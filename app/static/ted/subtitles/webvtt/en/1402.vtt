00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You should be nice

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to nerds.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In fact, I'd go so far as to say,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
if you don't already have a nerd in your life,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you should get one.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm just saying.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Scientists and engineers

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
change the world.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd like to tell you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about a magical place called DARPA

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
where scientists and engineers

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
defy the impossible

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and refuse to fear failure.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now these two ideas

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
are connected more than you may realize,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because when you remove the fear of failure,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
impossible things

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
suddenly become possible.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you want to know how,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
ask yourself this question:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What would you attempt to do

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
if you knew you could not fail?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If you really ask yourself

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
this question,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you can't help but feel uncomfortable.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I feel a little uncomfortable.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Because when you ask it,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you begin to understand

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
how the fear of failure constrains you,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
how it keeps us

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
from attempting great things,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and life gets dull,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
amazing things stop happening.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Sure, good things happen,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but amazing things

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
stop happening.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now I should be clear,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm not encouraging failure,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm discouraging

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
fear of failure.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Because it's not failure itself

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that constrains us.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The path to truly new,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
never-been-done-before things

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
always has failure along the way.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We're tested.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And in part, that testing feels an appropriate part

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of achieving something great.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Clemenceau said,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
"Life gets interesting when we fail,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because it's a sign

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that we've surpassed ourselves."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In 1895,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Lord Kelvin declared

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that heavier-than-air flying machines

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
were impossible.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
In October of 1903,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the prevailing opinion

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
of expert aerodynamicists

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
was that maybe in 10 million years

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we could build an aircraft that would fly.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And two months later on December 17th,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Orville Wright powered the first airplane

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
across a beach in North Carolina.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The flight lasted 12 seconds

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and covered 120 feet.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That was 1903.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
One year later,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the next declarations of impossibilities began.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Ferdinand Foch, a French army general

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
in the French army,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
said, "Airplanes are interesting toys,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but of no military value."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
40 years later,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
aero experts coined the term transonic.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
They debated, should it have one S or two?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and it wasn't at all clear

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
In 1947,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
there was no wind tunnel data

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
beyond Mach 0.85.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And yet,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
of his Bell X-1

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and he flew

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
towards an unknown possibility,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and in so doing,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
he became the first pilot

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to fly faster than the speed of sound.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Six of eight Atlas rockets

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
blew up on the pad.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
After 11 complete mission failures,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
we got our first images from space.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And on that first flight

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
we got more data

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
than in all U-2 missions combined.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It took a lot of failures

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
to get there.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Since we took to the sky,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
we have wanted to fly

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
faster and farther.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And to do so,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
we've had to believe in impossible things.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And we've had to refuse

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to fear failure.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
That's still true today.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Today, we don't talk about flying transonically,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
or even supersonically,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
we talk about flying hypersonically --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
not Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
At Mach 20,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
we can fly from New York to Long Beach

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in 11 minutes and 20 seconds.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
At that speed,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the surface of the airfoil

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is the temperature of molten steel --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
3,500 degrees Fahrenheit --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
like a blast furnace.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
We are essentially burning the airfoil

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
as we fly it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And we are flying it,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
or trying to.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
is the fastest maneuvering aircraft

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
ever built.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It's boosted to near-space

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
atop a Minotaur IV rocket.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
so we have to bleed it off

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
by flying the rocket

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
at an 89 degree angle of attack

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
for portions of the trajectory.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That's an unnatural act

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
for a rocket.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The third stage has a camera.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We call it rocketcam.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And it's pointed

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
at the hypersonic glider.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
This is the actual rocketcam footage

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
from flight one.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Now to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But this is what it looks like

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
from the third stage of the rocket

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
looking at the unmanned glider

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
as it heads into the atmosphere

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
back towards Earth.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We've flown twice.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
In the first flight,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
no aerodynamic control of the vehicle.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But we collected more hypersonic flight data

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
than in 30 years

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
of ground-based testing combined.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And in the second flight,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
three minutes of fully-controlled,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
aerodynamic flight

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
at Mach 20.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
We must fly again,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because amazing, never-been-done-before things

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
require that you fly.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
You can't learn to fly at Mach 20

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
unless you fly.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And while there's no substitute for speed,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
maneuverability is a very close second.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
to get from New York to Long Beach,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
a hummingbird would take,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
well, days.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
but they are maneuverable.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
In fact, the hummingbird is the only bird

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that can fly backwards.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It can fly up, down,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
forwards, backwards,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
even upside-down.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And so if we wanted to fly in this room

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
or places where humans can't go,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
we'd need an aircraft

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
small enough and maneuverable enough

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
to do so.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
This is a hummingbird drone.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It can fly in all directions,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
even backwards.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It can hover and rotate.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
This prototype aircraft

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
is equipped with a video camera.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It weighs less than one AA battery.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It does not eat nectar.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
In 2008,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
it flew for a whopping 20 seconds,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
a year later, two minutes,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
then six,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
eventually 11.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Many prototypes crashed -- many.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But there's no way

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
to learn to fly like a hummingbird

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
unless you fly.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
(Applause)

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
It's beautiful, isn't it.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Wow.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It's great.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
(Applause)

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Failure is part of creating

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
new and amazing things.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We cannot both fear failure

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and make amazing new things --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
like a robot

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
with the stability of a dog on rough terrain,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
or maybe even ice;

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
a robot that can run like a cheetah,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
or climb stairs like a human

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
with the occasional clumsiness of a human.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Or perhaps, Spider Man

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
will one day be Gecko Man.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
A gecko can support

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
its entire body weight

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
with one toe.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
One square millimeter of a gecko's footpad

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
has 14,000 hair-like structures

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
called setae.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
They are used to help it grip to surfaces

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
using intermolecular forces.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Today we can manufacture structures

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The result,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
a four-by-four-inch

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
artificial nano-gecko adhesive.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
can support a static load

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
of 660 pounds.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
That's enough to stick

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
six 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
no nails.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So much for Velcro, right?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And it's not just passive structures,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
it's entire machines.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
This is a spider mite.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It's one millimeter long,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
but it looks like Godzilla

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
next to these micromachines.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
In the world of Godzilla spider mites,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
we can make millions of mirrors,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
each one-fifth the diameter

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
of a human hair,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
to make large screen displays,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
so that we can watch movies like "Godzilla"

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
in high-def.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And if we can build machines

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
at that scale,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
what about Eiffel Tower-like trusses

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
at the microscale?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Today we are making metals

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that are lighter than Styrofoam,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
so light

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
they can sit atop a dandelion puff

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and be blown away

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
with a wisp of air --

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
so light

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that you can make a car that two people can lift,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
but so strong

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
that it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
From the smallest wisp of air

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
to the powerful forces of nature's storms.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
There are 44 lightning strikes per second

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
around the globe.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Each lightning bolt heats the air

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
hotter than the surface of the Sun.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
What if we could use

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
these electromagnetic pulses

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
as beacons,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
beacons in a moving network

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
of powerful transmitters?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Experiments suggest

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
that lightning could be the next GPS.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Using a grid the size of your thumb,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
with 32 electrodes

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
on the surface of his brain,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Tim uses his thoughts

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
to control an advanced prosthetic arm.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And his thoughts

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
made him reach for Katie.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
This is the first time

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
a human has controlled a robot

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
with thought alone.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And it is the first time

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that Tim has held Katie's hand

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
in seven years.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
That moment mattered

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
to Tim and Katie,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and this green goo

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
may someday matter to you.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
This green goo

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It was made in tobacco plants.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Tobacco plants

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
can make millions of doses of vaccine

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
in weeks instead of months,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and it might just be

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
the first healthy use of tobacco ever.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And if it seems far-fetched

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that tobacco plants could make people healthy,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
what about gamers that could solve problems

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that experts can't solve?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Last September,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
the gamers of Foldit

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
solved the three-dimensional structure

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
of the retroviral protease

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Now understanding this structure

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
is very important for developing treatments.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
For 15 years,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
it was unsolved

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in the scientific community.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
The gamers of Foldit

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
solved it in 15 days.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Now they were able to do so

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
by working together.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
They were able to work together

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
because they're connected by the Internet.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And others, also connected to the Internet,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
used it as an instrument of democracy.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And together

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
they changed the fate of their nation.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
The Internet is home to two billion people,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
or 30 percent of the world's population.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It allows us to contribute

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and to be heard

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
as individuals.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
It allows us to amplify

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
our voices and our power

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
as a group.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
But it too had humble beginnings.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
In 1969, the internet was but a dream,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
a few sketches on a piece of paper.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And then on October 29th,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
the first packet-switched message was sent

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
from UCLA to SRI.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The first two letters of the word "Login,"

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that's all that made it through --

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
an L and an O --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and then a buffer overflow crashed the system.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Laughter)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Two letters,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
an L and an O,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
now a worldwide force.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So who are these scientists and engineers

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
at a magical place called DARPA?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
They are nerds,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and they are heroes among us.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
They challenge existing perspectives

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
at the edges of science

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and under the most demanding of conditions.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
They remind us

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
that we can change the world

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
if we defy the impossible

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and we refuse to fear failure.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
They remind us

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
that we all have nerd power.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Sometimes we just forget.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
You see, there was a time

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
when you weren't afraid of failure,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
when you were a great artist or a great dancer

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and you could sing, you were good at math,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
you could build things, you were an astronaut,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
an adventurer, Jacques Cousteau,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
you could jump higher, run faster,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
kick harder than anyone.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
You believed in impossible things

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and you were fearless.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
You were totally and completely in touch

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
with your inner superhero.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Scientists and engineers

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
can indeed change the world.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
So can you.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
You were born to.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So go ahead,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
ask yourself,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
what would you attempt to do

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
if you knew you could not fail?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Now I want to say,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
this is not easy.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
It's hard to hold onto this feeling,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
really hard.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I guess in some way,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Doubt and fear always creep in.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
We think someone else, someone smarter than us,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
someone more capable,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
someone with more resources will solve that problem.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
But there isn't anyone else;

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
there's just you.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And if we're lucky,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
in that moment,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
someone steps into that doubt and fear,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
takes a hand and says,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
"Let me help you believe."

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Jason Harley did that for me.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Jason started at DARPA

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
on March 18th, 2010.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
He was with our transportation team.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I saw Jason nearly every day,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
sometimes twice a day.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And more so than most,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
he saw the highs and the lows,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
the celebrations and the disappointments.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And on one particularly dark day for me,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Jason sat down

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and he wrote an email.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
He was encouraging,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
but firm.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And when he hit send,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
It mattered to me.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
In that moment

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and still today

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
when I doubt,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
when I feel afraid,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
when I need to reconnect

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
with that feeling,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I remember his words,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
they were so powerful.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
and back to the skies for you."

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And remember,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
be nice to nerds.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:37.000
(Applause)

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
(Applause)

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Chris Anderson: Regina, thank you.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I have a couple of questions.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So that glider of yours,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
the Mach 20 glider,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
the first one, no control, it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
RD: Yeah, yeah. It did. (CA: What happened on that second flight?)

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Yeah, it also went into the Pacific. (CA: But this time under control?)

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
We didn't fly it into the Pacific.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
No, there are multiple portions of the trajectory

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
that are demanding

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
in terms of really flying at that speed.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And so in the second flight,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
we were able to get three minutes

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
CA: I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
from New York to Long Beach anytime soon.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
RD: It might be a little warm.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
CA: What do you picture that glider being used for?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
RD: Well our responsibility

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
is to develop the technology for this.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
How it's ultimately used

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
will be determined by the military.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Now the purpose of the vehicle though,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
the purpose of the technology,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
is to be able to reach anywhere in the world

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
in less than 60 minutes.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
CA: And to carry a payload

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
of more than a few pounds? (RD: Yeah.)

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Like what's the payload it could carry?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
RD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
We've got to fly it first.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
CA: But not necessarily just a camera?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
RD: No, not necessarily just a camera.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
CA: It's amazing.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
The hummingbird?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
RD: Yeah?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
CA: I'm curious, you started your beautiful sequence on flight

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
and failing horribly,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
and there haven't been that many planes built since

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
that flap wings.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and copy a hummingbird?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Isn't that a very expensive solution

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
for a small maneuverable flying object?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
RD: So I mean, in part,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
we wondered if it was possible to do it.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And you have to revisit these questions

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
over time.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
The folks at AeroVironment

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
tried 300 or more different wing designs,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
12 different forms of the avionics.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
It took them 10 full prototypes

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
to get something that would actually fly.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
But there's something really interesting

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
about a flying machine

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
that looks like something you'd recognize.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
So we often talk about stealth

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
as a means for avoiding any type of sensing,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
but when things looks just natural,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
you also don't see them.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
CA: Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
It's partly the look. (RD: Sure.)

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
It's actually, "Look at that cute hummingbird

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
flying into my headquarters."

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
(Laughter)

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Because I think, as well as the awe of looking at that,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I'm sure some people here are thinking,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
technology catches up so quick,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
how long is it

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
before some crazed geek with a little remote control

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
flies one through a window of the White House?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
RD: Well look, our singular mission

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
That's what we do.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
It would be inconceivable

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
for us to do that work

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
at the same time.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
It's just the nature of what we do.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Now our responsibility

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
is to push that edge.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
And we have to be, of course, mindful and responsible

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
of how the technology is developed

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
and ultimately used,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
but we can't simply close our eyes

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
and pretend that it isn't advancing; it's advancing.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
CA: I mean, you're clearly a really inspiring leader.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
And you persuade people

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
to go to these great feats of invention,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
but at a personal level,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
in a way I can't imagine doing your job.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Do you wake up in the night sometimes,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
just asking questions

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
about the possibly unintended consequences

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
of your team's brilliance?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
RD: Sure.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
I think you couldn't be human

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
if you didn't ask those questions.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
CA: How do you answer them?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
RD: Well I don't always have answers for them, right.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
I think that we learn

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
as time goes on.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
My job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I work with some of the most amazing people.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
And with that exhilaration,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
comes a really deep sense

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
of responsibility.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And so you have on the one hand

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
this tremendous lift

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
of what's possible

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
and this tremendous seriousness

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
of what it means.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
CA: Regina, that was jaw-dropping, as they say.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Thank you so much for coming to TED. (RD: Thank you.)

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
(Applause)
