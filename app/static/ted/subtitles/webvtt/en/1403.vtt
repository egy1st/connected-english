00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Many times

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I go around the world to speak,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and people ask me questions

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
about the challenges,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
my moments,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
some of my regrets.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
1998:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A single mother of four,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
three months after the birth of my fourth child,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I went to do a job

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as a research assistant.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I went to Northern Liberia.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And as part of the work,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the village would give you lodgings.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And they gave me lodging with a single mother

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and her daughter.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This girl happened to be

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the only girl in the entire village

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
who had made it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to the ninth grade.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
She was the laughing stock of the community.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Her mother was often told by other women,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
"You and your child

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
will die poor."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
After two weeks of working in that village,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it was time to go back.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The mother came to me, knelt down,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and said, "Leymah, take my daughter.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I wish for her

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to be a nurse."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Dirt poor, living in the home with my parents,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I couldn't afford to.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
With tears in my eyes,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I said, "No."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Two months later,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I go to another village

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
on the same assignment

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and they asked me to live with the village chief.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The women's chief of the village has this little girl,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
fair color like me,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
totally dirty.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And all day she walked around

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
only in her underwear.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
When I asked, "Who is that?"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
She said, "That's Wei.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The meaning of her name is pig.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Her mother died while giving birth to her,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and no one had any idea who her father was."

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
For two weeks, she became my companion,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
slept with me.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I bought her used clothes

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and bought her her first doll.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The night before I left,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
she came to the room

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and said, "Leymah, don't leave me here.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I wish to go with you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I wish to go to school."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Dirt poor, no money,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
living with my parents,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I again said, "No."

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Two months later,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
both of those villages fell into another war.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Till today, I have no idea

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
where those two girls are.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Fast-forward, 2004:

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In the peak of our activism,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the minister of Gender Liberia called me

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I want you to bring her home

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
because we don't have safe homes."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The story of this little girl:

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
She had been raped

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
by her paternal grandfather

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
every day for six months.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
She came to me bloated,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
very pale.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
She'd lie beside me

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I wish to go to school."

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
2010:

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
A young woman stands before President Sirleaf

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and gives her testimony

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of how she and her siblings live together,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
their father and mother died during the war.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
She's 19; her dream is to go to college

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to be able to support them.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
She's highly athletic.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
One of the things that happens

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
is that she applies for a scholarship.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Full scholarship. She gets it.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Her dream of going to school,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
her wish of being educated,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is finally here.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
She goes to school on the first day.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The director of sports

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
who's responsible for getting her into the program

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
asks her to come out of class.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And for the next three years,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
her fate will be

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
having sex with him every day,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
as a favor for getting her in school.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Globally, we have policies,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
international instruments,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
work leaders.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Great people have made commitments --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
we will protect our children

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
from want and from fear.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Countries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Other countries come with different things.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
There is a Millennium Development called Three

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that focuses on girls.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
All of these great works by great people

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
aimed at getting young people

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to where we want to get them globally,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I think, has failed.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
In Liberia, for example,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the teenage pregnancy rate

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is three to every 10 girls.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Teen prostitution is at its peak.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
In one community, we're told,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
you wake up in the morning

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Girls as young as 12 being prostituted

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
for less than a dollar a night.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It's disheartening, it's sad.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And then someone asked me,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
just before my TEDTalk, a few days ago,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
"So where is the hope?"

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Several years ago, a few friends of mine

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
decided we needed to bridge the disconnect

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
between our generation

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and the generation of young women.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It's not enough to say

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
when your girls' kids are totally out there

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and no hope, or seemingly no hope.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
We created a space

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
called the Young Girls Transformative Project.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We go into rural communities

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and all we do, like has been done in this room,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
is create the space.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
When these girls sit,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
you unlock intelligence,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you unlock passion,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
you unlock commitment,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
you unlock focus,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
you unlock great leaders.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Today, we've worked with over 300.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And some of those girls

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
who walked in the room very shy

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
have taken bold steps, as young mothers,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to go out there and advocate

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
for the rights of other young women.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
One young woman I met,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
teen mother of four,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
never thought about finishing high school,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
graduated successfully;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
never thought about going to college,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
enrolled in college.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
One day she said to me,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
"My wish is to finish college

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and be able to support my children."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
She's at a place where she can't find money

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to go to school.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
She sells water, sells soft drinks

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and sells recharge cards for cellphones.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And you would think she would take that money

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and put it back into her education.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Juanita is her name.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
She takes that money

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and finds single mothers in her community

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
to send back to school.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Says, "Leymah, my wish

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
is to be educated.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And if I can't be educated,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
when I see some of my sisters being educated,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
my wish has been fulfilled.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I wish for a better life.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I wish for food for my children.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
This is the dream of the African girl.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Several years ago,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
there was one African girl.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
This girl had a son

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
who wished for a piece of doughnut

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
because he was extremely hungry.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Angry, frustrated,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
really upset

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
about the state of her society

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and the state of her children,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
this young girl started a movement,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
a movement of ordinary women

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
banding together

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
to build peace.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I will fulfill the wish.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
This is another African girl's wish.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I failed to do this.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman --

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I failed, I failed, I failed.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So I will do this.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Women came out,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
protested a brutal dictator,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
fearlessly spoke.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the wish of peace came true.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This young woman

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
wished also to go to school.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
She went to school.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This young woman wished for other things to happen,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
it happened for her.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Today, this young woman is me,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
a Nobel laureate.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I'm now on a journey

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
to fulfill the wish,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
in my tiny capacity,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
of little African girls --

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the wish of being educated.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We set up a foundation.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
We're giving full four-year scholarships

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to girls from villages that we see with potential.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I don't have much to ask of you.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I've also been to places in this U.S.,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and I know that girls in this country

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
also have wishes,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
a wish for a better life

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
somewhere in downtown L.A.,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
a wish for a better life somewhere in New York,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
a wish for a better life

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
somewhere in New Jersey.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Will you journey with me

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
to help that girl,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
be it an African girl or an American girl

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
or a Japanese girl,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
fulfill her wish,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
fulfill her dream,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
achieve that dream?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Because all of these

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
great innovators and inventors

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that we've talked to and seen

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
over the last few days

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
are also sitting in tiny corners

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
in different parts of the world,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and all they're asking us to do

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
is create that space

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
to unlock the intelligence,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
unlock the passion,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
unlock all of the great things

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that they hold within themselves.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Let's journey together. Let's journey together.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Thank you.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:57.000
(Applause)

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Right now in Liberia,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
what do you see

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
as the main issue that troubles you?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
LG: I've been asked to lead

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
As part of my work,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I'm doing these tours

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
in different villages and towns --

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
13, 15 hours on dirt roads --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and there is no community that I've gone into

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that I haven't seen intelligent girls.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
But sadly,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
the vision of a great future,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
or the dream of a great future,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
is just a dream,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
because you have all of these vices.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Teen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So what troubles me

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
is that I was at that place

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and somehow I'm at this place,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and I just don't want to be the only one

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
at this place.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I'm looking for ways

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
for other girls to be with me.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I want to look back 20 years from now

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and see that there's another Liberian girl,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Ghanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
standing on this TED stage.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And maybe, just maybe, saying,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
"Because of that Nobel laureate

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I'm here today."

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So I'm troubled

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
when I see them like there's no hope.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
But I'm also not pessimistic,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
because I know it doesn't take a lot

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
to get them charged up.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
CA: And in the last year,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
tell us one hopeful thing

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
that you've seen happening.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
But in the last year,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
where President Sirleaf comes from, her village,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
we went there to work with these girls.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And we could not find 25 girls

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in high school.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
All of these girls went to the gold mine,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and they were predominantly prostitutes

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
doing other things.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
We took 50 of those girls

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and we worked with them.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And this was at the beginning of elections.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
This is one place where women were never --

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
even the older ones

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
barely sat in the circle with the men.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
These girls banded together and formed a group

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and launched a campaign

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
for voter registration.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
This is a real rural village.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And the theme they used was:

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
"Even pretty girls vote."

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
They were able to mobilize young women.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But not only did they do that,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
they went to those who were running for seats

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to ask them, "What is it

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that you will give the girls of this community

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
when you win?"

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And one of the guys

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
who already had a seat was very --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and he was one of those really fighting in parliament

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
to overturn that law

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because he called it barbaric.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Rape is not barbaric, but the law, he said, was barbaric.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And when the girls started engaging him,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
he was very hostile towards them.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
These little girls turned to him and said,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
"We will vote you out of office."

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
He's out of office today.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
(Applause)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
CA: Leymah, thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
LG: You're welcome. (CA: Thank you.)

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
(Applause)
