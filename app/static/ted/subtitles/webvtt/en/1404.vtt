00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This may sound strange,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with a very simple idea:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
modules made of cement of a fixed measurement

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that fit together.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Very quickly concrete blocks became

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the most-used construction unit in the world.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
buildings, bridges,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
one brick at a time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Essentially concrete blocks had become

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the building block of our time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Almost a hundred years later in 1947,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
LEGO came up with this.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And in a few short years,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
LEGO bricks took place in every household.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You don't have to be an engineer

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
LEGO made it accessible.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and made it into the building block

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of our imagination.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Meanwhile the exact same year,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the next building block.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The transistor was a small plastic unit

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that would take us from a world

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
of static bricks piled on top of each other

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to a world where everything was interactive.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Like the concrete block,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the transistor allows you to build

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But there's a main difference:

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The transistor was only for experts.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I personally don't accept this,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that the building block of our time

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is reserved for experts,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so I decided to change that.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I started exploring this idea

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of how to put the power of engineers

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in the hands of artists and designers.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Let me show you how they work.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
LittleBits are electronic modules

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
with each one specific function.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They're pre-engineered

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to be light, sound,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
motors and sensors.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And the best part about it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
is they snap together with magnets.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So you can't put them the wrong way.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The bricks are color-coded.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Green is output, blue is power,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
pink is input and orange is wire.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You put a blue to a green,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
you can make light.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You can put a knob in between

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and now you've made a little dimmer.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Switch out the knob

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
for a pulse module,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
which is here,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and now you've made a little blinker.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Add this buzzer

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
for some extra punch

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and you've created a noise machine.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm going to stop that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So beyond simple play,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
littleBits are actually pretty powerful.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
littleBits allow you to program

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
using very simple intuitive gestures.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So to make this blink faster or slower,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
you would just turn this knob

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and basically make it pulse faster or slower.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The idea behind littleBits

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
is that it's a growing library.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We want to make every single interaction in the world

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
into a ready-to-use brick.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
everything should be accessible.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And it's been an incredible experience.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The nicest thing is how they start to understand

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the electronics around them from everyday

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that they don't learn at schools.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
For example, how a nightlight works,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
or why an elevator door stays open,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
or how an iPod responds to touch.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So for example, we've had designers

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
with no experience with electronics whatsoever

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
start to play with littleBits as a material.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
we have Geordie making ...

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
(Clanging)

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Buzzing)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and gave them to some designers

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
with no experience in engineering whatsoever --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Here's an example of a project they made,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
a motion-activated confetti canon ball.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
(Laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's a lobster made of playdough

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that's afraid of the dark.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
(Laughter)

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
electronics became just another material.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So littleBits is open-source.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We want to encourage a world

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of creators, of inventors, of contributors,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
because this world that we live in,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
this interactive world, is ours.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So go ahead and start inventing.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Thank you.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
(Applause)
