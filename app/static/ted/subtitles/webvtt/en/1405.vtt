00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is something in the way of an experiment.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Today's its debut.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They are live

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and reacting to me in real time.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So fingers crossed.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And keep your eyes on the big screen.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Augmented reality

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is the melding of the real world

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with computer-generated imagery.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It seems the perfect medium

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to investigate magic

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and ask, why, in a technological age,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we continue to have

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
this magical sense of wonder.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Magic is deception,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but it is a deception we enjoy.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
To enjoy being deceived,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
an audience must first

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
suspend its disbelief.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
who first suggested this receptive state of mind.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to produce for these shadows of the imagination

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
a willing suspension of disbelief

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that, for a moment,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
constitutes poetic faith.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
for any kind of theatrical experience.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Without it,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
a script is just words.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Augmented reality

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is just the latest technology.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And sleight of hand

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is just an artful demonstration

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of dexterity.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We do it every day,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
while reading novels,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
watching television

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
or going to the movies.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We willingly enter fictional worlds

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
where we cheer our heroes

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and cry for friends we never had.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Without this ability

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
there is no magic.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It was Jean Robert-Houdin,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
France's greatest illusionist,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
who first recognized the role of the magician

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
as a storyteller.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
MT: Which means magic is theater

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and every trick

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is a story.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The tricks of magic

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
There are tales of creation and loss,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
death and resurrection,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and obstacles that must be overcome.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Magicians play with fire and steel,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
defy the fury of the buzzsaw,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
dare to catch a bullet

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
or attempt a deadly escape.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But audiences don't come to see the magician die,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
they come to see him live.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Because the best stories

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
always have a happy ending.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The tricks of magic have one special element.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
They are stories with a twist.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Now Edward de Bono argued

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that our brains are pattern matching machines.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
He said that magicians deliberately exploit

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the way their audiences think.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
on the momentum error.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that are perfectly reasonable,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but do not, in fact, match

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
what is being done in front of them.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
MT: In that respect,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
magic tricks are like jokes.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Jokes lead us down a path

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to an expected destination.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
into something entirely unexpected,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
we laugh.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The same thing happens

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
when people watch magic tricks.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The finale

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
defies logic,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
gives new insight into the problem,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and audiences express their amazement

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
with laughter.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's fun to be fooled.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
One of the key qualities of all stories

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
is that they're made to be shared.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We feel compelled to tell them.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
When I do a trick at a party --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
(Laughter)

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that person will immediately pull their friend over

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and ask me to do it again.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They want to share the experience.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
That makes my job more difficult,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
because, if I want to surprise them,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I need to tell a story that starts the same,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
but ends differently --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
a trick with a twist

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
on a twist.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
It keeps me busy.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Now experts believe

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
We think in narrative structures.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We connect events and emotions

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and instinctively transform them

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
into a sequence that can be easily understood.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It's a uniquely human achievement.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We all want to share our stories,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
whether it is the trick we saw at the party,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the bad day at the office

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Today, thanks to technology,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
we can share those stories as never before,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
by email, Facebook,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
blogs, tweets,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
on TED.com.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The tools of social networking,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
these are the digital campfires

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
around which the audience gathers

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to hear our story.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We turn facts into similes and metaphors,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and even fantasies.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We polish the rough edges of our lives

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
so that they feel whole.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Our stories make us the people we are

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and, sometimes, the people we want to be.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
They give us our identity

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and a sense of community.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And if the story is a good one,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
it might even make us smile.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Thank you.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
(Applause)

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Thank you.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
(Applause)
