00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:04.364
So, without romanticizing this too much:

00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:08.024
imagine that you light your home
with kerosene and candles every night,

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:09.741
and that you do all of your cooking

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:10.926
with charcoal.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.812
This is how the world's
two billion poorest people

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:15.897
cook and light their homes every day.

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:17.905
This isn't just inconvenient,

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.583
this is inefficient,

00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:20.867
it's expensive,

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.581
it's harmful to human health,
harmful to the environment,

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:24.782
and it's unproductive.

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:26.135
And that's energy poverty.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.065
So let me give you a couple of examples.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.406
I work in Haiti,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.713
where about 80% of the population
lives in energy poverty.

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:37.543
The average household
spends 10% of its income

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.405
on kerosene for lighting –

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.622
that's an order of magnitude greater
than what the average US household spends

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:47.208
on electricity to light their homes.

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:49.456
The 2008 hurricane season in Haiti caused

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.675
about one billion dollars in damage.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.057
That was a sixth of their GDP.

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.393
The damage was so severe

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:58.926
because the primary energy fuel
in Haiti is charcoal,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.318
which is made from trees,

00:01:00.342 --> 00:01:03.092
and has left the country
almost completely deforested.

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:07.849
Without trees, the country can't absorb
heavy rains and massive flooding,

00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:09.210
as a result.

00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:10.800
So in the industrialized world,

00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:14.729
we built walls that protect us
from the externalities of our energy use;

00:01:14.753 --> 00:01:18.466
we can afford to clean up acute
environmental disasters;

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.782
and we can also afford
to adapt to chronic conditions

00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:23.406
like climate change.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.095
That's not the case for Haiti.
They can't afford this.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.295
The only way they're going to lift
themselves out of energy poverty

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.004
is by adapting fuels
that are more efficient,

00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:33.528
that are less expensive,

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:36.538
that are better for human health,
better for the environment

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.021
and that are more productive.

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:40.731
So it turns out that those fuels
and technologies exist,

00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:42.334
and this is an example of that.

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:45.161
This is a solar LED lightbulb

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:50.142
that we sell for a retail price
of about 10 dollars in rural Haiti.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:53.123
That's a payback period
of less than three months

00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:54.933
for the average Haitian household.

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:01.305
The prescriptions to solve energy poverty
seems pretty straightforward:

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.714
you develop these technologies
that have a great return on investment,

00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:06.651
and people should be snatching them up.

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:08.032
But that's not the case.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:11.254
The first time I ever went down to Haiti
was in August of 2008,

00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:12.491
sort of on a whim,

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:15.397
and I was fielding surveys
in the rural south of the country

00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:17.824
to assess the extent of energy poverty.

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:20.186
And at night, I would go around sometimes

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.397
and I would speak with the street vendors

00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.683
and see if they were interested
in buying these solar LED lamps.

00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:28.551
One woman who I encountered
turned down my offer,

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:31.066
and she said, “Mon chéri,
c'est trop Cher,”

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.778
which basically means,
“My dear, it's too expensive.”

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:35.267
But I tried to explain to her,

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:37.561
“Look, this is going to save you
a lot of money,

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:39.656
and it's going to give
you even better light

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.020
than what you're using
now with the kerosene.”

00:02:42.044 --> 00:02:43.386
So I didn't make the sale,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.877
but I did learn a really important lesson,

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.909
which is that technology, products,

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:50.490
were not going to end energy poverty.

00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:52.698
Instead, access was going to.

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:55.239
Specifically, there are
two types of access

00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:57.267
that are going to end energy poverty:

00:02:57.291 --> 00:03:00.551
there's physical access,
and there's financial access.

00:03:00.907 --> 00:03:02.296
So, physical access --

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.382
what does that mean?

00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:08.641
It's very expensive for low-income
households in developing countries

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.471
to reach major centers of commerce.

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:14.423
And it's basically impossible for them
to order something off Amazon.com.

00:03:14.447 --> 00:03:17.213
“The last mile” is a phrase
that's normally associated

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:19.062
with the telecommunications industry.

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:21.326
It means that last bit
of wire that's necessary

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.544
to connect the customer to the provider.

00:03:23.568 --> 00:03:29.199
What we need for ending energy poverty
are last-mile retailers

00:03:29.223 --> 00:03:32.231
that bring these clean energy
products to the people.

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:35.391
The kerosene and charcoal value chains
already figured this out:

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.885
those fuels are ubiquitous
across the entire country.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.354
You can go to the most remote
village in Haiti

00:03:41.378 --> 00:03:44.763
and you will find somebody
selling kerosene and charcoal.

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:47.226
So the other type of access: financial.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.112
We all know that clean energy
products, technologies,

00:03:51.136 --> 00:03:53.695
tend to be characterized
by higher upfront costs,

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.327
but very low operating costs.

00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.151
And so in the industrialized world,

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:00.197
we have very generous subsidies
that are specifically designed

00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.789
to bring down those upfront costs.

00:04:02.813 --> 00:04:04.888
Those subsidies don't exist in Haiti.

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.396
What they do have is microfinance.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.244
But you're going to severely diminish
the value proposition

00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:11.678
of your clean energy product

00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:15.127
if you expect somebody in Haiti
to go out, get a microloan,

00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:16.556
go back to the retailer,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.759
and then buy the clean energy product.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.388
So the prescription to end energy poverty
is much more complicated

00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:25.422
than simply products.

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:28.169
We need to integrate financial access

00:04:28.193 --> 00:04:31.998
directly into new, innovative
distribution models.

00:04:32.323 --> 00:04:33.488
What does that mean?

00:04:33.512 --> 00:04:36.720
That means bundling consumer credit
with the retailer.

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:39.494
This is really easy
for Bloomingdale’s to do,

00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:43.484
but it's not so easy for a rural
sales agent in Haiti to do.

00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:46.187
We need to redirect cash flows

00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:49.195
that are going now
from the diaspora in the United States

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.485
through Western Union
wire transfers in cash

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.363
directly into clean energy products

00:04:54.387 --> 00:04:58.223
that can be delivered to or picked up by
their friends or family in Haiti.

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:01.333
So the next time you hear
about a technology or product

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:03.017
that's going to change the world,

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.438
be a little bit skeptical.

00:05:04.462 --> 00:05:08.117
The inventor Dean Kamen,
the guy who invented the Segway,

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.898
a genius by any standards,

00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:15.175
once said that his job is easy,
inventing things is easy,

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.270
the hard part is the technology
dissemination --

00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:20.421
it's getting those
technologies and products

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.008
to the people who need it most.

00:05:22.032 --> 00:05:23.207
Thank you.

00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:26.583
(Applause)
