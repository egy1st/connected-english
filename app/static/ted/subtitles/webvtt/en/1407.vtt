WEBVTT

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.656
Thank y'all!

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.896
This is going to be a motivational speech.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.120
Because --

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.680
imagine my motivation standing
between this strong, healthy crowd ...

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.976
and lunch.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.536
(Laughter)

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.760
So ...

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.776
I'm @Falkvinge on Twitter.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.256
Feel free to quote me if I say something
memorable, stupid, funny, whatever.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.016
I love seeing my name on Twitter.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.256
So ...

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.720
Hi! I'm Rick.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.720
I'm a politician.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.640
I'm sorry.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.616
How many in here have heard
of the Swedish Pirate Party before?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.920
Let's see a show of hands.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.856
OK, that's practically everybody.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.496
Probably due to the fact
that we are Sweden's neighbor.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.096
I frequently ask how many have heard
of any other political party

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.736
and there's always
just scattered hands in the audience

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.216
compared to this first question
which is one-half to two-thirds.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.936
This is actually the first time ever
that does not match.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.360
It was practically everybody.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.896
So, for those who haven't heard of us:

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280
well, the Pirate Party, we love the net.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.360
We love copying and sharing,
and we love civil liberties.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.960
For that, some people call us pirates.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.896
Probably in an attempt to make us
bow our heads and feel shame.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.256
That didn't work very well.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.536
We decided to stand tall about it instead.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.256
And so in 2006,
I founded a new political party.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.536
I led it for its first five years.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.936
And the European elections,
the last European elections,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.376
we became the largest party

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.840
and the most coveted
youth demographic, sub-30.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.936
And what's interesting is we did that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.400
on less than one percent
of the competition's budget.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.520
We had a campaign budget
total of 50,000 euros.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.800
They had six million between them --
and we beat them.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.280
That gave us a cost efficiency advantage
of over two orders of magnitude.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.600
And I'm gonna share
the secret recipe of how we did that.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.240
We developed swarm methodologies.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.400
And they can be applied
to any business or social cause.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.096
Well, almost any --

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.856
there's a small asterisk by the end,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.016
and I'll get to that in just a minute.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.736
But applying these --

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.696
and we've done this dozens of times,
we know that this works.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.416
We've put two people
in the European Parliament,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.336
we have 45 people
in various German state parliaments,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.896
we're in the Icelandic parliament,
the Czech senate,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.896
many, many, many more, local councils --

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.576
and, as said, we've spread
to 70 countries.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.656
And that's not bad
for a political movement

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.720
that hasn't even been around for a decade.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.640
So today we're going
to talk a bit about --

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.400
how people are motivated
to be part of change,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.600
to be part of something
bigger than themselves.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.856
And how you can channel this
into an organization

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.640
that harnesses this great power of wanting
to make the world a better place.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.880
And in the end,
come out a little on the better.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.576
When I speak to businesspeople,
I frequently make them very upset

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.456
when I contradict them

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.640
and say that no, your employees
are not your most valuable asset.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.096
Your most valuable asset
is the thousands of people

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.736
who want to work for you for free.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.160
And you don't let them.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.520
They get very upset about that.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.816
A swarm is a congregation
of tens of thousands of volunteers

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.840
that have chosen of their own will
to converge on a common goal.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.960
There's this "Futurama" quote:

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.880
"When push comes to shove,
you gotta do what you love --

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.616
even if it's not a good idea."

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.456
(Laughter)

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.696
I mean, seriously,
what kind of idiot thinks

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.880
they can change the world
by starting a political party?

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.016
(Laughter)

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.816
This kind of idiot, apparently.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.040
But it works!

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.296
What you need to do
is to put a stake in the ground.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.456
You need to announce your goal.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.440
Just say, "I want to accomplish this."

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.880
I'm going to do this.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.240
And it doesn't need to be very costly.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.880
My announcement was
just two lines in a chat channel.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.416
"Hey, look, the Pirate Party
has its website up now after New Year's."

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.656
And the address.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.616
That was all the advertising I ever did.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.440
The next time I had several hundred
activists wanting to work with us.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.336
When you provide such a focus point,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.296
a swarm intelligence emerges.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.360
When people can rally to a flag.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.680
And that's what gives you this two orders
of magnitude of cost efficiency.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.136
It's a huge advantage --

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.080
you're running circles
around all the legacy organizations.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.456
And there are four goals
that need to be fulfilled in your goal

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.920
in order for this to work.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.776
These four criteria
are that your goal must be:

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.800
tangible, credible, inclusive and epic.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.600
Let's take a look at them:
It needs to be tangible.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.416
A lot of people say,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.176
"Well, you know, we should make
the world a better place,"

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.560
or, "Yeah, we should all feel good now."

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.560
Not going to work.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.000
You need a binary.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.336
Are we there yet, or are we not there yet?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.616
It needs to be credible.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.896
Somebody seeing the project plan
that you're posting needs to see

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.016
that, yes, this project plan will take us

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.216
from where we are to where we want to be.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.536
You need to break it down into subgoals

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.456
that each by themselves
are seen as doable,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.896
and when you add the subgoals together,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.416
we've gone to where we want.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.656
It needs to be --

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.096
and this is where it gets exciting
in terms of working swarmwise --

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.976
it needs to be inclusive.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.656
Anybody who sees this project plan
needs to immediately say,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.000
"I want to do this --
and there's my spot!"

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.856
And they will be able
to jump right into the project

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.256
and start working on it
without asking anybody's permission.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.360
And that is exactly what'll happen.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.200
And, last but not least,
it needs to be epic.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.736
It needs to energize people.
It needs to electrify people.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.160
Shoot for the moon!

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.936
On second thought,
don't shoot for the moon,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.536
we've already been there --
shoot for Mars!

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.240
(Laughter)

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.096
In contrast,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.136
you will never be able
to get a volunteer swarm forming

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.840
around making the most
correct tax audit ever.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.000
Doesn't electrify people. Go to Mars.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.576
A lot of people
kind of balk at the obstacles.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.056
We're going to climb a huge mountain.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.296
So how do you motivate people to do that?

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.280
Well, it turns out
that obstacles are not the problem.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.936
Not knowing the obstacles is the problem.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.776
If you know how high the mountain is,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.336
you know exactly
what it takes to scale it.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.000
We know exactly how far away Mars is
and what it takes to get there.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.640
If you can plan it like a project,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.736
you can plan what resources you need

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.616
and you can execute it,
exactly like a project.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.176
Let's see: we're going to Mars,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.336
we need two dozen
volunteer rocket scientists,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.296
one dozen volunteer metallurgists,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.856
some crazy dude who will mix
rocket fuel in his backyard

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.080
and so on.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.856
When you can list the resources,
you know what you need to get there.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.800
When you know what you need
to get there, you can go there.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.840
And the next thing is to encourage
this development of a swarm intelligence,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.960
which is where
the cost efficiency comes in.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:40.440
There's a TED Talk on motivation
that debunks that we work for money,

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:47.616
and it presents science on how
we're really motivated by three things,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.296
in terms of larger creative tasks,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.296
when we work for something
bigger than ourselves.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.320
We work for autonomy, mastery and purpose.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.136
We've covered purpose already.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.240
As in, working for something bigger,
tangible, credible, inclusive and epic.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.456
So, where that motivation talk ends,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.896
what it doesn't answer is,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.800
how do you build an organization
that harnesses this motivational power.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.176
And this is where
working swarmwise comes in,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.656
this is where swarm intelligence comes in.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.640
Turns out that there are three factors
that you optimize for --

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.680
and each of these are in complete opposite
to what you learn at a business school.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.800
But it works.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.816
We know it works.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.720
We have people in many, many
parliaments to prove it.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.680
Those three factors are:
speed, trust and scalability.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.656
We optimize for speed
by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.536
cutting them out of the decision loop.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.040
That means cutting yourself
out of the decision loop,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.656
which can be hard.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.976
But you've got to communicate your vision
so passionately, so strongly,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.376
that everybody knows what the goal is

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.176
and can find something, some step

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.840
that takes the movement
just a little closer to that goal.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.160
And when tens of thousands of people
do that on a weekly basis,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.200
you become an unstoppable force.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.776
We had a three-person rule
in our organization,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.176
saying that if three self-identified
volunteers in the movement

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.016
were in agreement that something
was good for the movement,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.296
they had the green light
from the highest office

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.776
to go ahead and act
in the name of the organization,

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.200
including spending resources.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.456
When you talk about
this kind of empowerment

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.336
to traditional businesspeople,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.880
they think you belong in a zoo.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.176
But you know what?

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.376
I led this organization for five years,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.616
there were 50,000 registered members

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.920
and many, many more anonymous activists.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.720
It was not abused once.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.456
Everybody had the key
to the treasure chest.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.576
It was not abused one single time.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.496
Turns out when you give people
the keys to the castle,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.000
and look them in the eye
and say, "I trust you,"

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.080
they step up to the plate.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.320
And that's a beautiful thing
to see happen.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.736
Obviously, not everything
went according to plan,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.176
but that's a different thing.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.616
We made mistakes.
We should expect mistakes.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.296
If you're pioneering something,
that means you must, by definition,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.176
venture into the unknown.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.296
When you're trying the unknown,
some things won't go as planned.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.216
That's part of the definition
of venturing into the unknown.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.336
To find the great,
you must allow mistakes to happen.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.216
So you must communicate
that we expect some things to go wrong

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.080
to create a risk-positive environment.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.280
Therefore we optimize for iteration speed.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.216
Meaning that we try, we fail,
we try again, we fail faster,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.616
we fail better, we try again,
we fail better again.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.976
Maybe after we've tried 15 times,
we've mastered some specific subject,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.640
so you want to minimize the time
it takes to try those 15 times.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.000
We optimize on trust.
We encourage diversity.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.696
You need to communicate
your vision so strongly

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.616
so that everybody can translate it
into their own context

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.536
because language is an incredibly strong

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.360
inclusionary and exclusionary
social marker.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.056
This one-brand-fits-all message --

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.296
forget it!

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.416
That's what they teach you
at business school -- it doesn't work.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.616
Or at least, it doesn't give you
the cost-efficiency advantage

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.880
of working swarmwise.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.816
This leads to a lot of different
approaches tried in parallel

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.456
in different social groups

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.480
who try out different methods
of working toward the goal.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.936
Some of them will work

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.016
but in order to find the great ones,
you need this diversity.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.496
And you need to communicate
that we need that diversity.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.176
If somebody on this side
does not understand

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.640
what those guys are doing,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.456
that's OK because we all trust each other
to work for the better of the movement.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.936
And it's OK that I don't understand
their social context.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.536
I'm not expected to --
I understand my social context.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.240
I contribute with something I know.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.456
Make people aware of this diversity.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.160
Finally, scalability.
Get feet on the ground.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.336
Again, in business school,
they teach you to use a lean organization.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.560
Forget that.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.536
Just scale up the organization
from the get-go.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.456
Start with 10,000 empty boxes
and an org chart

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.656
covering down to every minor city.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.856
When you have lots and lots
of small responsibilities

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.416
in such a scaffolding
that supports the swarm,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.976
supports the activists,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.016
you'll find that these boxes
in the org charts

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.256
are getting filled in quite rapidly,

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.816
and they start to get filled in
beyond your horizon

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.480
with people you've never heard of.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.976
And so, this swarm keeps growing
to tens of thousands of people,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.376
each taking on something small
with very, very decentralized mandate

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.920
to act on the organization.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.160
And this is when
a swarm intelligence emerges.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.176
This is when you have this beehive logic
where everybody knows what's to be done.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.040
Everybody is taking
their own small steps towards it.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.336
So the swarm starts to act
as a coherent organism.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.320
And it's amazing to watch.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.176
This is when you're awarded
by the cost-efficiency advantage

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.400
over your competitors

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.040
by two orders of magnitude.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.600
Two orders of magnitude.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.040
This is not just a silver bullet.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.880
So we've been talking a lot
about the big picture today.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.136
You can use these swarm methods
for a lot of stuff.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.016
Do you want to change the world?

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.536
Do you want to bring clean water
to a billion people?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.256
Teach three billion people to read?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.856
Maybe you're into social change;

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.496
you want to introduce
unconditional basic income.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.640
Or maybe you want
to take humanity to Mars.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.800
You can do this using these methods.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.776
You can do this.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.016
It's about leadership.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.640
It's about deciding what you want to do
and telling it to the world.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.880
Because no matter whether you think
you can or cannot change the world,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.960
no matter whether you think
you can or cannot change the world,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.480
you are probably right.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.456
So one question I want everybody here
to ask themselves today

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.920
is the observation that change doesn't
just happen, somebody makes it happen --

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.000
do you want to be that person?

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.229
Do you want to be that person?

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.560
And then one last thing:

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.016
There's one component more
that's required to work swarmwise

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.421
that I haven't mentioned yet.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.800
And that is fun.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.576
This goes beyond just enjoying your job,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.280
this goes beyond having
a pinball machine in the office.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.656
Because this is actually required
to succeed in a swarmwise scenario.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.376
This is required to succeed

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.040
to get that cost-efficiency advantage
of two orders of magnitude.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.320
For the reason that you need
to attract volunteers.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.920
And people, in this aspect,
are rather predictable.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.480
People will go to other people
who are having fun.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:03.960
In contrast, they will walk an extra mile
to avoid people who are not having fun.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.296
So, having fun is more than just
having a pinball machine in the office.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:17.296
It's an absolute
and unavoidable requirement

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:21.880
for organizational and operational success
when you're working swarmwise.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.119
So, in summary --

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.416
a recipe for a swarm organization

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.880
using these motivational methods
to a huge competitive advantage.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:43.120
Your goal: it needs to be tangible,
credible, inclusive and epic.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.560
Your organization needs to be optimized
for speed, trust and scalability.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.400
You need to enjoy yourselves.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.056
And that will reward you

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.760
with two orders of magnitude
of cost-efficiency advantage.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.576
Thank you.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.320
(Applause)
