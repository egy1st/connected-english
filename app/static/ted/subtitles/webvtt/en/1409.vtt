00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Just a moment ago,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Her text said,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
"Mom, you will rock."

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I love this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Getting that text

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
was like getting a hug.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And so there you have it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I embody

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the central paradox.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm a woman

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
who loves getting texts

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
who's going to tell you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that too many of them can be a problem.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Actually that reminder of my daughter

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
brings me to the beginning of my story.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Rebecca was five years old

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and she was sitting right there

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in the front row.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I had just written a book

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that celebrated our life on the internet

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I was about to be on the cover

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of Wired magazine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In those heady days,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
we were experimenting

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with chat rooms and online virtual communities.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And then we unplugged.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I was excited.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And, as a psychologist, what excited me most

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
was the idea

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that we would use what we learned in the virtual world

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
about ourselves, about our identity,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to live better lives in the real world.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now fast-forward to 2012.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm back here on the TED stage again.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
My daughter's 20. She's a college student.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
She sleeps with her cellphone,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
so do I.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And I've just written a new book,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but this time it's not one

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that will get me on the cover

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
of Wired magazine.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So what happened?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm still excited by technology,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but I believe,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and I'm here to make the case,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that we're letting it take us places

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that we don't want to go.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Over the past 15 years,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I've studied technologies of mobile communication

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
young and old,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
about their plugged in lives.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And what I've found

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is that our little devices,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
those little devices in our pockets,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
are so psychologically powerful

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that they don't only change what we do,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
they change who we are.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Some of the things we do now with our devices

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
are things that, only a few years ago,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
we would have found odd

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
or disturbing,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but they've quickly come to seem familiar,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
just how we do things.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So just to take some quick examples:

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
People text or do email

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
during corporate board meetings.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
They text and shop and go on Facebook

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
during classes, during presentations,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
actually during all meetings.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
People talk to me about the important new skill

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
of making eye contact

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
while you're texting.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
(Laughter)

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
People explain to me

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that it's hard, but that it can be done.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Parents text and do email

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
at breakfast and at dinner

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
while their children complain

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
about not having their parents' full attention.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But then these same children

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
deny each other their full attention.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
This is a recent shot

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of my daughter and her friends

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
being together

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
while not being together.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And we even text at funerals.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I study this.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We remove ourselves

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
from our grief or from our revery

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and we go into our phones.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Why does this matter?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It matters to me

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
trouble certainly

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
in how we relate to each other,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
but also trouble

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
in how we relate to ourselves

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and our capacity for self-reflection.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We're getting used to a new way

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of being alone together.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
People want to be with each other,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
but also elsewhere --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
connected to all the different places they want to be.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
People want to customize their lives.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They want to go in and out of all the places they are

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
because the thing that matters most to them

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
is control over where they put their attention.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So you want to go to that board meeting,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
but you only want to pay attention

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to the bits that interest you.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And some people think that's a good thing.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But you can end up

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
hiding from each other,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
even as we're all constantly connected to each other.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
A 50-year-old business man

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
lamented to me

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
When he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
he doesn't call.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
because, he says, "They're too busy on their email."

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But then he stops himself

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and he says, "You know, I'm not telling you the truth.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I think I should want to,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry."

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Across the generations,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I see that people can't get enough of each other,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
if and only if

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
they can have each other at a distance,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
in amounts they can control.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I call it the Goldilocks effect:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
not too close, not too far,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
just right.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But what might feel just right

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
for that middle-aged executive

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
can be a problem for an adolescent

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
who needs to develop face-to-face relationships.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
An 18-year-old boy

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
who uses texting for almost everything

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
says to me wistfully,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
"Someday, someday,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
but certainly not now,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I'd like to learn how to have a conversation."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
When I ask people

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
"What's wrong with having a conversation?"

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
People say, "I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It takes place in real time

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and you can't control what you're going to say."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So that's the bottom line.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Texting, email, posting,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
all of these things

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
let us present the self as we want to be.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We get to edit,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and that means we get to delete,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and that means we get to retouch,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the face, the voice,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
the flesh, the body --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
not too little, not too much,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
just right.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Human relationships

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
are rich and they're messy

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and they're demanding.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And we clean them up with technology.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And when we do,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
one of the things that can happen

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
is that we sacrifice conversation

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
for mere connection.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
We short-change ourselves.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And over time,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
we seem to forget this,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
or we seem to stop caring.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I was caught off guard

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
when Stephen Colbert

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
asked me a profound question,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
a profound question.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
He said, "Don't all those little tweets,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
don't all those little sips

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
of online communication,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
add up to one big gulp

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of real conversation?"

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
My answer was no,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
they don't add up.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Connecting in sips may work

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
for gathering discrete bits of information,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
they may work for saying, "I'm thinking about you,"

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
or even for saying, "I love you," --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I mean, look at how I felt

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
when I got that text from my daughter --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
but they don't really work

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
for learning about each other,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
for really coming to know and understand each other.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And we use conversations with each other

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to learn how to have conversations

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
with ourselves.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So a flight from conversation

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
can really matter

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
because it can compromise

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
our capacity for self-reflection.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
For kids growing up,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that skill is the bedrock of development.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Over and over I hear,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
"I would rather text than talk."

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And what I'm seeing

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is that people get so used to being short-changed

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
out of real conversation,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
so used to getting by with less,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that they've become almost willing

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
to dispense with people altogether.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So for example,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
many people share with me this wish,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
that some day a more advanced version of Siri,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
will be more like a best friend,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
someone who will listen

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
when others won't.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I believe this wish

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
reflects a painful truth

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that I've learned in the past 15 years.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
That feeling that no one is listening to me

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
is very important

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in our relationships with technology.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
That's why it's so appealing

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
to have a Facebook page

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
or a Twitter feed --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
so many automatic listeners.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And the feeling that no one is listening to me

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
make us want to spend time

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
with machines that seem to care about us.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We're developing robots,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
they call them sociable robots,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
that are specifically designed to be companions --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to the elderly,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to our children,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
to us.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Have we so lost confidence

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that we will be there for each other?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
During my research

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I worked in nursing homes,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and I brought in these sociable robots

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that were designed to give the elderly

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the feeling that they were understood.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And one day I came in

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and a woman who had lost a child

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
was talking to a robot

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
in the shape of a baby seal.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It seemed to be looking in her eyes.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
It seemed to be following the conversation.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It comforted her.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And many people found this amazing.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
But that woman was trying to make sense of her life

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
with a machine that had no experience

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
of the arc of a human life.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
That robot put on a great show.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And we're vulnerable.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
People experience pretend empathy

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
as though it were the real thing.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So during that moment

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
when that woman

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
was experiencing that pretend empathy,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I was thinking, "That robot can't empathize.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
It doesn't face death.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It doesn't know life."

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And as that woman took comfort

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
in her robot companion,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I didn't find it amazing;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
in my 15 years of work.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But when I stepped back,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I felt myself

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
at the cold, hard center

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
of a perfect storm.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
We expect more from technology

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and less from each other.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And I ask myself,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
"Why have things come to this?"

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And I believe it's because

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
technology appeals to us most

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
where we are most vulnerable.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And we are vulnerable.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
We're lonely,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
but we're afraid of intimacy.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And so from social networks to sociable robots,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
we're designing technologies

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
that will give us the illusion of companionship

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
without the demands of friendship.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
We turn to technology to help us feel connected

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
in ways we can comfortably control.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But we're not so comfortable.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
We are not so much in control.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
These days, those phones in our pockets

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
are changing our minds and hearts

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
because they offer us

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
three gratifying fantasies.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
One, that we can put our attention

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
wherever we want it to be;

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
two, that we will always be heard;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and three, that we will never have to be alone.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And that third idea,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that we will never have to be alone,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
is central to changing our psyches.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Because the moment that people are alone,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
even for a few seconds,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
they become anxious, they panic, they fidget,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
they reach for a device.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Just think of people at a checkout line

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
or at a red light.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And so people try to solve it by connecting.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But here, connection

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
is more like a symptom than a cure.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It expresses, but it doesn't solve,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
an underlying problem.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But more than a symptom,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
constant connection is changing

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
the way people think of themselves.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's shaping a new way of being.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The best way to describe it is,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I share therefore I am.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We use technology to define ourselves

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
by sharing our thoughts and feelings

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
even as we're having them.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So before it was:

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I have a feeling,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I want to make a call.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Now it's: I want to have a feeling,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I need to send a text.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
The problem with this new regime

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
of "I share therefore I am"

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
is that, if we don't have connection,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
we don't feel like ourselves.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
We almost don't feel ourselves.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So what do we do? We connect more and more.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But in the process,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
we set ourselves up to be isolated.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
How do you get from connection to isolation?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
You end up isolated

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
the ability to be separate,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
to gather yourself.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Solitude is where you find yourself

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
so that you can reach out to other people

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and form real attachments.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
When we don't have the capacity for solitude,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
or in order to feel alive.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
When this happens,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
we're not able to appreciate who they are.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
It's as though we're using them

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
as spare parts

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
to support our fragile sense of self.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We slip into thinking that always being connected

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
is going to make us feel less alone.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
But we're at risk,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
because actually it's the opposite that's true.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
If we're not able to be alone,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
we're going to be more lonely.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And if we don't teach our children to be alone,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
they're only going to know

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
how to be lonely.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
When I spoke at TED in 1996,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
reporting on my studies

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
of the early virtual communities,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I said, "Those who make the most

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
of their lives on the screen

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
come to it in a spirit of self-reflection."

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And that's what I'm calling for here, now:

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
reflection and, more than that, a conversation

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
about where our current use of technology

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
may be taking us,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
what it might be costing us.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
We're smitten with technology.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And we're afraid, like young lovers,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
that too much talking might spoil the romance.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But it's time to talk.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
We grew up with digital technology

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and so we see it as all grown up.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
But it's not, it's early days.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
There's plenty of time

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
for us to reconsider how we use it,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
how we build it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I'm not suggesting

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that we turn away from our devices,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
just that we develop a more self-aware relationship

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
with them, with each other

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and with ourselves.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I see some first steps.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Start thinking of solitude

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
as a good thing.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Make room for it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Find ways to demonstrate this

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
as a value to your children.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Create sacred spaces at home --

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
the kitchen, the dining room --

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and reclaim them for conversation.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Do the same thing at work.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
At work, we're so busy communicating

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
that we often don't have time to think,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
we don't have time to talk,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
about the things that really matter.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Change that.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Most important, we all really need to listen to each other,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
including to the boring bits.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Because it's when we stumble

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
or hesitate or lose our words

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
that we reveal ourselves to each other.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Technology is making a bid

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
to redefine human connection --

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
how we care for each other,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
how we care for ourselves --

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
but it's also giving us the opportunity

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
to affirm our values

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and our direction.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I'm optimistic.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
We have everything we need to start.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
We have each other.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And we have the greatest chance of success

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
if we recognize our vulnerability.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
That we listen

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
when technology says

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
it will take something complicated

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and promises something simpler.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So in my work,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I hear that life is hard,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
relationships are filled with risk.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And then there's technology --

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
simpler, hopeful,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
optimistic, ever-young.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
It's like calling in the cavalry.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
An ad campaign promises

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
that online and with avatars,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
you can "Finally, love your friends

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
love your body, love your life,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
online and with avatars."

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
We're drawn to virtual romance,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
to computer games that seem like worlds,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
to the idea that robots, robots,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
will someday be our true companions.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
We spend an evening on the social network

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
instead of going to the pub with friends.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
But our fantasies of substitution

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
have cost us.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Now we all need to focus

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
on the many, many ways

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
technology can lead us back

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
to our real lives, our own bodies,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
our own communities,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
our own politics,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
our own planet.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
They need us.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Let's talk about

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
how we can use digital technology,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
the technology of our dreams,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
to make this life

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
the life we can love.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Thank you.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
(Applause)
