WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
First place I'd like to take you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that I'll talk a little bit about.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
One of the things that's changed here,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
in the last 150 years since Jules Verne

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is that technology has enabled us to go to these places

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that you can see for hundreds of meters

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
without a break in the line of sight.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
for anywhere from two to four months,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And a lot of people ask me, you know,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
what kind of people do you get for a project like this?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
While our selection process

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In case you're wondering, this is our strength test.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
(Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But we also value esprit de corps

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
while under great stress in remote locations.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
except that you're now running a string of these things down.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
is artificially illuminated at great effort.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and unfortunately slides just don't do justice.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
(Video)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
are obsolete and dangerous.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
(Laughter)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Along that same line, I have to tell you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
we have never seen monsters underground --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
at least the kind that eat you.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If there is a monster underground,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
it is the crushing psychological remoteness

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that begins to hit every member of the team

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that's a little over 8,600 feet down --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
at 30 kilometers from the entrance.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Eventually, if you keep going down in these things,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
probability says that you're going to run into a place like this.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that collects water and fills to the roof.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And when you used to find these things,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is because the confrontation of these things

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
forced me to become an inventor.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And we've since gone on to develop

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
for long range, away from a safe haven.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that came out in 1999.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
To experience it is a privilege.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
that you saw in there did not exist before 1999.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to another unexplored world.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
This is Europa.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
This is one of the places where planetary scientists

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
believe there is a highest probability of the detection

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
For those who have never seen this story,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
couple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
There was a brief clip --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
would be the ultimate robotic challenge.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and to find a good landing site on the ice.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now we have to get through the ice.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
You need a melt probe.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
through the ancient ice, until finally --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX --

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
This is the target site,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and beyond that nobody knows anything.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
This is part of DEPTHX's mission.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
There are two primary targets we're doing here.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
There are more stages involved here

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
through the space, we populate it with environmental variables --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
sulphide, halide, things like that.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
where there's a high probability of life.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
looking for changes in color.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
We either draw in a liquid sample,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
or we can actually take a solid core from the wall.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
No hands at the wheel.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This is all behavioral autonomy here

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
that's being conducted by the robot on its own.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
The real hat trick for this vehicle, though,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
allowing it to do new exploration

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
on what it's gone through already.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
What I'm going to show you next

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
that's ever been done.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
robotically-discovered division of bacteria.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
we may have the first evidence of life off this planet.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
What then of manned space exploration?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
The successful conclusion of that mission will result

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
of government scientists and pilots.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
It will leave us no further along in the general expansion

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Something fundamental has to change

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
One of them is the requirement

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
for economical earth-to-space transport.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
have got this in their sights and I salute them.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Go, go, go.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
a gas station on orbit.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
It's not going to look like that.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Now, to give you a chance to understand

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
why there is power in that statement,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I've got to give you the basics of Space 101.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Anybody drink one of these here this week?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
That's more than you pay for TED,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
if Google dropped their sponsorship.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
every time you hit the accelerator.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
There is a place where you can.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
if you can find propellant on the moon.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
There is a little-known mission that was launched

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
on the south pole of the moon.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
That signal was so strong,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
by the impact of asteroids and comet material.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We can't do that right now.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
that has to be launched from the ground,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
We have to beat that.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
with Dr. Lowell Wood's group.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And we can extend that now to just about everything.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
We can go much further.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
There's another thing.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
When you're coming back from the moon,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
you have to deal with orbital mechanics.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You got two choices.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
You can dive into the stratosphere,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
It has never been done.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
better than Disney.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
The traditional approach to space exploration

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
has been that you carry all the fuel you need

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
to get everybody back in case of an emergency.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
If you try to do that for the moon,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
But if you send a mining team there,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
without the return propellant, first --

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
(Laughter)

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
so we're not going to burn the gear.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and it would be the most dramatic demonstration

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
that you could do something worthwhile off this planet

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
that has ever been done.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
There's a myth that you can't do anything in space

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
That's not true.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
In seven years, we could pull off

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
We're living in one of the most exciting times in history.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
We're at a magical confluence where private wealth

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and imagination are driving the demand for access to space.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The orbital refueling stations I've just described

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
for opening space to the general exploration.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
of purpose and timing.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I intend to lead that expedition.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:36.000
(Applause)

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
It can be done in seven years with the right backing.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and join other bold individuals from time past

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
We have collectively forgotten that lesson.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
and complete the final piece

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Thank you.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000
(Applause)
