00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hi.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I did that for two reasons.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
First of all, I wanted to give you

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
a good visual first impression.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But the main reason I did it is that

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a Lady Gaga skanky mic.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm used to a stationary mic.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's the sensible shoe of public address.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
(Laughter)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I just become skanky.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
(Laughter) So I'm sorry about that.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And I'm already off-message.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
(Laughter)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I have devoted the past 25 years of my life

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to designing books.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
("Yes, BOOKS. You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You cannot turn them off with a switch.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Tell your kids.")

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It all sort of started as a benign mistake,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
like penicillin. (Laughter)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What I really wanted

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
was to be a graphic designer

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
at one of the big design firms in New York City.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But upon arrival there,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I found that the only thing I was offered

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
a book publisher.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now I was stupid,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but not so stupid that I turned it down.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I had absolutely no idea

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
what I was about to become part of,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and I was incredibly lucky.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Soon, it had occurred to me what my job was.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
My job was to ask this question:

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
"What do the stories look like?"

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because that is what Knopf is.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We bring stories to the public.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The stories can be anything,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and some of them are actually true.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But they all have one thing in common:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
They all need to look like something.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They all need a face.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Why? To give you a first impression

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of what you are about to get into.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
A book designer gives form to content,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but also

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
manages a very careful balance between the two.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now, the first day

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
of my graphic design training at Penn State University,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and wrote the word "Apple" underneath,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And he covered up the picture and he said,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"You either say this," and then he covered up the word,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
"or you show this.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But you don't do this."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Because this is treating your audience like a moron.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
(Laughter)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And they deserve better.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And lo and behold, soon enough,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I was able to put this theory to the test

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
on two books that I was working on for Knopf.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Now the Hepburn book

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
was written in a very conversational style,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The Dietrich book was an observation

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
by her daughter; it was a biography.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So the Hepburn story is words

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So there you are.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Pure content and pure form, side by side.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
No fighting, ladies.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
("What's a Jurassic Park?")

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now, what is the story here?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Someone

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is re-engineering dinosaurs

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
by extracting their DNA

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
from prehistoric amber.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Genius!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Now, luckily for me,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I live and work in New York City,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
where there are plenty of dinosaurs.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Laughter)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I went to the Museum of Natural History,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and I bought a book.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Now I took this diagram,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and I put it in a Photostat machine,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Laughter)

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and I took a piece of tracing paper,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and I taped it over the Photostat

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
(Laughter) --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and then I took a Rapidograph pen --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
explain it to the youngsters --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
(Laughter)

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I had no idea what I was doing,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I had no idea where I was going,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
but at some point, I stopped --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
when to keep going would seem like I was going too far.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of us seeing this animal coming into being.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We're in the middle of the process.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And then I just threw some typography on it.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Very basic stuff,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
slightly suggestive of public park signage.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
(Laughter)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Everybody in house loved it,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and so off it goes to the author.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And even back then,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Michael was on the cutting edge.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
("Michael Crichton responds by fax:")

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
("Wow! Fucking Fantastic Jacket")

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
(Laughter)

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I miss Michael.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
calls our legal department to see if they can

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
maybe look into buying the rights to the image,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
just in case they might want to use it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Well, they used it.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And I was thrilled.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
We all know it was an amazing movie,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and it was so interesting to see it

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
go out into the culture and become this phenomenon

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and to see all the different permutations of it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But not too long ago,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I came upon this on the Web.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
No, that is not me.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
But whoever it is,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
"Oh my God, that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh!

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I was so wasted."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
(Laughter)

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But if you think about it, from my head

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
to my hands to his leg.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
(Laughter)

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
That's a responsibility.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
The book designer's responsibility is threefold:

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
to the reader, to the publisher and, most of all, to the author.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I want you to look at the author's book

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and say, "Wow! I need to read that."

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and the title essay

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And the reason he went is because

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
he had a fear of his body image,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and he wanted to explore what was underlying that.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
that you could literally take the pants off of.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
But when you do,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you don't get what you expect.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
You get something that goes much deeper than that.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And David especially loved this design

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
because at book signings, which he does a lot of,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
he could take a magic marker and do this.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Laughter)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Hello!

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
(Laughter)

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
called ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
In his 20s, he was a hotshot ad executive,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and as Mad Men has told us, a raging alcoholic.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
He did not think so, however,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
but his coworkers did an intervention and they said,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
"You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
what I would call the opposite of Type 101.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
What does that mean?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
you get the assignment of, select a word

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Very simple stuff.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
This is going to be the opposite of that.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I want this book to look like it's lying to you,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Then when we went to press,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the printer put a spot gloss on the ink

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and it really looked like it was running.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Not long after it came out, Augusten was waylaid in an airport

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and he was hiding out in the bookstore

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
spying on who was buying his books.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And this woman came up to it,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and she squinted, and she took it to the register,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and she said to the man behind the counter, "This one's ruined."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
(Laughter)

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady. They all came in that way."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Now, that's a good printing job.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
A book cover

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is a distillation.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It is a haiku,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
if you will, of the story.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
This particular story

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
by Osama Tezuka

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
is his epic life of the Buddha,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
when it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
of the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
All of these solutions

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
derive their origins from the text of the book,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
but once the book designer has read the text,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
then he has to be an interpreter

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and a translator.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
This story was a real puzzle.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This is what it's about.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
("Intrigue and murder among 16th century Ottoman court painters.")

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
(Laughter)

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and I looked at them and I deconstructed them

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and I put them back together.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And so, here's the design, right?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Ahh! We come upon them,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Huhh! They've been discovered by the sultan.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
He will not be pleased.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Huhh! And now the sultan is in danger.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And now, we have to open it up

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
to find out what's going to happen next.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Try experiencing that on a Kindle.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
(Laughter)

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Don't get me started.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Seriously.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Much is to be gained by eBooks:

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
ease, convenience, portability.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But something is definitely lost: tradition,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
a sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness --

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
a little bit of humanity.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Do you know what John Updike used to do

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
the first thing when he would get a copy

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
He'd smell it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
All those years, all those books, he never got tired of it.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Now, I am all for the iPad,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
but trust me -- smelling it will get you nowhere.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
(Laughter)

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Now the Apple guys are texting,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
"Develop odor emission plug-in."

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
(Laughter)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
A woman

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
negotiating down a spiral staircase

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
she's entered a new reality

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
that's just slightly different from the one that she left,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
but very similar, but different.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So how do we show this?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So we're talking about different planes, different pieces of paper.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It's one part of the form and content.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
When it's on top of the paper board,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
which is the opposite, it forms this.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So even if you don't know anything about this book,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
you are forced to consider a single person

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
straddling two planes of existence.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And the object itself invited exploration

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
interaction, consideration

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and touch.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
This debuted at number two

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
on the New York Times Best Seller list.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
This is unheard of,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
both for us the publisher, and the author.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We're talking a 900-page book

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
that is as weird as it is compelling,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and featuring a climactic scene

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
in which a horde of tiny people

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and cause a German Shepherd to explode.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.000
(Laughter)

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Not exactly Jackie Collins.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
eight printings, and still going strong.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So even though we love publishing as an art,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
we very much know it's a business too,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
that great art can be great business.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So that's my story. To be continued.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
What does it look like?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Yes. It can, it does and it will,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but for this book designer,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
page-turner,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
dog-eared place-holder,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
notes in the margins-taker,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
ink-sniffer,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
the story looks like this.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Thank you.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
(Applause)
