00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You know, cadaver dissection

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is the traditional way of learning human anatomy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For students, it's quite an experience,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but for a school, it could be very difficult

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or expensive to maintain.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
they do not have a cadaver dissection lab.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
cadavers may not be easily available.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So to address this, we developed

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with a Dr. Brown in Stanford: virtual dissection table.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So we call this Anatomage Table.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So with this Anatomage Table,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
students can experience

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the dissection without a human cadaver.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And the table form is important,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and since it's touch-interactive,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
just like the way they do dissections in the lab,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you can literally interact with your table.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Our digital body is one-to-one life size,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so this is exactly the way

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
students will see the real anatomy.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm going to

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
do some demonstrations.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
As you can see,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I use my finger to interact with my digital body.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm going to do some cuts.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I can cut any way I want to, so I cut right here.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Then it's going to show inside.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And I can change my cut

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to see different parts.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Maybe I can cut there,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
see the brain,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and I can change my cut.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You can see some internal organs.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So we call this

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the slicer mode.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
OK, I'm going to do another cut.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Right there.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This shows a lot of internal structures.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So if I want to see the back side,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I can flip

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and see from behind.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Like this.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So if these images are

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that means we did the right job.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So our doctors said

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
these are eye candies.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So instead of just butchering the body,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
What I'm going to do is

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm going to peel off all the skin, muscles and bones,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
just to see a few internal organs.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Right here.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Let's say I'm going to cut

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the liver right here.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
OK.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm going to do some surgery here.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm going to cut some veins, arteries.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Oops! ...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
You don't want to hear "oops" in real surgery.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
(Laughter)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But fortunately, our digital man has "undo."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Laughter)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Okay.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
All right then.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Let me zoom in.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I'm going to make a cut right there.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And then you can see the inside of the heart.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
You can see the atrium and the ventricles,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
how blood flows to our arteries and veins.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Just like this,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
students can isolate anybody

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and dissect any way you want to.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
It doesn't have to be always dissection.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So let me show you,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I'm going to start with the skeletal structure,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and I can add a few internal organs.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Yep.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Maybe I can add quickly this way.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And I can build muscles

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
gradually,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
just like that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We can see tendons and muscles.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Wish I could build my muscle this fast.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Laughter)

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And this is another way to learn anatomy.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Another thing I can show you is,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
more often than not,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
doctors get to meet patients

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in X-ray form.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Anatomage Table shows

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You can also interact with your X-ray,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and also if you want,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
you can compare

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
with how anatomy would appear

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
in X-ray, too.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So when you are done,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
just bring back the body

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and then it's ready for another session.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It looks like our table

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
also can transform gender, too.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It's a female now.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So this is Anatomage Table. Thank you.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
(Applause)
