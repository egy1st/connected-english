WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.995
Tonight, I want to have a conversation about

00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:04.929
this incredible global issue

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.466
that's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.787
something we can all relate to,

00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:13.517
and what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth.

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:16.794
But first, I want to take you on a little journey.

00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:19.590
Let's first visit our planet, but at night,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.126
and from space.

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:24.077
This is what our planet looks like from outer space

00:00:24.077 --> 00:00:26.215
at nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:29.069
around the planet. And the thing you would notice first,

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.386
of course, is how dominant the human presence

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:34.450
on our planet is.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.185
We see cities, we see oil fields,

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.382
you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,

00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:42.946
that we are dominating much of our planet,

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:44.719
and mostly through the use of energy

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.453
that we see here at night.

00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:48.627
But let's go back and drop it a little deeper

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:50.669
and look during the daytime.

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:54.359
What we see during the day is our landscapes.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.912
This is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called Rondônia

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:01.502
in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:04.118
If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,

00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:06.644
you're going to see a thin white line,

00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:10.022
which is a road that was built in the 1970s.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:13.689
If we come back to the same place in 2001,

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.946
what we're going to find is that these roads

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:19.796
spurt off more roads, and more roads after that,

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:22.937
at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.098
where there are going to be a few cows.

00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:28.410
These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.041
And these cows are eaten basically in South America,

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.825
in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:36.561
But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.146
is something we notice a lot of around the tropics,

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:41.374
especially in this part of the world.

00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:44.697
If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:47.089
we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:51.225
here also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:54.787
there's a thin white line through that kind of seam,

00:01:54.787 --> 00:01:56.099
and there's a lone farmer out there

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.662
in the middle of the primeval jungle.

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:03.435
Let's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:05.963
and we'll see that that landscape actually looks

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:08.845
a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.213
In fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.

00:02:12.213 --> 00:02:15.086
These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:18.832
as animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare

00:02:18.832 --> 00:02:21.373
about a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:24.803
animal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.

00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:27.415
Instead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.

00:02:27.415 --> 00:02:29.207
So soybeans have really exploded,

00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:32.832
showing how trade and globalization are

00:02:32.832 --> 00:02:35.704
really responsible for the connections to rainforests

00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:37.641
and the Amazon -- an incredibly strange

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:40.357
and interconnected world that we have today.

00:02:40.357 --> 00:02:42.678
Well, again and again, what we find as we look

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:44.814
around the world in our little tour of the world

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:48.565
is that landscape after landscape after landscape

00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:51.334
have been cleared and altered for growing food

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:53.669
and other crops.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.029
So one of the questions we've been asking is,

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.517
how much of the world is used to grow food,

00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:00.913
and where is it exactly, and how can we change that

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.407
into the future, and what does it mean?

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:06.375
Well, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:09.295
using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track

00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:11.479
farming on a global scale.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.191
And this is what we found, and it's startling.

00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:17.982
This map shows the presence of agriculture

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:20.046
on planet Earth.

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:23.006
The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:26.207
like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.

00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:30.471
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.

00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:32.595
If you put it all together in one place,

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:35.262
it'd be the size of South America.

00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:37.938
The second area, in brown, is the world's pastures

00:03:37.938 --> 00:03:40.155
and rangelands, where our animals live.

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:42.871
That area's about 30 million square kilometers,

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:45.290
or about an Africa's worth of land,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.203
a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,

00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:50.355
is what you see. And what's left is, like,

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.366
the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.057
or the middle of a rain forest.

00:03:54.057 --> 00:03:57.802
We're using a planet's worth of land already.

00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:00.593
If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:03.305
of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.874
and it's 60 times larger

00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:08.449
than all the areas we complain about,

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.666
our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.529
Half of humanity lives in cities today,

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:18.465
but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.

00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:20.384
So this is an amazing kind of result,

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:22.561
and it really shocked us when we looked at that.

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:25.265
So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.971
but also we're using a lot of water.

00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.499
This is a photograph flying into Arizona,

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:31.308
and when you look at it, you're like,

00:04:31.308 --> 00:04:32.435
"What are they growing here?" It turns out

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:35.367
they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:37.755
using water sprayed on top.

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:39.305
Now, the irony is, it's probably sold

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:41.981
in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.293
But what's really interesting is, this water's got to come

00:04:44.293 --> 00:04:46.837
from some place, and it comes from here,

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:49.477
the Colorado River in North America.

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:52.125
Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.244
this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,

00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:57.029
kind of an average day, it looks something like this.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.933
But if we come back today, during a normal condition

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:03.501
to the exact same location, this is what's left.

00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:06.503
The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,

00:05:06.503 --> 00:05:10.059
or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.979
Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.386
and using it to grow food,

00:05:15.386 --> 00:05:18.066
and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:21.346
it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.

00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:24.474
We've literally consumed an entire river in North America

00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:26.602
for irrigation.

00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:28.358
Well, that's not even the worst example in the world.

00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:31.178
This probably is: the Aral Sea.

00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:34.082
Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.

00:05:34.082 --> 00:05:36.141
This is in the former Soviet Union

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.713
in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.161
one of the great inland seas of the world.

00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:43.473
But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like

00:05:43.473 --> 00:05:46.995
it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?

00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:48.958
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.450
you see two little rivers kind of coming down

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.967
through the sand, feeding this basin with water.

00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:57.549
Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains

00:05:57.549 --> 00:06:00.482
far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river

00:06:00.482 --> 00:06:03.682
through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.

00:06:03.682 --> 00:06:07.694
Well, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water

00:06:07.694 --> 00:06:10.047
to irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not,

00:06:10.047 --> 00:06:13.827
in Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets

00:06:13.827 --> 00:06:15.887
to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union.

00:06:15.887 --> 00:06:17.813
They really needed the money.

00:06:17.813 --> 00:06:19.809
Well, you can imagine what happens. You turn off

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.739
the water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen?

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:25.187
Here it is in 1973,

00:06:25.187 --> 00:06:27.399
1986,

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:30.203
1999,

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:33.258
2004,

00:06:33.258 --> 00:06:37.923
and about 11 months ago.

00:06:37.923 --> 00:06:39.972
It's pretty extraordinary.

00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:43.163
Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest.

00:06:43.163 --> 00:06:45.823
Imagine that was Lake Superior.

00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:49.097
Imagine that was Lake Huron.

00:06:49.097 --> 00:06:50.704
It's an extraordinary change.

00:06:50.704 --> 00:06:53.047
This is not only a change in water and

00:06:53.047 --> 00:06:55.416
where the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:57.673
of the environment of this region.

00:06:57.673 --> 00:06:58.957
Let's start with this.

00:06:58.957 --> 00:07:01.167
The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:02.707
Let's put it that way.

00:07:02.707 --> 00:07:06.111
So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.

00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:08.055
There's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things

00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:10.471
that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.603
One of those small islands that was remote

00:07:12.603 --> 00:07:14.215
and impossible to get to was a site

00:07:14.215 --> 00:07:16.911
of Soviet biological weapons testing.

00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.265
You can walk there today.

00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:19.812
Weather patterns have changed.

00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:23.121
Nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only

00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:26.071
in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.951
This is an environmental disaster writ large.

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:30.446
But let's bring it home.

00:07:30.446 --> 00:07:33.175
This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago

00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:34.824
that he took when he was in the Soviet Union

00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:36.086
a long, long time ago,

00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:39.082
showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea.

00:07:39.082 --> 00:07:41.240
You see the canal they dug?

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.704
They were so desperate to try to, kind of, float the boats into

00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:45.920
the remaining pools of water, but they finally had to give up

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.384
because the piers and the moorings simply couldn't

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:50.554
keep up with the retreating shoreline.

00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:52.565
I don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future

00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:54.963
archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about

00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:57.783
our time in history, and wonder, "What were you thinking?"

00:07:57.783 --> 00:08:00.811
Well, that's the future we have to look forward to.

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:03.724
We already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water

00:08:03.724 --> 00:08:05.916
that's sustainable, and agriculture alone

00:08:05.916 --> 00:08:08.316
is 70 percent of that.

00:08:08.316 --> 00:08:11.476
So we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.

00:08:11.476 --> 00:08:14.820
We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.156
Usually when we think about the atmosphere,

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:19.804
we think about climate change and greenhouse gases,

00:08:19.804 --> 00:08:21.860
and mostly around energy,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.496
but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters

00:08:24.496 --> 00:08:26.548
of greenhouse gases too.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.604
If you look at carbon dioxide from

00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:30.756
burning tropical rainforest,

00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:33.316
or methane coming from cows and rice,

00:08:33.316 --> 00:08:36.229
or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:39.000
it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.016
gases going into the atmosphere from human activity.

00:08:42.016 --> 00:08:43.870
That's more than all our transportation.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.620
It's more than all our electricity.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.245
It's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.

00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:51.355
It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases

00:08:51.355 --> 00:08:53.675
of any human activity in the world.

00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:56.301
And yet, we don't talk about it very much.

00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:59.354
So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture

00:08:59.354 --> 00:09:01.491
dominating our planet,

00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:03.849
whether it's 40 percent of our land surface,

00:09:03.849 --> 00:09:05.957
70 percent of the water we use,

00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:08.682
30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:11.531
We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus

00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:13.994
around the world simply by using fertilizers,

00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:16.765
causing huge problems of water quality from rivers,

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.482
lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest

00:09:19.482 --> 00:09:22.157
driver of biodiversity loss.

00:09:22.157 --> 00:09:24.258
So without a doubt, agriculture is

00:09:24.258 --> 00:09:27.938
the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet

00:09:27.938 --> 00:09:30.557
since the end of the ice age. No question.

00:09:30.557 --> 00:09:33.537
And it rivals climate change in importance.

00:09:33.537 --> 00:09:36.462
And they're both happening at the same time.

00:09:36.462 --> 00:09:38.834
But what's really important here to remember is that

00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:42.102
it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.

00:09:42.102 --> 00:09:44.282
In fact, we completely depend on it.

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:48.722
It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:50.866
We have to provide food and feed and, yeah,

00:09:50.866 --> 00:09:54.722
fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people

00:09:54.722 --> 00:09:57.458
in the world today, and if anything,

00:09:57.458 --> 00:09:59.488
we're going to have the demands on agriculture

00:09:59.488 --> 00:10:02.026
increase into the future. It's not going to go away.

00:10:02.026 --> 00:10:04.257
It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of

00:10:04.257 --> 00:10:07.250
growing population. We're seven billion people today

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.450
heading towards at least nine,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.242
probably nine and a half before we're done.

00:10:12.242 --> 00:10:14.619
More importantly, changing diets.

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:17.666
As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:20.733
we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,

00:10:20.733 --> 00:10:24.194
which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.

00:10:24.194 --> 00:10:28.116
So more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,

00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:31.317
and of course having an energy crisis at the same time,

00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:34.790
where we have to replace oil with other energy sources

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.361
that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels

00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:39.140
and bio-energy sources.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.893
So you put these together. It's really hard to see

00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:44.245
how we're going to get to the rest of the century

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:48.573
without at least doubling global agricultural production.

00:10:48.573 --> 00:10:50.522
Well, how are we going to do this? How are going to

00:10:50.522 --> 00:10:53.315
double global ag production around the world?

00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:56.003
Well, we could try to farm more land.

00:10:56.003 --> 00:10:58.802
This is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where

00:10:58.802 --> 00:11:02.296
the crops are today, on the right is where they could be

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:05.244
based on soils and climate, assuming climate change

00:11:05.244 --> 00:11:07.085
doesn't disrupt too much of this,

00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:08.973
which is not a good assumption.

00:11:08.973 --> 00:11:11.162
We could farm more land, but the problem is

00:11:11.162 --> 00:11:14.143
the remaining lands are in sensitive areas.

00:11:14.143 --> 00:11:16.181
They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,

00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:18.615
things we want to protect.

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:21.439
So we could grow more food by expanding farmland,

00:11:21.439 --> 00:11:22.757
but we'd better not,

00:11:22.757 --> 00:11:26.423
because it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do.

00:11:26.423 --> 00:11:28.807
Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint

00:11:28.807 --> 00:11:32.592
of agriculture and farm the lands we have better.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:34.992
This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places

00:11:34.992 --> 00:11:37.559
in the world where we could improve yields

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.825
without harming the environment.

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:42.226
The green areas here show where corn yields,

00:11:42.226 --> 00:11:44.376
just showing corn as an example,

00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:46.977
are already really high, probably the maximum you could

00:11:46.977 --> 00:11:49.855
find on Earth today for that climate and soil,

00:11:49.855 --> 00:11:52.206
but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where

00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:54.720
we're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.060
you should be able to get.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.378
You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,

00:11:58.378 --> 00:12:01.238
but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union

00:12:01.238 --> 00:12:03.479
and Eastern Bloc countries used to be,

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:05.703
is still a mess agriculturally.

00:12:05.703 --> 00:12:08.336
Now, this would require nutrients and water.

00:12:08.336 --> 00:12:10.469
It's going to either be organic or conventional

00:12:10.469 --> 00:12:12.282
or some mix of the two to deliver that.

00:12:12.282 --> 00:12:14.447
Plants need water and nutrients.

00:12:14.447 --> 00:12:17.655
But we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work.

00:12:17.655 --> 00:12:19.935
But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive

00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:22.544
to meeting the food security needs of the future

00:12:22.544 --> 00:12:25.807
and the environmental security needs of the future.

00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:28.821
We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between

00:12:28.821 --> 00:12:32.530
growing food and having a healthy environment work better.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.060
Right now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.022
We can grow food in the background --

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:38.483
that's a soybean field —

00:12:38.483 --> 00:12:41.610
and in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.128
but we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing

00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:47.125
a lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.

00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:49.133
In the foreground, we have this prairie

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:50.691
that's wonderful from the environmental side,

00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:53.895
but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?

00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:56.432
We need to figure out how to bring both of those together

00:12:56.432 --> 00:13:00.542
into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.

00:13:00.542 --> 00:13:02.753
Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me,

00:13:02.753 --> 00:13:05.985
"Well, isn't blank the answer?" -- organic food,

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:10.733
local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills --

00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:13.500
and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here,

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.573
but not any one of these is a silver bullet.

00:13:16.573 --> 00:13:19.533
In fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot.

00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:22.045
And I love silver buckshot. You put it together

00:13:22.045 --> 00:13:24.363
and you've got something really powerful,

00:13:24.363 --> 00:13:26.763
but we need to put them together.

00:13:26.763 --> 00:13:29.296
So what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind

00:13:29.296 --> 00:13:31.980
of agriculture that blends the best ideas

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.085
of commercial agriculture and the green revolution

00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:38.637
with the best ideas of organic farming and local food

00:13:38.637 --> 00:13:42.045
and the best ideas of environmental conservation,

00:13:42.045 --> 00:13:43.850
not to have them fighting each other but to have them

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.599
collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture,

00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:52.317
something I call "terraculture," or farming for a whole planet.

00:13:52.317 --> 00:13:55.301
Now, having this conversation has been really hard,

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.413
and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points

00:13:57.413 --> 00:13:59.716
to people to reduce the controversy,

00:13:59.716 --> 00:14:01.216
to increase the collaboration.

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.763
I want to show you a short video that does kind of show

00:14:03.763 --> 00:14:06.093
our efforts right now to bring these sides together

00:14:06.093 --> 00:14:09.819
into a single conversation. So let me show you that.

00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:13.480
(Music)

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.137
("Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota: Driven to Discover")

00:14:17.137 --> 00:14:18.578
(Music)

00:14:18.578 --> 00:14:20.226
("The world population is growing

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:23.239
by 75 million people each year.

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:25.672
That's almost the size of Germany.

00:14:25.672 --> 00:14:28.615
Today, we're nearing 7 billion people.

00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:31.305
At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:33.073
And we all need food.

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:34.424
But how?

00:14:34.424 --> 00:14:37.312
How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?

00:14:37.312 --> 00:14:40.557
We already know climate change is a big problem.

00:14:40.557 --> 00:14:41.807
But it's not the only problem.

00:14:41.807 --> 00:14:44.729
We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.'

00:14:44.729 --> 00:14:47.277
A global crisis in agriculture.

00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:53.536
Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.

00:14:53.536 --> 00:14:56.985
More than 40% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.

00:14:56.985 --> 00:14:58.991
Global croplands cover 16 million km².

00:14:58.991 --> 00:15:02.184
That's almost the size of South America.

00:15:02.184 --> 00:15:03.979
Global pastures cover 30 million km².

00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:06.054
That's the size of Africa.

00:15:06.054 --> 00:15:10.770
Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.482
Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet.

00:15:14.482 --> 00:15:18.856
We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year.

00:15:18.856 --> 00:15:22.638
That's enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day.

00:15:22.638 --> 00:15:25.619
Today, many large rivers have reduced flows.

00:15:25.619 --> 00:15:27.643
Some dry up altogether.

00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:31.627
Look at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.

00:15:31.627 --> 00:15:35.250
Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.133
Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:40.389
The consequence?

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:42.373
Widespread water pollution

00:15:42.373 --> 00:15:44.535
and massive degradation of lakes and rivers.

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:48.909
Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.

00:15:48.909 --> 00:15:51.336
It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.

00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:54.029
That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:57.005
or from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.

00:15:57.005 --> 00:15:59.373
Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,

00:15:59.373 --> 00:16:00.749
methane from animals and rice fields,

00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:02.581
and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.

00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:05.836
There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture.

00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:09.367
And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival.

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:10.873
Here's the dilemma...

00:16:10.873 --> 00:16:15.228
As the world grows by several billion more people,

00:16:15.228 --> 00:16:19.812
We'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.208
So where do we go from here?

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:24.011
We need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue.

00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:25.819
We need to invest in real solutions:

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:30.157
incentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation,

00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:33.818
gray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets.

00:16:33.818 --> 00:16:36.024
We need everyone at the table.

00:16:36.024 --> 00:16:37.974
Advocates of commercial agriculture,

00:16:37.974 --> 00:16:39.121
environmental conservation,

00:16:39.121 --> 00:16:40.582
and organic farming...

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:42.617
must work together.

00:16:42.617 --> 00:16:44.175
There is no single solution.

00:16:44.191 --> 00:16:45.800
We need collaboration,

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.236
imagination,

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:48.014
determination,

00:16:48.014 --> 00:16:51.673
because failure is not an option.

00:16:51.673 --> 00:16:55.370
How do we feed the world without destroying it?

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.236
Yeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges

00:16:58.236 --> 00:17:00.346
in all of human history today:

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:03.020
the need to feed nine billion people

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.774
and do so sustainably and equitably and justly,

00:17:06.774 --> 00:17:08.475
at the same time protecting our planet

00:17:08.475 --> 00:17:11.288
for this and future generations.

00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:12.804
This is going to be one of the hardest things

00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:14.675
we ever have done in human history,

00:17:14.675 --> 00:17:17.925
and we absolutely have to get it right,

00:17:17.925 --> 00:17:22.262
and we have to get it right on our first and only try.

00:17:22.262 --> 00:17:26.237
So thanks very much. (Applause)
