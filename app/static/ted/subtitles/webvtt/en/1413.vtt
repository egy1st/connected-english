00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I call myself a body architect.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I trained in classical ballet

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and have a background in architecture and fashion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
As a body architect, I fascinate with the human body

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and explore how I can transform it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I worked at Philips Electronics

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the far-future design research lab,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
looking 20 years into the future.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I explored the human skin, and how technology can transform the body.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is augmented by touch,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or dresses that blushed and shivered with light.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I started my own experiments.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
These were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations I was having.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
These are Q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
(Laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I started a collaboration with a friend of mine, Bart Hess --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
he doesn't normally look like this --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and we used ourselves as models.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We transformed our apartments into our laboratories,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We were creating

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
visual imagery provoking human evolution.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Whilst I was at Philips, we discussed this idea of a maybe technology,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
something that wasn't either switched on or off, but in between.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
A maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I set up my studio in the red-light district

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and found a way to redefine the skin

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and create this dynamic textile.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I was introduced to Robyn, the Swedish pop star,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and she was also exploring

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
how technology coexists with raw human emotion.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And she talked about how technology with these new feathers,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
this new face paint, this punk, the way that we identify with the world,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and we made this music video.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm fascinated with the idea

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
of what happens when you merge biology with technology,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
biology, in the future, away from disease and aging.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And I thought about this concept of,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
imagine if we could reprogram

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
our own body odor, modify and biologically enhance it,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Or the way that we attract sexual partners?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And would we revert back to being more like animals,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
more primal modes of communication?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I worked with a synthetic biologist,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and I created a swallowable perfume,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
which is a cosmetic pill that you eat

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and the fragrance comes out through the skin's surface when you perspire.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It completely blows apart the way that perfume is,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and provides a whole new format.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's perfume coming from the inside out.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It redefines the role of skin, and our bodies become an atomizer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I've learned that there's no boundaries,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and if I look at the evolution of my work

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
i can see threads and connections that make sense.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But when I look towards the future,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the next project is completely unknown and wide open.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and it's these conversations and these experiences

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that connect these ideas, and they kind of instinctively come out.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
As a body architect,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I've created this limitless and boundless platform

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
for me to discover whatever I want.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And I feel like I've just got started.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So here's to another day at the office.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Thank you!

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Thank you!
