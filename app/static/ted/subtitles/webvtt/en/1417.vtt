WEBVTT

00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:02.239
I was born in Den Bosch,

00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:05.600
where the painter Hieronymus Bosch
named himself after.

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:08.047
And I've always been very fond
of this painter

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.556
who lived and worked in the 15th century.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.276
And what is interesting about him
in relation to morality

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.355
is that he lived at a time
where religion's influence was waning,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.196
and he was sort of wondering, I think,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.810
what would happen with society
if there was no religion

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:22.294
or if there was less religion.

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:25.772
And so he painted this famous painting,
"The Garden of Earthly Delights,"

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:29.655
which some have interpreted
as being humanity before the Fall,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.917
or being humanity without any Fall at all.

00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:34.229
And so it makes you wonder,

00:00:34.253 --> 00:00:37.752
what would happen if we hadn't tasted
the fruit of knowledge, so to speak,

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:39.976
and what kind of morality would we have.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.299
Much later, as a student,
I went to a very different garden,

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:48.991
a zoological garden in Arnhem
where we keep chimpanzees.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:52.141
This is me at an early age
with a baby chimpanzee.

00:00:52.165 --> 00:00:54.850
(Laughter)

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:56.593
And I discovered there

00:00:56.617 --> 00:00:59.873
that the chimpanzees are very power-hungry
and wrote a book about it.

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:02.424
And at that time the focus
in a lot of animal research

00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:04.875
was on aggression and competition.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.156
I painted a whole picture
of the animal kingdom

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.378
and humanity included, was that deep down
we are competitors, we are aggressive,

00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:15.455
we are all out
for our own profit, basically.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.351
This is the launch of my book.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:19.759
I'm not sure how well
the chimpanzees read it,

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:22.454
but they surely seemed
interested in the book.

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:24.683
(Laughter)

00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:27.618
Now in the process of doing all this work

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:30.542
on power and dominance
and aggression and so on,

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.749
I discovered that chimpanzees
reconcile after fights.

00:01:33.773 --> 00:01:36.559
And so what you see here
is two males who have had a fight.

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:39.927
They ended up in a tree, and one of them
holds out a hand to the other.

00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:42.021
And about a second
after I took the picture,

00:01:42.045 --> 00:01:44.106
they came together in the fork of the tree

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.846
and kissed and embraced each other.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.214
And this is very interesting

00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:50.535
because at the time, everything
was about competition and aggression,

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:52.053
so it wouldn't make any sense.

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:54.713
The only thing that matters
is that you win or you lose.

00:01:54.737 --> 00:01:57.674
But why reconcile after a fight?
That doesn't make any sense.

00:01:57.698 --> 00:02:00.696
This is the way bonobos do it.
Bonobos do everything with sex.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.534
And so they also reconcile with sex.

00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:04.484
But the principle is exactly the same.

00:02:04.508 --> 00:02:08.483
The principle is that you have
a valuable relationship

00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:12.597
that is damaged by conflict,
so you need to do something about it.

00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:16.988
So my whole picture of the animal kingdom,
and including humans also,

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.591
started to change at that time.

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:22.954
So we have this image in political
science, economics, the humanities,

00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:26.836
the philosophy for that matter,
that man is a wolf to man.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.544
And so deep down,
our nature is actually nasty.

00:02:29.973 --> 00:02:32.891
I think it's a very unfair
image for the wolf.

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:36.361
The wolf is, after all,
a very cooperative animal.

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:38.639
And that's why many of you
have a dog at home,

00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:40.882
which has all these characteristics also.

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:42.701
And it's really unfair to humanity,

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.976
because humanity is actually
much more cooperative and empathic

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.187
than given credit for.

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:50.471
So I started getting
interested in those issues

00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:52.280
and studying that in other animals.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.684
So these are the pillars of morality.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:58.260
If you ask anyone,
"What is morality based on?"

00:02:58.284 --> 00:03:00.479
these are the two factors
that always come out.

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:02.210
One is reciprocity,

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:05.789
and associated with it is a sense
of justice and a sense of fairness.

00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:08.006
And the other one is empathy
and compassion.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.281
And human morality is more than this,
but if you would remove these two pillars,

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.434
there would be not much
remaining, I think.

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:16.113
So they're absolutely essential.

00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:18.005
So let me give you a few examples here.

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.729
This is a very old video
from the Yerkes Primate Center,

00:03:20.753 --> 00:03:23.076
where they trained
chimpanzees to cooperate.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.191
So this is already
about a hundred years ago

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:29.307
that we were doing
experiments on cooperation.

00:03:29.331 --> 00:03:32.863
What you have here is two
young chimpanzees who have a box,

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:35.892
and the box is too heavy
for one chimp to pull in.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.775
And of course, there's food on the box.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.800
Otherwise they wouldn't
be pulling so hard.

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:41.937
And so they're bringing in the box.

00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:44.230
And you can see that they're synchronized.

00:03:44.254 --> 00:03:47.354
You can see that they work together,
they pull at the same moment.

00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:49.891
It's already a big advance
over many other animals

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:51.553
who wouldn't be able to do that.

00:03:51.577 --> 00:03:53.963
Now you're going to get
a more interesting picture,

00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:56.613
because now one
of the two chimps has been fed.

00:03:56.637 --> 00:04:00.063
So one of the two is not really interested
in the task anymore.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.908
(Laughter)

00:04:08.763 --> 00:04:13.573
(Laughter)

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:22.730
(Laughter)

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.082
[- and sometimes appears to convey
its wishes and meanings by gestures.]

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.170
Now look at what happens
at the very end of this.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.924
(Laughter)

00:04:52.507 --> 00:04:54.396
He takes basically everything.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.396
(Laughter)

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.436
There are two interesting
parts about this.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.102
One is that the chimp on the right

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:03.418
has a full understanding
he needs the partner --

00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:05.877
so a full understanding
of the need for cooperation.

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:08.390
The second one is that the partner
is willing to work

00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:10.536
even though he's not
interested in the food.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.763
Why would that be?

00:05:11.787 --> 00:05:13.978
Well, that probably
has to do with reciprocity.

00:05:14.002 --> 00:05:17.006
There's actually a lot of evidence
in primates and other animals

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.552
that they return favors.

00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:21.264
He will get a return favor
at some point in the future.

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:23.163
And so that's how this all operates.

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:25.935
We do the same task with elephants.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:29.113
Now, it's very dangerous
to work with elephants.

00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:32.294
Another problem with elephants
is that you cannot make an apparatus

00:05:32.318 --> 00:05:34.235
that is too heavy for a single elephant.

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:35.976
Now you can probably make it,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.761
but it's going to be a pretty
clumsy apparatus, I think.

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:40.427
And so what we did in that case --

00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.113
we do these studies in Thailand
for Josh Plotnik --

00:05:43.137 --> 00:05:47.070
is we have an apparatus around which
there is a rope, a single rope.

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:50.857
And if you pull on this side of the rope,
the rope disappears on the other side.

00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:54.268
So two elephants need to pick it up
at exactly the same time, and pull.

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:57.339
Otherwise nothing is going to happen
and the rope disappears.

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:59.571
The first tape you're going to see

00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:03.584
is two elephants who are released together
arrive at the apparatus.

00:06:03.608 --> 00:06:06.408
The apparatus is on the left,
with food on it.

00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:09.858
And so they come together,
they arrive together,

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:12.175
they pick it up together,
and they pull together.

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.515
So it's actually fairly simple for them.

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:17.435
There they are.

00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:26.764
So that's how they bring it in.

00:06:26.788 --> 00:06:28.945
But now we're going to make it
more difficult.

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:30.789
Because the purpose of this experiment

00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:33.005
is to see how well
they understand cooperation.

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.867
Do they understand that as well
as the chimps, for example?

00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:39.369
What we do in the next step is we release
one elephant before the other

00:06:39.393 --> 00:06:41.404
and that elephant needs to be smart enough

00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:43.900
to stay there and wait
and not pull at the rope --

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:47.405
because if he pulls at the rope,
it disappears and the whole test is over.

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:50.699
Now this elephant does something illegal
that we did not teach it.

00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:52.889
But it shows the understanding he has,

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:55.437
because he puts his big foot on the rope,

00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:57.779
stands on the rope
and waits there for the other,

00:06:57.803 --> 00:07:00.386
and then the other is going
to do all the work for him.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.976
So it's what we call freeloading.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.015
(Laughter)

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:08.855
But it shows the intelligence
that the elephants have.

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.452
They developed several
of these alternative techniques

00:07:11.476 --> 00:07:13.434
that we did not approve of, necessarily.

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:14.681
(Laughter)

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:16.688
So the other elephant is now coming ...

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:21.205
and is going to pull it in.

00:07:39.338 --> 00:07:42.456
Now look at the other;
it doesn't forget to eat, of course.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.742
(Laughter)

00:07:45.677 --> 00:07:47.894
This was the cooperation
and reciprocity part.

00:07:47.918 --> 00:07:49.137
Now something on empathy.

00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:51.665
Empathy is my main topic
at the moment, of research.

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:53.137
And empathy has two qualities:

00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:55.180
One is the understanding part of it.

00:07:55.204 --> 00:07:56.835
This is just a regular definition:

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:59.671
the ability to understand and share
the feelings of another.

00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:00.904
And the emotional part.

00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:04.339
Empathy has basically two channels:
One is the body channel,

00:08:04.363 --> 00:08:06.221
If you talk with a sad person,

00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:09.498
you're going to adopt
a sad expression and a sad posture,

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.284
and before you know it, you feel sad.

00:08:11.308 --> 00:08:15.526
And that's sort of the body channel
of emotional empathy,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.829
which many animals have.

00:08:16.853 --> 00:08:18.408
Your average dog has that also.

00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:20.432
That's why people keep mammals in the home

00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:22.763
and not turtles or snakes
or something like that,

00:08:22.787 --> 00:08:24.576
who don't have that kind of empathy.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.372
And then there's a cognitive channel,

00:08:26.396 --> 00:08:29.460
which is more that you can take
the perspective of somebody else.

00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:30.642
And that's more limited.

00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:34.912
Very few animals, I think elephants
and apes, can do that kind of thing.

00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:37.873
So synchronization,

00:08:37.897 --> 00:08:40.040
which is part of that whole
empathy mechanism,

00:08:40.064 --> 00:08:42.319
is a very old one in the animal kingdom.

00:08:42.343 --> 00:08:45.584
In humans, of course,
we can study that with yawn contagion.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.426
Humans yawn when others yawn.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.233
And it's related to empathy.

00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:51.392
It activates the same areas in the brain.

00:08:51.416 --> 00:08:54.137
Also, we know that people
who have a lot of yawn contagion

00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:55.314
are highly empathic.

00:08:55.338 --> 00:08:58.513
People who have problems with empathy,
such as autistic children,

00:08:58.537 --> 00:09:00.029
they don't have yawn contagion.

00:09:00.053 --> 00:09:01.208
So it is connected.

00:09:01.232 --> 00:09:04.955
And we study that in our chimpanzees
by presenting them with an animated head.

00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:08.970
So that's what you see on the upper-left,
an animated head that yawns.

00:09:08.994 --> 00:09:10.614
And there's a chimpanzee watching,

00:09:10.638 --> 00:09:13.080
an actual real chimpanzee
watching a computer screen

00:09:13.104 --> 00:09:15.052
on which we play these animations.

00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:23.012
(Laughter)

00:09:23.036 --> 00:09:25.975
So yawn contagion
that you're probably all familiar with --

00:09:26.436 --> 00:09:29.115
and maybe you're going
to start yawning soon now --

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:32.355
is something that we share
with other animals.

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:35.380
And that's related to that whole
body channel of synchronization

00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:37.124
that underlies empathy,

00:09:37.148 --> 00:09:40.251
and that is universal
in the mammals, basically.

00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:43.386
We also study more complex expressions --
This is consolation.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.510
This is a male chimpanzee
who has lost a fight and he's screaming,

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:49.245
and a juvenile comes over
and puts an arm around him

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:50.434
and calms him down.

00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:51.632
That's consolation.

00:09:51.656 --> 00:09:53.520
It's very similar to human consolation.

00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:55.703
And consolation behavior --

00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:56.877
(Laughter)

00:09:56.901 --> 00:09:58.586
it's empathy driven.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.427
Actually, the way to study
empathy in human children

00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:04.025
is to instruct a family member
to act distressed,

00:10:04.049 --> 00:10:06.012
and then to see what young children do.

00:10:06.036 --> 00:10:08.050
And so it is related to empathy,

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:10.307
and that's the kind
of expressions we look at.

00:10:10.331 --> 00:10:13.429
We also recently published an experiment
you may have heard about.

00:10:13.453 --> 00:10:15.436
It's on altruism and chimpanzees,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.876
where the question is: Do chimpanzees care
about the welfare of somebody else?

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.351
And for decades it had been assumed
that only humans can do that,

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:27.634
that only humans worry
about the welfare of somebody else.

00:10:27.658 --> 00:10:30.095
Now we did a very simple experiment.

00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:32.746
We do that on chimpanzees
that live in Lawrenceville,

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.512
in the field station of Yerkes.

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:35.873
And so that's how they live.

00:10:35.897 --> 00:10:39.107
And we call them into a room
and do experiments with them.

00:10:39.131 --> 00:10:41.468
In this case, we put
two chimpanzees side-by-side,

00:10:41.492 --> 00:10:45.069
and one has a bucket full of tokens,
and the tokens have different meanings.

00:10:45.093 --> 00:10:47.666
One kind of token feeds
only the partner who chooses,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.515
the other one feeds both of them.

00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:51.884
So this is a study we did
with Vicki Horner.

00:10:53.556 --> 00:10:55.825
And here, you have the two color tokens.

00:10:55.849 --> 00:10:57.808
So they have a whole bucket full of them.

00:10:57.832 --> 00:11:00.605
And they have to pick
one of the two colors.

00:11:01.153 --> 00:11:02.613
You will see how that goes.

00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:06.269
So if this chimp makes the selfish choice,

00:11:07.173 --> 00:11:09.834
which is the red token in this case,

00:11:09.858 --> 00:11:11.488
he needs to give it to us,

00:11:11.512 --> 00:11:14.849
we pick it up, we put it on a table
where there's two food rewards,

00:11:14.873 --> 00:11:17.408
but in this case, only the one
on the right gets food.

00:11:17.432 --> 00:11:20.213
The one on the left walks away
because she knows already

00:11:20.237 --> 00:11:22.307
that this is not a good test for her.

00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:25.016
Then the next one is the pro-social token.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.384
So the one who makes the choices --
that's the interesting part here --

00:11:28.408 --> 00:11:31.228
for the one who makes the choices,
it doesn't really matter.

00:11:31.252 --> 00:11:34.225
So she gives us now a pro-social
token and both chimps get fed.

00:11:34.249 --> 00:11:36.976
So the one who makes the choices
always gets a reward.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.578
So it doesn't matter whatsoever.

00:11:38.602 --> 00:11:41.096
And she should actually
be choosing blindly.

00:11:41.922 --> 00:11:45.281
But what we find is that they prefer
the pro-social token.

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:48.299
So this is the 50 percent line,
that's the random expectation.

00:11:48.323 --> 00:11:52.272
And especially if the partner draws
attention to itself, they choose more.

00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:54.304
And if the partner
puts pressure on them --

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:57.467
so if the partner starts spitting water
and intimidating them --

00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:59.019
then the choices go down.

00:11:59.043 --> 00:12:00.082
(Laughter)

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:01.976
It's as if they're saying,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.987
"If you're not behaving,
I'm not going to be pro-social today."

00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:07.015
And this is what happens
without a partner,

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:08.853
when there's no partner sitting there.

00:12:08.877 --> 00:12:12.696
So we found that the chimpanzees do care
about the well-being of somebody else --

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.543
especially, these are other members
of their own group.

00:12:16.175 --> 00:12:18.944
So the final experiment
that I want to mention to you

00:12:18.968 --> 00:12:20.615
is our fairness study.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.529
And so this became a very famous study.

00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:24.976
And there are now many more,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.143
because after we did this
about 10 years ago,

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:28.976
it became very well-known.

00:12:29.524 --> 00:12:31.817
And we did that originally
with Capuchin monkeys.

00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:34.631
And I'm going to show you
the first experiment that we did.

00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:37.467
It has now been done
with dogs and with birds

00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:38.976
and with chimpanzees.

00:12:39.545 --> 00:12:42.976
But with Sarah Brosnan,
we started out with Capuchin monkeys.

00:12:44.318 --> 00:12:47.523
So what we did is we put
two Capuchin monkeys side-by-side.

00:12:47.547 --> 00:12:50.376
Again, these animals, live in a group,
they know each other.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.154
We take them out of the group,
put them in a test chamber.

00:12:53.795 --> 00:12:56.341
And there's a very simple task
that they need to do.

00:12:56.365 --> 00:12:59.745
And if you give both of them
cucumber for the task,

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:01.199
the two monkeys side-by-side,

00:13:01.223 --> 00:13:04.053
they're perfectly willing
to do this 25 times in a row.

00:13:04.077 --> 00:13:07.524
So cucumber, even though
it's only really water in my opinion,

00:13:07.548 --> 00:13:10.786
but cucumber is perfectly fine for them.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.093
Now if you give the partner grapes --

00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:15.264
the food preferences
of my Capuchin monkeys

00:13:15.288 --> 00:13:18.328
correspond exactly with the prices
in the supermarket --

00:13:18.352 --> 00:13:21.757
and so if you give them grapes --
it's a far better food --

00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:23.984
then you create inequity between them.

00:13:24.702 --> 00:13:26.548
So that's the experiment we did.

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:28.653
Recently, we videotaped it
with new monkeys

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:30.014
who'd never done the task,

00:13:30.038 --> 00:13:32.670
thinking that maybe they would have
a stronger reaction,

00:13:32.694 --> 00:13:34.233
and that turned out to be right.

00:13:34.257 --> 00:13:36.753
The one on the left is the monkey
who gets cucumber.

00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:39.036
The one on the right
is the one who gets grapes.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.407
The one who gets cucumber --

00:13:40.431 --> 00:13:43.141
note that the first piece
of cucumber is perfectly fine.

00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:44.976
The first piece she eats.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.605
Then she sees the other one getting grape,
and you will see what happens.

00:13:49.294 --> 00:13:51.873
So she gives a rock to us.
That's the task.

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:54.955
And we give her a piece
of cucumber and she eats it.

00:13:54.979 --> 00:13:56.976
The other one needs to give a rock to us.

00:13:58.188 --> 00:13:59.976
And that's what she does.

00:14:00.587 --> 00:14:02.199
And she gets a grape ...

00:14:03.579 --> 00:14:04.742
and eats it.

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:05.961
The other one sees that.

00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:07.301
She gives a rock to us now,

00:14:07.325 --> 00:14:08.897
gets, again, cucumber.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:19.360
(Laughter)

00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:27.742
(Laughter ends)

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:30.741
She tests a rock now against the wall.

00:14:30.765 --> 00:14:32.121
She needs to give it to us.

00:14:32.984 --> 00:14:35.000
And she gets cucumber again.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:43.799
(Laughter)

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:47.580
So this is basically
the Wall Street protest that you see here.

00:14:47.604 --> 00:14:49.976
(Laughter)

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.253
(Applause)

00:14:54.277 --> 00:14:56.063
I still have two minutes left --

00:14:56.087 --> 00:14:58.050
let me tell you a funny story about this.

00:14:58.261 --> 00:15:01.871
This study became very famous
and we got a lot of comments,

00:15:01.895 --> 00:15:05.501
especially anthropologists,
economists, philosophers.

00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:06.933
They didn't like this at all.

00:15:06.957 --> 00:15:09.519
Because they had decided
in their minds, I believe,

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:13.609
that fairness is a very complex issue,
and that animals cannot have it.

00:15:14.212 --> 00:15:16.675
And so one philosopher even wrote us

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:19.473
that it was impossible that monkeys
had a sense of fairness

00:15:19.497 --> 00:15:22.278
because fairness was invented
during the French Revolution.

00:15:22.302 --> 00:15:24.719
(Laughter)

00:15:24.743 --> 00:15:27.425
And another one wrote a whole chapter

00:15:27.449 --> 00:15:30.976
saying that he would believe
it had something to do with fairness,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.397
if the one who got grapes
would refuse the grapes.

00:15:33.421 --> 00:15:37.293
Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan,
who's been doing this with chimpanzees,

00:15:37.317 --> 00:15:39.463
had a couple of combinations
of chimpanzees

00:15:39.487 --> 00:15:41.843
where, indeed, the one
who would get the grape

00:15:41.867 --> 00:15:44.773
would refuse the grape
until the other guy also got a grape.

00:15:44.797 --> 00:15:47.564
So we're getting very close
to the human sense of fairness.

00:15:47.588 --> 00:15:51.024
And I think philosophers need
to rethink their philosophy for a while.

00:15:51.658 --> 00:15:52.976
So let me summarize.

00:15:53.592 --> 00:15:55.404
I believe there's an evolved morality.

00:15:55.428 --> 00:15:58.647
I think morality is much more
than what I've been talking about,

00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:01.122
but it would be impossible
without these ingredients

00:16:01.146 --> 00:16:02.644
that we find in other primates,

00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:04.505
which are empathy and consolation,

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:08.235
pro-social tendencies and reciprocity
and a sense of fairness.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.316
And so we work on these particular issues

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.685
to see if we can create a morality
from the bottom up, so to speak,

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:16.142
without necessarily
god and religion involved,

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:18.632
and to see how we can get
to an evolved morality.

00:16:19.066 --> 00:16:20.806
And I thank you for your attention.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:27.830
(Applause)
