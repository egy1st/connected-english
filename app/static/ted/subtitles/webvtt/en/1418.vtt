00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.855
Today, I'd like to talk with you

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.176
about something that should be
a totally uncontroversial topic.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.120
But, unfortunately,
it's become incredibly controversial.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.772
This year, if you think about it,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.920
over a billion couples
will have sex with one another.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.840
Couples like this one,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.400
and this one,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.416
and this one,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.640
and, yes,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.296
even this one.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.216
(Laughter)

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.800
And my idea is this --

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.176
all these men and women
should be free to decide

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.880
whether they do or do not
want to conceive a child.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.136
And they should be able to use
one of these birth control methods

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.440
to act on their decision.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.896
Now, I think you'd have a hard time

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.280
finding many people
who disagree with this idea.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.240
Over one billion people use birth control
without any hesitation at all.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.960
They want the power
to plan their own lives

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.640
and to raise healthier, better educated
and more prosperous families.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.560
But, for an idea that is
so broadly accepted in private,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.720
birth control certainly generates
a lot of opposition in public.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.936
Some people think
when we talk about contraception

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.480
that it's code for abortion,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.240
which it's not.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.096
Some people -- let's be honest --

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.400
they're uncomfortable with the topic
because it's about sex.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.056
Some people worry

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.440
that the real goal of family planning
is to control populations.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.536
These are all side issues

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.336
that have attached themselves
to this core idea that men and women

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.080
should be able to decide
when they want to have a child.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.816
And as a result, birth control has
almost completely and totally disappeared

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.440
from the global health agenda.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.496
The victims of this paralysis
are the people of sub-Saharan Africa

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.720
and South Asia.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.416
Here in Germany, the proportion of people
that use contraception

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.176
is about 66 percent.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320
That's about what you'd expect.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.360
In El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.440
Thailand, 64 percent.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.776
But let's compare that to other places,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.496
like Uttar Pradesh,
one of the largest states in India.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.296
In fact, if Uttar Pradesh
was its own country,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.800
it would be the fifth largest
country in the world.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.360
Their contraception rate -- 29 percent.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.840
Nigeria, the most populous
country in Africa, 10 percent.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.040
Chad, 2 percent.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.776
Let's just take one country
in Africa, Senegal.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.856
Their rate is about 12 percent.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.680
But why is it so low?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.880
One reason is that the most popular
contraceptives are rarely available.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.456
Women in Africa will tell you
over and over again

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.576
that what they prefer today
is an injectable.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.616
They get it in their arm --
and they go about four times a year,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.696
they have to get it every three months --
to get their injection.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.000
The reason women like it so much in Africa
is they can hide it from their husbands,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.600
who sometimes want a lot of children.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.776
The problem is every other time
a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.560
that injection is stocked out.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.800
It's stocked out 150 days out of the year.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.256
So can you imagine the situation --

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.176
she walks all this way
to go get her injection.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.376
She leaves her field,
sometimes leaves her children,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.856
and it's not there.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.642
And she doesn't know
when it's going to be available again.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.320
This is the same story
across the continent of Africa today.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.495
And so what we've created as a world
has become a life-and-death crisis.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.200
There are 100,000 women [per year]
who say they don't want to be pregnant

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.440
and they die in childbirth --
100,000 women a year.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.496
There are another 600,000 women [per year]

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.336
who say they didn't want to be pregnant
in the first place,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.456
and they give birth to a baby

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.680
and her baby dies
in that first month of life.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.760
I know everyone wants to save
these mothers and these children.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.616
But somewhere along the way,
we got confused by our own conversation.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.680
And we stopped trying to save these lives.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.000
So if we're going to make
progress on this issue,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.160
we have to be really clear
about what our agenda is.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.216
We're not talking about abortion.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.080
We're not talking
about population control.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.136
What I'm talking about is giving women
the power to save their lives,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.256
to save their children's lives

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.560
and to give their families
the best possible future.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.936
Now, as a world,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.216
there are lots of things we have to do
in the global health community

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.669
if we want to make the world
better in the future --

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.136
things like fight diseases.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.696
So many children today die of diarrhea,
as you heard earlier, and pneumonia.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.336
They kill literally
millions of children a year.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.456
We also need to help small farmers --

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.400
farmers who plow
small plots of land in Africa --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.896
so that they can grow enough food
to feed their children.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.240
And we have to make sure that
children are educated around the world.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.336
But one of the simplest
and most transformative things we can do

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.216
is to give everybody access
to birth control methods

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.696
that almost all Germans have access to
and all Americans, at some point,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.880
they use these tools during their life.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.096
And I think as long as we're really clear
about what our agenda is,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.736
there's a global movement
waiting to happen

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.640
and ready to get behind
this totally uncontroversial idea.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.776
When I grew up,
I grew up in a Catholic home.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.640
I still consider myself
a practicing Catholic.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.376
My mom's great-uncle was a Jesuit priest.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.816
My great-aunt was a Dominican nun.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.576
She was a schoolteacher
and a principal her entire life.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.080
In fact, she's the one who taught me
as a young girl how to read.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.440
I was very close to her.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.496
And I went to Catholic schools
for my entire childhood

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.760
until I left home to go to university.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.560
In my high school, Ursuline Academy,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.920
the nuns made service and social justice
a high priority in the school.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.416
Today, in the [Gates] Foundation's work,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.600
I believe I'm applying the lessons
that I learned in high school.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.016
So, in the tradition of Catholic scholars,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.160
the nuns also taught us
to question received teachings.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.456
And one of the teachings that we girls
and my peers questioned

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.040
was is birth control really a sin?

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.136
Because I think one of the reasons

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.496
we have this huge discomfort
talking about contraception

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.496
is this lingering concern

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.840
that if we separate sex from reproduction,
we're going to promote promiscuity.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.816
And I think that's a reasonable question
to be asked about contraception --

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.640
what is its impact on sexual morality?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.496
But, like most women,

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.240
my decision about birth control
had nothing to do with promiscuity.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.296
I had a plan for my future.
I wanted to go to college.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.656
I studied really hard in college,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.416
and I was proud to be one of the very few
female computer science graduates

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.720
at my university.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.616
I wanted to have a career,
so I went on to business school

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.120
and I became one of the youngest
female executives at Microsoft.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.135
I still remember, though,
when I left my parents' home

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.640
to move across the country
to start this new job at Microsoft.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.360
They had sacrificed a lot
to give me five years of higher education.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.696
But they said, as I left home --

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.056
and I literally went down the front steps,
down the porch at home --

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.296
and they said,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.720
"Even though you've had
this great education,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.920
if you decide to get married
and have kids right away,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.240
that's OK by us, too."

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.336
They wanted me to do the thing
that would make me the very happiest.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.296
I was free to decide what that would be.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.480
It was an amazing feeling.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.576
In fact, I did want to have kids --

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.840
but I wanted to have them
when I was ready.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.080
And so now, Bill and I have three.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.200
And when our eldest daughter was born,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.656
we weren't, I would say,
exactly sure how to be great parents.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.640
Maybe some of you know that feeling.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.320
And so we waited a little while
before we had our second child.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.696
And it's no accident
that we have three children

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.960
that are spaced three years apart.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.480
Now, as a mother, what do I want
the very most for my children?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.720
I want them to feel the way I did --

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.200
like they can do anything
they want to do in life.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.656
And so, what has struck me

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.680
as I've travelled the last decade
for the foundation around the world

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.240
is that all women want that same thing.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.456
Last year, I was in Nairobi, in the slums,
in one called Korogocho --

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.040
which literally means when translated,
"standing shoulder to shoulder."

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.896
And I spoke with this women's group
that's pictured here.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.056
And the women talked very openly
about their family life in the slums,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.496
what it was like.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.120
And they talked quite intimately
about what they did for birth control.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.056
Marianne, in the center of the screen
in the red sweater,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.816
she summed up that entire
two-hour conversation

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.160
in a phrase that I will never forget.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:47.600
She said, "I want to bring
every good thing to this child

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.920
before I have another."

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.176
And I thought -- that's it.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.840
That's universal.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.840
We all want to bring
every good thing to our children.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.280
But what's not universal is our ability
to provide every good thing.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.656
So many women suffer
from domestic violence.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.736
And they can't even
broach the subject of contraception,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.600
even inside their own marriage.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.120
There are many women
who lack basic education.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.840
Even many of the women
who do have knowledge and do have power

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.096
don't have access to contraceptives.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.136
For 250 years, parents around the world

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.920
have been deciding
to have smaller families.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.136
This trend has been steady
for a quarter of a millennium,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.000
across cultures and across geographies,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.280
with the glaring exception
of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.376
The French started bringing down
their family size in the mid-1700s.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.320
And over the next 150 years,
this trend spread all across Europe.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.576
The surprising thing to me,
as I learned this history,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:11.416
was that it spread not along socioeconomic
lines but around cultural lines.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.296
People who spoke the same language
made that change as a group.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.896
They made the same choice
for their family,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.920
whether they were rich
or whether they were poor.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.616
The reason that trend
toward smaller families spread

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.840
was that this whole way
was driven by an idea --

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.336
the idea that couples
can exercise conscious control

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.280
over how many children they have.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.200
This is a very powerful idea.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.920
It means that parents have
the ability to affect the future,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.640
not just accept it as it is.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.016
In France, the average family size
went down every decade

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.760
for 150 years in a row
until it stabilized.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.760
It took so long back then because
the contraceptives weren't that good.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.696
In Germany, this transition started
in the 1880s, and it took just 50 years

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.360
for family size
to stabilize in this country.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.736
And in Asia and Latin America,
the transition started in the 1960s,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.880
and it happened much faster
because of modern contraception.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.976
I think, as we go through this history,
it's important to pause for a moment

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.056
and to remember why this has become
such a contentious issue.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.736
It's because some family planning programs

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.600
resorted to unfortunate incentives
and coercive policies.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:51.336
For instance, in the 1960s, India
adopted very specific numeric targets

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.640
and they paid women to accept
having an IUD placed in their bodies.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.576
Now, Indian women were
really smart in this situation.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.096
When they went to get an IUD inserted,
they got paid six rupees.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.320
And so what did they do?

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.976
They waited a few hours or a few days,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.200
and they went to another service provider
and had the IUD removed for one rupee.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.760
For decades in the United States,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.960
African-American women
were sterilized without their consent.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.096
The procedure was so common

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.640
it became known as
the Mississippi appendectomy --

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.200
a tragic chapter in my country's history.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.176
And as recently as the 1990s, in Peru,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.696
women from the Andes region
were given anesthesia

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.640
and they were sterilized
without their knowledge.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.816
The most startling thing about this

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.576
is that these coercive policies
weren't even needed.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.416
They were carried out in places

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.560
where parents already
wanted to lower their family size.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.416
Because in region after region,
again and again,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.360
parents have wanted
to have smaller families.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.376
There's no reason to believe

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.000
that African women
have innately different desires.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.200
Given the option,
they will have fewer children.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.576
The question is:

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.080
will we invest in helping
all women get what they want now?

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.576
Or, are we going to condemn them
to some century-long struggle,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.336
as if this was still revolutionary France

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.160
and the best method
was coitus interruptus?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.600
Empowering parents --
it doesn't need justification.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:47.416
But here's the thing -- our desire
to bring every good thing to our children

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.280
is a force for good throughout the world.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.120
It's what propels societies forward.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.536
In that same slum in Nairobi,
I met a young businesswoman,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.776
and she was making backpacks
out of her home.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.136
She and her young kids
would go to the local jeans factory

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.896
and collect scraps of denim.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.456
She'd create these backpacks
and resell them.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.861
And when I talked with her,
she had three children,

00:16:10.885 --> 00:16:12.461
and I asked her about her family.

00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:14.576
And she said she and her husband decided

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.616
that they wanted to stop
having children after their third one.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.296
And so when I asked her why,
she simply said,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.816
"Well, because I couldn't run
my business if I had another child."

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.079
And she explained the income
that she was getting out of her business

00:16:27.103 --> 00:16:30.823
afforded her to be able to give
an education to all three of her children.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.560
She was incredibly optimistic
about her family's future.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.696
This is the same mental calculus

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.896
that hundreds of millions
of men and women have gone through.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.720
And evidence proves
that they have it exactly right.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.216
They are able to give their children
more opportunities

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.520
by exercising control
over when they have them.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.576
In Bangladesh,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.536
there's a district called Matlab.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:07.296
It's where researchers have collected data
on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.856
In the global health community,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.576
we like to say it's one of the longest
pieces of research that's been running.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.776
We have so many great health statistics.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.336
In one of the studies, what did they do?

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.455
Half the villagers
were chosen to get contraceptives.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.656
They got education
and access to contraception.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.856
Twenty years later,
following those villages,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.896
what we learned is that they had a better
quality of life than their neighbors.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.616
The families were healthier.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.776
The women were less likely
to die in childbirth.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.816
Their children were less likely
to die in the first thirty days of life.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.136
The children were better nourished.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.176
The families were also wealthier.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.696
The adult women's wages were higher.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.240
Households had more assets --
things like livestock or land or savings.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.320
Finally, their sons and daughters
had more schooling.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.000
So when you multiply these types
of effects over millions of families,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.720
the product can be large-scale
economic development.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.616
People talk about the Asian
economic miracle of the 1980s --

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.696
but it wasn't really a miracle.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.256
One of the leading causes
of economic growth across that region

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.120
was this cultural trend
towards smaller families.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.496
Sweeping changes start
at the individual family level --

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.960
the family making a decision
about what's best for their children.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.776
When they make that change
and that decision,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.520
those become sweeping
regional and national trends.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.296
When families in sub-Saharan Africa
are given the opportunity

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.680
to make those decisions for themselves,

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.536
I think it will help spark
a virtuous cycle of development

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.320
in communities across the continent.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.856
We can help poor families
build a better future.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.576
We can insist that all people
have the opportunity

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.536
to learn about contraceptives

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.840
and have access
to the full variety of methods.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.896
I think the goal here is really clear:

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.800
universal access to birth control
that women want.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.656
And for that to happen, it means that
both rich and poor governments alike

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.200
must make contraception a total priority.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.736
We can do our part,
in this room and globally,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.016
by talking about the hundreds
of millions of families

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.936
that don't have access
to contraception today

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.680
and what it would do to change
their lives if they did have access.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.416
I think if Marianne
and the members of her women's group

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.736
can talk about this openly

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.160
and have this discussion
out amongst themselves and in public,

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.160
we can, too.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.240
And we need to start now.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:02.040
Because like Marianne, we all want
to bring every good thing to our children.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.440
And where is the controversy in that?

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.376
Thank you.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.136
(Applause)

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.400
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.336
I have some questions for Melinda.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.656
(Applause ends)

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.640
Thank you for your courage
and everything else.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.976
So, Melinda, in the last few years

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.720
I've heard a lot of smart people
say something to the effect of,

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.856
"We don't need to worry
about the population issue anymore.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.376
Family sizes are coming down
naturally all over the world.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.360
We're going to peak
at nine or 10 billion. And that's it."

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.936
Are they wrong?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.736
Melinda Gates: If you look
at the statistics across Africa,

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.976
they are wrong.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.056
And I think we need to look at it,
though, from a different lens.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.256
We need to look at it
from the ground upwards.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.536
I think that's one of the reasons
we got ourselves in so much trouble

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.256
on this issue of contraception.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.661
We looked at it from top down

00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:07.216
and said we want to have different
population numbers over time.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.536
Yes, we care about the planet.
Yes, we need to make the right choices.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.136
But the choices have to be made
at the family level.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.496
And it's only by giving people access
and letting them choose what to do

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.576
that you get those sweeping changes
that we have seen globally --

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.280
except for sub-Saharan Africa and those
places in South Asia and Afghanistan.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.016
CA: Some people on the right in America

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.440
and in many conservative cultures
around the world

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.176
might say something like this:

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.867
"It's all very well to talk about saving
lives and empowering women and so on.

00:21:40.891 --> 00:21:42.851
But, sex is sacred.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.016
What you're proposing
is going to increase the likelihood

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.256
that lots of sex happens outside marriage.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.720
And that is wrong."

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.656
What would you say to them?

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.936
MG: I would say
that sex is absolutely sacred.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.056
And it's sacred in Germany,
and it's sacred in the United States,

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.176
and it's sacred in France
and so many places around the world.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.096
And the fact that 98 percent of women
in my country who are sexually experienced

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.296
say they use birth control
doesn't make sex any less sacred.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.576
It just means that they're getting
to make choices about their lives.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.896
And I think in that choice,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.816
we're also honoring
the sacredness of the family

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.096
and the sacredness of the mother's life

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.376
and the childrens' lives
by saving their lives.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.680
To me, that's incredibly sacred, too.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.496
CA: So what is your foundation
doing to promote this issue?

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.536
And what could people here
and people listening on the web --

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.096
what would you like them to do?

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.263
MG: I would say this --
join the conversation.

00:22:41.287 --> 00:22:45.456
We've listed the website up here.
Join the conversation.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.296
Tell your story about how contraception
has either changed your life

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.336
or somebody's life that you know.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.741
And say that you're for this.

00:22:52.765 --> 00:22:55.480
We need a groundswell
of people saying, "This makes sense.

00:22:55.504 --> 00:22:58.896
We've got to give all women access --
no matter where they live."

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.016
And one of the things
that we're going to do

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.216
is do a large event July 11 in London,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.616
with a whole host of countries,
a whole host of African nations,

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.776
to all say we're putting this back
on the global health agenda.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.656
We're going to commit resources to it,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.816
and we're going to do planning
from the bottom up with governments

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.936
to make sure that women are educated --

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.416
so that if they
want the tool, they have it,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.536
and that they have
lots of options available

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.656
either through
their local healthcare worker

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.560
or their local community rural clinic.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.496
CA: Melinda, I'm guessing that some
of those nuns who taught you at school

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.160
are going to see
this TED Talk at some point.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.856
Are they going to be horrified,
or are they cheering you on?

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.976
MG: I know they're going
to see the TED Talk

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.136
because they know that I'm doing it
and I plan to send it to them.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.296
And, you know, the nuns who taught me
were incredibly progressive.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.216
I hope that they'll be very proud of me

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.176
for living out what they taught us
about social justice and service.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.096
I have come to feel
incredibly passionate about this issue

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.896
because of what I've seen
in the developing world.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.776
And for me, this topic
has become very close to heart

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.856
because you meet these women
and they are so often voiceless.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.216
And yet they shouldn't be --

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.776
they should have a voice,
they should have access.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.056
And so I hope they'll feel

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.896
that I'm living out
what I've learned from them

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.206
and from the decades of work
that I've already done at the foundation.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.576
CA: So, you and your team brought together
today an amazing group of speakers

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.160
to whom we're all grateful.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.496
Did you learn anything?

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.736
(Laughter)

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.576
MG: Oh my gosh, I learned so many things.
I have so many follow-up questions.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.856
And I think a lot
of this work is a journey.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.736
You heard the discussion
about the journey through energy,

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.096
or the journey through social design,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.040
or the journey in the coming and saying,

00:24:45.064 --> 00:24:47.216
"Why aren't there any women
on this platform?"

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.616
And I think for all of us who work
on these development issues,

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.416
you learn by talking to other people.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.296
You learn by doing.
You learn by trying and making mistakes.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.816
And it's the questions you ask.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.216
Sometimes it's the questions you ask
that helps lead to the answer

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.336
the next person
that can help you answer it.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.056
So I have lots of questions
for the panelists from today.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.136
And I thought it was just an amazing day.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.494
CA: Melinda, thank you for inviting
all of us on this journey with you.

00:25:10.518 --> 00:25:12.566
Thank you so much.
MG: Great. Thanks, Chris.
