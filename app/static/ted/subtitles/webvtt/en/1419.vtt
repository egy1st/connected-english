WEBVTT

00:00:00.986 --> 00:00:05.260
I'm a process engineer, I know all about
boilers and incinerators

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:08.408
and fabric filters, and cyclones,
and things like that.

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.998
But I also have Marfan syndrome.

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:12.897
This is an inherited disorder.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:17.092
And in 1992, I participated
in a genetic study,

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:20.204
and found to my horror,
as you can see from the slide,

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:24.351
that my ascending aorta
was not in the normal range,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.971
the green line at the bottom.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.878
Everyone in here will be between 3.2-3.6,

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:31.002
and I was already up at 4.4.

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:35.652
And as you can see,
my aorta dilated progressively,

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:40.247
and I got closer and closer to the point
where surgery was going to be necessary.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.553
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome.

00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:46.543
Anesthetize you, open your chest,

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.416
put you on an artificial
heart and lung machine,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.609
drop your body temperature
to about 18 centigrade,

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.297
stop your heart, cut the aorta out,

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.335
replace it with a plastic valve
and a plastic aorta.

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:04.080
And most importantly, commit you
to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy.

00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:05.354
Normally, warfarin.

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:08.570
The thought of the surgery
was not attractive.

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:12.511
The thought of the warfarin
was really quite frightening.

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:14.301
So I said to myself,

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:17.756
"I'm an engineer, I'm in R&amp;D,
this is just a plumbing problem."

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.786
"I can do this, I can change this."

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.883
So I set out to change the entire
treatment for aortic dilation.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.459
The project aim is really quite simple.

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:33.497
The only real problem
with the ascending aorta

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.082
in people with Marfan syndrome

00:01:35.106 --> 00:01:37.061
is that it lacks some tensile strength.

00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:43.591
So, the possibility exists
to simply externally wrap the pipe,

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:47.149
and it would remain stable
and operate quite happily.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:51.844
If your high-pressure hose pipe
or hydraulic line bulges a little,

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:55.368
you just wrap some tape around it,
it really is that simple.

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:58.192
In concept, though not in execution.

00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:02.328
The great advantage
of an external support, for me,

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:05.041
was that I could retain
all of my own bits,

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:07.357
all of my own endothelium and valves,

00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.181
and not need any anticoagulation therapy.

00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:13.023
So, where do we start?

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:16.027
This is a sagittal slice through me.

00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:20.569
In the middle, you can see
that little structure squeezing out,

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:22.080
that's the left ventricle,

00:02:22.104 --> 00:02:24.925
pushing blood out
through the aortic valve.

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.116
You can see two of the leaflets
of the aortic valve working there.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.986
Up into the ascending aorta.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.964
And it's that part, the ascending aorta,

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:38.674
which dilates and ultimately bursts,
which of course is fatal.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.480
We started by organizing image acquisition

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:47.564
from magnetic resonance
and CT imaging machines,

00:02:47.588 --> 00:02:52.037
from which to make a model
of the patient's aorta.

00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:56.220
This is a model of my aorta.

00:02:56.244 --> 00:02:58.087
I've got a real one in my pocket,

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.591
if anyone would like to look at it,
and play with it.

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:01.624
(Laughter)

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.713
You can see it's quite
a complex structure.

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.282
It has a funny tri-lobal shape
at the bottom,

00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:08.301
which contains the aortic valve.

00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:10.283
It then comes back into a round form,

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:12.406
and then tapers and curves off.

00:03:13.408 --> 00:03:16.450
It's quite a difficult structure
to produce.

00:03:17.752 --> 00:03:19.541
This is a sort of CAD model of me,

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.481
and this is one of the later CAD models.

00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:25.104
We went through an iterative process
of producing better and better models.

00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:28.656
When we produced that model,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.955
we turned it into a solid,
plastic model, as you can see,

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.919
using a rapid prototyping technique,
another engineering technique.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.776
We then used that former

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.447
to manufacture a perfectly bespoke
porous textile mesh,

00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:47.282
which takes the shape of the former
and perfectly fits the aorta.

00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:51.940
So this is absolutely personalized
medicine at its best, really.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:56.587
Every patient we do
has an absolutely bespoke implant.

00:03:57.497 --> 00:04:00.550
Once you've made it,
the installation is quite easy.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:04.792
John Pepper, bless his heart,
professor of cardiothoracic surgery.

00:04:05.894 --> 00:04:09.372
Never done it before in his life,
he put the first one in, didn't like it,

00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:10.763
he put the second one in.

00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:12.025
Happy, away I went.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.895
Four and a half hours on the table,
and everything was done.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.800
So the surgical implantation
was actually the easiest part.

00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:21.933
If you compare our new treatment
to the existing alternative,

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:23.724
the composite aortic root graft,

00:04:23.748 --> 00:04:26.103
there are one or two startling comparisons

00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:28.644
which I'm sure will be
clear to all of you.

00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:31.749
Two hours to install one of our devices,

00:04:31.773 --> 00:04:35.155
compared to 6 hours
for the existing treatment.

00:04:36.184 --> 00:04:39.665
As I said, the existing treatment
requires the heart-lung bypass machine,

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.481
and it requires a total body cooling.

00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:44.184
We don't need any of that.
We work on a beating heart.

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:45.499
He opens you up,

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:47.959
he accesses the aorta
while your heart is beating,

00:04:47.983 --> 00:04:49.445
all at the right temperature.

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.623
No breaking into your circulatory system.

00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:53.136
So it really is great.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.499
But for me, absolutely the best point is,

00:04:56.523 --> 00:04:59.387
there is no anticoagulation
therapy required.

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.102
I don't take any drugs at all,

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:03.863
other than recreational ones
that I would choose to take.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.240
(Laughter)

00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:08.496
And in fact, if you speak to people
who are on long-term warfarin,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.424
it is a serious compromise
to your quality of life,

00:05:11.448 --> 00:05:15.182
and even worse, it inevitably
foreshortens your life.

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:18.487
Likewise, if you have
the artificial valve option,

00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:20.321
you're committed to antibiotic therapy

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.412
whenever you have
any intrusive medical treatment,

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:26.369
even trips to the dentist
require that you take antibiotics,

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.774
in case you get an internal
infection on the valve.

00:05:29.252 --> 00:05:32.247
Again, I don't have any of that,
so I'm entirely free,

00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:33.612
my artery is fixed.

00:05:34.192 --> 00:05:38.335
I haven't got to worry about it,
which is a rebirth for me.

00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:43.323
Back to the theme of the presentation,
multidisciplinary research,

00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:46.474
how on earth does a process engineer
used to working with boilers

00:05:46.498 --> 00:05:50.475
end up producing a medical device
which transforms his own life?

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:53.023
Well, the answer to that is,
a multidisciplinary team.

00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:56.359
This is a list of the core team,

00:05:56.383 --> 00:06:01.606
and you can see there aren't only two
principal technical disciplines there,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.898
medicine and engineering,

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:07.024
but also, there are various specialists
from within those two disciplines.

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.930
John Pepper was the cardiac surgeon
who did all the actual work on me.

00:06:12.383 --> 00:06:15.703
But everyone else had to contribute
one way or another.

00:06:15.727 --> 00:06:17.537
Raad Mohiaddin, a medical radiologist.

00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.610
We had to get good-quality images
from which to make the CAD model.

00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:24.457
Warren Thornton, who still does
all our CAD models for us,

00:06:24.481 --> 00:06:27.465
had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:32.737
to produce this model from this
really rather difficult input data set.

00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:37.758
There are some barriers to this, though,
there are some problems.

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:39.035
Jargon is a big one.

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:44.621
I would think no one in this room
understands the first four jargon points.

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:48.091
The engineers amongst you will recognize
"rapid prototyping" and "CAD."

00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:51.449
The medics amongst you, if there are any,
will recognize the first two,

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:55.106
but there will be nobody else here
that understands all those four words.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.150
Taking the jargon out was very important

00:06:57.174 --> 00:07:01.331
to ensure that everyone in the team
understood exactly what was meant

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:03.000
when a particular phrase was used.

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.561
Our disciplinary conventions
were funny as well.

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:09.620
We took a lot of horizontal slice
images through me,

00:07:09.644 --> 00:07:13.144
produced those slices and used them
to build a CAD model.

00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:15.443
And the very first CAD model we made,

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:19.630
the surgeons were playing with it
and couldn't quite figure it out.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.095
And then we realized that it was actually
a mirror image of the real aorta.

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:27.576
And it was a mirror image
because in the real world,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.411
we always look down on plans,

00:07:29.435 --> 00:07:31.984
plans of houses, or streets, or maps.

00:07:32.008 --> 00:07:34.808
In the medical world,
they look up at plans.

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:38.224
So the horizontal images
were all in inversion.

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:41.406
So, one needs to be careful
with disciplinary conventions.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.555
Everyone needs to understand
what is assumed and what is not.

00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:50.332
Institutional barriers were
another serious headache in the project.

00:07:50.951 --> 00:07:53.040
The Brompton Hospital was taken over

00:07:53.064 --> 00:07:55.330
by the Imperial College
School of Medicine.

00:07:55.354 --> 00:07:58.997
And there are some seriously bad
relationship problems

00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:00.478
between the two organizations.

00:08:00.502 --> 00:08:02.812
I was working with the Imperial
and the Brompton,

00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:05.507
and this generated some serious
problems for the project.

00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:07.341
Really, problems that shouldn't exist.

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:09.986
Research &amp; Ethics Committee.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.010
If you want to do anything new in surgery,

00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:15.023
you have to get a license
from your local Research &amp; Ethics.

00:08:15.047 --> 00:08:16.872
I'm sure it's the same in Poland.

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:21.994
There will be some form of equivalent
which licenses new types of surgery.

00:08:22.348 --> 00:08:25.491
We didn't only have the bureaucratic
problems associated with that,

00:08:25.515 --> 00:08:27.602
we also had professional jealousies.

00:08:27.626 --> 00:08:30.055
There were people
on the Research &amp; Ethics committee

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.808
who really didn't want to see
John Pepper succeed again.

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:34.683
Because he is so successful.

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:36.845
And they made extra problems for us.

00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:40.390
Bureaucratic problems.

00:08:40.414 --> 00:08:43.068
Ultimately, when you have a new treatment,

00:08:43.092 --> 00:08:47.109
you have to have a guidance note
for all the hospitals in the country.

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:50.753
In the UK, we have the National Institute
and Clinical Excellence.

00:08:50.777 --> 00:08:52.777
You have an equivalent
in Poland, no doubt.

00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:56.086
And we had to get past the NICE problem.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.872
We now have a great clinical
guidance, out on the net.

00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:03.536
So any other hospitals interested
can come along, read the NICE report,

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.132
get in touch with us,
and then get doing it themselves.

00:09:08.766 --> 00:09:12.893
Funding barriers, another big area
to be concerned with.

00:09:15.164 --> 00:09:17.974
A big problem with understanding
one of those perspectives.

00:09:17.998 --> 00:09:22.261
When we first approached one of the big,
charitable UK organizations

00:09:22.285 --> 00:09:23.798
that fund this kind of stuff,

00:09:23.822 --> 00:09:26.227
we essentially gave them
an engineering proposal.

00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:29.047
They didn't understand it,
they were doctors, next to God,

00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:30.921
it must be rubbish, they binned it.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:34.181
So in the end, I went after
private investors, just gave up on it.

00:09:34.205 --> 00:09:37.435
Most R&amp;D is going to be
institutionally funded,

00:09:37.459 --> 00:09:39.819
by the Polish Academy of Sciences

00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:43.508
or the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council, or whatever.

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:45.342
And you need to get past those people.

00:09:45.749 --> 00:09:48.876
Jargon is a huge problem
when you try to work across disciplines,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.254
because in an engineering world,
we all understand CAD and RP.

00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:54.079
Not in the medical world.

00:09:54.749 --> 00:09:58.321
I suppose the funding bureaucrats
ultimately have to get their act together.

00:09:58.345 --> 00:10:00.697
They've really got to start
talking to each other,

00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.077
and exercise a bit of imagination,
if that's not too much to ask.

00:10:04.101 --> 00:10:05.312
(Laughter)

00:10:05.336 --> 00:10:07.225
Which it probably is.

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:08.564
(Laughter)

00:10:08.588 --> 00:10:10.948
I've coined the phrase
"obstructive conservatism."

00:10:10.972 --> 00:10:14.554
So many people in the medical world
don't want to change.

00:10:14.578 --> 00:10:18.094
Particularly when some jumped-up engineer
has come along with the answer.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.505
They don't want to change.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:21.958
They simply want to do
whatever they've done before.

00:10:21.982 --> 00:10:25.281
And in fact, many surgeons
in the UK are still waiting

00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:28.434
for one of our patients
to have some sort of an episode,

00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:31.113
so that they could say,
"Told you that was no good."

00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:33.373
We've actually got 30 patients.

00:10:33.397 --> 00:10:35.223
At seven and a half years,

00:10:35.247 --> 00:10:37.412
we've got 90 post-op
patient years between us,

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.212
and we haven't had a single problem.

00:10:39.236 --> 00:10:41.374
And still, there are people
in the UK saying,

00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:44.154
"That external aortic root,
it will never work, you know."

00:10:44.527 --> 00:10:46.932
It really is a problem.

00:10:46.956 --> 00:10:49.759
I'm sure everyone in this room
has come across arrogance

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:52.549
amongst medics, doctors,
surgeons, at some point.

00:10:53.575 --> 00:10:57.939
The middle point is simply the way
that the doctors protect themselves.

00:10:57.963 --> 00:11:00.314
"Well, of course,
I'm looking after my patient."

00:11:00.338 --> 00:11:03.850
I think it's not good, but that's my view.

00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:06.838
Egos, of course, again a huge problem.

00:11:06.862 --> 00:11:08.800
If you work in a multidisciplinary team,

00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:11.629
you've got to give your guys
the benefit of the doubt,

00:11:11.653 --> 00:11:13.529
you've got to express support for them.

00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:16.432
Tom Treasure, professor
of cardiothoracic surgery.

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.264
Incredible guy.

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:19.778
Dead easy to give him respect.

00:11:19.802 --> 00:11:22.567
Him giving me respect? Slightly different.

00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:23.614
(Laughter)

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:25.398
That's all the bad news.

00:11:25.422 --> 00:11:29.643
The good news is,
the benefits are stonkingly huge.

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:31.776
Translate that one! I bet they can't.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.444
(Laughter)

00:11:33.468 --> 00:11:36.707
When you have a group of people
with different professional training,

00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:38.632
a different professional experience,

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.805
they not only have a different
knowledge base,

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:43.050
but also a different perspective
on everything.

00:11:43.074 --> 00:11:44.775
And if you can bring them together,

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:47.611
and get them talking
and understanding each other,

00:11:47.635 --> 00:11:50.243
the results can be spectacular.

00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:55.358
You can find really novel solutions
that have never been looked at before,

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.104
very quickly and easily.

00:11:57.128 --> 00:12:00.397
You can short-cut huge amounts of work

00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:04.026
simply by using the extended
knowledge base you have.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.822
And as a result,
it's an entirely different use

00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:11.335
of the technology
and the knowledge around you.

00:12:11.908 --> 00:12:16.023
The result of all this is that you can get
incredibly quick progress

00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:18.147
on incredibly small budgets.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.413
I'm so embarrassed at how cheap
it was to get from my idea

00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:23.771
to me being implanted

00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:26.055
that I'm not prepared
to tell you what it cost,

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:30.344
because I suspect there are
absolutely standard surgical treatments,

00:12:30.368 --> 00:12:31.714
probably in the USA,

00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:36.530
which cost more for a one-off patient

00:12:36.554 --> 00:12:40.788
than the cost of us getting from
my dream to my reality.

00:12:41.455 --> 00:12:44.217
That's all I want to say,
and I've got three minutes left.

00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:45.696
So, Ewa's going to like me.

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:49.235
If you have any questions,
please come up and talk to me later on,

00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:51.368
it would be a pleasure to speak with you.

00:12:51.392 --> 00:12:52.400
Many thanks.

00:12:52.424 --> 00:12:53.424
(Applause)
