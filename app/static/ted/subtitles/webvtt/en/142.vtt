00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk to you today about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
hopefully converting fear into hope.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When we go to the physician today --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
there are words that we just don't want to hear.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are words that we're truly afraid of.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
heart failure, lung failure --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
things that we know are debilitating diseases,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
for which there's relatively little that can be done.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And what I want to lay out for you today is

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
why it's important,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
if you think it already hasn't,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and what some of the hurdles are.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I want to start with this slide,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This was an issue from 2002

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that everybody can understand.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to a clinically relevant timescale.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This is not regenerative medicine.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
with devices and drugs and the like --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and I'll come back to that theme a few times --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So that at the end of the treatment,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
very few good ideas are truly novel.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And this is just the same.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If you look back in history,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
was actually one of the first people

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to begin to think about, could you culture organs?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And they published this book in 1937,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
where they actually began to think about,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We've come a long way since then.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But before doing that, what I'd like to do

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
is share my depression about the health care system

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and the need for this with you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Many of the talks yesterday talked about

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to take care of our diseases as we get older.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This is simply the wealth of a country

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
versus the percent of population over the age of 65.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And you can basically see that the richer a country is,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the older the people are within it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Why is this important?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
If the average age of your population is 30,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
then the average kind of disease that you have to treat

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
maybe a little bit of asthma.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
now the average person is looking at diabetes,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
things that are inherently more difficult to treat,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and much more expensive to treat.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This is from "The Untied States of America."

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
How can you actually afford to treat patients

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
when the reality of getting old looks like this?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This is age versus cost of health care.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
plotted over your lifetime.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And you can actually --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
(Laughter)

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
-- we won't get into that.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
(Laughter)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
There are very few things, very few things that you can really do

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and experience what I would call healthy aging.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I'd suggest there are four things,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
All those things do is change who pays.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
You can prevent.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and then treating the disease to cure the disease

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
instead of treating a symptom.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
But eventually it stops working,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
perhaps even before it was symptomatic?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This is a newt re-growing its limb.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I'll actually show you some more important features

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
about limb regeneration in a moment.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is doing this in every organ system of the body,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
for tissues and for organs themselves.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So today's reality is that if we get sick,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the message is we will treat your symptoms,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and you need to adjust to a new way of life.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I would pose to you that tomorrow --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and when tomorrow is we could debate,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
but it's within the foreseeable future --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
There's a limb prosthetic up here,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
similar actually one on the soldier

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that's come back from Iraq.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
face the regeneration of that limb.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's a wild concept.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
How can we do that?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We need to learn to speak the body's language.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
will re-grow that limb.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It's a natural process,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
but it is lost as we age.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
In a child, before the age of about six months,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
if they lose their fingertip in an accident,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they'll re-grow their fingertip.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So to engage in that conversation with the body,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
we need to speak the body's language.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
through which to converse with the body.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The first is cellular therapies.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
using cells to do most of the work.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Therefore, if we can find the right cells

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Secondly, we can use materials.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
If we can invent materials, design materials,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or extract materials from a natural environment,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I'm going to show you an example of each of these,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and I'm going to start with materials.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
if you threw away all the cells,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
may contain all of the necessary factors and signals

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that would signal the body to heal itself.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And he asked a very important question.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
He asked the question,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
if I take that material, which is a natural material

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that usually induces healing in the small intestine,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and I place it somewhere else on a person's body,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
would it give a tissue-specific response,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
The picture I'm about to show you

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
is a compelling picture.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
(Laughter)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish --

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
(Laughter)

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is the reality of diabetes.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
which is amputation, if you can't heal it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The treatment for this is amputation.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
That material contained only natural signals.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that it didn't have before.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you --

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I'll let you know when you can look again.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
The horse just has another nostril that's developed

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
because of a riding accident.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Just a few weeks after treatment --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and the horse heals up.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
There are now 400,000 patients around the world

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
who have used that material to heal their wounds.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Could you regenerate a limb?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
to begin the process of asking that question.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
After treatment that's what it looks like.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
This is happening today.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
This is clinically relevant today.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
But could you go a little further?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Could you, say, instead of using material,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
can I take some cells along with the material,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and remove a damaged piece of tissue,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
put a bio-degradable material on there?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
He chills the dish, it changes its properties

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and he peels it right out of the dish.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It's the coolest stuff.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And what I'm going to show you here

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But this one's kind of cool.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
with a difference.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
you're going to see the stem cells from the patient

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that were removed at the beginning of the procedure

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
being injected directly into the heart of the patient.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And I'm standing up here because at one point

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And if you look really carefully,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it's going to be right around this point

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
you'll actually see a back-flush.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
You see the cells coming back out.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to get the cells to the right place at the right time.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
This was a randomized trial.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
These are now two years out.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
There go the cells.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We don't have time to go into all of those details,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
but basically, that works too.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
You can take patients who are less sick,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
through that kind of therapy.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
but I think very soon will be.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
along with a number of colleagues around the world.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
They've decided that liposuction fluid,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
(Laughter)

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It's a great source of stem cells.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Out comes the liposuction fluid,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
All done in the lab.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I talked before about the use of devices

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
to dramatically change the way we treat disease.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Here's just one example before I close up.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
This is equally tragic.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Many of those patients are very severely burned.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
it's that we don't know how to treat it.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Everything that is done to treat burn --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
basically we do a sodding approach.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We make something over here,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and we try and get the two to take.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed --

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR --

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
The gun that you see there sprays cells.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
That's going to spray cells over that area.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
deliver other things as well at the same time,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and therefore we will seed that lawn,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
as opposed to try the sodding approach.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It's a completely different way of doing it.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So my 18 minutes is up.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So let me finish up with some good news,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and maybe a little bit of bad news.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
The good news is that this is happening today.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
It's very powerful work.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Clearly the images kind of get that across.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
is involved in trying to get this to happen.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
A number of governments, and a number of regions,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
The Japanese government were perhaps the first,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
when they decided to invest first 3 billion,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
later another 2 billion in this field.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
It's no coincidence.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
They need this to work or their health system dies.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
The European Union, same thing.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
China, the same thing.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
(Laughter)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
We've had a different approach.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
But there's been no strategic investment

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
just a few months ago,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
at which these things get to patients.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And at the end of a very testy meeting,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
what the NIH director said was,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
"Your vision is larger than our appetite."

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
but together we can change his appetite.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Thank you.
