WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
If you had caught me straight out of college

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
in the halls of the Vermont State House

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
where I was a lobbyist in training

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and asked me what I was going to do with my life,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I would have told you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the Chinese equivalency exam,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I was going to go study law in Beijing,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
through top-down policy changes

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and judicial system reforms.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
(Laughter)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Applause)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I had a plan,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and I never ever thought

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it would have anything to do

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
with the banjo.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Little did I know

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
what a huge impact it would have on me one night

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
when I was at a party

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and I heard a sound coming out of a record player

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
in the corner of a room.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And it was Doc Watson

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
singing and playing "Shady Grove."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
♫ Shady Grove, my darlin' ♫

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
♫ Going back to Harlan ♫

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That sound was just so beautiful,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the sound of Doc's voice

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the rippling groove of the banjo.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And after being totally and completely obsessed

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
with the mammoth richness and history

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
of Chinese culture,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it was like this total relief

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to hear something so truly American

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and so truly awesome.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So before going to law school in China

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and I traveled down through Appalachia

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and I learned a bunch of old American songs,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and I ended up in Kentucky

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I was sitting in a hallway one night

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and a couple girls came up to me.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And they said, "Hey, do you want to jam?"

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And I was like, "Sure."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So I picked up my banjo

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And a record executive walked up to me

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Laughter)

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It's been eight years,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In fact, I went to Nashville.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And after a few months I was writing songs.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And the first song I wrote was in English,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and the second one was in Chinese.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
(Music)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
[Chinese]

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Outside your door the world is waiting.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Inside your heart a voice is calling.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The four corners of the world are watching,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
so travel daughter, travel.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Go get it, girl.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000
(Applause)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And I've played thousands of shows.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And I've collaborated

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
with so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And I see the power of music.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I see the power of music

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to connect cultures.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I see it when I stand on a stage

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and I bust out into a song in Chinese.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
[Chinese]

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And everybody's eyes just pop wide open

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
like it's going to fall out of their heads.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And they're like, "What's that girl doing?"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And then they come up to me after the show

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and they all have a story.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
They all come up and they're like,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and adopted a girl."

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's just incredible.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And then I go to China

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and I stand on a stage at a university

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and I bust out into a song in Chinese

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and everybody sings along

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and they roar with delight

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
at this girl

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
with the hair and the instrument,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and she's singing their music.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And I see, even more importantly,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
the power of music to connect hearts.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Like the time I was in Sichuan Province

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and I was singing for kids in relocation schools

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in the earthquake disaster zone.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And this little girl comes up to me.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
[Chinese]

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
"Big sister Wong,"

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Washburn, Wong, same difference.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
"Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
that my mom sang for me

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
before she was swallowed in the earthquake?"

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And I sat down,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
she sat on my lap.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
She started singing her song.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And the warmth of her body

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and I started to cry.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And the light that shone off of her eyes

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
was a place I could have stayed forever.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And in that moment, we weren't our American selves,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
we weren't our Chinese selves,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
we were just mortals

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
sitting together in that light that keeps us here.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I want to dwell in that light

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
with you and with everyone.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And I know U.S.-China relations

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
doesn't need another lawyer.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Thank you.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(Applause)
