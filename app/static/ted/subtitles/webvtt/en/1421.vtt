WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I got my start

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in writing and research

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
as a surgical trainee,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as someone who was a long ways away

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So the natural question you ask then at that point

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it became a question of,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how do we all get good

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
at what we're trying to do?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's hard enough to learn to get the skills,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
try to learn all the material you have to absorb

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
at any task you're taking on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I had to think about how I sew and how I cut,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but then also how I pick the right person

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to come to an operating room.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And then in the midst of all this

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
came this new context

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
for thinking about what it meant to be good.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In the last few years

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we realized we were in the deepest crisis

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of medicine's existence

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
due to something you don't normally think about

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
when you're a doctor

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
concerned with how you do good for people,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is the cost

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of health care.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There's not a country in the world

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that now is not asking

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
whether we can afford what doctors do.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The political fight that we've developed

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
has become one around

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
whether it's the government that's the problem

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or is it insurance companies that are the problem.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And the answer is yes and no;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it's deeper than all of that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The cause of our troubles

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is actually the complexity that science has given us.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And in order to understand this,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'm going to take you back a couple of generations.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I want to take you back

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, "The Youngest Science."

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Lewis Thomas was a physician-writer,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
one of my favorite writers.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And he wrote this book to explain, among other things,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
what it was like to be a medical intern

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
at the Boston City Hospital

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in the pre-penicillin year

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of 1937.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It was a time when medicine was cheap

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and very ineffective.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If you were in a hospital, he said,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it was going to do you good

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
only because it offered you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
some warmth, some food, shelter,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and maybe the caring attention

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of a nurse.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Doctors and medicine

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
made no difference at all.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That didn't seem to prevent the doctors

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
from being frantically busy in their days,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
as he explained.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
What they were trying to do

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
for which they could do something.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And there were a few.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and they could give you an antiserum,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
an injection of rabid antibodies

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to the bacterium streptococcus,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
if the intern sub-typed it correctly.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you had an acute congestive heart failure,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
they could bleed a pint of blood from you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
by opening up an arm vein,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and then giving you oxygen by tent.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
If you had early signs of paralysis

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and you were really good at asking personal questions,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
you might figure out

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in which case you could give this nice concoction

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
of mercury and arsenic --

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Beyond these sorts of things,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This was when the core structure of medicine

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
was created --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
what it meant to be good at what we did

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and how we wanted to build medicine to be.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It was at a time

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
when what was known you could know,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
If you had a prescription pad,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
if you had a nurse,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
if you had a hospital

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
you really could do it all.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
You set the fracture, you drew the blood,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you spun the blood,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
looked at it under the microscope,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
This was a life as a craftsman.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
As a result, we built it around

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
a culture and set of values

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that said what you were good at

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
was being daring,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
at being courageous,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
at being independent and self-sufficient.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Autonomy was our highest value.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Go a couple generations forward

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to where we are, though,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and it looks like a completely different world.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We have now found treatments

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that a human being can have.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We can't cure it all.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But we can make it possible

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
for most.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But what does it take?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Well, we've now discovered

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
4,000 medical and surgical procedures.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We've discovered 6,000 drugs

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that I'm now licensed to prescribe.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And we're trying to deploy this capability,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
town by town,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
to every person alive --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
in our own country,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
let alone around the world.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And we've reached the point where we've realized,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
as doctors,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we can't know it all.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
We can't do it all

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
by ourselves.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
There was a study where they looked

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
at how many clinicians it took to take care of you

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
if you came into a hospital,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
as it changed over time.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And in the year 1970,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
That is to say,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
it took basically the nursing time

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and then just a little bit of time for a doctor

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
who more or less checked in on you

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
once a day.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
By the end of the 20th century,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it had become more than 15 clinicians

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
for the same typical hospital patient --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
specialists, physical therapists,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
the nurses.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
We're all specialists now,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
even the primary care physicians.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Everyone just has

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
a piece of the care.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But holding onto that structure we built

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
around the daring, independence,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
self-sufficiency

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
of each of those people

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
has become a disaster.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We have trained, hired and rewarded people

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
to be cowboys.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
But it's pit crews that we need,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
pit crews for patients.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
There's evidence all around us:

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
in our communities

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
receive incomplete or inappropriate care.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
60 percent

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
of our asthma, stroke patients

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
receive incomplete or inappropriate care.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Two million people come into hospitals

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and pick up an infection

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
they didn't have

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because someone failed to follow

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the basic practices of hygiene.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Our experience

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
as people who get sick,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
need help from other people,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
is that we have amazing clinicians

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that we can turn to --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
hardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart --

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that we have access to incredible technologies

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that give us great hope,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
but little sense

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
that it consistently all comes together for you

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
from start to finish

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
in a successful way.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
There's another sign

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that we need pit crews,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and that's the unmanageable cost

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
of our care.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Now we in medicine, I think,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
are baffled by this question of cost.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We want to say, "This is just the way it is.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is just what medicine requires."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
When you go from a world

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
where you treated arthritis with aspirin,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that mostly didn't do the job,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
to one where, if it gets bad enough,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
we can do a hip replacement, a knee replacement

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that gives you years, maybe decades,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
without disability,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
a dramatic change,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
well is it any surprise

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that that $40,000 hip replacement

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
replacing the 10-cent aspirin

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
is more expensive?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
It's just the way it is.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
But I think we're ignoring certain facts

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
that tell us something about what we can do.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
As we've looked at the data

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
about the results that have come

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
as the complexity has increased,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
we found

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that the most expensive care

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
is not necessarily the best care.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And vice versa,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
the best care

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
often turns out to be the least expensive --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
has fewer complications,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the people get more efficient at what they do.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And what that means

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is there's hope.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Because [if] to have the best results,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
you really needed the most expensive care

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
in the country, or in the world,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
well then we really would be talking about rationing

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
who we're going to cut off from Medicare.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
That would be really our only choice.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
But when we look at the positive deviants --

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
the ones who are getting the best results

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
at the lowest costs --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
we find the ones that look the most like systems

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
are the most successful.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
That is to say, they found ways

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
to get all of the different pieces,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
all of the different components,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
to come together into a whole.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Having great components is not enough,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
We want the best drugs, the best technologies,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the best specialists,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
but we don't think too much

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
about how it all comes together.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It's a terrible design strategy actually.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There's a famous thought experiment

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that touches exactly on this

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that said, what if you built a car

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
from the very best car parts?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
a Ferrari engine,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
a Volvo body, a BMW chassis.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And you put it all together and what do you get?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's not a system.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Now a system, however,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
when things start to come together,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
you realize it has certain skills

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
for acting and looking that way.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Skill number one

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
is the ability to recognize success

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and the ability to recognize failure.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
When you are a specialist,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
you can't see the end result very well.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
You have to become really interested in data,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
unsexy as that sounds.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and he got interested in the question of,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
well how many CT scans did they do

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
for their community in Cedar Rapids?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
He got interested in this

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
because there had been government reports,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
newspaper reports, journal articles

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
saying that there had been too many CT scans done.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
He didn't see it in his own patients.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And so he asked the question, "How many did we do?"

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and he wanted to get the data.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It took him three months.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
No one had asked this question in his community before.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And what he found was that,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
for the 300,000 people in their community,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
in the previous year

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
they had done 52,000 CT scans.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
They had found a problem.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Which brings us to skill number two a system has.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Skill one, find where your failures are.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Skill two is devise solutions.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I got interested in this

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
when the World Health Organization came to my team

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
asking if we could help with a project

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to reduce deaths in surgery.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The volume of surgery had spread

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
around the world,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
but the safety of surgery

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
had not.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
are to do more training,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
give people more specialization

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
or bring in more technology.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Well in surgery, you couldn't have people who are more specialized

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and you couldn't have people who are better trained.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And yet we see unconscionable levels

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
of death, disability

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that could be avoided.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
We looked at skyscraper construction,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
we looked at the aviation world,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and we found

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
that they have technology, they have training,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and then they have one other thing:

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
They have checklists.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I did not expect

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
to be spending a significant part

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
of my time as a Harvard surgeon

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
worrying about checklists.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And yet, what we found

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
were that these were tools

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to help make experts better.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Could we design a checklist for surgery?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Not for the lowest people on the totem pole,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
but for the folks

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
who were all the way around the chain,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the entire team including the surgeons.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And what they taught us

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
was that designing a checklist

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to help people handle complexity

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
actually involves more difficulty than I had understood.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You have to think about things

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
like pause points.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
You need to identify the moments in a process

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and do something about it.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You have to identify

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
that this is a before-takeoff checklist.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And then you need to focus on the killer items.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
An aviation checklist,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
like this one for a single-engine plane,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
it's a reminder of the key things

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
that get forgotten or missed

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
if they're not checked.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So we did this.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
We created a 19-item two-minute checklist

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
for surgical teams.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We had the pause points

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
immediately before anesthesia is given,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
immediately before the knife hits the skin,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
immediately before the patient leaves the room.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there --

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
because that cuts the infection rate by half --

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and then interesting stuff,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Instead, you can make a recipe

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And we had items like making sure everyone in the room

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
because you get half a dozen people or more

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
who are sometimes coming together as a team

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
for the very first time that day that you're coming in.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
We implemented this checklist

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
in eight hospitals around the world,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
deliberately in places from rural Tanzania

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
to the University of Washington in Seattle.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
We found that after they adopted it

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
the complication rates fell

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
35 percent.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
It fell in every hospital it went into.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The death rates fell

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
47 percent.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
This was bigger than a drug.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
(Applause)

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And that brings us

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
to skill number three,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
the ability to implement this,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
to get colleagues across the entire chain

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to actually do these things.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And it's been slow to spread.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
This is not yet our norm in surgery --

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
let alone making checklists

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
to go onto childbirth and other areas.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
There's a deep resistance

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
because using these tools

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
forces us to confront

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that we're not a system,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
forces us to behave with a different set of values.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Just using a checklist

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
requires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
like humility,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
discipline,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
teamwork.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
This is the opposite of what we were built on:

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
independence, self-sufficiency,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
autonomy.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I met an actual cowboy, by the way.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I asked him, what was it like

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
to actually herd a thousand cattle

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
across hundreds of miles?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
How did you do that?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And he said, "We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around."

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
They communicate electronically constantly,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and they have protocols and checklists

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
for how they handle everything --

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
(Laughter)

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
-- from bad weather

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Even the cowboys are pit crews now.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And it seemed like time

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
that we become that way ourselves.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Making systems work

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
is the great task of my generation

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
of physicians and scientists.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
But I would go further and say

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
that making systems work,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
whether in health care, education,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
climate change,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
making a pathway out of poverty,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
is the great task of our generation as a whole.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
In every field, knowledge has exploded,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
but it has brought complexity,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
it has brought specialization.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And we've come to a place where we have no choice

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
but to recognize,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
as individualistic as we want to be,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
complexity requires

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
group success.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
We all need to be pit crews now.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Thank you.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:58.000
(Applause)
