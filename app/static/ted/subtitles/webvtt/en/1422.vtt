00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Last January, my company, Fark.com, was sued

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
along with Yahoo, MSN, Reddit,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
AOL, TechCrunch and others

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Gooseberry owned a patent

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for the creation and distribution

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of news releases via email.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
(Laughter)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but it does happen all the time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Take something already being done

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and patent it for an emerging technology --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
like phone calls on the internet

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or video listings for TV shows

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
or radio but for cellphones,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and so on.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The problem with these patents

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is that the mechanisms are obscure

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and the patent system is dysfunctional,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and as a result, most of these lawsuits end in settlements.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
no one knows what the terms were.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And as a result, the patent troll can claim

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that they won the case.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
this patent on emailing news releases

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
had sort of a fatal flaw

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
as it pertained to myself,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and that was that in the mainstream media world

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
there is only one definition for news release,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and it turns out that is press release --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
as in P.R.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now my company, Fark,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
deals with news, ostensibly,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and as a result

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we were not in violation of this patent.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So case closed, right?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Wrong.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
One of the major problems with patent law is that,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is actually on the defendant,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
which means you have to prove

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And this can take quite a while.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You need to know that the average patent troll defense

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
costs two million dollars

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and takes 18 months when you win.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That is your best case outcome

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
when you get sued by a patent troll.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
in order to defend against this lawsuit,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but one-by-one they settled out of the case,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
even though -- and this is important --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
none of these companies

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
infringed on this patent -- not a one of them.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And they started settling out.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The reason they settled out

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
clearly, two million dollars cheaper in some cases,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and much worse if you actually lose.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
especially a small eight-man shop like my company.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Six months into the lawsuit,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we finally reached the discovery phase.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And in discovery phase,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
we asked the patent troll to please provide

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
screenshots of Fark

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
where the infringement of their patent

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
was actually occurring.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now perhaps it's because no such screenshots actually existed,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Their attorney:

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
"Ah, yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Never mind the fact

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
with no employees.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
"And we'd like to go ahead and close this out.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So would you mind giving us your best and final offer?"

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
My response:

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
"How about nothing?!"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
(Applause)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We didn't have high hopes for that outcome.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
(Laughter)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But they settled.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
No counter offer.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now, as mentioned before,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
one of the reasons I can talk to you about this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
is because there's no non-disclosure agreement on this case.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Now how did that happen?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Well during the settlement process, when we received our copy, I struck it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
My attorney said, "Nah, no chance of that working."

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It came back signed.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now why? You can call them.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
They're not under NDA either.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Now what did I learn from this case? Well, three things.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
First of all, if you can,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
don't fight the patent, fight the infringement.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Patents are very difficult to overturn.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Secondly, make it clear from the beginning

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that either you have no money at all

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
than actually giving them the money.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Now the reason this works

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is because patent trolls

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
they become less interested in pursuing the case.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Finally, make sure that you can tell them

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that you will make this process

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
as annoying and as painful

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and as difficult as possible for them.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
to get their way.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It turns out, because they're paid on contingency,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
it works really, really well in reverse.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Don't forget that.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So what does all this mean?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Well to sum up,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
it boils down to one thing:

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Don't negotiate with terrorists.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
(Applause)

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
than any domestic or foreign

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
terrorist organization in history

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
every year.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And what do they do with that money?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Now this is the point in the Talk

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
where I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And the problem with that

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
is that there are two very large industry groups

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that have different outcomes in mind

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
for the patent system.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The health care industry

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
would like stronger protections for inventors.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The hi-tech industry

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
would like stronger protections for producers.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed, but they are at odds.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So unfortunately I'm not smart enough

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to have a solution for the patent troll problem.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
However, I did have this idea,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and it was kind of good.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And I thought, "I should patent this."

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(Laughter)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Behold, patent infringement via mobile device --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
defined as a computer which is not stationary.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
My solution: award me this patent

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and I will troll them out of existence.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Thank you.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
(Applause)
