WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Shivdutt Yadav,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in Uttar Pradesh,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and he discovered

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that official records were listing him as dead.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
His land was no longer registered

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in his name.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
were also listed as dead.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Family members had bribed officials

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
by having the brothers declared dead,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
allowing them to inherit

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
their father's share of the ancestral farmland.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Because of this, all three brothers and their families

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
had to vacate their home.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
According to the Yadav family,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the local court has been scheduling a case review

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
since 2001,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but a judge has never appeared.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of people dying

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
before their case is given a proper review.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
led to this corruption.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
He was laid to rest in the Ganges River,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Photographing these brothers

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
was a disorienting exchange

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
because on paper they don't exist,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Yet, these men remain dead.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This quandary led to the title of the project,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which considers in many ways

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that we are all the living dead

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and that we in some ways represent

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
ghosts of the past and the future.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So this story is the first of 18 chapters

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in my new body of work titled "A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And for this work,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I traveled around the world over a four-year period

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
researching and recording bloodlines

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and their related stories.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I was interested in ideas surrounding fate

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and whether our fate is determined

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
by blood, chance or circumstance.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The subjects I documented

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
ranged from feuding families in Brazil

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to victims of genocide in Bosnia

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to the first woman to hijack an airplane

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and the living dead in India.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In each chapter, you can see the external forces

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
of governance, power and territory or religion

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
colliding with the internal forces

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
of psychological and physical inheritance.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Each work that I make

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
is comprised of three segments.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
On the left are one or more portrait panels

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
in which I systematically order

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the members of a given bloodline.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
in which I construct

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the narrative at stake.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's a space that's more intuitive

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in which I present fragments of the story,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
beginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And it's meant to kind of reflect

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
in a less linear form.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So it's more disordered.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And this disorder is in direct contrast

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to the unalterable order of a bloodline.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In my past projects I've often worked in serial form,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
documenting things that have

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the appearance of being comprehensive

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
through a determined title and a determined presentation,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
but in fact, are fairly abstract.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and find an absolute catalog,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
something that I couldn't interrupt, curate or edit by choice.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This led me to blood.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
A bloodline is determined and ordered.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But the project centers

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
on the collision of order and disorder --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the order of blood butting up against the disorder

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
represented in the often chaotic and violent stories

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that are the subjects of my chapters.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
In chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
He was sent in 1907 to Palestine

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
by the Zionist organization

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to look at areas for Jewish settlement

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and acquire land for Jewish settlement.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
He oversaw land acquisition

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
whose work led to the establishment

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of a Jewish state.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I wanted to look at the early paperwork

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
of the establishment of the Jewish state.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And I found these maps which you see here.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And these are studies

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
commissioned by the Zionist organization

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
for alternative areas for Jewish settlement.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
In this, I was interested in the consequences

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
of geography

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and imagining how the world would be different

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
if Israel were in Uganda,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which is what these maps demonstrate.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
These archives in Jerusalem,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
they maintain a card index file

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
to Palestine, and later Israel,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
from 1919 to 1965.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Chapter three:

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
treated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
for AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
mental illness, evil spirits.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
He's most often paid for his services

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
in cash, cows or goats.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But sometimes when his female patients

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
can't afford his services,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
their families give the women to Jura

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
in exchange for medical treatment.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
As a result of these transactions,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Jura has nine wives,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
32 children

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and 63 grandchildren.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Two of his wives were brought to him

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
suffering from infertility

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and he cured them,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
three for evil spirits,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
paying their families a total of 16 cows.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
One wife deserted him

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It's common among a privileged class

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
capable of paying numerous dowries

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and keeping multiple homes.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Instances of prominent social and political figures

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
in polygamous relationships

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
has led to the perception of polygamy

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
as a symbol of wealth, status and power.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
there are empty portraits.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
These empty portraits represent individuals,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
living individuals, who couldn't be present.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
They include dengue fever,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
imprisonment, army service,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
women not allowed to be photographed

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
for religious and cultural reasons.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And in this particular chapter,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
it's children whose mothers

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Twenty-four European rabbits

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
were brought to Australia in 1859

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
by a British settler

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
for sporting purposes, for hunting.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And within a hundred years,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and it competes with native wildlife

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and damages native plants

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and degrades the land.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Since the 1950s,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Australia has been introducing lethal diseases

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
into the wild rabbit population

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to control growth.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
These rabbits were bred at a government facility,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Biosecurity Queensland,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and have infected them with a lethal disease

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and are monitoring their progress

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to see if it will effectively kill them.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So they're testing its virulence.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
During the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
except for a few, which were euthanized.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Haigh's Chocolate,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
in collaboration

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Now this was done to counter

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the annual celebration of rabbits

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and presumably make the public more comfortable

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
with the killing of rabbits

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and promote an animal that's native to Australia,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and actually an animal that is threatened

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
by the European rabbit.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
In chapter seven, I focus on the effects

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
of a genocidal act

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
on one bloodline.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So over a two-day period,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
six individuals from this bloodline

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
This is the only work

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
in which I visually represent the dead.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
But I only represent those

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
since the Second World War.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And during this massacre,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
were systematically executed.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So when you look at a detail of this work,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
you can see, the man on the upper-left

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
is the father of the woman sitting next to him.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Her name is Zumra.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
She is followed by her four children,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
who is then followed by her children

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
who were killed as well.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
During the time I was in Bosnia,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
were exhumed from a mass grave.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And I was therefore able to photograph

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
the fully assembled remains.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
However, the other individuals

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
are represented by these blue slides,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which show tooth and bone samples

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to prove they were the identities

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
of those individuals.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
They've all been given a proper burial,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
so what remains are these blue slides

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
at the International Commission for Missing Persons.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
These are personal effects

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
dug up from a mass grave

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that are awaiting identification from family members

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and also the Serbian soldiers later

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
during the times of the executions.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
which from top to bottom

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
shows a Serbian scorpion unit

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
being blessed by an Orthodox priest

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
before rounding up the boys and men

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and killing them.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Chapter 15 is more of a performance piece.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to select a multi-generational bloodline

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
to represent China for this project.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
They chose a large family from Beijing for its size,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and they declined to give me

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
any further reasoning for their choice.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
This is one of the rare situations

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
where I have no empty portraits.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Everyone showed up.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
You can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
as it travels through the bloodline.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
the State Council Information Office

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It controls all foreign media and image production

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
outside of China

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
from foreign media working within China.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It also monitors the Internet

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and instructs local media

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
on how to handle any potentially controversial issues,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
including Tibet, ethnic minorities,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Human Rights, religion,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
democracy movements and terrorism.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
For the footnote panel in this work,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
this office instructed me

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
to photograph their central television tower in Beijing.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
when I left.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
These are the descendants of Hans Frank

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
who was Hitler's personal legal advisor

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and governor general of occupied Poland.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
highlighting a complex relationship

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
to one's family history.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
The reasons for these absences

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
include people who declined participation.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
There's also parents who participated

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
who wouldn't let their children participate

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Another section of the family

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
presented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
because they didn't want to be identified

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
with the past that I was highlighting.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And finally, another individual

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
sat for me from behind

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and later rescinded his participation,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
In the footnote panel that accompanies this work

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and an imitation of that stamp

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
produced by British Intelligence

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
with Hans Frank's image on it.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
It was released in Poland

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
to create friction between Frank and Hitler,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
so that Hitler would imagine

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Frank was trying to usurp his power.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Again, talking about fate,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I was interested in the stories and fate

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
of particular works of art.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
These paintings were taken by Hans Frank

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
during the time of the Third Reich.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
They are Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady With an Ermine,"

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Rembrandt's "Landscape With Good Samaritan"

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and Raphael's "Portrait of a Youth,"

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
which has never been found.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Chapter 12 highlights

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
people being born into a battle that is not of their making,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
but becomes their own.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So this is the Ferraz family

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and the Novaes family.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And they are in an active blood feud.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
This feud has been going on since 1991

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and it involved the deaths

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
of 20 members of the families

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and 40 others associated with the feud,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
including hired hit men, innocent bystanders

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and friends.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Tensions between these two families date back to 1913

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
when there was a dispute over local political power.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
But it got violent in the last two decades

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and includes decapitation

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and the death of two mayors.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Installed into a protective wall

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
who's the head of the Novaes family,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
are these turret holes,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
which were used for shooting and looking.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
is one of the nation's most violent regions.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
or an eye for an eye,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
so retaliatory killings

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
have led to several deaths in the area.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
This story, like many of the stories in my chapters,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
reads almost as an archetypal episode,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
like something out of Shakespeare,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
that's happening now and will happen again in the future.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I'm interested in these ideas of repetition.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So after I returned home, I received word

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
that one member of the family

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
had been shot 30 times in the face.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Chapter 17

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and the absence of a history.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
are between the ages of six and 16.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
This piece is ordered by age

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
because it can't be ordered by blood.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
only one child had been adopted.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Children have to leave the orphanage at age 16,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
It's commonly reported in Ukraine

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that children, when leaving the orphanage

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
are targeted for human trafficking,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
child pornography and prostitution.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and high rates of suicide are recorded.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
This is a boys' bedroom.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and not enough warm clothing.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Children bathe infrequently

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
because the hot water isn't turned on until October.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
This is a girls' bedroom.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
as an industrial size washing machine and dryer,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
four vacuum cleaners, two computers,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
a video projector, a copy machine,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
winter shoes and a dentist's drill.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
This photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
shows a sign which I had translated when I got home.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And it reads: "Those who do not know their past

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
are not worthy of their future."

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
There are many more chapters in this project.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
This is just an abridged rendering

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
of over a thousand images.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And this mass pile of images and stories

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
forms an archive.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And within this accumulation of images and texts,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I'm struggling to find patterns

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
are just as coded as blood itself.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
But archives exist

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Something is said in the gaps

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
between all the information that's collected.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And there's this relentless persistence

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
of birth and death

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
and an unending collection of stories in between.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
It's almost machine-like

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
the way people are born and people die,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and the stories keep coming and coming.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And in this, I'm considering,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
is this actual accumulation

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
leading to some sort of evolution,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
or are we on repeat

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
over and over again?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Thank you.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
(Applause)
