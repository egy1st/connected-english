00:00:00.642 --> 00:00:04.541
People are living longer
and societies are getting grayer.

00:00:05.113 --> 00:00:06.841
You hear about it all the time.

00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:08.764
You read about it in your newspapers.

00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:11.134
You hear about it on your television sets.

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:12.422
Sometimes, I'm concerned

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:17.054
that we hear about it so much
that we've come to accept longer lives

00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:20.911
with a kind of a complacency, even ease.

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:26.225
But make no mistake, longer lives can --

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:32.132
and, I believe, will improve
quality of life at all ages.

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:36.832
Now to put this in perspective,
let me just zoom out for a minute.

00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:43.720
More years were added to average
life expectancy in the 20th century

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:51.801
than all years added
across all prior millennia

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:53.999
of human evolution combined.

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:56.803
In the blink of an eye,

00:00:56.827 --> 00:01:00.199
we nearly doubled the length of time
that we're living.

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.728
So if you ever feel like you don't have
this aging thing quite pegged,

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:06.066
don't kick yourself.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.976
It's brand new.

00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:12.778
And because fertility rates fell
across that very same period

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:15.298
that life expectancy was going up,

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:22.188
that pyramid that has always represented
the distribution of age in the population,

00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:27.238
with many young ones at the bottom
winnowed to a tiny peak of older people

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:29.499
who make it and survive to old age,

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:33.393
is being reshaped into a rectangle.

00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:37.276
And now, if you're the kind of person

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.657
who can get chills
from population statistics,

00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:40.704
(Laughter)

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:42.522
these are the ones that should do it.

00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:43.976
Because what that means

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.840
is that for the first time
in the history of the species,

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:51.634
the majority of babies born
in the developed world

00:01:51.658 --> 00:01:55.474
are having the opportunity to grow old.

00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:58.976
How did this happen?

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:03.446
Well, we're no genetically hardier
than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago.

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.290
This increase in life expectancy
is the remarkable product of culture --

00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:12.515
the crucible that holds
science and technology

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:17.975
and wide-scale changes in behavior
that improve health and well-being.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:25.443
Through cultural changes, our ancestors
largely eliminated early death

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.292
so that people can now
live out their full lives.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.469
Now there are problems
associated with aging --

00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:34.784
diseases, poverty, loss of social status.

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:36.976
It's hardly time to rest on our laurels.

00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:39.847
But the more we learn about aging,

00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.910
the clearer it becomes
that a sweeping downward course

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:45.976
is grossly inaccurate.

00:02:46.954 --> 00:02:50.222
Aging brings some rather
remarkable improvements --

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:52.976
increased knowledge, expertise --

00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:58.475
and emotional aspects of life improve.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.739
That's right, older people are happy.

00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:08.126
They're happier than middle-aged people,
and younger people, certainly.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.332
(Laughter)

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.470
Study after study
is coming to the same conclusion.

00:03:12.494 --> 00:03:15.326
The CDC recently conducted a survey

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.234
where they asked respondents
simply to tell them

00:03:18.258 --> 00:03:21.373
whether they experienced
significant psychological distress

00:03:21.397 --> 00:03:22.559
in the previous week.

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:26.217
And fewer older people
answered affirmatively to that question

00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:28.975
than middle-aged people,
and younger people as well.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:32.831
And a recent Gallup poll
asked participants

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:37.341
how much stress and worry and anger
they had experienced the previous day.

00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:41.787
And stress, worry, anger

00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:44.000
all decrease with age.

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:48.613
Now social scientists call this
the paradox of aging.

00:03:48.637 --> 00:03:51.329
I mean, after all,
aging is not a piece of cake.

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:56.365
So we've asked all sorts of questions
to see if we could undo this finding.

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:02.825
We've asked whether it may be that
the current generations of older people

00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.871
are and always have been
the greatest generations.

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.277
That is that younger people today
may not typically experience

00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:12.629
these improvements as they grow older.

00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:14.551
We've asked,

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:18.518
well, maybe older people
are just trying to put a positive spin

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:20.955
on an otherwise depressing existence.

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.726
(Laughter)

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.603
But the more we've tried
to disavow this finding,

00:04:25.627 --> 00:04:28.125
the more evidence we find to support it.

00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:31.881
Years ago, my colleagues
and I embarked on a study

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.993
where we followed the same group
of people over a 10-year period.

00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:37.976
Originally, the sample was aged 18 to 94.

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:41.833
And we studied whether and how
their emotional experiences changed

00:04:41.857 --> 00:04:43.762
as they grew older.

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:47.097
Our participants would carry
electronic pagers

00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.622
for a week at a time,

00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:51.945
and we'd page them throughout the day
and evenings at random times.

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:53.759
And every time we paged them,

00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:55.835
we'd ask them to answer
several questions --

00:04:55.859 --> 00:04:58.924
"On a one to seven scale,
how happy are you right now?"

00:04:58.948 --> 00:05:00.433
"How sad are you right now?"

00:05:00.457 --> 00:05:02.608
"How frustrated are you right now?" --

00:05:02.632 --> 00:05:06.866
so that we could get a sense of the kinds
of emotions and feelings they were having

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.270
in their day-to-day lives.

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:12.343
And using this intense study
of individuals,

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:16.221
we find that it's not
one particular generation

00:05:16.245 --> 00:05:18.506
that's doing better than the others,

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.404
but the same individuals over time

00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:26.287
come to report relatively greater
positive experience.

00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:30.749
Now you see this slight downturn
at very advanced ages.

00:05:30.773 --> 00:05:32.410
And there is a slight downturn.

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:37.423
But at no point does it return
to the levels we see in early adulthood.

00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:45.628
Now it's really too simplistic
to say that older people are "happy."

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.975
In our study, they are more positive.

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:52.145
But they're also more likely
than younger people

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.342
to experience mixed emotions --

00:05:54.366 --> 00:05:56.983
sadness at the same time
you experience happiness;

00:05:57.007 --> 00:06:00.451
you know, that tear in the eye
when you're smiling at a friend.

00:06:01.634 --> 00:06:06.277
And other research has shown that
older people seem to engage with sadness

00:06:06.301 --> 00:06:07.707
more comfortably.

00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:10.615
They're more accepting of sadness
than younger people are.

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.232
And we suspect
that this may help to explain

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:15.976
why older people are better
than younger people

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.252
at solving hotly charged
emotional conflicts and debates.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.286
Older people can view injustice
with compassion,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.302
but not despair.

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:31.096
And all things being equal,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.211
older people direct their cognitive
resources, like attention and memory,

00:06:35.235 --> 00:06:37.976
to positive information
more than negative.

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:41.968
If we show older, middle-aged,
younger people images,

00:06:41.992 --> 00:06:43.976
like the ones you see on the screen,

00:06:44.698 --> 00:06:49.324
and we later ask them
to recall all the images that they can,

00:06:49.885 --> 00:06:52.244
older people, but not younger people,

00:06:52.268 --> 00:06:55.975
remember more positive images
than negative images.

00:06:56.652 --> 00:07:00.790
We've asked older and younger people
to view faces in laboratory studies,

00:07:00.814 --> 00:07:02.690
some frowning, some smiling.

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:07.836
Older people look toward the smiling faces
and away from the frowning, angry faces.

00:07:09.257 --> 00:07:14.365
In day-to-day life, this translates
into greater enjoyment and satisfaction.

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:20.822
But as social scientists, we continue
to ask about possible alternatives.

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:24.500
We've said, well, maybe older people
report more positive emotions

00:07:24.524 --> 00:07:26.976
because they're cognitively impaired.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.320
(Laughter)

00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:32.107
We've said, could it be

00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:35.725
that positive emotions are simply easier
to process than negative emotions,

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:38.918
and so you switch
to the positive emotions?

00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:41.077
Maybe our neural centers in our brain

00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:45.223
are degraded such that we're unable
to process negative emotions anymore.

00:07:45.572 --> 00:07:47.081
But that's not the case.

00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:50.850
The most mentally sharp older adults

00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:53.976
are the ones who show
this positivity effect the most.

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:57.231
And under conditions
where it really matters,

00:07:57.255 --> 00:07:59.783
older people do process
the negative information

00:07:59.807 --> 00:08:01.976
just as well as the positive information.

00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:04.321
So how can this be?

00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:07.849
Well, in our research,

00:08:07.957 --> 00:08:11.948
we've found that these changes
are grounded fundamentally

00:08:11.972 --> 00:08:15.189
in the uniquely human
ability to monitor time --

00:08:15.213 --> 00:08:18.262
not just clock time
and calendar time, but lifetime.

00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:21.226
And if there's a paradox of aging,

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.672
it's that recognizing
that we won't live forever

00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:28.953
changes our perspective on life
in positive ways.

00:08:30.204 --> 00:08:35.010
When time horizons are long and nebulous,
as they typically are in youth,

00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:36.976
people are constantly preparing,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.755
trying to soak up all the information
they possibly can,

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:43.025
taking risks, exploring.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.992
We might spend time with people
we don't even like

00:08:46.016 --> 00:08:48.115
because it's somehow interesting.

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:50.335
We might learn something unexpected.

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:52.419
(Laughter)

00:08:52.443 --> 00:08:53.976
We go on blind dates.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.253
(Laughter)

00:08:57.277 --> 00:08:58.447
You know, after all,

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.976
if it doesn't work out,
there's always tomorrow.

00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:04.698
People over 50 don't go on blind dates.

00:09:04.722 --> 00:09:11.722
(Laughter)

00:09:12.014 --> 00:09:17.821
As we age, our time horizons grow shorter
and our goals change.

00:09:18.342 --> 00:09:21.334
When we recognize that we don't have
all the time in the world,

00:09:21.358 --> 00:09:24.205
we see our priorities most clearly.

00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:26.950
We take less notice of trivial matters.

00:09:26.974 --> 00:09:28.475
We savor life.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.758
We're more appreciative,

00:09:30.782 --> 00:09:32.537
more open to reconciliation.

00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:36.291
We invest in more emotionally
important parts of life,

00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:38.976
and life gets better,

00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:41.976
so we're happier day-to-day.

00:09:42.305 --> 00:09:44.245
But that same shift in perspective

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:48.664
leads us to have less tolerance
than ever for injustice.

00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:51.636
By 2015,

00:09:52.137 --> 00:09:54.775
there will be more people
in the United States

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:58.136
over the age of 60 than under 15.

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:04.181
What will happen to societies
that are top-heavy with older people?

00:10:05.363 --> 00:10:08.655
The numbers won't determine the outcome.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.694
Culture will.

00:10:12.203 --> 00:10:15.308
If we invest in science and technology

00:10:15.332 --> 00:10:19.322
and find solutions for the real problems
that older people face

00:10:20.184 --> 00:10:26.281
and we capitalize on the very real
strengths of older people,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.710
then added years of life can dramatically
improve quality of life at all ages.

00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:38.364
Societies with millions of talented,
emotionally stable citizens

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:43.315
who are healthier and better educated
than any generations before them,

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:47.165
armed with knowledge
about the practical matters of life

00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:51.478
and motivated to solve the big issues

00:10:52.296 --> 00:10:57.063
can be better societies
than we have ever known.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.726
My father, who is 92, likes to say,

00:11:03.778 --> 00:11:07.347
"Let's stop talking
only about how to save the old folks

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.964
and start talking about
how to get them to save us all."

00:11:13.837 --> 00:11:15.277
Thank you.

00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:18.095
(Applause)
