00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Have you ever wondered

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
what is inside your dental plaque?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Probably not, but people like me do.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm an archeological geneticist

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
at the University of Zurich,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by conducting genetic research

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And through this work, I hope to better understand

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so that we can improve

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and better manage our health in the future.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and one way is to extract human DNA

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
from ancient bones.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And from these extracts,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and look for changes that might be related to adaptations,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
risk factors and inherited diseases.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But this is only one half of the story.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The most important health challenges today

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
are not caused by simple mutations in our genome,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
between genetic variation,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
diet, microbes and parasites

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and our immune response.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
All of these diseases

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
have a strong evolutionary component

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that directly relates to the fact

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that we live today in a very different environment

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
than the ones in which our bodies evolved.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And in order to understand these diseases,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we need to move past studies of the human genome alone

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and towards a more holistic approach

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to human health in the past.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But there are a lot of challenges for this.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And first of all, what do we even study?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Skeletons are ubiquitous; they're found all over the place.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But of course, all of the soft tissue has decomposed,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and the skeleton itself

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
has limited health information.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Mummies are a great source of information,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
except that they're really geographically limited

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and limited in time as well.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Coprolites are fossilized human feces,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and they're actually extremely interesting.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but they are very rare.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
(Laughter)

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So to address this problem,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I put together a team of international researchers

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in Switzerland, Denmark and the U.K.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to study a very poorly studied, little known material

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that's found on people everywhere.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's a type of fossilized dental plaque

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that is called officially dental calculus.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Many of you may know it by the term tartar.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It's what the dentist cleans off your teeth

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
every time that you go in for a visit.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And in a typical dentistry visit,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But in ancient times before tooth brushing,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
over a lifetime.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And what's really important about dental calculus

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
it's abundant in quantity before the present day

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and it's ubiquitous worldwide.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We find it in every population around the world at all time periods

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
going back tens of thousands of years.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And we even find it in neanderthals and animals.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And so previous studies

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
had only focused on microscopy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
They'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and what they had found was things like pollen

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and plant starches,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and they'd found muscle cells from animal meats

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and bacteria.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And so what my team of researchers, what we wanted to do,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
is say, can we apply

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
genetic and proteomic technology

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to go after DNA and proteins,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to really understand what's going on?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And what we found

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We also have found immune proteins

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
related to infection and inflammation

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and proteins and DNA related to diet.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But what was surprising to us, and also quite exciting,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is we also found bacteria

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So it gives us virtual access to the lungs,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
which is where many important diseases reside.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And we also found bacteria

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that normally inhabit the gut.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And so we can also now virtually gain access

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
to this even more distant organ system

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that, from the skeleton alone,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
has long decomposed.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and protein mass spectrometry technologies

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to ancient dental calculus,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
we can generate immense quantities of data

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of the dynamic interplay

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
between diet, infection and immunity

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
thousands of years ago.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So what started out as an idea,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is now being implemented

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
to churn out millions of sequences

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that we can use to investigate

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And from this information

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
we can learn about how pathogens evolve

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and also why they continue to make us sick.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And I hope I have convinced you

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of the value of dental calculus.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And as a final parting thought,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
on behalf of future archeologists,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I would like to ask you to please think twice

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
before you go home and brush your teeth.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
(Applause)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Thank you.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Applause)
