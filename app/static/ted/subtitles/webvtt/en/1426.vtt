00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A few months ago

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the Nobel Prize in physics

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
was awarded to two teams of astronomers

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for a discovery that has been hailed

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as one of the most important

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
astronomical observations ever.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And today, after briefly describing what they found,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for explaining their discovery,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
namely the possibility

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that way beyond the Earth,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the Milky Way and other distant galaxies,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we may find that our universe

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is not the only universe,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but is instead

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
part of a vast complex of universes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that we call the multiverse.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I mean, most of us were raised to believe

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that the word "universe" means everything.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I say most of us with forethought,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And last year I was holding her

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I said, "Sophia,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I love you more than anything in the universe."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And she turned to me and said, "Daddy,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
universe or multiverse?"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
(Laughter)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But barring such an anomalous upbringing,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
it is strange to imagine

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
other realms separate from ours,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
most with fundamentally different features,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that would rightly be called universes of their own.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And yet,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
speculative though the idea surely is,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I aim to convince you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that there's reason for taking it seriously,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
as it just might be right.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In part one,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and to highlight a profound mystery

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which those results revealed.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In part two,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I'll offer a solution to that mystery.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It's based on an approach called string theory,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and that's where the idea of the multiverse

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
will come into the story.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Finally, in part three,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm going to describe a cosmological theory

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
called inflation,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
which will pull all the pieces of the story together.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Okay, part one starts back in 1929

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
realized that the distant galaxies

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
were all rushing away from us,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
establishing that space itself is stretching,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
it's expanding.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Now this was revolutionary.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the universe was static.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But even so,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
there was one thing that everyone was certain of:

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The expansion must be slowing down.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the gravitational pull

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
of each galaxy on every other

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
must be slowing

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the expansion of space.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
when those two teams of astronomers

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I mentioned at the outset

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
were inspired by this reasoning

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to measure the rate

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
at which the expansion has been slowing.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And they did this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by painstaking observations

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
of numerous distant galaxies,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
allowing them to chart

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
how the expansion rate has changed over time.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Here's the surprise:

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
They found that the expansion is not slowing down.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Instead they found that it's speeding up,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
going faster and faster.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That's like tossing an apple upward

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and it goes up faster and faster.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Now if you saw an apple do that,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
you'd want to know why.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
What's pushing on it?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Similarly, the astronomers' results

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but they raised an analogous question.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
What force is driving all galaxies

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to rush away from every other

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
at an ever-quickening speed?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Well the most promising answer

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
comes from an old idea of Einstein's.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You see, we are all used to gravity

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
being a force that does one thing,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
pulls objects together.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But in Einstein's theory of gravity,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
his general theory of relativity,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
gravity can also push things apart.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
How? Well according to Einstein's math,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
if space is uniformly filled

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
with an invisible energy,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
sort of like a uniform, invisible mist,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
then the gravity generated by that mist

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
would be repulsive,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
repulsive gravity,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
which is just what we need to explain the observations.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Because the repulsive gravity

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
of an invisible energy in space --

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
we now call it dark energy,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
its repulsive gravity

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
would cause each galaxy to push against every other,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
driving expansion to speed up,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
not slow down.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And this explanation

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
represents great progress.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But I promised you a mystery

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
here in part one.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Here it is.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
When the astronomers worked out

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
how much of this dark energy

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
must be infusing space

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
to account for the cosmic speed up,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
look at what they found.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
This number is small.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Expressed in the relevant unit,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
it is spectacularly small.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We want this number

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to emerge from the laws of physics,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
but so far no one has found a way to do that.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Now you might wonder,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
should you care?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Maybe explaining this number

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
is just a technical issue,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a technical detail of interest to experts,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
but of no relevance to anybody else.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Well it surely is a technical detail,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
but some details really matter.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Some details provide

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
windows into uncharted realms of reality,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and this peculiar number may be doing just that,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
invokes the possibility of other universes --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
an idea that naturally emerges from string theory,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
which takes me to part two: string theory.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So hold the mystery of the dark energy

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
in the back of your mind

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
as I now go on to tell you

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
three key things about string theory.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
First off, what is it?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
of a unified theory of physics,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
a single overarching framework

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that would be able to describe

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
all the forces at work in the universe.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And the central idea of string theory

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
is quite straightforward.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It says that if you examine

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
any piece of matter ever more finely,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
at first you'll find molecules

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But the theory says that if you could probe smaller,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
much smaller than we can with existing technology,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
you'd find something else inside these particles --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
a little tiny vibrating filament of energy,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
a little tiny vibrating string.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And just like the strings on a violin,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
they can vibrate in different patterns

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
producing different musical notes.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
These little fundamental strings,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
when they vibrate in different patterns,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
they produce different kinds of particles --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
all other particles

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
would be united into a single framework,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
as they would all arise from vibrating strings.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It's a compelling picture,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
a kind of cosmic symphony,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
where all the richness

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that we see in the world around us

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
emerges from the music

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that these little, tiny strings can play.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But there's a cost

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to this elegant unification,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
because years of research

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
It has internal inconsistencies,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
unless we allow

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
for something wholly unfamiliar --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
extra dimensions of space.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And you can think about those

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
as height, width and depth.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
there are additional dimensions

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
crumpled to a tiny size so small

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that we have not detected them.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
But even though the dimensions are hidden,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
they would have an impact on things that we can observe

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
because the shape of the extra dimensions

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
constrains how the strings can vibrate.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And in string theory,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
vibration determines everything.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So particle masses, the strengths of forces,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and most importantly, the amount of dark energy

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
would be determined

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
by the shape of the extra dimensions.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
we should be able to calculate these features,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
calculate the amount of dark energy.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The challenge

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
is we don't know

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the shape of the extra dimensions.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
All we have

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
is a list of candidate shapes

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
allowed by the math.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Now when these ideas were first developed,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
there were only about five different candidate shapes,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
so you can imagine

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
analyzing them one-by-one

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
to determine if any yield

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the physical features we observe.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
But over time the list grew

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
as researchers found other candidate shapes.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
since after all,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
graduate students need something to do.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But then the list continued to grow

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
into the millions and the billions, until today.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The list of candidate shapes

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
has soared to about 10 to the 500.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So, what to do?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Well some researchers lost heart,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
each giving rise to different physical features,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
string theory would never make

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
definitive, testable predictions.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But others turned this issue on its head,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Here's the idea.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Each is as real as every other,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
in the sense

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that there are many universes,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And this radical proposal

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
has a profound impact on this mystery:

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Because you see,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
if there are other universes,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and if those universes

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
then the physical features of each universe will be different,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and in particular,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
the amount of dark energy in each universe

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
will be different.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Which means that the mystery

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
would take on a wholly different character.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
In this context,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
because there isn't just one number,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
there are many numbers.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Which means

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
we have been asking the wrong question.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
It's that the right question to ask is,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
why do we humans find ourselves in a universe

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
instead of any of the other possibilities

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that are out there?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And that's a question on which we can make headway.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Because those universes

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that have much more dark energy than ours,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that it blows the clump apart

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and galaxies don't form.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And in those universes that have much less dark energy,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
well they collapse back on themselves so quickly

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that, again, galaxies don't form.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and no chance

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
for our form of life

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
to exist in those other universes.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So we find ourselves in a universe

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
simply because our universe has conditions

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
hospitable to our form of life.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And that would be that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Mystery solved,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
multiverse found.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
We're used to physics

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But the point is,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
if the feature you're observing

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
can and does take on

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
a wide variety of different values

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
across the wider landscape of reality,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
then thinking one explanation

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
for a particular value

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
is simply misguided.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
An early example

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
who was obsessed with understanding

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
a different number --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And he worked for decades trying to explain this number,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
but he never succeeded, and we know why.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Kepler was asking

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
the wrong question.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
We now know that there are many planets

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So hoping that the laws of physics

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
will explain one particular number, 93 million miles,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
well that is simply wrongheaded.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Instead the right question to ask is,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
why do we humans find ourselves on a planet

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
at this particular distance,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
instead of any of the other possibilities?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And again, that's a question we can answer.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
would be so hot

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that our form of life wouldn't exist.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And those planets that are much farther away from the star,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
well they're so cold

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that, again, our form of life would not take hold.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So we find ourselves

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
on a planet at this particular distance

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
simply because it yields conditions

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
vital to our form of life.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And when it comes to planets and their distances,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
this clearly is the right kind of reasoning.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
The point is,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
it may also be the right kind of reasoning.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
One key difference, of course,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
is we know that there are other planets out there,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but so far I've only speculated on the possibility

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
that there might be other universes.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So to pull it all together,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
we need a mechanism

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
that can actually generate other universes.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And that takes me to my final part, part three.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Because such a mechanism has been found

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You see, when we speak of the Big Bang,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
we often have an image

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
of a kind of cosmic explosion

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that created our universe

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and set space rushing outward.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
But there's a little secret.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
the Bang.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
but gives us no insight

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
into what would have powered the Bang itself.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And this gap was finally filled

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It's called inflationary cosmology,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
which identified a particular kind of fuel

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
that would naturally generate

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
an outward rush of space.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
The fuel is based on something called a quantum field,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
but the only detail that matters for us

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
is that this fuel proves to be so efficient

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that it's virtually impossible

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
to use it all up,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
which means in the inflationary theory,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
the Big Bang giving rise to our universe

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
is likely not a one-time event.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
each giving rise to its own separate universe

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
with our universe becoming but one bubble

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And now, when we meld this with string theory,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
here's the picture we're led to.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Each of these universes has extra dimensions.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
The different shapes yield different physical features.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
simply because it's only in our universe

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
are right for our form of life to take hold.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
of the wider cosmos

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
that cutting-edge observation and theory

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
have now led us to seriously consider.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
One big remaining question, of course, is,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
could we ever confirm

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
the existence of other universes?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Well let me describe

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
one way that might one day happen.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
The inflationary theory

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
already has strong observational support.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Because the theory predicts

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that the Big Bang would have been so intense

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
that as space rapidly expanded,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
tiny quantum jitters from the micro world

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
would have been stretched out to the macro world,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
yielding a distinctive fingerprint,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
across space,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
which powerful telescopes have now observed.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Going further, if there are other universes,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
the theory predicts that every so often

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
those universes can collide.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And if our universe got hit by another,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
that collision

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
would generate an additional subtle pattern

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
of temperature variations across space

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
that we might one day

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
be able to detect.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And so exotic as this picture is,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
it may one day be grounded

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
in observations,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
establishing the existence of other universes.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I'll conclude

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
with a striking implication

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
of all these ideas

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
for the very far future.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
You see, we learned

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
that our universe is not static,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
that space is expanding,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that that expansion is speeding up

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and that there might be other universes

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
all by carefully examining

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
faint pinpoints of starlight

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
coming to us from distant galaxies.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
But because the expansion is speeding up,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
in the very far future,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
that we won't be able to see them --

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
not because of technological limitations,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
but because of the laws of physics.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
The light those galaxies emit,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
will not be able to overcome

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
the ever-widening gulf between us.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
So astronomers in the far future

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
looking out into deep space

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
will see nothing but an endless stretch

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
of static, inky, black stillness.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And they will conclude

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
that the universe is static and unchanging

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
and populated by a single central oasis of matter

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
that they inhabit --

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
a picture of the cosmos

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
that we definitively know to be wrong.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Now maybe those future astronomers will have records

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
handed down from an earlier era,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
like ours,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
attesting to an expanding cosmos

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
teeming with galaxies.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But would those future astronomers

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
believe such ancient knowledge?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Or would they believe

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
in the black, static empty universe

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I suspect the latter.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Which means that we are living

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
through a remarkably privileged era

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
when certain deep truths about the cosmos

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
are still within reach

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
of the human spirit of exploration.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
It appears that it may not always be that way.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Because today's astronomers,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
by turning powerful telescopes to the sky,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
have captured a handful of starkly informative photons --

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
a kind of cosmic telegram

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
billions of years in transit.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
and the message echoing across the ages is clear.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Sometimes nature guards her secrets

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
with the unbreakable grip

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
of physical law.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
from just beyond the horizon.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
(Applause)

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
The range of ideas you've just spoken about

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
How do you think

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
of where cosmology is now,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
in a sort of historical side?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
BG: Well it's hard to say.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
When we learn that astronomers of the far future

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
may not have enough information to figure things out,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
the natural question is, maybe we're already in that position

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
and certain deep, critical features of the universe

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
already have escaped our ability to understand

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
because of how cosmology evolves.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So from that perspective,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
maybe we will always be asking questions

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
and never be able to fully answer them.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
On the other hand, we now can understand

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
how old the universe is.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
We can understand

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
that was set down 13.72 billion years ago --

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and it matches.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Holy cow! That's just amazing.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
CA: You're going to be around for the next few days.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Maybe some of these conversations can continue.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.)

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
(Applause)
