00:00:01.722 --> 00:00:04.135
So I want to talk today
about money and happiness,

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:07.717
which are two things a lot of us
spend a lot of our time thinking about,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.571
either trying to earn them
or trying to increase them.

00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:12.874
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase,

00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:15.707
we see it in religions
and self-help books:

00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:17.026
money can't buy happiness.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.825
And I want to suggest today
that, in fact, that's wrong.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.900
(Laughter)

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:24.141
I'm at a business school,
so that's what we do.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.318
So that's wrong,

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:28.565
and in fact, if you think that,
you're just not spending it right.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.237
So instead of spending it
the way you usually spend it,

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.748
maybe if you spent it differently,
that might work a little bit better.

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:38.217
Before I tell you the ways you can spend
it that will make you happier,

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.424
let's think about the ways
we usually spend it

00:00:40.448 --> 00:00:42.260
that don't, in fact, make us happier.

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:44.020
We had a little natural experiment.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.827
So CNN, a little while ago,
wrote this interesting article

00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:49.343
on what happens to people
when they win the lottery.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.805
It turns out people think
when they win the lottery

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.186
their lives will be amazing.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.520
This article's about
how their lives get ruined.

00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:57.465
What happens when people win the lottery

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.887
is, one, they spend
all the money and go into debt;

00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:02.979
and two, all of their friends
and everyone they've ever met

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:04.748
find them and bug them for money.

00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:06.944
It ruins their social
relationships, in fact.

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:09.052
So they have more debt
and worse friendships

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:11.103
than they had before they won the lottery.

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:13.147
What was interesting
about the article was,

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:16.163
people started commenting
on the article, readers of the thing.

00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:18.699
And instead of talking
about how it made them realize

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:20.521
that money doesn't lead to happiness,

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:23.989
everyone started saying, "You know
what I'd do if I won the lottery ...?"

00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:25.812
and fantasizing about what they'd do.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:29.206
Here's just two of the ones we saw
that are interesting to think about.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.566
One person wrote, "When I win,
I'm going to buy my own little mountain

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.158
and have a little house on top."

00:01:34.182 --> 00:01:35.497
(Laughter)

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.570
And another person wrote,
"I would fill a big bathtub with money

00:01:38.594 --> 00:01:40.834
and get in the tub
while smoking a big fat cigar

00:01:40.858 --> 00:01:42.704
and sipping a glass of champagne."

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:45.288
This is even worse:
"... then I'd have a picture taken

00:01:45.312 --> 00:01:46.656
and dozens of glossies made.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.176
Anyone begging for money
or trying to extort from me

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.951
would receive a copy
of the picture and nothing else."

00:01:51.975 --> 00:01:54.420
(Laughter)

00:01:54.444 --> 00:01:57.017
And so many of the comments
were exactly of this type,

00:01:57.041 --> 00:02:00.309
where people got money
and, in fact, it made them antisocial.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.521
So I told you it ruins people's lives
and their friends bug them.

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:05.737
Also, money often makes
us feel very selfish

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:07.576
and we do things only for ourselves.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.216
We thought maybe the reason money
doesn't make us happy

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.412
is that we're spending it
on the wrong things;

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:14.962
in particular, we're always
spending it on ourselves.

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:16.573
And we wondered what would happen

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:19.137
if we made people spend
more of their money on others.

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:21.384
So instead of being antisocial
with your money,

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:23.411
what if you were more pro-social with it?

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.279
We thought, let's make people
do it and see what happens.

00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:28.505
Let's have some people
do what they usually do,

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.807
spend money on themselves,

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.862
and let's make some people
give money away,

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:35.000
and measure their happiness
and see if, in fact, they get happier.

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:37.577
The first way we did this was,
one Vancouver morning,

00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:40.576
we went out on the campus
at University of British Columbia,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.664
approached people and said,
"Do you want to be in an experiment?"

00:02:43.688 --> 00:02:44.856
They said, "Yes."

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.981
We asked them how happy they were,
and then gave them an envelope.

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.319
One of the envelopes
had things in it that said,

00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:53.338
"By 5pm today,
spend this money on yourself."

00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:55.935
We gave some examples
of what you could spend it on.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.024
Other people got
a slip of paper that said,

00:02:58.048 --> 00:03:01.163
"By 5pm today, spend this money
on somebody else."

00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:03.377
Also inside the envelope was money.

00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.612
And we manipulated
how much money we gave them;

00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:08.263
some people got this slip
of paper and five dollars,

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.899
some got this slip
of paper and 20 dollars.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:13.930
We let them go about their day
and do whatever they wanted.

00:03:13.954 --> 00:03:16.931
We found out they did spend it
in the way we asked them to.

00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:19.872
We called them up and asked them,
"What did you spend it on?

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:21.212
How happy do you feel now?"

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:22.487
What did they spend it on?

00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:23.908
These are college undergrads;

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:26.047
a lot of what they spent it on
for themselves

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.867
were things like earrings and makeup.

00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:30.570
One woman said she bought
a stuffed animal for her niece.

00:03:30.594 --> 00:03:32.373
People gave money to homeless people.

00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:34.440
Huge effect here of Starbucks.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.188
(Laughter)

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:38.228
So if you give
undergraduates five dollars,

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:39.650
it looks like coffee to them,

00:03:39.674 --> 00:03:42.722
and they run over to Starbucks
and spend it as fast as they can.

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:46.056
Some people bought coffee for themselves,
the way they usually would,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.199
but others bought coffee
for somebody else.

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.899
So the very same purchase,

00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:53.237
just targeted toward yourself
or targeted toward somebody else.

00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.824
What did we find when we called
at the end of the day?

00:03:55.848 --> 00:03:57.983
People who spent money
on others got happier;

00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:00.497
people who spent it on themselves,
nothing happened.

00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:03.549
It didn't make them less happy,
it just didn't do much for them.

00:04:03.573 --> 00:04:06.676
The other thing we saw is the amount
of money doesn't matter much.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.345
People thought 20 dollars
would be way better than five.

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.826
In fact, it doesn't matter
how much money you spent.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.546
What really matters
is that you spent it on somebody else

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.741
rather than on yourself.

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:17.071
We see this again and again

00:04:17.095 --> 00:04:20.453
when we give people money to spend
on others instead of on themselves.

00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:22.743
Of course, these are
undergraduates in Canada --

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:24.982
not the world's most
representative population.

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:28.160
They're also fairly wealthy and affluent
and other sorts of things.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.950
We wanted to see if this holds true
everywhere in the world

00:04:30.974 --> 00:04:32.519
or just among wealthy countries.

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:35.349
So we went to Uganda
and ran a very similar experiment.

00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:37.726
Imagine, instead of just people
in Canada, we say,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.508
"Name the last time you spent
money on yourself or others.

00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:42.449
Describe it. How happy did it make you?"

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:45.891
Or in Uganda, "Name the last time
you spent money on yourself or others

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:47.072
and describe that."

00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:49.257
Then we asked them
how happy they are, again.

00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:50.961
And what we see is sort of amazing,

00:04:50.985 --> 00:04:54.030
because there's human universals
on what you do with your money,

00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:56.541
and real cultural differences
on what you do as well.

00:04:56.565 --> 00:04:59.869
So for example, one guy
from Uganda says this:

00:04:59.893 --> 00:05:01.769
"I called a girl I wished to love."

00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:03.576
They basically went out on a date,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.852
and he says at the end
that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.

00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:08.040
(Laughter)

00:05:08.064 --> 00:05:10.035
Here's a guy from Canada.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:11.766
Very similar thing.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.781
"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.

00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:15.646
We went to a movie, we left early,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.469
and then went back to her room
for ... cake," just cake.

00:05:19.493 --> 00:05:20.847
(Laughter)

00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:22.024
Human universal:

00:05:22.048 --> 00:05:24.284
you spend money on others,
you're being nice.

00:05:24.308 --> 00:05:26.373
Maybe you have something
in mind, maybe not.

00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:28.449
But then we see extraordinary differences.

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:29.626
So look at these two.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.004
This is a woman from Canada.

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:33.604
We say, "Name a time you spent
money on somebody else."

00:05:33.628 --> 00:05:35.605
She says, "I bought a present for my mom.

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.355
I drove to the mall, bought
a present, gave it to my mom."

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.682
Perfectly nice thing to do.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.761
It's good to get gifts
for people you know.

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:44.117
Compare that to this woman from Uganda:

00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:47.835
"I was walking and met a longtime friend
whose son was sick with malaria.

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:51.233
They had no money, they went to a clinic
and I gave her this money."

00:05:51.257 --> 00:05:53.466
This isn't $10,000,
it's the local currency.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.682
So it's a very small
amount of money, in fact.

00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:57.815
But enormously different motivations here.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.367
This is a real medical need,
literally a lifesaving donation.

00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:04.139
Above, it's just kind of,
I bought a gift for my mother.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:05.774
What we see again, though,

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:09.448
is that the specific way you spend
on other people isn't nearly as important

00:06:09.472 --> 00:06:13.422
as the fact that you spend on other people
in order to make yourself happy,

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.005
which is really quite important.

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.570
So you don't have to do
amazing things with your money

00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:18.745
to make yourself happy.

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:22.372
You can do small, trivial things and still
get the benefits from doing this.

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:23.805
These are only two countries.

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:26.778
We wanted to look at every country
in the world if we could,

00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:29.701
to see what the relationship is
between money and happiness.

00:06:29.725 --> 00:06:31.709
We got data from the Gallup Organization,

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:34.608
which you know from
all the political polls happening lately.

00:06:34.632 --> 00:06:37.565
They asked people, "Did you donate
money to charity recently?"

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:39.762
and, "How happy are you
with life in general?"

00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:42.663
We can see what the relationship is
between those two things.

00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:45.599
Are they positively correlated,
giving money makes you happy?

00:06:45.623 --> 00:06:47.263
Or are they negatively correlated?

00:06:47.287 --> 00:06:50.082
On this map, green will mean
they're positively correlated,

00:06:50.106 --> 00:06:52.026
red means they're negatively correlated.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.147
And you can see,
the world is crazily green.

00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:57.434
So in almost every country in the world
where we have this data,

00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.915
people who give money
to charity are happier people

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.069
than people who don't give
money to charity.

00:07:02.093 --> 00:07:04.707
I know you're looking
at the red country in the middle.

00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:06.885
I would be a jerk and not
tell you what it is,

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.544
but it's Central African Republic.

00:07:08.568 --> 00:07:09.720
You can make up stories.

00:07:09.744 --> 00:07:11.756
Maybe it's different there
for some reason.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.994
Just below that to the right
is Rwanda, though,

00:07:14.018 --> 00:07:15.232
which is amazingly green.

00:07:15.256 --> 00:07:16.642
So almost everywhere we look,

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:19.099
we see that giving money away
makes you happier

00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:20.669
than keeping it for yourself.

00:07:20.693 --> 00:07:23.658
What about work, which is where
we spend the rest of our time,

00:07:23.682 --> 00:07:25.544
when we're not with the people we know.

00:07:25.568 --> 00:07:28.791
We decided to infiltrate some companies
and do a very similar thing.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.620
These are sales teams in Belgium.

00:07:30.644 --> 00:07:33.693
They work in teams,
go out and sell to doctors

00:07:33.717 --> 00:07:35.293
and try to get them to buy drugs.

00:07:35.317 --> 00:07:37.463
We can look and see
how well they sell things

00:07:37.487 --> 00:07:39.730
as a function of being a member of a team.

00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:42.360
We give people on some teams some money

00:07:42.384 --> 00:07:44.348
"Spend it however you want on yourself,"

00:07:44.372 --> 00:07:46.622
just like we did
with the undergrads in Canada.

00:07:46.646 --> 00:07:50.316
To other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro.
Spend it on one of your teammates.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.004
Buy them something as a gift
and give it to them.

00:07:53.028 --> 00:07:55.728
Then we can see, we've got teams
that spend on themselves

00:07:55.752 --> 00:07:59.523
and these pro-social teams
who we give money to make the team better.

00:07:59.547 --> 00:08:01.576
The reason I have
a ridiculous pinata there

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.015
is one team pooled their money
and bought a pinata,

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:07.120
they smashed the pinata,
the candy fell out and things like that.

00:08:07.144 --> 00:08:08.584
A silly, trivial thing to do,

00:08:08.608 --> 00:08:11.913
but think of the difference on a team
that didn't do that at all,

00:08:11.937 --> 00:08:15.511
that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket,
maybe bought themselves a coffee,

00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:17.595
or teams that had
this pro-social experience

00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:20.910
where they bonded together
to buy something and do a group activity.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:24.003
What we see is that the teams
that are pro-social sell more stuff

00:08:24.027 --> 00:08:26.422
than the teams that only got
money for themselves.

00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:30.089
One way to think of it is: for every
15 euro you give people for themselves,

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:33.521
they put it in their pocket and don't do
anything different than before.

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:34.986
You don't get money from that;

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.089
you lose money, since it doesn't
motivate them to perform better.

00:08:38.113 --> 00:08:40.915
But when you give them 15 euro
to spend on their teammates,

00:08:40.939 --> 00:08:42.713
they do so much better on their teams

00:08:42.737 --> 00:08:45.831
that you actually get a huge win
on investing this kind of money.

00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:48.537
You're probably thinking
to yourselves, this is all fine,

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:51.764
but there's a context that's incredibly
important for public policy,

00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:53.702
and I can't imagine it would work there.

00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:55.833
And if he doesn't show me
that it works here,

00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:57.471
I don't believe anything he said.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.282
I know what you're all thinking
about are dodgeball teams.

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.697
(Laughter)

00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:03.576
This was a huge criticism that we got,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.781
that if you can't show it
with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.

00:09:06.805 --> 00:09:10.988
So we went and found these dodgeball
teams and infiltrated them,

00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:12.890
and did the exact same thing as before.

00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:15.834
So we give people on some teams
money to spend on themselves.

00:09:15.858 --> 00:09:19.576
Other teams, we give them money
to spend on their dodgeball teammates.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.576
The teams that spend money on themselves

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.786
have the same winning
percentages as before.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.229
The teams we give the money
to spend on each other

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:27.408
become different teams;

00:09:27.432 --> 00:09:29.983
they dominate the league
by the time they're done.

00:09:30.007 --> 00:09:32.016
Across all of these different contexts --

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.648
your personal life, you work life,
even things like intramural sports --

00:09:35.672 --> 00:09:38.482
we see spending on other people
has a bigger return for you

00:09:38.506 --> 00:09:40.480
than spending on yourself.

00:09:40.504 --> 00:09:44.305
So if you think money can't buy happiness,
you're not spending it right.

00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:47.909
The implication isn't you should buy
this product instead of that product,

00:09:47.933 --> 00:09:50.063
and that's the way
to make yourself happier.

00:09:50.087 --> 00:09:53.722
It's that you should stop thinking
about which product to buy for yourself,

00:09:53.746 --> 00:09:56.576
and try giving some of it
to other people instead.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.104
And we luckily have
an opportunity for you.

00:09:59.128 --> 00:10:03.198
DonorsChoose.org is a nonprofit
for mainly public school teachers

00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:04.655
in low-income schools.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:05.972
They post projects like,

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:09.016
"I want to teach Huckleberry Finn
and we don't have the books,"

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.526
or, "I want a microscope
to teach my students science

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.079
and we don't have a microscope."

00:10:13.103 --> 00:10:15.054
You and I can go on and buy it for them.

00:10:15.078 --> 00:10:17.553
The teacher and the kids
write you thank-you notes,

00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:20.390
sometimes they send pictures
of them using the microscope.

00:10:20.414 --> 00:10:21.760
It's an extraordinary thing.

00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:24.900
Go to the website and start yourself
on the process of thinking

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:27.028
less about "How can I spend
money on myself?"

00:10:27.052 --> 00:10:29.909
and more about "If I've got
five dollars or 15 dollars,

00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:32.078
what can I do to benefit other people?"

00:10:32.102 --> 00:10:35.588
Ultimately, when you do that, you'll find
you benefit yourself much more.

00:10:35.612 --> 00:10:36.803
Thank you.

00:10:36.827 --> 00:10:38.230
(Applause)
