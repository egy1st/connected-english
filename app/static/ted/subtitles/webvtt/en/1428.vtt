00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.009
You probably already know

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.723
everything is made up
of little tiny things called atoms

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.708
or even that each atom
is made up of even smaller particles

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:22.854
called protons, neutrons and electrons.

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:25.165
And you've probably heard
that atoms are small.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.349
But I bet you haven't ever thought
about how small atoms really are.

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:33.089
Well, the answer is
that they are really, really small.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.947
So you ask, just how small are atoms?

00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:40.044
To understand this,
let's ask this question:

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:41.976
How many atoms are in a grapefruit?

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:46.150
Well, let's assume that the grapefruit
is made up of only nitrogen atoms,

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:49.832
which isn't at all true, but there
are nitrogen atoms in a grapefruit.

00:00:49.856 --> 00:00:52.887
To help you visualize this,
let's blow up each of the atoms

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:54.724
to the size of a blueberry.

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:57.896
And then how big
would the grapefruit have to be?

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.949
It would have to be the same size of
-- well, actually, the Earth.

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:02.989
That's crazy!

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:05.834
You mean to say that if I filled
the Earth with blueberries,

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:08.835
I would have the same number
of nitrogen atoms as a grapefruit?

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:09.859
That's right!

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:11.791
So how big is the atom?

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:14.502
Well, it's really, really small!

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.976
And you know what?
It gets even more crazy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.773
Let's now look inside of each atom
-- and thus the blueberry, right? --

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:22.910
What do you see there?

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.655
In the center of the atom
is something called the nucleus,

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.406
which contains protons and neutrons,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.491
and on the outside, you'd see electrons.

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:30.976
So how big is the nucleus?

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.516
If atoms are like blueberries
in the Earth,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.317
how big would the nucleus be?

00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:38.558
You might remember the old pictures
of the atom from science class,

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:42.345
where you saw this tiny dot on the page
with an arrow pointing to the nucleus.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.764
Well, those pictures,
they're not drawn to scale,

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.403
so they're kind of wrong.

00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:47.983
So how big is the nucleus?

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.976
So if you popped open the blueberry
and were searching for the nucleus ...

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:55.482
You know what? It would be invisible.

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:57.148
It's too small to see!

00:01:57.944 --> 00:02:00.720
OK. Let's blow up the atom --
the blueberry --

00:02:00.744 --> 00:02:01.976
to the size of a house.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.738
So imagine a ball that is as tall
as a two-story house.

00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:08.239
Let's look for the nucleus
in the center of the atom.

00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:11.558
And do you know what?
It would just barely be visible.

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:14.962
So to get our minds wrapped
around how big the nucleus is,

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:18.976
we need to blow up the blueberry,
up to the size of a football stadium.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
So imagine a ball the size
of a football stadium,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.976
and right smack dab
in the center of the atom,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.334
you would find the nucleus,
and you could see it!

00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:30.902
And it would be the size
of a small marble.

00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:34.677
And there's more, if I haven't
blown your mind by now.

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.321
Let's consider the atom some more.

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.542
It contains protons,
neutrons and electrons.

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.995
The protons and neutrons
live inside of the nucleus,

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.210
and contain almost
all of the mass of the atom.

00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:44.976
Way on the edge are the electrons.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.976
So if an atom is like a ball
the size of a football stadium,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.905
with the nucleus in the center,
and the electrons on the edge,

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.215
what is in between the nucleus
and the electrons?

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:57.111
Surprisingly, the answer is empty space.

00:02:57.987 --> 00:03:00.557
(Wind noise)

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.976
That's right. Empty!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.305
Between the nucleus and the electrons,
there are vast regions of empty space.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.901
Now, technically there are
some electromagnetic fields,

00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:11.836
but in terms of stuff,
matter, it is empty.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.383
Remember this vast region of empty space
is inside the blueberry,

00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:17.302
which is inside the Earth,

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:19.511
which really are the atoms
in the grapefruit.

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:22.976
OK, one more thing,
if I can even get more bizarre.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.355
Since virtually all the mass
of an atom is in the nucleus --

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.028
now, there is some amount
of mass in the electrons,

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:32.073
but most of it is in the nucleus --

00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:33.869
how dense is the nucleus?

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:35.812
Well, the answer is crazy.

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:37.726
The density of a typical nucleus

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.976
is four times 10 to the 17th
kilograms per meter cubed.

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:44.944
But that's hard to visualize.
OK, I'll put it in English units.

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:48.976
2.5 times 10 to the 16th pounds
per cubic feet.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:51.769
OK, that's still kind of hard to figure.

00:03:51.793 --> 00:03:53.894
OK, here's what I want you to do.

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:57.442
Make a box that is one foot
by one foot by one foot.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:01.153
Now let's go and grab
all of the nuclei from a typical car.

00:04:01.177 --> 00:04:03.511
Now, cars on average weigh two tons.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:07.071
How many cars' nuclei would you
have to put into the box

00:04:07.095 --> 00:04:10.048
to have your one-foot-box have
the same density of the nucleus?

00:04:10.072 --> 00:04:11.400
Is it one car? Two?

00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:12.424
How about 100?

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:15.148
Nope, nope and nope.

00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:17.064
The answer is much bigger.

00:04:17.702 --> 00:04:20.497
It is 6.2 billion.

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:24.196
That is almost equal to the number
of people in the Earth.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.554
So if everyone in the Earth
owned their own car --

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:27.909
and they don't --

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.148
(Cars honking)

00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:31.372
and we put all of those
cars into your box ...

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.634
That would be about
the density of a nucleus.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.453
So I'm saying that if you took
every car in the world

00:04:39.477 --> 00:04:41.808
and put it into your one-foot box,

00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:43.976
you would have the density of one nucleus.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.212
OK, let's review.

00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:46.896
The atom is really,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.218
really, really small.

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:52.608
Think atoms in a grapefruit
like blueberries in the Earth.

00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:56.024
The nucleus is crazy small.

00:04:56.048 --> 00:04:57.717
Now look inside the blueberry,

00:04:57.741 --> 00:05:00.156
and blow it up to the size
of a football stadium,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.323
and now the nucleus
is a marble in the middle.

00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:06.997
The atom is made up
of vast regions of empty space.

00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:08.608
That's weird.

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:10.852
The nucleus has a crazy-high density.

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:13.353
Think of putting all those cars
in your one-foot box.

00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:16.129
I think I'm tired.
