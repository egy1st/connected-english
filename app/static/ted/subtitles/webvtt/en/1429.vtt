WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's a great honor to be here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's a great honor to be here talking about cities,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
talking about the future of cities.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's great to be here as a mayor.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I really do believe that mayors have the political position

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to really change people's lives.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's the place to be.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Rio's a beautiful city,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a vibrant place, special place.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Actually, you're looking at a guy

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
who has the best job in the world.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I really wanted to share with you

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a very special moment of my life

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the history of the city of Rio.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
(Video) Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the envelope containing the result.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Jacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that the games of the 31st Olympiad

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
(Cheering)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
EP: Okay, that's very touching, very emotional,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but it was not easy to get there.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Actually it was a very hard challenge.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We had to beat the European monarchy.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is Juan Carlos, king of Spain.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We had to beat the most powerful man in the world

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
defending his own city.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So it was not easy at all.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that I think fits perfectly to the situation

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
of Rio winning the Olympic bid.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We really showed that, yes, we can.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And really, this is the reason I came here tonight.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I came here tonight to tell you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that things can be done,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that you don't have always to be rich or powerful

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to get things on the way,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that cities are a great challenge.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's a difficult task to deal with cities.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But with some original ways

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
of getting things done,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
with some basic commandments,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you can really get cities

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to be a great, great place to live.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I want you all to imagine Rio.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You probably think about a city full of energy,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
a vibrant city full of green.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And nobody showed that better

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
than Carlos Saldanha in last year's "Rio."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
(Music)

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
(Video) Bird: This is incredible.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Music)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
EP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but it's not like that everywhere.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We're like every big city in the world.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We've got lots of people,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
pollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
These pictures I'm showing here,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
they are some pictures from Madureira.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's like the heart of the suburb in Rio.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And I want to use an example of Rio

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that we're doing in Madureira, in this region,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to see what we should think as our first commandment.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So every time you see a concrete jungle like that,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what you've got to do is find open spaces.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If you don't have open spaces,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
you've got to go there and open spaces.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So go inside these open spaces

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and make it that people can get inside

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and use those spaces.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This is going to be the third largest park in Rio

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
by June this year.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It's going to be a place where people can meet,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
where you can put nature.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The temperature's going to drop two, three degrees centigrade.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So the first commandment

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I want to leave you tonight

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
is, a city of the future

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
has to be environmentally friendly.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Every time you think of a city,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
you've got to think green.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You've got to think green and green.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Let's think that cities are made of people,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
lots of people together.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
cities are packed with people.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So how do you move these people around?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
When you have 3.5 billion people living in cities --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
by 2050, it's going to be 6 billion people.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So every time you think about moving these people around,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
you think about high-capacity transportation.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But there is a problem.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
High-capacity transportation means

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
spending lots and lots of money.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So what I'm going to show here

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is something that was already presented in TED

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
by the former mayor of Curitiba

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
who created that, a city in Brazil, Jaime Lerner.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And it's something that we're doing, again, lots in Rio.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You transform it inside as a train car.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You use separate lanes, dedicated lanes.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The contractors, they don't like that.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
You don't have to dig deep down underground.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You can build nice stations.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Again, you don't have to dig deep down underground

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to make a station like that.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This station has the same comfort, the same features

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
as a subway station.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
A kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So spending much less money and doing it much faster,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
you can really change the way people move.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
This is a map of Rio.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
All the lines, the colored lines you see there,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
it's our high-capacity transportation network.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
In this present time today,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
we only carry 18 percent of our population

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
in high-capacity transportation.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
With the BRTs we're doing,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
again, the cheapest and fastest way,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
we're going to move to 63 percent of the population

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
being carried by high-capacity transportation.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So remember what I said:

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
You don't always have to be rich or powerful

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to get things done.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You can find original ways to get things done.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So the second commandment I want to leave you tonight

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
is, a city of the future

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
has to deal with mobility and integration

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
of its people.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Moving to the third commandment.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And this is the most controversial one.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It has to do with the favelas, the slums --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
whatever you call it, there are different names all over the world.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But the point we want to make here tonight

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
is, favelas are not always a problem.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I mean, favelas can sometimes

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
really be a solution,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
if you deal with them,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
if you put public policy inside the favelas.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Let me just show a map of Rio again.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
More than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
All these red parts are favelas.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So you see, they are spread all over the city.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is a typical view of a favela in Rio.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
You see the contrast between the rich and poor.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The first one is,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
you can change from what I call a [vicious] circle

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
to a virtual circle.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
But what you've got to do to get that

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
is you've got to go inside the favelas,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
bring in the basic services --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
mainly education and health -- with high quality.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I'm going to give a fast example here.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This was an old building in a favela in Rio --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
[unclear favela name] --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that we just transformed into a primary school,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
with high quality.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
This is primary assistance in health

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that we built inside a favela,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
again, with high quality.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
We call it a family clinic.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So the first point is bring basic services

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
inside the favelas

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
with high quality.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The second point I want to make about the favelas

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
is, you've got to open spaces in the favela.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Bring infrastructure

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to the favelas, to the slums, wherever you are.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Rio has the aim, by 2020,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to have all its favelas completely urbanized.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Another example, this was completely packed with houses,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and then we built this, what we call, a knowledge square.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
This is a place with high technology

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
can go inside and have access to all technology.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
We even built a theater there -- 3D movie.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And this is the kind of change you can get for that.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
which is this great laugh

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
from a kid that lives in the favela.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
is, a city of the future

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
has to be socially integrated.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
You cannot deal with a city

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
if it's not socially integrated.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But moving to our fourth commandment,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I really wouldn't be here tonight.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Between November and May, Rio's completely packed.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We just had last week Carnivale.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It was great. It was lots of fun.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
We have New Year's Eve.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
There's like two million people on Copacabana Beach.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We have problems.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
We fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
You can imagine how people get happy with me

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
watching these kinds of scenes.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
We have problems with the tropical rains.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Almost every year

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
we have these landslides, which are terrible.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But the reason I could come here

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
is because of that.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
This was something we did with IBM

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that's a little bit more than a year old.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It's what we call the Operations Center of Rio.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And I wanted to show that I can govern my city, using technology,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
from here, from Long Beach,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
so I got here last night and I know everything.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
We're going to speak now to the Operations Center.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This is Osorio,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
he's our secretary of urban affairs.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So Osorio, good to be there with you.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I've already told the people

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that we have tropical rain this time of year.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So how's the weather in Rio now?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Osorio: The weather is fine. We have fair weather today.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Let me get you our weather satellite radar.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You see just a little bit of moisture around the city.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
today and in the next few days.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
EP: Okay, how's the traffic?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
We, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
People get mad at the mayor. So how's the traffic tonight?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Osario: Well traffic tonight is fine.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Let me get you one of our 8,000 buses.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
A live transmission in downtown Rio for you, Mr. Mayor.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You see, the streets are clear.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Now it's 11:00 pm in Rio.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Nothing of concern in terms of traffic.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I'll get to you now the incidents of the day.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
We had heavy traffic early in the morning

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and in the rush hour in the afternoon,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
but nothing of big concern.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
We are below average

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
in terms of traffic incidents in the city.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
EP: Okay, so you're showing now some public services.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
These are the cars.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Osorio: Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This is live transmission.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We have GPS's in all of our trucks.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And you can see them working

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
in all parts of the city.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Waste collection on time.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Public services working well.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
EP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
It was great to have you here.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
(Applause)

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Okay, so no files, this place, no paperwork,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
no distance, 24/7 working.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
is, a city of the future

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
has to use technology to be present.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But everything that I said here tonight, or the commandments,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
are means, are ways,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
for us to govern cities --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
invest in infrastructure, invest in the green,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
open parks, open spaces,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
integrate socially, use technology.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
But at the end of the day, when we talk about cities,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
we talk about a gathering of people.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And we cannot see that as a problem.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
That is fantastic.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
If there's 3.5 billion now,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
it's going to be six billion then it's going to be 10 billion.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
That is great, that means we're going to have

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
10 billion minds working together,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
10 billion talents together.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So a city of the future,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I really do believe

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
that it's a city that cares about its citizens,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
integrates socially its citizens.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
of this great party, which are cities.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Thank you very much.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
(Applause)
