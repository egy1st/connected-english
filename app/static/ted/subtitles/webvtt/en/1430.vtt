00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:03.984
To most of you, this is a device

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:06.992
to buy, sell, play games,

00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:08.902
watch videos.

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:11.042
I think it might be a lifeline.

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:13.458
I think actually it might be able to save more lives

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:14.958
than penicillin.

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.431
Texting:

00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:19.250
I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.500
a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see --

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.125
hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else --

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.917
or trying to translate the abbreviations

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.875
LOL, LMAO, HMU.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:31.708
I can help you with those later.

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:33.750
But the parents in the room

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.375
know that texting is actually

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.000
the best way to communicate with your kids.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.833
It might be the only way to communicate with your kids.

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:42.500
(Laughter)

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.125
The average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month,

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:50.625
unless she's a girl, then it's closer to 4,000.

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:54.208
And the secret is she opens every single one.

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:57.917
Texting has a 100 percent open rate.

00:00:57.917 --> 00:00:59.333
Now the parents are really alarmed.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.167
It's a 100 percent open rate

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:02.917
even if she doesn't respond to you

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:04.667
when you ask her when she's coming home for dinner.

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:06.208
I promise she read that text.

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:12.292
And this isn't some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon.

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:13.667
Texting actually overindexes

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.750
for minority and urban youth.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.625
I know this because at DoSomething.org,

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.333
which is the largest organization

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.292
for teenagers and social change in America,

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.750
about six months ago we pivoted

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.375
and started focusing on text messaging.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:30.583
We're now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:33.292
about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:36.458
or to work on homeless issues and things like that.

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:39.875
We're finding it 11 times more powerful than email.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:45.958
We've also found an unintended consequence.

00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.000
We've been getting text messages back like these.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.250
"I don't want to go to school today.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.125
The boys call me faggot."

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:58.708
"I was cutting, my parents found out,

00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:00.583
and so I stopped.

00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:02.792
But I just started again an hour ago."

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:06.083
Or, "He won't stop raping me.

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:07.458
He told me not to tell anyone.

00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:10.250
It's my dad. Are you there?"

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.375
That last one's an actual text message that we received.

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:16.125
And yeah, we're there.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.667
I will not forget the day we got that text message.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.083
And so it was that day that we decided

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:24.208
we needed to build a crisis text hotline.

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:25.708
Because this isn't what we do.

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:27.042
We do social change.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.042
Kids are just sending us these text messages

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:31.958
because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.750
and there's nowhere else to turn

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.333
that they're sending them to us.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.625
So think about it, a text hotline; it's pretty powerful.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.333
It's fast, it's pretty private.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:43.750
No one hears you in a stall, you're just texting quietly.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.792
It's real time.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:48.954
We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals.

00:02:48.954 --> 00:02:51.208
That's great.

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:55.625
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.125
Because I'm not really comfortable just helping that girl

00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.875
with counseling and referrals.

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:03.375
I want to prevent this shit from happening.

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.708
So think about a cop.

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:08.458
There's something in New York City.

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:11.000
The police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.583
And then they started crime mapping.

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:15.958
And so they started following and watching

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.000
petty thefts, summonses, all kinds of things --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.750
charting the future essentially.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.458
And they found things like,

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:25.083
when you see crystal meth on the street,

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:26.708
if you add police presence,

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:29.833
you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:33.417
of assaults and robberies that would happen.

00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:34.542
In fact, the year after

00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:37.167
the NYPD put CompStat in place,

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:40.333
the murder rate fell 60 percent.

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:44.875
So think about the data from a crisis text line.

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:48.250
There is no census on bullying and dating abuse

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.167
and eating disorders and cutting and rape --

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:52.917
no census.

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:55.250
Maybe there's some studies, some longitudinal studies,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.875
that cost lots of money and took lots of time.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:00.250
Or maybe there's some anecdotal evidence.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.250
Imagine having real time data

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.917
on every one of those issues.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:06.708
You could inform legislation.

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:08.500
You could inform school policy.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.583
You could say to a principal,

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.375
"You're having a problem every Thursday at three o'clock.

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.333
What's going on in your school?"

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:17.875
You could see the immediate impact of legislation

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:20.167
or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:23.708
and see what happens as a result.

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:25.375
This is really, to me,

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:28.750
the power of texting and the power of data.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.000
Because while people are talking about data,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.583
making it possible for Facebook

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.833
to mine my friend from the third grade,

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:37.792
or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers,

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:40.792
or some dude to build a better baseball team,

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:45.958
I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.083
to help that kid go to school,

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:50.167
to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:54.083
and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her.

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:56.875
Thank you.

00:04:56.875 --> 00:05:01.625
(Applause)
