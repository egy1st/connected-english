00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:04.244
Five hundred seventy-one million

00:00:04.244 --> 00:00:10.551
two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:12.438
are used by Americans

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:16.109
every year.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.164
If we could -- correction, wrong figure --

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:21.515
13 billion used every year.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.618
If we could reduce the usage of paper towels,

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:27.800
one paper towel per person per day,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.681
571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.816
We can do that.

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:40.746
Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:44.977
There's the tri-fold. People typically take two or three.

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:49.140
There's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.404
People go one, two, three, four, tear.

00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:52.842
This much, right?

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:55.307
There's the one that cuts itself.

00:00:55.307 --> 00:00:59.447
People go, one, two, three, four.

00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:03.522
Or there's the same thing, but recycled paper,

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:08.035
you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent, of course.

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:14.556
The fact is, you can do it all with one towel.

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:16.596
The key, two words:

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:21.044
This half of the room, your word is "shake."

00:01:21.044 --> 00:01:23.226
Let's hear it. Shake. Louder.

00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.771
Audience: Shake.

00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:26.947
Joe Smith: Your word is "fold."

00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:28.063
Audience: Fold.

00:01:28.063 --> 00:01:28.990
JS: Again.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.059
Audience: Fold. JS: Really loud.

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:32.607
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:01:32.607 --> 00:01:36.767
JS: OK. Wet hands.

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:41.567
Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.505
Why 12? Twelve apostles, twelve tribes,

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:48.612
twelve zodiac signs, twelve months. The one I like the best:

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:50.809
It's the biggest number with one syllable.

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:55.071
(Laughter)

00:01:55.071 --> 00:02:02.431
Tri-fold. Fold ...

00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.983
Dry.

00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:08.215
(Applause)

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:13.429
Audience: Shake.

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.361
Fold.

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:18.939
JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.821
because it allows interstitial suspension.

00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:26.299
You don't have to remember that part, but trust me.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.352
(Laughter)

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:38.069
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.731
JS: Cuts itself.

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:44.888
You know the funny thing is,

00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:47.063
I get my hands drier than people do with three or four,

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:49.511
because they can't get in between the cracks.

00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:52.655
If you think this isn't as good...

00:02:52.655 --> 00:03:01.124
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:03:01.124 --> 00:03:04.692
JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention,

00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:07.099
it's the one where you wave your hand

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.890
and it kicks it out.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.976
It's way too big a towel.

00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:12.003
Let me tell you a secret.

00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.090
If you're really quick, if you're really quick --

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.670
and I can prove this --

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.519
this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.886
How? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.

00:03:23.886 --> 00:03:25.558
It's smart enough to stop.

00:03:25.558 --> 00:03:29.550
And you get half a towel.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:42.827
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:49.661
JS: Now, let's all say it together. Shake. Fold.

00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:53.804
You will for the rest of your life remember those words

00:03:53.804 --> 00:03:56.787
every time you pick up a paper towel.

00:03:56.787 --> 00:04:01.875
And remember, one towel per person for one year --

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:06.595
571,230,000 pounds of paper. No small thing.

00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:08.843
And next year, toilet paper.

00:04:08.843 --> 00:04:10.219
(Laughter)
