00:00:00.713 --> 00:00:03.159
When we think of games,
there's all kinds of things.

00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:06.568
Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe,
you're looking forward to a new game.

00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:08.450
You've been up too late playing a game.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:09.937
All these things happen to me.

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.396
But when we think about games,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.590
a lot of times we think
about stuff like this:

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:16.645
first-person shooters, or the big,
what we would call AAA games,

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.543
or maybe you're a Facebook game player.

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:20.442
This is one my partner and I worked on.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.769
Maybe you play Facebook games,
and that's what we're making right now.

00:00:23.793 --> 00:00:25.295
This is a lighter form of game.

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.922
Maybe you think about
the tragically boring board games

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:30.188
that hold us hostage
in Thanksgiving situations.

00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:33.951
This would be one of the tragically boring
board games that you can figure out.

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:35.740
Or maybe you're in your living room,

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:37.621
playing with the Wii with the kids,

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:41.379
and there's this whole range of games,
and that's very much what I think about.

00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:44.344
I make my living from games,
I've been lucky enough to do this

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:47.805
since I was 15, which also qualifies
as I've never really had a real job.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.707
But we think about games as fun,
and that's completely reasonable,

00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:53.345
but let's just think about this.

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.933
So this one here,
this is the 1980 Olympics.

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:57.924
Now I don't know where you guys were,

00:00:57.948 --> 00:00:59.323
but I was in my living room.

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:01.149
It was practically a religious event.

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:03.760
And this is when the Americans
beat the Russians,

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:06.023
and this was --
yes, it was technically a game.

00:01:06.047 --> 00:01:07.374
Hockey is a game.

00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:09.144
But really, was this a game?

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:10.907
I mean, people cried.

00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:14.272
I've never seen my mother cry
like that at the end of Monopoly.

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:15.438
(Laughter)

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:17.814
And so this was an amazing experience.

00:01:17.838 --> 00:01:20.348
Or, if anybody here is from Boston --

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:23.425
So when the Boston Red Sox
won the World Series

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:26.356
after I believe, 351 years --

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.657
(Laughter)

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:29.940
when they won the World Series,
it was amazing.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.362
I happened to be living
in Springfield at the time,

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:34.381
and the best part of it was,

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:37.018
you would close the women's door
in the bathroom,

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:39.933
and I remember seeing "Go Sox,"
and I thought, really?

00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:43.006
Or the houses, you'd come out,
because every game,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.814
well, I think almost every game,
went into overtime, right?

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:49.187
So we'd be outside, and all the other
lights are on in the whole block.

00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:52.271
And kids -- the attendance
was down in school,

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:55.443
kids weren't going to school,
but it's OK, it's the Red Sox, right?

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:58.114
I mean, there's education,
and then there's the Red Sox,

00:01:58.138 --> 00:01:59.903
and we know where they're stacked.

00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:01.748
So this was an amazing experience,

00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:05.261
and again, yes, it was a game,
but they didn't write newspaper articles,

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:09.604
people didn't say, "You know, really,
I can die now, because the Red Sox won."

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:11.078
And many people did.

00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:14.047
So games, it means something more to us.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.940
It absolutely means something more.

00:02:15.964 --> 00:02:18.213
So now, this is an abrupt transition here.

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.539
There was three years where
I actually did have a real job, sort of.

00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:24.119
I was the head of a college
department teaching games,

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:25.918
so, again, it was sort of a real job,

00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:29.579
and now I got to talk about making them
as opposed to making them.

00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:32.875
Part of the job of it,
when you're a chair of a department,

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.709
is to eat, and I did that very well --

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:37.574
and so I'm out at a dinner
with this guy called Zig Jackson.

00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:41.152
So this is Zig in this photograph,
this is also one of Zig's photographs.

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:42.337
He's a photographer.

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:47.403
And he goes all around the country
taking pictures of himself,

00:02:47.427 --> 00:02:50.799
and you can see here he's got
Zig's Indian Reservation.

00:02:51.126 --> 00:02:52.646
And this particular shot --

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.795
this is one of the more traditional shots.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.482
This is a rain dancer.

00:02:57.506 --> 00:02:59.604
And this is one of my favorite shots here.

00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:02.883
So you can look at this, and maybe
you've even seen things like this.

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:04.831
This is an expression of culture, right?

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:07.400
And this is actually
from his Degradation series.

00:03:07.424 --> 00:03:09.903
And what was most fascinating
to me about this series

00:03:09.927 --> 00:03:12.559
is just, look at that little boy there,
can you imagine?

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.834
We can see that's
a traditional Native American.

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:16.896
Now I just want to change that guy's race.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.817
Just imagine if that's a black guy.

00:03:18.841 --> 00:03:22.321
So, "Honey, come here, let's get you
a picture with the black guy." Right?

00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:24.155
Like, seriously, nobody would do this.

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:25.564
It baffles the mind.

00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:28.469
And so Zig, being Indian,
likewise it baffles his mind.

00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:29.739
His favorite photograph --

00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:32.641
my favorite photograph of his,
which I don't have in here --

00:03:32.665 --> 00:03:35.904
is Indian taking picture of white people
taking pictures of Indians.

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:37.438
(Laughter)

00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:39.857
So I happen to be at dinner
with this photographer,

00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:41.932
and he was talking
with another photographer

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:43.645
about a shooting that had occurred,

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.389
and it was on an Indian Reservation.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:47.669
He'd taken his camera up there
to photograph it,

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:50.273
but when he got there,
he discovered he couldn't do it.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:52.079
He just couldn't capture the picture.

00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:54.998
And so they were talking back and forth
about this question.

00:03:55.022 --> 00:03:56.940
Do you take the picture or not?

00:03:56.964 --> 00:03:59.345
And that was fascinating
to me as a game designer,

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:00.800
because it never occurs to me,

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.972
should I make the game
about this difficult topic or not?

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:05.910
Because we just make things that are fun

00:04:05.934 --> 00:04:09.415
or will make you feel fear,
that visceral excitement.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.396
But every other medium does it.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.589
So this is my kid.

00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:15.286
This is Maezza, and when she was
seven years old,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.950
she came home from school one day,

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:20.228
and like I do every single day,
I asked her, "What did you do today?"

00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:22.598
So she said, "We talked
about the Middle Passage."

00:04:22.622 --> 00:04:24.976
Now, this was a big moment.
Maezza's dad is black,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.599
and I knew this day was coming.

00:04:27.623 --> 00:04:30.739
I wasn't expecting it at seven,
I don't know why, but I wasn't.

00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:34.116
Anyways, so I asked her,
"How do you feel about that?"

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.697
So she proceeded to tell me,

00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:39.230
and so any of you who are parents
will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.

00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:41.927
"The ships start in England,
they come down from England,

00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:44.141
they go to Africa,
they go across the ocean --

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:45.810
that's the Middle Passage part --

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:49.033
they come to America, where
the slaves are sold," she's telling me.

00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:51.065
But Abraham Lincoln was elected president,

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:53.380
and then he passed
the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:04:53.404 --> 00:04:54.571
and now they're free.

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:55.899
Pause for about 10 seconds.

00:04:55.923 --> 00:04:57.237
"Can I play a game, Mommy?"

00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:59.349
And I thought, that's it?
And so, you know,

00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:05.161
this is the Middle Passage,
this is an incredibly significant event,

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:09.100
and she's treating it like, basically
some black people went on a cruise,

00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:11.132
this is more or less how it sounds to her.

00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:12.313
(Laughter)

00:05:12.337 --> 00:05:15.203
And so, to me,
I wanted more value in this,

00:05:15.227 --> 00:05:18.407
so when she asked
if she could play a game, I said, "Yes."

00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:19.616
(Laughter)

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.121
And so I happened to have
all of these little pieces.

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:25.244
I'm a game designer, so I have
this stuff sitting around my house.

00:05:25.268 --> 00:05:28.521
I said, "Yeah, you can play a game,"
and I give her a bunch of these,

00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:30.955
and I tell her to paint them
in different families.

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.066
These are pictures of Maezza
when she was --

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.032
God, it still chokes me up seeing these.

00:05:35.056 --> 00:05:36.881
So she's painting her little families.

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:39.541
So then I grab a bunch of them
and I put them on a boat.

00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:42.271
This was the boat,
it was made quickly, obviously.

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:45.417
And so the basic gist of it is,
I grabbed a bunch of families,

00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:47.877
and she's like, "Mommy,
but you forgot the pink baby

00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:49.319
and you forgot the blue daddy

00:05:49.343 --> 00:05:51.215
and you forgot all these other things."

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:52.777
And she says, "They want to go."

00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:55.017
And I said, "Honey,
no, they don't want to go.

00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:58.346
This is the Middle Passage, Nobody wants
to go on the Middle Passage."

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.252
So she gave me a look that only a daughter
of a game designer would give a mother,

00:06:02.276 --> 00:06:05.048
and as we're going across the ocean,
following these rules,

00:06:05.072 --> 00:06:07.131
she realizes that she's rolling
pretty high,

00:06:07.155 --> 00:06:09.444
and she says to me,
"We're not going to make it."

00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:11.585
And she realizes,
we don't have enough food,

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:12.926
and so she asks what to do,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.680
and I say -- remember, she's seven --

00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:17.740
"We can either put
some people in the water

00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:19.635
or we can hope that they don't get sick

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.281
and we make it to the other side."

00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:23.876
Just the look on her face came over --

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.527
now mind you this is after a month of --

00:06:26.551 --> 00:06:28.230
this is Black History Month, right?

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:31.896
After a month, she says to me,
"Did this really happen?"

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.986
And I said, "Yes." And so she said --

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.657
this is her brother and sister --

00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.659
"If I came out of the woods,
Avalon and Donovan might be gone."

00:06:39.683 --> 00:06:40.850
"Yes."

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:42.682
"But I'd get to see them in America."

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:43.857
"No."

00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.410
"But what if I saw them?
Couldn't we stay together?"

00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:47.685
"So Daddy could be gone."

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:48.867
"Yes."

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:51.328
She was fascinated by this,
and she started to cry,

00:06:51.352 --> 00:06:54.751
I started to cry, her father started
to cry, and now we're all crying.

00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:58.648
He didn't expect to come home from work
to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.

00:06:58.672 --> 00:07:00.765
And so, we made this game, and she got it.

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.345
She got it because she spent time
with these people.

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:06.614
It wasn't abstract stuff
in a brochure or in a movie.

00:07:06.638 --> 00:07:09.706
And so it was just an incredibly
powerful experience.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.710
This is the game, which I've ended up
calling "The New World,"

00:07:12.734 --> 00:07:14.016
because I like the phrase.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.824
I don't think the New World
felt too new worldly exciting

00:07:16.848 --> 00:07:19.279
to the people who were
brought over on slave ships.

00:07:19.303 --> 00:07:22.389
But when this happened,
I saw the whole planet; I was so excited.

00:07:22.413 --> 00:07:24.799
I'd been making games for 20-some years,

00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:26.822
and then I decided to do it again.

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.262
My history is Irish.

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:31.418
So this is a game called "Síochán Leat."
It's "peace be with you."

00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:33.973
It's the entire history
of my family in a single game.

00:07:33.997 --> 00:07:36.496
I made another game called "Train."

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.575
I was making a series of six games
that covered difficult topics,

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.309
and if you're going to cover a difficult
topic, this is one you need to cover,

00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:46.061
and I'll let you figure out
what that's about on your own.

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:48.938
And I also made a game
about the Trail of Tears.

00:07:48.962 --> 00:07:51.416
This is a game
with 50,000 individual pieces.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.824
I was crazy when I decided to start it,
but I'm in the middle of it now.

00:07:54.848 --> 00:07:56.075
It's the same thing.

00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:59.026
I'm hoping that I'll teach
culture through these games.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.352
And the one I'm working
on right now, which is --

00:08:01.376 --> 00:08:03.202
because I'm right in the middle of it,

00:08:03.226 --> 00:08:05.692
and these for some reason
choke me up like crazy --

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.771
is a game called
"Mexican Kitchen Workers."

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:10.240
And originally, it was
a math problem, more or less.

00:08:10.264 --> 00:08:12.331
Here's the economics
of illegal immigration.

00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:14.556
And the more I learned
about Mexican culture --

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.850
my partner is Mexican —
the more I learned that,

00:08:16.874 --> 00:08:19.204
you know, for all of us,
food is a basic need,

00:08:19.228 --> 00:08:22.534
and it is obviously with Mexicans, too,
but it's much more than that.

00:08:22.558 --> 00:08:24.988
It's an expression of love.
It's an expression of --

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:27.462
God, I'm totally choking up
way more than I thought.

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:29.358
I'll look away from the picture.

00:08:29.382 --> 00:08:32.678
It's an expression of beauty,
it's how they say they love you.

00:08:32.702 --> 00:08:34.054
It's how they say they care,

00:08:34.078 --> 00:08:37.106
and you can't hear somebody
talk about their Mexican grandmother

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.838
without saying "food"
in the first sentence.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.143
And so to me, this beautiful culture,

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:46.487
this beautiful expression is something
that I want to capture through games.

00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:50.012
And so games, for a change,
it changes how we see topics,

00:08:50.036 --> 00:08:53.548
it changes our perceptions
about those people in topics,

00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:55.294
and it changes ourselves.

00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:57.507
We change as people through games,

00:08:57.531 --> 00:08:59.567
because we're involved, and we're playing,

00:08:59.591 --> 00:09:01.080
and we're learning as we do so.

00:09:01.104 --> 00:09:02.302
Thank you.
