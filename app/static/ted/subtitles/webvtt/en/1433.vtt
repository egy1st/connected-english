WEBVTT

00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:03.487
We conventionally divide space

00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:05.049
into private and public realms,

00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:08.316
and we know these legal
distinctions very well

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.324
because we've become experts

00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:14.184
at protecting our private
property and private space.

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.088
But we're less attuned

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:19.643
to the nuances of the public.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:23.566
What translates generic public
space into qualitative space?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.972
I mean, this is something

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:26.797
that our studio has been working on

00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:28.305
for the past decade.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.568
And we're doing this
through some case studies.

00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:32.057
A large chunk of our work

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.597
has been put into transforming

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:36.393
this neglected industrial ruin

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:39.466
into a viable post-industrial space

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.967
that looks forward and backward

00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:42.228
at the same time.

00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:44.730
And another huge chunk of our work

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:46.768
has gone into making relevant

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:49.464
a site that's grown
out of sync with its time.

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:52.508
We've been working
on democratizing Lincoln Center

00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:56.226
for a public that doesn't
usually have $300

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.991
to spend on an opera ticket.

00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:01.682
So we've been eating, drinking,

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:03.976
thinking, living public space

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.947
for quite a long time.

00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:08.216
And it's taught us really one thing,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.184
and that is to truly
make good public space,

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:15.434
you have to erase the distinctions

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:18.059
between architecture, urbanism,

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:19.934
landscape, media design

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.518
and so on.

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:23.547
It really goes beyond distinction.

00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:26.601
Now we're moving onto Washington, D.C.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:28.934
and we're working
on another transformation,

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.559
and that is for the existing
Hirshhorn Museum

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.184
that's sited

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:35.476
on the most revered
public space in America,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.409
the National Mall.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.976
The Mall is a symbol

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.809
of American democracy.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.809
And what's fantastic is that this symbol

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:48.018
is not a thing, it's not an image,

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.726
it's not an artifact,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.434
actually it's a space,

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:54.284
and it's kind of just defined
by a line of buildings

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:56.315
on either side.

00:01:56.339 --> 00:02:00.059
It's a space where citizens
can voice their discontent

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:01.352
and show their power.

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:04.268
It's a place where pivotal
moments in American history

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:06.424
have taken place.

00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:08.830
And they're inscribed in there forever --

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:11.209
like the march on Washington
for jobs and freedom

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:14.301
and the great speech that Martin
Luther King gave there.

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:18.684
The Vietnam protests,
the commemoration of all that died

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.726
in the pandemic of AIDS,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.268
the march for women's reproductive rights,

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:26.726
right up until almost the present.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.888
The Mall is the greatest civic stage

00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:33.559
in this country for dissent.

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:37.447
And it's synonymous with free speech,

00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:40.138
even if you're not sure what it
is that you have to say.

00:02:40.162 --> 00:02:45.168
It may just be a place
for civic commiseration.

00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:48.809
There is a huge disconnect, we believe,

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.976
between the communicative
and discursive space of the Mall

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.018
and the museums that line
it to either side.

00:02:57.042 --> 00:03:00.643
And that is that those
museums are usually passive,

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:04.018
they have passive relationships
between the museum

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:05.662
as the presenter and the audience,

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.934
as the receiver of information.

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.684
And so you can see dinosaurs

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:13.768
and insects and collections of locomotives

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.093
and all of that,

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:16.624
but you're really not involved;

00:03:16.648 --> 00:03:18.268
you're being talked to.

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:22.971
When Richard Koshalek took
over as director of the Hirshhorn

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:24.768
in 2009,

00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:27.184
he was determined to take advantage

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:30.434
of the fact that this museum was sited

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:32.184
at the most unique place:

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:34.059
at the seat of power in the U.S.

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.268
And while art and politics

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:41.726
are inherently and implicitly
together always and all the time,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.893
there could be some very
special relationship

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:49.809
that could be forged
here in its uniqueness.

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.434
The question is, is it possible ultimately

00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:54.184
for art to insert itself

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:57.309
into the dialogue of national
and world affairs?

00:03:57.333 --> 00:04:01.178
And could the museum be
an agent of cultural diplomacy?

00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:06.239
There are over 180 embassies
in Washington D.C.

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:09.226
There are over 500 think tanks.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.726
There should be a way

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.643
of harnessing all of that intellectual
and global energy

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:15.793
into, and somehow through, the museum.

00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:18.872
There should be some kind of brain trust.

00:04:18.896 --> 00:04:22.184
So the Hirshhorn, as we began
to think about it,

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:24.684
and as we evolved the mission,

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:26.518
with Richard and his team --

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:28.643
it's really his life blood.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:32.728
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art,

00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:35.518
the Hirshhorn will become a public forum,

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:37.643
a place of discourse

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.851
for issues around arts,

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:44.934
culture, politics and policy.

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.934
It would have the global reach
of the World Economic Forum.

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.816
It would have the interdisciplinarity
of the TED Conference.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.274
It would have the informality
of the town square.

00:04:56.298 --> 00:04:58.203
And for this new initiative,

00:04:58.227 --> 00:05:00.018
the Hirshhorn would have to expand

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:01.395
or appropriate a site

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.289
for a contemporary, deployable structure.

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:06.028
This is it. This is the Hirshhorn --

00:05:06.052 --> 00:05:09.143
so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut

00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:11.351
designed in the early '70s

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:13.103
by Gordon Bunshaft.

00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:14.393
It's hulking, it's silent,

00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:16.143
it's cloistered, it's arrogant,

00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:18.476
it's a design challenge.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.049
Architects love to hate it.

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:22.059
One redeeming feature

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:23.768
is it's lifted up off the ground

00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:25.518
and it's got this void,

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:27.143
and it's got an empty core

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:30.059
kind of in the spirit and that facade

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:33.809
very much corporate and federal style.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.726
And around that space,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.268
the ring is actually galleries.

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:39.893
Very, very difficult
to mount shows in there.

00:05:39.917 --> 00:05:41.851
When the Hirshhorn opened,

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:44.161
Ada Louise Huxstable,
the New York Times critic,

00:05:44.185 --> 00:05:45.672
had some choice words:

00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:47.474
"Neo-penitentiary modern."

00:05:47.498 --> 00:05:50.333
"A maimed monument and a maimed Mall

00:05:50.357 --> 00:05:51.768
for a maimed collection."

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:53.524
Almost four decades later,

00:05:53.548 --> 00:05:55.268
how will this building expand

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:57.297
for a new progressive program?

00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:58.809
Where would it go?

00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:00.051
It can't go in the Mall.

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:01.308
There is no space there.

00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:02.851
It can't go in the courtyard.

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:08.059
It's already taken up by landscape
and by sculptures.

00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:09.464
Well there's always the hole.

00:06:09.488 --> 00:06:13.976
But how could it take
the space of that hole

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.976
and not be buried in it invisibly?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.726
How could it become iconic?

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.274
And what language would it take?

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:24.476
The Hirshhorn sits
among the Mall's monumental institutions.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.320
Most are neoclassical, heavy and opaque,

00:06:27.344 --> 00:06:30.118
made of stone or concrete.

00:06:30.142 --> 00:06:32.008
And the question is,

00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:33.424
if one inhabits that space,

00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:36.786
what is the material of the Mall?

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.434
It has to be different
from the buildings there.

00:06:39.458 --> 00:06:41.458
It has to be something entirely different.

00:06:41.482 --> 00:06:43.246
It has to be air.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.768
In our imagination, it has to be light.

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:47.983
It has to be ephemeral.
It has to be formless.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:50.007
And it has to be free.

00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:53.541
(Video)

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:04.494
So this is the big idea.

00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:07.059
It's a giant airbag.

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:10.714
The expansion takes
the shape of its container

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:12.453
and it oozes out wherever it can --

00:07:12.477 --> 00:07:14.476
the top and sides.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.226
But more poetically,

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.268
we like to think of the structure

00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:20.340
as inhaling the democratic
air of the Mall,

00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:24.101
bringing it into itself.

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:28.072
The before and the after.

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:31.226
It was dubbed "the bubble" by the press.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.768
That was the lounge.

00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:36.730
It's basically one big volume of air

00:07:36.754 --> 00:07:39.018
that just oozes out in every direction.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.051
The membrane is translucent.

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:44.740
It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:48.832
And it's inflated twice a year
for one month at a time.

00:07:48.856 --> 00:07:52.017
This is the view from the inside.

00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:53.863
So you might have been wondering

00:07:53.887 --> 00:07:55.841
how in the world

00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:58.294
did we get this approved
by the federal government.

00:07:58.318 --> 00:08:02.174
It had to be approved
by actually two agencies.

00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:06.059
And one is there to preserve

00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:08.424
the dignity and sanctity of the Mall.

00:08:08.448 --> 00:08:11.157
I blush whenever I show this.

00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:14.976
It is yours to interpret.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.018
But one thing I can say

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:19.476
is that it's a combination

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.726
of iconoclasm

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.353
and adoration.

00:08:25.377 --> 00:08:28.469
There was also some creative
interpretation involved.

00:08:28.493 --> 00:08:31.393
The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910

00:08:31.417 --> 00:08:33.351
limits the height of buildings in D.C.

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:35.309
to 130 feet,

00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:38.184
except for spires, towers,
domes and minarets.

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:42.851
This pretty much exempts monuments
of the church and state.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:45.976
And the bubble is 153 ft.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.601
That's the Pantheon next to it.

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:51.893
It's about 1.2 million cubic
feet of compressed air.

00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:53.809
And so we argued it

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.809
on the merits of being a dome.

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.893
So there it is,

00:08:57.917 --> 00:08:59.067
very stately,

00:08:59.091 --> 00:09:02.518
among all the stately
buildings in the Mall.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.559
And while this Hirshhorn
is not landmarked,

00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:07.934
it's very, very historically sensitive.

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.309
And so we couldn't really
touch its surfaces.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:12.048
We couldn't leave any traces behind.

00:09:12.072 --> 00:09:14.226
So we strained it from the edges,

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.351
and we held it by cables.

00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:19.726
It's a study of some bondage techniques,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.409
which are actually very important

00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:23.334
because it's hit by wind all the time.

00:09:23.358 --> 00:09:25.449
There's one permanent
steel ring at the top,

00:09:25.473 --> 00:09:28.164
but it can't be seen
from any vantage point on the Mall.

00:09:28.188 --> 00:09:30.351
There are also some restrictions

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:31.852
about how much it could be lit.

00:09:31.876 --> 00:09:33.893
It glows from within, it's translucent.

00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:37.059
But it can't be more lit than the Capitol

00:09:37.083 --> 00:09:38.476
or some of the monuments.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.856
So it's down the hierarchy on lighting.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.976
So it comes to the site twice a year.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.934
It's taken off the delivery truck.

00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.434
It's hoisted.

00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:49.726
And then it's inflated

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.476
with this low-pressure air.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.453
And then it's restrained with the cables.

00:09:53.477 --> 00:09:56.643
And then it's ballasted
with water at the very bottom.

00:09:56.667 --> 00:10:00.768
This is a very strange moment

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:03.184
where we were asked
by the bureaucracy at the Mall

00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:06.393
how much time would it take to install.

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:09.132
And we said, well the first
erection would take one week.

00:10:09.156 --> 00:10:12.476
And they really connected with that idea.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.476
And then it was really
easy all the way through.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.559
So we didn't really have
that many hurdles, I have to say,

00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:22.631
with the government
and all the authorities.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:24.179
But some of the toughest hurdles

00:10:24.203 --> 00:10:25.684
have been the technical ones.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.976
This is the warp and weft.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.018
This is a point cloud.

00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:31.143
There are extreme pressures.

00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:32.929
This is a very, very unusual building

00:10:32.953 --> 00:10:34.851
in that there's no gravity load,

00:10:34.875 --> 00:10:36.590
but there's load in every direction.

00:10:36.614 --> 00:10:41.143
And I'm just going to zip
through these slides.

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:44.268
And this is the space in action.

00:10:44.292 --> 00:10:47.101
So flexible interior for discussions,

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:49.434
just like this, but in the round --

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:50.893
luminous and reconfigurable.

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:53.309
Could be used for anything,

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:55.059
for performances, films,

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:57.601
for installations.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.018
And the very first program

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.233
will be one of cultural
dialogue and diplomacy

00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:03.518
organized in partnership

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:06.143
with the Council on Foreign Relations.

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:07.893
Form and content are together here.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.559
The bubble is an anti-monument.

00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:13.101
The ideals of participatory democracy

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:15.226
are represented through suppleness

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.672
rather than rigidity.

00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:18.101
Art and politics

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:21.741
occupy an ambiguous site
outside the museum walls,

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:25.334
but inside of the museum's core,

00:11:25.358 --> 00:11:27.184
blending its air

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:29.551
with the democratic air of the Mall.

00:11:29.575 --> 00:11:35.101
And the bubble will inflate

00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:36.726
hopefully for the first time

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.934
at the end of 2013.

00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.434
Thank you.

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:44.458
(Applause)
