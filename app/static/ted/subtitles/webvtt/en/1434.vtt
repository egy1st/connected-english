00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:02.487
America's public energy conversation

00:00:02.487 --> 00:00:04.710
boils down to this question:

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.090
Would you rather die of A) oil wars,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.700
or B) climate change,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.100
or C) nuclear holocaust,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.400
or D) all of the above?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.200
Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.315
That's the one we're not normally offered.

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:22.454
What if we could make energy do our work

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.900
without working our undoing?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.000
Could we have fuel without fear?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.408
Could we reinvent fire?

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:31.038
You see, fire made us human;

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:33.092
fossil fuels made us modern.

00:00:33.092 --> 00:00:34.392
But now we need a new fire

00:00:34.392 --> 00:00:37.915
that makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable.

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:40.174
Let's see how.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.060
Four-fifths of the world's energy

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.833
still comes from burning each year

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.333
four cubic miles of the rotted remains

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.933
of primeval swamp goo.

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.067
Those fossil fuels

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:56.144
have built our civilization.

00:00:56.144 --> 00:00:58.213
They've created our wealth.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.805
They've enriched the lives of billions.

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:02.444
But they also have rising costs

00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:06.833
to our security, economy, health and environment

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.087
that are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits.

00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:12.329
So we need a new fire.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.231
And switching from the old fire to the new fire

00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:19.267
means changing two big stories about oil and electricity,

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:23.944
each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air.

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:25.913
But they're really quite distinct.

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:29.325
Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil --

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:33.029
although almost half is made from coal.

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:35.308
Their uses are quite concentrated.

00:01:35.308 --> 00:01:38.048
Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:40.823
Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.

00:01:40.823 --> 00:01:42.864
And the rest of both runs factories.

00:01:42.864 --> 00:01:46.700
So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.469
save oil and coal,

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.900
and also natural gas that can displace both of them.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.585
But today's energy system is not just inefficient,

00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:57.592
it is also disconnected,

00:01:57.592 --> 00:02:00.300
aging, dirty and insecure.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.777
So it needs refurbishment.

00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:06.205
By 2050 though, it could become efficient,

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:09.467
connected and distributed

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:10.867
with elegantly frugal

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:13.600
autos, factories and buildings

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.967
all relying on a modern, secure

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:18.629
and resilient electricity system.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.067
We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:27.236
and use one-third less natural gas

00:02:27.236 --> 00:02:30.121
while switching to efficient use

00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.705
and renewable supply.

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:36.238
This could cost, by 2050,

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:39.490
five trillion dollars less in net present value,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.133
that is expressed as a lump sum today,

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.679
than business as usual --

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.133
assuming that carbon emissions

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:48.198
and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero --

00:02:48.198 --> 00:02:52.082
a conservatively low estimate.

00:02:52.082 --> 00:02:54.033
Yet this cheaper energy system

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:57.867
could support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:00.236
all without needing oil or coal,

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:02.700
or for that matter nuclear energy.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.723
Moreover, this transition needs no new inventions

00:03:05.723 --> 00:03:08.985
and no acts of Congress

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:13.467
and no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or laws

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.418
and running Washington gridlock.

00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:17.333
Let me say that again.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:20.102
I'm going to tell you how to get the United States

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:23.413
completely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:24.759
with no act of Congress

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.269
led by business for profit.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.908
In other words, we're going to use our most effective institutions --

00:03:30.908 --> 00:03:34.721
private enterprise co-evolving with civil society

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:37.233
and sped by military innovation

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:40.033
to go around our least effective institutions.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.367
And whether you care most

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.798
about profits and jobs and competitive advantage

00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:48.208
or national security, or environmental stewardship

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:50.369
and climate protection and public health,

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:54.652
reinventing fire makes sense and makes money.

00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:58.098
General Eisenhower reputedly said

00:03:58.098 --> 00:04:00.718
that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem

00:04:00.718 --> 00:04:05.287
makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.956
So in reinventing fire,

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:10.123
we integrated all four sectors that use energy --

00:04:10.123 --> 00:04:13.762
transportation, buildings, industry and electricity --

00:04:13.762 --> 00:04:16.385
and we integrated four kinds of innovation,

00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:18.933
not just technology and policy,

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:22.033
but also design and business strategy.

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:24.048
Those combinations yield

00:04:24.048 --> 00:04:26.154
very much more than the sum of the parts,

00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:31.500
especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.548
Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day,

00:04:35.548 --> 00:04:37.915
plus another four billion dollars a day

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:40.562
in hidden economic and military costs,

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:44.492
raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.036
Our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles.

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.682
So let's start by making autos oil free.

00:04:49.682 --> 00:04:52.862
Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car

00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:55.064
is caused by its weight.

00:04:55.064 --> 00:04:58.571
And every unit of energy you save at the wheels,

00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.818
by taking out weight or drag,

00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:01.848
saves seven units in the tank,

00:05:01.848 --> 00:05:03.533
because you don't have to waste six units

00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:05.633
getting the energy to the wheels.

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:09.218
Unfortunately, over the past quarter century,

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:11.933
epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:15.756
gain weight twice as fast as we have.

00:05:15.756 --> 00:05:19.410
But today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.979
like carbon fiber composites,

00:05:21.995 --> 00:05:24.367
can make dramatic weight savings snowball

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:28.282
and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build.

00:05:28.282 --> 00:05:30.648
Lighter and more slippery autos

00:05:30.648 --> 00:05:32.895
need less force to move them,

00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:35.169
so their engines get smaller.

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.000
Indeed, that sort of vehicle fitness

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.167
then makes electric propulsion affordable

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:44.300
because the batteries or fuel cells

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.900
also get smaller and lighter and cheaper.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.800
So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.321
while the driving cost, even from the start,

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.069
is very much lower.

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.215
So these innovations together can transform automakers

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.577
from wringing tiny savings

00:06:03.577 --> 00:06:06.908
out of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.646
to the steeply falling costs

00:06:09.646 --> 00:06:14.746
of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other --

00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:18.669
namely ultralight materials, making them into structures

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.000
and electric propulsion.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.700
The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.408
with temporary feebates,

00:06:27.408 --> 00:06:29.662
that is rebates for efficient new autos

00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:32.762
paid for by fees on inefficient ones.

00:06:32.762 --> 00:06:35.608
And just in the first two years

00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:39.056
the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs

00:06:39.056 --> 00:06:43.102
has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency.

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:46.531
The resulting shift to electric autos

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.002
is going to be as game-changing

00:06:48.002 --> 00:06:52.200
as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.300
Of course, computers and electronics

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.600
are now America's biggest industry,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.754
while typewriter makers have vanished.

00:06:58.754 --> 00:07:00.675
So vehicle fitness

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:04.244
opens a new automotive competitive strategy

00:07:04.244 --> 00:07:07.498
that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years,

00:07:07.498 --> 00:07:10.375
but then also make electrification affordable,

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:14.359
and that displaces the rest of the oil.

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:17.915
America could lead this next automotive revolution.

00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:20.400
Currently the leader is Germany.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.908
Last year, Volkswagen announced

00:07:22.908 --> 00:07:25.131
that by next year they'll be producing

00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:28.000
this carbon fiber plugin hybrid

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.408
getting 230 miles a gallon.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.923
Also last year, BMW announced

00:07:32.923 --> 00:07:35.192
this carbon fiber electric car,

00:07:35.192 --> 00:07:37.167
they said that its carbon fiber is paid for

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:39.221
by needing fewer batteries.

00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:41.752
And they said, "We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."

00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:45.275
Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year.

00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:48.500
Seven years ago, an even faster and cheaper

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.092
American manufacturing technology

00:07:51.092 --> 00:07:58.536
was used to make this little carbon fiber test part,

00:07:58.536 --> 00:08:00.875
which doubles as a carbon cap.

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:02.438
(Laughter)

00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:05.500
In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.333
how immensely stiff and strong it is.

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.825
Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.048
Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer

00:08:14.048 --> 00:08:15.587
without even scuffing it.

00:08:15.587 --> 00:08:17.702
But such manufacturing techniques

00:08:17.702 --> 00:08:20.925
can scale to automotive speed and cost

00:08:20.925 --> 00:08:22.379
with aerospace performance.

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.900
They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.062
They can save lives

00:08:27.062 --> 00:08:28.354
because this stuff can absorb

00:08:28.354 --> 00:08:31.618
up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel.

00:08:31.618 --> 00:08:33.367
If we made all of our autos this way,

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:36.290
it would save oil equivalent to finding

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.122
one and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC,

00:08:39.122 --> 00:08:43.554
by drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play.

00:08:43.554 --> 00:08:46.254
And all those mega-barrels under Detroit

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.767
cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel.

00:08:48.767 --> 00:08:50.613
They are all-American, carbon-free

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.933
and inexhaustible.

00:08:52.933 --> 00:08:55.687
The same physics and the same business logic

00:08:55.687 --> 00:08:57.233
also apply to big vehicles.

00:08:57.233 --> 00:08:59.925
In the five years ending with 2010,

00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:04.500
Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.900
in its giant fleet of heavy trucks

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.300
through better logistics and design.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.315
But just the technological savings in heavy trucks

00:09:10.315 --> 00:09:12.200
can get to two-thirds.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.487
And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes,

00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:17.208
now on the drawing board,

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:19.454
can save close to a trillion dollars.

00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:23.823
Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency

00:09:23.823 --> 00:09:26.800
is going to speed up all of these civilian advances

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.329
in much the same way that military R&amp;D

00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:32.523
has given us the Internet, the Global Positioning System

00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:35.592
and the jet engine and microchip industries.

00:09:35.592 --> 00:09:39.115
As we design and build vehicles better,

00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:41.215
we can also use them smarter

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:43.462
by harnessing four powerful techniques

00:09:43.462 --> 00:09:45.454
for eliminating needless driving.

00:09:45.454 --> 00:09:48.246
Instead of just seeing the travel grow,

00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:50.900
we can use innovative pricing,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.854
charging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon.

00:09:54.854 --> 00:09:58.100
We can use some smart IT to enhance transit

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.641
and enable car sharing and ride sharing.

00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:05.900
We can allow smart and lucrative growth models

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.077
that help people already be near where they want to be,

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:11.590
so they don't need to go somewhere else.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.700
And we can use smart IT

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.236
to make traffic free-flowing.

00:10:16.252 --> 00:10:19.067
Together, those things can give us the same or better access

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:23.567
with 46 to 84 percent less driving,

00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:26.205
saving another 0.4 trillion dollars,

00:10:26.205 --> 00:10:31.200
plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.905
So 40 years hence, when you add it all up,

00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:36.913
a far more mobile U.S. economy

00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:38.992
can use no oil.

00:10:38.992 --> 00:10:42.500
Saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.900
rather than buying them for over a hundred,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.675
adds up to a $4 trillion net saving

00:10:47.675 --> 00:10:50.682
counting all the hidden costs at zero.

00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:53.600
So to get mobility without oil,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.700
to phase out the oil,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.131
we can get efficient and then switch fuels.

00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:03.475
Those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos

00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:07.318
can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells,

00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:10.429
electricity and advanced biofuels.

00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:14.082
The trucks and planes can realistically use

00:11:14.082 --> 00:11:16.902
hydrogen or advanced biofuels.

00:11:16.902 --> 00:11:18.967
The trucks could even use natural gas.

00:11:18.967 --> 00:11:20.967
But no vehicles will need oil.

00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:24.052
And the most biofuel we might need,

00:11:24.052 --> 00:11:25.795
just three million barrels a day,

00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:27.433
can be made two-thirds from waste

00:11:27.433 --> 00:11:29.267
without displacing any cropland

00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:32.300
and without harming soil or climate.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.315
Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings

00:11:34.315 --> 00:11:37.267
by what we call "institutional acupuncture."

00:11:37.267 --> 00:11:38.667
We figure out where the business logic

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:41.136
is congested and not flowing properly,

00:11:41.136 --> 00:11:42.948
we stick little needles in it to get it flowing,

00:11:42.948 --> 00:11:45.441
working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon.

00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:48.902
And the long transition is already well under way.

00:11:48.902 --> 00:11:53.205
In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil,

00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:56.152
not in supply, but in demand.

00:11:56.152 --> 00:12:01.264
And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.

00:12:01.264 --> 00:12:05.925
In other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:10.018
before it becomes unavailable even at high prices.

00:12:10.018 --> 00:12:12.944
But the electrified vehicles

00:12:12.944 --> 00:12:15.721
don't need to burden the electricity grid.

00:12:15.721 --> 00:12:19.156
Rather, when smart autos exchange electricity and information

00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:21.582
through smart buildings with smart grids,

00:12:21.582 --> 00:12:24.898
they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage

00:12:24.898 --> 00:12:26.748
that help the grid integrate

00:12:26.748 --> 00:12:29.595
varying solar and wind power.

00:12:29.595 --> 00:12:31.271
So the electrified autos

00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:33.895
make the auto and electricity problems

00:12:33.895 --> 00:12:36.133
easier to solve together than separately.

00:12:36.133 --> 00:12:37.964
And they also converge the oil story

00:12:37.964 --> 00:12:40.548
with our second big story,

00:12:40.548 --> 00:12:44.308
saving electricity and then making it differently.

00:12:44.308 --> 00:12:47.290
And those twin revolutions in electricity

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.344
will bring to that sector

00:12:50.344 --> 00:12:53.129
more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions

00:12:53.129 --> 00:12:54.490
than any other sector,

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.705
because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on

00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:03.400
with 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.475
Changing how we make electricity gets easier

00:13:06.475 --> 00:13:08.990
if we need less of it.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.652
Most of it now is wasted

00:13:10.652 --> 00:13:12.633
and the technologies for saving it

00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:15.587
keep improving faster than we're installing them.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.033
So the unbought efficiency resource

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:20.933
keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper.

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:23.995
But as efficiency in buildings and industry

00:13:23.995 --> 00:13:25.967
starts to grow faster than the economy,

00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:30.390
America's electricity use could actually shrink,

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.987
even with the little extra use required

00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:35.967
for those efficient electrified autos.

00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:40.795
And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends.

00:13:40.795 --> 00:13:43.133
Over the next 40 years, buildings,

00:13:43.133 --> 00:13:45.341
which use three-quarters of the electricity,

00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:49.175
can triple or quadruple their energy productivity,

00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:53.100
saving 1.4 trillion dollars, net present value,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.700
with a 33 percent internal rate of return

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.371
or in English,

00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:01.567
the savings are worth four times what they cost.

00:14:01.567 --> 00:14:03.805
And industry can accelerate too,

00:14:03.805 --> 00:14:05.521
doubling its energy productivity

00:14:05.521 --> 00:14:08.469
with a 21 percent internal rate of return.

00:14:08.469 --> 00:14:10.508
The key is a disruptive innovation

00:14:10.508 --> 00:14:13.331
that we call integrative design

00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:16.259
that often makes very big energy savings

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:18.736
cost less than small or no savings.

00:14:18.736 --> 00:14:21.364
That is, it can give you expanding returns,

00:14:21.364 --> 00:14:23.218
not diminishing returns.

00:14:23.218 --> 00:14:26.964
That is how our 2010 retrofit

00:14:26.964 --> 00:14:30.167
is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building --

00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:34.321
remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site

00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:38.633
into super windows that pass light, but reflect heat.

00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:41.818
plus better lights and office equipment and such

00:14:41.818 --> 00:14:45.433
cut the maximum cooling load by a third.

00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:50.500
And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.023
saved 17 million dollars of

00:14:52.023 --> 00:14:55.400
capital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.444
and reduce the payback to just three years.

00:14:59.444 --> 00:15:01.667
Integrative design can also increase

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.875
energy savings in industry.

00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:05.867
Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment

00:15:05.867 --> 00:15:09.167
has already returned nine billion dollars.

00:15:09.167 --> 00:15:12.113
But industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars

00:15:12.113 --> 00:15:14.308
of energy still to save.

00:15:14.308 --> 00:15:18.867
For example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors.

00:15:18.867 --> 00:15:20.936
Half of that runs pumps and fans.

00:15:20.936 --> 00:15:23.810
And those can all be made more efficient,

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.525
and the motors that turn them

00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:29.175
can have their system efficiency roughly doubled

00:15:29.175 --> 00:15:33.090
by integrating 35 improvements, paying back in about a year.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.318
But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings

00:15:36.318 --> 00:15:38.967
that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks.

00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:42.121
For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors,

00:15:42.121 --> 00:15:43.938
move liquid through pipes.

00:15:43.938 --> 00:15:45.738
But a standard industrial pumping loop

00:15:45.738 --> 00:15:50.115
was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy,

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:52.054
not by getting better pumps,

00:15:52.054 --> 00:15:55.436
but just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipes

00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:58.052
with fat, short, straight pipes.

00:15:58.052 --> 00:16:01.267
This is not about new technology,

00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:03.244
it's just rearranging our metal furniture.

00:16:03.244 --> 00:16:05.598
Of course, it also shrinks the pumping equipment

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:07.313
and its capital costs.

00:16:07.313 --> 00:16:09.933
So what do such savings mean

00:16:09.933 --> 00:16:13.615
for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors?

00:16:13.615 --> 00:16:16.715
Well, from the coal burned at the power plant

00:16:16.715 --> 00:16:19.836
through all these compounding losses,

00:16:19.836 --> 00:16:22.659
only a tenth of the fuel energy

00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:25.659
actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow.

00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:29.333
But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards,

00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:34.964
and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe

00:16:34.964 --> 00:16:39.108
saves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution

00:16:39.108 --> 00:16:41.715
and what Hunter Lovins calls "global weirding"

00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:43.133
back at the power plant.

00:16:43.133 --> 00:16:44.825
And of course, as you go back upstream,

00:16:44.825 --> 00:16:48.125
the components get smaller and therefore cheaper.

00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:52.705
Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings

00:16:52.705 --> 00:16:55.938
in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns --

00:16:55.938 --> 00:16:58.667
everything from data centers and chip fabs

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:00.859
to mines and refineries.

00:17:00.859 --> 00:17:02.300
Typically our retrofit designs

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.254
save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy

00:17:05.254 --> 00:17:07.200
and pay back in a few years,

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.354
while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.800
with generally lower capital cost.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.864
Now needing less electricity

00:17:16.864 --> 00:17:19.179
would ease and speed

00:17:19.179 --> 00:17:22.341
the shift to new sources of electricity, chiefly renewables.

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:26.825
China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost.

00:17:26.825 --> 00:17:30.246
In fact, these solar power module costs

00:17:30.246 --> 00:17:32.625
have just fallen off the bottom of the chart.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:35.695
And Germany now has more solar workers

00:17:35.695 --> 00:17:38.333
than America has steel workers.

00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:40.179
Already in about 20 states

00:17:40.179 --> 00:17:42.533
private installers will come

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:46.018
put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down

00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:47.887
and beat your utility bill.

00:17:47.887 --> 00:17:50.079
Such unregulated products

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:52.933
could ultimately add up to a virtual utility

00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:55.887
that bypasses your electric company

00:17:55.887 --> 00:17:59.718
just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company.

00:17:59.718 --> 00:18:03.136
And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees

00:18:03.136 --> 00:18:05.359
and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams.

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:08.452
Renewables are no longer a fringe activity.

00:18:08.452 --> 00:18:10.929
For each of the past four years

00:18:10.929 --> 00:18:13.767
half of the world's new generating capacity

00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:15.364
has been renewable,

00:18:15.364 --> 00:18:17.056
mainly lately in developing countries.

00:18:17.056 --> 00:18:21.348
In 2010, renewables other than big hydro,

00:18:21.348 --> 00:18:23.679
particularly wind and solar cells,

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:28.671
got 151 billion dollars of private investment,

00:18:28.671 --> 00:18:31.256
and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity

00:18:31.256 --> 00:18:32.941
of nuclear power in the world

00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:36.400
by adding 60 billion watts in that one year.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.100
That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.915
that the world can now make every year --

00:18:42.915 --> 00:18:46.262
a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year.

00:18:46.262 --> 00:18:51.795
In contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity

00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:55.364
and the orders behind those keep fading

00:18:55.364 --> 00:18:57.900
because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.300
In fact in this country,

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.415
no new nuclear power plant

00:19:01.415 --> 00:19:03.933
has been able to raise any private construction capital,

00:19:03.933 --> 00:19:08.348
despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies.

00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:12.352
So how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants?

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:16.121
Well efficiency and gas can displace them all

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:18.805
at just below their operating cost

00:19:18.805 --> 00:19:22.559
and, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.633
at less than their replacement cost.

00:19:24.633 --> 00:19:26.641
But we only need to replace them once.

00:19:26.641 --> 00:19:29.329
We're often told though

00:19:29.329 --> 00:19:31.710
that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on,

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.995
because they're 24/7,

00:19:32.995 --> 00:19:35.818
whereas wind and solar power are variable,

00:19:35.818 --> 00:19:38.833
and hence supposedly unreliable.

00:19:38.833 --> 00:19:42.218
Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break.

00:19:42.218 --> 00:19:44.333
And when a big plant goes down,

00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:47.125
you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds,

00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:50.618
often for weeks or months, often without warning.

00:19:50.618 --> 00:19:52.615
That is exactly why we've designed the grid

00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:56.885
to back up failed plants with working plants.

00:19:56.885 --> 00:19:58.615
And in exactly the same way,

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:03.646
the grid can handle wind and solar power's

00:20:03.646 --> 00:20:06.195
forecastable variations.

00:20:06.195 --> 00:20:09.502
Hourly simulations

00:20:09.502 --> 00:20:13.269
show that largely or wholly renewable grids

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:15.046
can deliver highly reliable power

00:20:15.046 --> 00:20:16.675
when they're forecasted,

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.729
integrated and diversified

00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:20.782
by both type and location.

00:20:20.782 --> 00:20:25.005
And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe

00:20:25.005 --> 00:20:29.490
and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.129
That is how, for example,

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:33.513
four German states in 2010

00:20:33.513 --> 00:20:36.110
were 43 to 52 percent wind powered.

00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:39.767
Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered,

00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:42.092
Denmark 36.

00:20:42.092 --> 00:20:45.377
And it's how all of Europe can shift

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:46.662
to renewable electricity.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:51.387
In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system

00:20:51.387 --> 00:20:54.271
has to be replaced anyway by 2050.

00:20:54.271 --> 00:20:55.898
And whatever we replace it with

00:20:55.898 --> 00:20:57.336
is going to cost about the same,

00:20:57.336 --> 00:21:00.046
about six trillion dollars at present value --

00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:02.254
whether we buy more of what we've got

00:21:02.254 --> 00:21:04.367
or new nuclear and so-called clean coal,

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:07.998
or renewables that are more or less centralized.

00:21:07.998 --> 00:21:11.267
But those four futures at the same cost

00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:13.336
differ profoundly in their risks,

00:21:13.336 --> 00:21:15.867
around national security,

00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:19.405
fuel, water, finance, technology,

00:21:19.405 --> 00:21:20.936
climate and health.

00:21:20.936 --> 00:21:23.771
For example, our over-centralized grid

00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:27.702
is very vulnerable to cascading

00:21:27.702 --> 00:21:30.429
and potentially economy-shattering blackouts

00:21:30.429 --> 00:21:33.867
caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters

00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:35.813
or a terrorist attack.

00:21:35.813 --> 00:21:38.544
But that blackout risk disappears,

00:21:38.544 --> 00:21:40.521
and all of the other risks are best managed,

00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:42.790
with distributed renewables

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.067
organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect,

00:21:47.067 --> 00:21:48.875
but can stand alone at need.

00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:50.913
That is, they can disconnect fractally

00:21:50.913 --> 00:21:53.767
and then reconnect seamlessly.

00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:57.044
That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting

00:21:57.044 --> 00:21:58.359
for its own power supply.

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:01.625
They think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending?

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.310
We want our stuff to work too.

00:22:03.325 --> 00:22:06.895
At about the same cost as business as usual,

00:22:06.895 --> 00:22:08.900
this would maximize national security,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.902
customer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity

00:22:12.902 --> 00:22:14.525
and innovation.

00:22:14.525 --> 00:22:20.200
Together, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.123
are starting to transform the whole electricity sector.

00:22:23.123 --> 00:22:24.754
Traditionally utilities build

00:22:24.754 --> 00:22:26.923
a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants

00:22:26.923 --> 00:22:28.869
and a bunch of big gas plants

00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:29.938
and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables.

00:22:29.938 --> 00:22:32.467
And those utilities were rewarded,

00:22:32.467 --> 00:22:34.921
as they still are in 34 states,

00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:38.387
for selling you more electricity.

00:22:38.387 --> 00:22:41.185
However, especially where regulators

00:22:41.185 --> 00:22:44.738
are now instead rewarding cutting your bills,

00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:48.521
the investments are shifting radically

00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:51.052
toward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration,

00:22:51.052 --> 00:22:54.421
renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably

00:22:54.421 --> 00:22:55.844
with less transmission

00:22:55.844 --> 00:22:58.698
and little or no bulk electricity storage.

00:22:58.698 --> 00:23:01.525
So our energy future is not fate, but choice,

00:23:01.525 --> 00:23:04.271
and that choice is very flexible.

00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:05.871
In 1976, for example,

00:23:05.871 --> 00:23:07.679
government and industry insisted

00:23:07.695 --> 00:23:10.279
that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:12.062
could never go down.

00:23:12.062 --> 00:23:15.692
And I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.

00:23:15.692 --> 00:23:17.941
Well that's what's actually happened so far.

00:23:17.956 --> 00:23:19.271
It's fallen by half.

00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:21.762
But with today's much better technologies,

00:23:21.762 --> 00:23:24.671
more mature delivery channels and integrative design,

00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:28.571
we can do far more and even cheaper.

00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:31.079
So to solve the energy problem,

00:23:31.079 --> 00:23:33.000
we just needed to enlarge it.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.200
And the results may at first seem incredible,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.977
but as Marshall McLuhan said,

00:23:37.977 --> 00:23:40.729
"Only puny secrets need protection.

00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:46.813
Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity."

00:23:46.813 --> 00:23:50.295
Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions,

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.979
both driven by modern efficiency,

00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:55.521
and you get the really big story: reinventing fire,

00:23:55.521 --> 00:24:00.652
where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets

00:24:00.652 --> 00:24:05.182
can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,

00:24:05.182 --> 00:24:07.502
saving 5 trillion dollars,

00:24:07.502 --> 00:24:10.095
growing the economy 2.6-fold,

00:24:10.095 --> 00:24:11.738
strengthening out national security,

00:24:11.738 --> 00:24:14.723
oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,

00:24:14.723 --> 00:24:19.233
reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.

00:24:19.233 --> 00:24:22.567
Now if you like any of those outcomes,

00:24:22.567 --> 00:24:24.759
you can support reinventing fire

00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:26.621
without needing to like all of them

00:24:26.621 --> 00:24:30.044
and without needing to agree about which of them is most important.

00:24:30.044 --> 00:24:33.121
So focusing on outcomes, not motives,

00:24:33.121 --> 00:24:35.677
can turn gridlock and conflict

00:24:35.677 --> 00:24:39.979
into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge.

00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:43.036
This also turns out to be the best way

00:24:43.036 --> 00:24:45.536
to cope with global challenges --

00:24:45.536 --> 00:24:48.115
climate change, nuclear proliferation,

00:24:48.115 --> 00:24:50.546
energy insecurity, energy poverty --

00:24:50.546 --> 00:24:54.192
all of which make us less safe.

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:57.879
Now our team at RMI helps smart companies

00:24:57.879 --> 00:25:00.948
to get unstuck and speed this journey

00:25:00.948 --> 00:25:04.010
via six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.967
Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too.

00:25:06.967 --> 00:25:10.144
Former oil man Maurice Strong said,

00:25:10.144 --> 00:25:12.090
"Not all the fossils are in the fuel."

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.395
But as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,

00:25:16.395 --> 00:25:20.541
"Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem

00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:26.121
because," he said," they simply won't be around long-term."

00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:28.985
I've described not just a once-in-a-civilization

00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:30.592
business opportunity,

00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:33.015
but one of the most profound transitions

00:25:33.015 --> 00:25:35.531
in the history of our species.

00:25:35.531 --> 00:25:38.954
We humans are inventing a new fire,

00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:40.698
not dug from below,

00:25:40.698 --> 00:25:43.605
but flowing from above;

00:25:43.605 --> 00:25:46.536
not scarce, but bountiful;

00:25:46.536 --> 00:25:48.236
not local, but everywhere;

00:25:48.236 --> 00:25:50.867
not transient, but permanent;

00:25:50.867 --> 00:25:53.767
not costly, but free.

00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:57.167
And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas

00:25:57.167 --> 00:26:00.729
and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure,

00:26:00.729 --> 00:26:04.438
this new fire is flameless.

00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:08.502
Efficiently used, it really can do our work

00:26:08.502 --> 00:26:11.356
without working our undoing.

00:26:11.356 --> 00:26:16.238
Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.

00:26:16.238 --> 00:26:18.492
And our new book "Reinventing Fire"

00:26:18.492 --> 00:26:20.877
describes how you can capture it.

00:26:20.877 --> 00:26:23.146
So with the conversation just begun

00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:25.031
at ReinventingFire.com,

00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:27.162
let me invite you each

00:26:27.162 --> 00:26:31.000
to engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.792
to help make the world richer, fairer,

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:36.400
cooler and safer

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.208
by together reinventing fire.

00:26:39.208 --> 00:26:41.067
Thank you.

00:26:41.067 --> 00:26:42.467
(Applause)
