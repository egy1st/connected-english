00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
Usually I like working in my shop,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:06.958
but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river,

00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:08.998
then I just love it.

00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:12.329
And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water,

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.208
and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers.

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:18.140
You have no idea how much time I spend.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.167
This is the "Double Raindrop."

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.292
Of all my sculptures, it's the most talkative.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.442
It adds together the interference pattern

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:34.721
from two raindrops that land near each other.

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:39.868
Instead of expanding circles, they're expanding hexagons.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.229
All the sculptures move by mechanical means.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.125
Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave?

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:05.225
Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on.

00:01:20.644 --> 00:01:24.110
Eight hundred two-liter soda bottles --

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.854
oh yea.

00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:28.090
(Laughter)

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.917
Four hundred aluminum cans.

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:47.277
Tule is a reed that's native to California,

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:52.543
and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious.

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:08.783
A single drop of rain

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:11.298
increasing amplitude.

00:02:32.883 --> 00:02:38.109
The spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip.

00:02:48.263 --> 00:02:51.138
This adds together four different waves.

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:54.059
And here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.407
and increase the single.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:00.348
The mechanism that drives it has nine motors

00:03:00.348 --> 00:03:02.870
and about 3,000 pulleys.

00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:17.173
Four hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave.

00:03:17.173 --> 00:03:20.012
Transferred to a larger scale --

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:23.090
actually a lot larger, with a lot of help --

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.857
14,064 bicycle reflectors --

00:03:26.857 --> 00:03:30.606
a 20-day install.

00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:51.375
"Connected" is a collaboration

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:55.179
with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek.

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.520
Strings attached to dancers.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.942
This is very early rehearsal footage,

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:03.304
but the finished work's on tour

00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:07.677
and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.171
A pair of helices and 40 wooden slats.

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.000
Take your finger and draw this line.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Summer, fall, winter, spring,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.237
noon, dusk, dark, dawn.

00:04:51.237 --> 00:04:54.500
Have you ever seen those stratus clouds

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.173
that go in parallel stripes across the sky?

00:04:57.173 --> 00:04:59.768
Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud

00:04:59.768 --> 00:05:03.365
that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer?

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:06.198
What if every seemingly isolated object

00:05:06.198 --> 00:05:10.042
was actually just where the continuous wave of that object

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:13.523
poked through into our world?

00:05:13.523 --> 00:05:17.900
The Earth is neither flat nor round.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.323
It's wavy.

00:05:22.323 --> 00:05:27.821
It sounds good, but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth,

00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:29.379
and I'll tell you why.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.375
I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.458
And I'm just going to come out and say it:

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.993
My daughter is not a wave.

00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:41.573
And you might say, "Surely, Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back,

00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:44.333
the cycles of hunger and eating,

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:47.173
waking and sleeping, laughing and crying

00:05:47.173 --> 00:05:49.784
would emerge as pattern."

00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:52.411
But I would say, "If I did that,

00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.900
too much would be lost."

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.629
This tension between the need to look deeper

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.583
and the beauty and immediacy of the world,

00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:07.285
where if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for,

00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:10.356
this tension is what makes the sculptures move.

00:06:10.356 --> 00:06:12.867
And for me, the path between these two extremes

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:15.602
takes the shape of a wave.

00:06:15.602 --> 00:06:18.669
Let me show you one more.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.529
Thank you very much. Thanks.

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:05.710
(Applause)

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.942
Thanks.

00:07:06.942 --> 00:07:11.406
(Applause)

00:07:11.406 --> 00:07:13.179
June Cohen: Looking at each of your sculptures,

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:15.607
they evoke so many different images.

00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:18.142
Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves,

00:07:18.142 --> 00:07:21.027
and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math.

00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:23.531
Is there an actual inspiration behind each one?

00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:27.087
Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it?

00:07:27.087 --> 00:07:30.227
RM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation --

00:07:30.227 --> 00:07:33.042
like literally two raindrops falling,

00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:35.917
and just watching that pattern is so stunning.

00:07:35.917 --> 00:07:41.606
And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff.

00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:44.150
I like working with my hands.

00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:46.375
There's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:48.125
and trying to make it move.

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:49.875
JC: And does it ever change?

00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:51.000
Do you think you're designing one thing,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.750
and then when it's produced it looks like something else?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.208
RM: The "Double Raindrop" I worked on for nine months,

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:58.534
and when I finally turned it on,

00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:02.208
I actually hated it.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:06.333
The very moment I turned it on, I hated it.

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:09.681
It was like a really deep-down gut reaction, and I wanted to throw it out.

00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:11.825
And I happened to have a friend who was over,

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.837
and he said, "Why don't you just wait."

00:08:13.837 --> 00:08:18.206
And I waited, and the next day I liked it a bit better,

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:21.167
the next day I liked it a bit better, and now I really love it.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:25.833
And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes,

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:28.375
and two, it does not look like as expected.

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.792
JC: The relationship evolves over time.

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:31.667
Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us.

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:34.554
RM: Thanks. (JC: Thank you, Reuben.)

00:08:34.554 --> 00:08:36.917
(Applause)
