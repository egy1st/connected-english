WEBVTT

00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:03.819
I don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.417
that two and a half billion of us around the world

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:08.833
are connected to each other through the Internet

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:10.958
and that at any point in time

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:13.708
more than 30 percent of the world's population

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:18.823
can go online to learn, to create and to share.

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:22.386
And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this

00:00:22.386 --> 00:00:24.167
is also continuing to go grow.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:25.625
A recent study showed

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.125
that the young generation alone

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.396
is spending over eight hours a day online.

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.562
As the parent of a nine-year-old girl,

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.775
that number seems awfully low.

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:36.125
(Laughter)

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.198
But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us,

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:43.873
it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world.

00:00:43.873 --> 00:00:46.729
And increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:47.980
for all of this connectedness

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.994
is our privacy.

00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:53.990
Today, what many of us would love to believe

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.995
is that the Internet is a private place; it's not.

00:00:56.995 --> 00:01:00.080
And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.430
we are like Hansel and Gretel

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000
leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.442
everywhere we travel through the digital woods.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:12.292
We are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence,

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:14.654
our interests and preferences,

00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:16.743
our relationships,

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.504
our financial histories, and on and on it goes.

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:22.500
Now don't get me wrong,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.987
I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.

00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:28.365
In fact, when I know the data that's being shared

00:01:28.365 --> 00:01:31.125
and I'm asked explicitly for my consent,

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.542
I want some sites to understand my habits.

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:35.940
It helps them suggest books for me to read

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.275
or movies for my family to watch

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:40.731
or friends for us to connect with.

00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:43.812
But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked,

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.408
that's when the problem arises.

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:48.125
It's a phenomenon on the Internet today

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:49.875
called behavioral tracking,

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.542
and it is very big business.

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, there's an entire industry formed

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.337
around following us through the digital woods

00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:58.681
and compiling a profile on each of us.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.596
And when all of that data is held,

00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:04.048
they can do almost whatever they want with it.

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:07.417
This is an area today that has very few regulations

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.167
and even fewer rules.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.750
Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.875
it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked.

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.279
So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.985
The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:27.458
and it's an experimental browser add-on

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:29.625
that you can install in your Firefox browser

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:34.321
that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.917
The red dots you see up there

00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:38.833
are sites that are behavioral tracking

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:42.042
that I have not navigated to, but are following me.

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:45.190
The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.556
And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me,

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:50.656
but I have no idea who they are.

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:52.750
All of them are connected, as you can see,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.000
to form a picture of me on the Web.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.542
And this is my profile.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.952
So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal.

00:02:59.952 --> 00:03:03.375
I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.385
and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day.

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:08.683
Now like most of you,

00:03:08.683 --> 00:03:12.304
I actually start my day going online and checking email.

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:15.143
I then go to a news site, look for some headlines.

00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:18.667
And in this particular case I happened to like one of them

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:22.083
on the merits of music literacy in schools

00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:24.333
and I shared it over a social network.

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:27.000
Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.250
and I asked her, "Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?"

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.250
And she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.369
looked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?"

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:39.125
So I sent her online, of course, to look it up.

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:41.250
Now let me stop here.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.030
We are not even two bites into breakfast

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.346
and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me.

00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:51.604
I have navigated to a total of four.

00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:54.894
So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.191
I go to work, I check email,

00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:59.881
I log onto a few more social sites, I blog,

00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:03.375
I check more news reports, I share some of those news reports,

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:05.437
I go look at some videos,

00:04:05.437 --> 00:04:10.000
pretty typical day -- in this case, actually fairly pedantic --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.042
and at the end of the day, as my day winds down,

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:16.083
look at my profile.

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:18.173
The red dots have exploded.

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:20.779
The gray dots have grown exponentially.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.319
All in all, there's over 150 sites

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.250
that are now tracking my personal information,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.092
most all of them without my consent.

00:04:29.092 --> 00:04:32.339
I look at this picture and it freaks me out.

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:36.821
This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web.

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:39.138
And why is this happening?

00:04:39.138 --> 00:04:41.508
Pretty simple -- it's huge business.

00:04:41.508 --> 00:04:44.083
The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:46.458
is over 39 billion dollars today.

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:49.381
And as adults, we're certainly not alone.

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:52.375
At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile,

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.708
I installed one for my daughter.

00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:59.083
And on one single Saturday morning, over two hours on the Internet,

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:02.225
here's her Collusion profile.

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:05.120
This is a nine-year-old girl

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.945
navigating to principally children's sites.

00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:12.417
I move from this, from freaked out to enraged.

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:17.127
This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate;

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:18.727
this is me being a parent.

00:05:18.727 --> 00:05:20.292
Imagine in the physical world

00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:23.579
if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:25.605
and recorded their every movement.

00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:29.125
I can tell you, there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by.

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:32.550
We'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.896
(Laughter)

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:35.961
We can't sit idly by here either.

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.019
This is happening today.

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:40.221
Privacy is not an option,

00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:42.062
and it shouldn't be the price we accept

00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:43.768
for just getting on the Internet.

00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:47.385
Our voices matter and our actions matter even more.

00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:50.458
Today we've launched Collusion.

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:52.625
You can download it, install it in Firefox,

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.167
to see who is tracking you across the Web

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:57.548
and following you through the digital woods.

00:05:57.548 --> 00:06:00.610
Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.750
Because what we don't know can actually hurt us.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.375
Because the memory of the Internet is forever.

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:08.054
We are being watched.

00:06:08.054 --> 00:06:10.769
It's now time for us to watch the watchers.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:11.866
Thank you.

00:06:11.866 --> 00:06:15.917
(Applause)
