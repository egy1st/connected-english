00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.627
What you have here

00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:05.920
is an electronic cigarette.

00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:10.056
It's something that, since it was
invented a year or two ago,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.551
has given me untold happiness.

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:12.756
(Laughter)

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.215
A little bit of it,
I think, is the nicotine,

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.449
but there's something
much bigger than that;

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:23.040
which is, ever since, in the UK,
they banned smoking in public places,

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.884
I've never enjoyed
a drinks party ever again.

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:27.766
(Laughter)

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.886
And the reason, I only worked out
just the other day,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.578
which is: when you go
to a drinks party and you stand up

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:36.562
and hold a glass of red wine
and you talk endlessly to people,

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:39.160
you don't actually want to spend
all the time talking.

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:40.655
It's really, really tiring.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.692
Sometimes you just want to stand there
silently, alone with your thoughts.

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:48.718
Sometimes you just want to stand
in the corner and stare out of the window.

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:52.821
Now the problem is, when you can't smoke,

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:56.496
if you stand and stare
out of the window on your own,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.742
you're an antisocial, friendless idiot.

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.076
(Laughter)

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.505
If you stand and stare out of the window
on your own with a cigarette,

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:06.282
you're a fucking philosopher.

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:09.109
(Laughter)

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:14.785
(Applause)

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:18.254
So the power of reframing things

00:01:19.718 --> 00:01:22.174
cannot be overstated.

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:25.570
What we have is exactly
the same thing, the same activity,

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:27.912
but one of them makes you feel great

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:31.637
and the other one,
with just a small change of posture,

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:32.882
makes you feel terrible.

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:37.174
And I think one of the problems
with classical economics is,

00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:39.631
it's absolutely preoccupied with reality.

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:43.289
And reality isn't a particularly good
guide to human happiness.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:48.903
Why, for example,
are pensioners much happier

00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:50.308
than the young unemployed?

00:01:51.293 --> 00:01:54.539
Both of them, after all,
are in exactly the same stage of life.

00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:57.515
You both have too much time
on your hands and not much money.

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:01.057
But pensioners are reportedly
very, very happy,

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:04.508
whereas the unemployed
are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.

00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:07.831
The reason, I think,
is that the pensioners believe

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:09.428
they've chosen to be pensioners,

00:02:09.452 --> 00:02:13.405
whereas the young unemployed
feel it's been thrust upon them.

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:18.774
In England, the upper-middle classes have
actually solved this problem perfectly,

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:21.124
because they've re-branded unemployment.

00:02:21.148 --> 00:02:23.414
If you're an upper-middle-class
English person,

00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:25.766
you call unemployment "a year off."

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.484
(Laughter)

00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:31.552
And that's because having a son
who's unemployed in Manchester

00:02:31.576 --> 00:02:33.503
is really quite embarrassing.

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:36.605
But having a son
who's unemployed in Thailand

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.712
is really viewed
as quite an accomplishment.

00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:40.765
(Laughter)

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.112
But actually, the power
to re-brand things --

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:48.675
to understand that
our experiences, costs, things

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.149
don't actually much depend
on what they really are,

00:02:51.173 --> 00:02:52.746
but on how we view them --

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.679
I genuinely think can't be overstated.

00:02:55.703 --> 00:02:58.159
There's an experiment
I think Daniel Pink refers to,

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:00.702
where you put two dogs in a box

00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:03.939
and the box has an electric floor.

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:09.785
Every now and then,
an electric shock is applied to the floor,

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:11.636
which pains the dogs.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.498
The only difference is one of the dogs
has a small button in its half of the box.

00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:20.316
And when it nuzzles the button,
the electric shock stops.

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:23.880
The other dog doesn't have the button.

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:28.145
It's exposed to exactly the same level
of pain as the dog in the first box,

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.043
but it has no control
over the circumstances.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:35.073
Generally, the first dog
can be relatively content.

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:38.041
The second dog lapses
into complete depression.

00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:43.670
The circumstances of our lives
may actually matter less to our happiness

00:03:43.694 --> 00:03:47.431
than the sense of control
we feel over our lives.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.074
It's an interesting question.

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.347
We ask the question -- the whole
debate in the Western world

00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:56.205
is about the level of taxation.

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.452
But I think there's another
debate to be asked,

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:01.907
which is the level of control
we have over our tax money,

00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.567
that what costs us 10 pounds
in one context can be a curse;

00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:11.193
what costs us 10 pounds in a different
context, we may actually welcome.

00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:16.618
You know, pay 20,000 pounds
in tax toward health,

00:04:16.642 --> 00:04:18.571
and you're merely feeling a mug.

00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:21.857
Pay 20,000 pounds
to endow a hospital ward,

00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:23.747
and you're called a philanthropist.

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:28.318
I'm probably in the wrong country
to talk about willingness to pay tax.

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:30.029
(Laughter)

00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:35.253
So I'll give you one in return:
how you frame things really matters.

00:04:35.277 --> 00:04:37.555
Do you call it "The bailout of Greece"?

00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:40.775
Or "The bailout of a load of stupid banks
which lent to Greece"?

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:41.810
(Laughter)

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:44.184
Because they are actually the same thing.

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:48.068
What you call them
actually affects how you react to them,

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:50.126
viscerally and morally.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.344
I think psychological value is great,
to be absolutely honest.

00:04:53.368 --> 00:04:56.240
One of my great friends,
a professor called Nick Chater,

00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:59.138
who's the Professor of Decision
Sciences in London,

00:04:59.162 --> 00:05:03.662
believes we should spend far less time
looking into humanity's hidden depths,

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:07.109
and spend much more time
exploring the hidden shallows.

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:08.645
I think that's true, actually.

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.743
I think impressions have an insane effect
on what we think and what we do.

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:17.350
But what we don't have is a really
good model of human psychology --

00:05:17.374 --> 00:05:19.659
at least pre-Kahneman, perhaps,

00:05:19.683 --> 00:05:22.647
we didn't have a really good model
of human psychology

00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:27.544
to put alongside models of engineering,
of neoclassical economics.

00:05:27.568 --> 00:05:30.891
So people who believed in psychological
solutions didn't have a model.

00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:32.850
We didn't have a framework.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:36.221
This is what Warren Buffett's
business partner Charlie Munger calls

00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:38.606
"a latticework on which
to hang your ideas."

00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:42.320
Engineers, economists,
classical economists

00:05:42.344 --> 00:05:45.275
all had a very, very robust
existing latticework

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:47.994
on which practically
every idea could be hung.

00:05:48.018 --> 00:05:51.414
We merely have a collection
of random individual insights

00:05:51.438 --> 00:05:52.839
without an overall model.

00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:58.051
And what that means
is that, in looking at solutions,

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:00.801
we've probably given too much priority

00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:04.946
to what I call technical engineering
solutions, Newtonian solutions,

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.348
and not nearly enough
to the psychological ones.

00:06:07.372 --> 00:06:09.685
You know my example of the Eurostar:

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:10.907
six million pounds spent

00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:14.151
to reduce the journey time
between Paris and London

00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:15.613
by about 40 minutes.

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.417
For 0.01 percent of this money,
you could have put wi-fi on the trains,

00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:23.109
which wouldn't have reduced
the duration of the journey,

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:27.052
but would have improved its enjoyment
and its usefulness far more.

00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:29.693
For maybe 10 percent of the money,

00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:33.051
you could have paid all of the world's top
male and female supermodels

00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:36.010
to walk up and down the train
handing out free Château Pétrus

00:06:36.034 --> 00:06:37.308
to all the passengers.

00:06:37.332 --> 00:06:38.374
(Laughter)

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.748
You'd still have five million
pounds in change,

00:06:40.772 --> 00:06:43.397
and people would ask
for the trains to be slowed down.

00:06:43.421 --> 00:06:47.515
(Laughter)

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.901
Why were we not given the chance
to solve that problem psychologically?

00:06:50.925 --> 00:06:53.409
I think it's because there's an imbalance,

00:06:53.433 --> 00:07:00.067
an asymmetry in the way we treat creative,
emotionally driven psychological ideas

00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:04.992
versus the way we treat rational,
numerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:07.483
If you're a creative person,
I think, quite rightly,

00:07:07.507 --> 00:07:09.642
you have to share
all your ideas for approval

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:11.603
with people much more rational than you.

00:07:11.627 --> 00:07:14.891
You have to go in
and have a cost-benefit analysis,

00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:17.968
a feasibility study,
an ROI study and so forth.

00:07:17.992 --> 00:07:19.734
And I think that's probably right.

00:07:20.643 --> 00:07:23.289
But this does not apply
the other way around.

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:25.341
People who have an existing framework --

00:07:25.365 --> 00:07:27.744
an economic framework,
an engineering framework --

00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:30.934
feel that, actually,
logic is its own answer.

00:07:31.503 --> 00:07:34.409
What they don't say is,
"Well, the numbers all seem to add up,

00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:37.885
but before I present this idea,
I'll show it to some really crazy people

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:40.275
to see if they can come up with
something better."

00:07:40.299 --> 00:07:43.054
And so we -- artificially,
I think -- prioritize

00:07:43.078 --> 00:07:46.829
what I'd call mechanistic ideas
over psychological ideas.

00:07:47.577 --> 00:07:49.609
An example of a great psychological idea:

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:52.249
the single best improvement
in passenger satisfaction

00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:53.577
on the London Underground,

00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:55.171
per pound spent,

00:07:55.195 --> 00:07:57.530
came when they didn't add
any extra trains,

00:07:57.554 --> 00:07:59.459
nor change the frequency of the trains;

00:07:59.483 --> 00:08:02.612
they put dot matrix display boards
on the platforms --

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:07.468
because the nature of a wait is not just
dependent on its numerical quality,

00:08:07.492 --> 00:08:08.735
its duration,

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:12.173
but on the level of uncertainty
you experience during that wait.

00:08:12.197 --> 00:08:15.086
Waiting seven minutes for a train
with a countdown clock

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.003
is less frustrating and irritating

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:19.966
than waiting four minutes,
knuckle biting, going,

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.278
"When's this train
going to damn well arrive?"

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.436
Here's a beautiful example
of a psychological solution

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.631
deployed in Korea.

00:08:26.655 --> 00:08:29.064
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay.

00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:32.114
It's proven to reduce
the accident rate in experiments.

00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:33.296
Why?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.841
Because road rage, impatience and general
irritation are massively reduced

00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:40.714
when you can actually see
the time you have to wait.

00:08:40.738 --> 00:08:43.641
In China, not really understanding
the principle behind this,

00:08:43.665 --> 00:08:46.404
they applied the same principle
to green traffic lights --

00:08:46.428 --> 00:08:50.266
(Laughter)

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.812
which isn't a great idea.

00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:54.926
You're 200 yards away, you realize
you've got five seconds to go,

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.102
you floor it.

00:08:56.126 --> 00:08:59.449
(Laughter)

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.974
The Koreans, very assiduously,
did test both.

00:09:01.998 --> 00:09:05.333
The accident rate goes down
when you apply this to red traffic lights;

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:07.945
it goes up when you apply it
to green traffic lights.

00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:10.907
This is all I'm asking for, really,
in human decision making,

00:09:10.931 --> 00:09:13.036
is the consideration
of these three things.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.025
I'm not asking for the complete primacy
of one over the other.

00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:18.289
I'm merely saying
that when you solve problems,

00:09:18.313 --> 00:09:20.795
you should look
at all three of these equally,

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:23.020
and you should seek as far as possible

00:09:23.044 --> 00:09:25.903
to find solutions which sit
in the sweet spot in the middle.

00:09:25.927 --> 00:09:27.898
If you actually look at a great business,

00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:31.511
you'll nearly always see all of these
three things coming into play.

00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:33.218
Really successful businesses --

00:09:33.242 --> 00:09:35.904
Google is a great, great
technological success,

00:09:35.928 --> 00:09:39.127
but it's also based
on a very good psychological insight:

00:09:40.094 --> 00:09:42.651
people believe something
that only does one thing

00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:46.834
is better at that thing than something
that does that thing and something else.

00:09:46.858 --> 00:09:49.564
It's an innate thing
called "goal dilution."

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:52.349
Ayelet Fishbach has written
a paper about this.

00:09:52.373 --> 00:09:54.863
Everybody else at the time
of Google, more or less,

00:09:54.887 --> 00:09:56.134
was trying to be a portal.

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:58.984
Yes, there's a search function,
but you also have weather,

00:09:59.008 --> 00:10:00.666
sports scores, bits of news.

00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:04.471
Google understood
that if you're just a search engine,

00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:07.333
people assume you're a very,
very good search engine.

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:10.839
All of you know this, actually,
from when you go in to buy a television,

00:10:10.863 --> 00:10:13.765
and in the shabbier end
of the row of flat-screen TVs,

00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:16.094
you can see, are these
rather despised things

00:10:16.118 --> 00:10:19.092
called "combined TV and DVD players."

00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:22.993
And we have no knowledge whatsoever
of the quality of those things,

00:10:23.017 --> 00:10:26.456
but we look at a combined
TV and DVD player and we go, "Uck.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.412
It's probably a bit of a crap telly
and a bit rubbish as a DVD player."

00:10:30.436 --> 00:10:32.853
So we walk out of the shops
with one of each.

00:10:33.326 --> 00:10:37.926
Google is as much a psychological success
as it is a technological one.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.633
I propose that we can use
psychology to solve problems

00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:43.988
that we didn't even realize
were problems at all.

00:10:44.012 --> 00:10:47.775
This is my suggestion for getting people
to finish their course of antibiotics.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:49.368
Don't give them 24 white pills;

00:10:49.392 --> 00:10:52.405
give them 18 white pills and six blue ones

00:10:52.429 --> 00:10:54.496
and tell them to take
the white pills first,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.990
and then take the blue ones.

00:10:56.886 --> 00:10:58.037
It's called "chunking."

00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:01.037
The likelihood that people will get
to the end is much greater

00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:03.641
when there is a milestone
somewhere in the middle.

00:11:04.847 --> 00:11:07.193
One of the great mistakes,
I think, of economics

00:11:07.217 --> 00:11:09.620
is it fails to understand
that what something is --

00:11:09.644 --> 00:11:12.152
whether it's retirement,
unemployment, cost --

00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:17.140
is a function, not only of its amount,
but also its meaning.

00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:20.773
This is a toll crossing in Britain.

00:11:20.797 --> 00:11:23.734
Quite often queues happen at the tolls.

00:11:23.758 --> 00:11:25.982
Sometimes you get very,
very severe queues.

00:11:26.006 --> 00:11:28.196
You could apply
the same principle, actually,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.960
to the security lanes in airports.

00:11:29.984 --> 00:11:32.970
What would happen if you could actually
pay twice as much money

00:11:32.994 --> 00:11:34.145
to cross the bridge,

00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:36.288
but go through a lane
that's an express lane?

00:11:36.312 --> 00:11:38.082
It's not an unreasonable thing to do;

00:11:38.106 --> 00:11:40.117
it's an economically
efficient thing to do.

00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:42.182
Time means more
to some people than others.

00:11:42.206 --> 00:11:44.637
If you're waiting trying
to get to a job interview,

00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:48.875
you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more
to go through the fast lane.

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:51.228
If you're on the way
to visit your mother-in-law,

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.403
you'd probably prefer --

00:11:52.427 --> 00:11:53.610
(Laughter)

00:11:53.634 --> 00:11:55.768
you'd probably prefer to stay on the left.

00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:59.833
The only problem is if you introduce
this economically efficient solution,

00:11:59.857 --> 00:12:01.007
people hate it ...

00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:04.965
because they think you're deliberately
creating delays at the bridge

00:12:04.989 --> 00:12:06.643
in order to maximize your revenue,

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:10.055
and, "Why on earth should I pay
to subsidize your incompetence?"

00:12:10.376 --> 00:12:12.556
On the other hand,
change the frame slightly

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.871
and create charitable yield management,

00:12:14.895 --> 00:12:18.029
so the extra money you get
goes not to the bridge company,

00:12:18.053 --> 00:12:19.244
it goes to charity ...

00:12:20.211 --> 00:12:23.056
and the mental willingness
to pay completely changes.

00:12:24.128 --> 00:12:26.771
You have a relatively
economically efficient solution,

00:12:26.795 --> 00:12:29.114
but one that actually meets
with public approval

00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:31.138
and even a small degree of affection,

00:12:31.162 --> 00:12:33.351
rather than being seen as bastardy.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.158
So where economists
make the fundamental mistake

00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:39.147
is they think that money is money.

00:12:40.275 --> 00:12:44.506
Actually, my pain experienced
in paying five pounds

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.677
is not just proportionate to the amount,

00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:48.685
but where I think that money is going.

00:12:49.314 --> 00:12:52.310
And I think understanding that
could revolutionize tax policy.

00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:54.337
It could revolutionize
the public services.

00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:56.874
It could actually change things
quite significantly.

00:12:56.898 --> 00:12:58.360
[Ludwig Von Mises is my hero.]

00:12:58.384 --> 00:13:00.098
Here's a guy you all need to study.

00:13:00.122 --> 00:13:01.727
He's an Austrian School economist

00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:06.315
who was first active in the first half
of the 20th century in Vienna.

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:08.531
What was interesting
about the Austrian School

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:11.588
is they actually grew up alongside Freud.

00:13:11.612 --> 00:13:14.265
And so they're predominantly
interested in psychology.

00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:18.842
They believed that there was
a discipline called praxeology,

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:21.462
which is a prior discipline
to the study of economics.

00:13:21.486 --> 00:13:25.934
Praxeology is the study of human choice,
action and decision-making.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.985
I think they're right.

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:30.077
I think the danger
we have in today's world

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.781
is we have the study of economics

00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:35.835
considers itself to be a prior discipline
to the study of human psychology.

00:13:35.859 --> 00:13:38.828
But as Charlie Munger says,
"If economics isn't behavioral,

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:40.399
I don't know what the hell is."

00:13:41.804 --> 00:13:47.605
Von Mises, interestingly, believes
economics is just a subset of psychology.

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:49.534
I think he just refers to economics

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:52.838
as "the study of human praxeology
under conditions of scarcity."

00:13:53.742 --> 00:13:56.838
But Von Mises, among many other things,

00:13:56.862 --> 00:14:01.512
I think uses an analogy which is probably
the best justification and explanation

00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:05.743
for the value of marketing,
the value of perceived value

00:14:05.767 --> 00:14:09.044
and the fact that we should treat it
as being absolutely equivalent

00:14:09.068 --> 00:14:10.551
to any other kind of value.

00:14:11.054 --> 00:14:14.006
We tend to, all of us, even those of us
who work in marketing,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.328
think of value in two ways:

00:14:15.352 --> 00:14:18.249
the real value, which is when
you make something in a factory

00:14:18.273 --> 00:14:19.427
or provide a service,

00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:21.069
and then there's a dubious value,

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:23.904
which you create by changing
the way people look at things.

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:26.222
Von Mises completely rejected
this distinction.

00:14:26.246 --> 00:14:28.137
And he used this following analogy:

00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:33.494
he referred to strange economists
called the French physiocrats,

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:37.148
who believed that the only true value
was what you extracted from the land.

00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:39.657
So if you're a shepherd
or a quarryman or a farmer,

00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:41.102
you created true value.

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:43.985
If however, you bought
some wool from the shepherd

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.990
and charged a premium
for converting it into a hat,

00:14:47.014 --> 00:14:48.796
you weren't actually creating value,

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.580
you were exploiting the shepherd.

00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:55.162
Now, Von Mises said that modern
economists make exactly the same mistake

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.243
with regard to advertising and marketing.

00:14:57.577 --> 00:14:59.459
He says if you run a restaurant,

00:14:59.483 --> 00:15:01.722
there is no healthy distinction to be made

00:15:01.746 --> 00:15:04.299
between the value you create
by cooking the food

00:15:04.323 --> 00:15:06.626
and the value you create
by sweeping the floor.

00:15:07.203 --> 00:15:09.693
One of them creates, perhaps,
the primary product --

00:15:09.717 --> 00:15:11.582
the thing we think we're paying for --

00:15:11.606 --> 00:15:14.447
the other one creates a context
within which we can enjoy

00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:15.995
and appreciate that product.

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:19.191
And the idea that one of them
should have priority over the other

00:15:19.215 --> 00:15:20.365
is fundamentally wrong.

00:15:20.944 --> 00:15:22.611
Try this quick thought experiment:

00:15:22.635 --> 00:15:25.286
imagine a restaurant
that serves Michelin-starred food,

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.957
but where the restaurant smells of sewage

00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:30.119
and there's human feces on the floor.

00:15:30.143 --> 00:15:31.552
(Laughter)

00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:34.069
The best thing you can do there
to create value

00:15:34.093 --> 00:15:37.109
is not actually to improve
the food still further,

00:15:37.133 --> 00:15:39.932
it's to get rid of the smell
and clean up the floor.

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:44.812
And it's vital we understand this.

00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:47.483
If that seems like a sort
of strange, abstruse thing --

00:15:47.507 --> 00:15:51.405
in the UK, the post office
had a 98 percent success rate

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:53.613
at delivering first-class
mail the next day.

00:15:54.192 --> 00:15:56.077
They decided this wasn't good enough,

00:15:56.101 --> 00:15:57.893
and they wanted to get it up to 99.

00:15:59.234 --> 00:16:02.607
The effort to do that
almost broke the organization.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.910
If, at the same time,
you'd gone and asked people,

00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:08.753
"What percentage of first-class mail
arrives the next day?"

00:16:08.777 --> 00:16:12.683
the average answer, or the modal answer,
would have been "50 to 60 percent."

00:16:13.381 --> 00:16:16.095
Now, if your perception
is much worse than your reality,

00:16:16.119 --> 00:16:19.143
what on earth are you doing
trying to change the reality?

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:22.782
That's like trying to improve the food
in a restaurant that stinks.

00:16:24.362 --> 00:16:27.080
What you need to do is,
first of all, tell people

00:16:27.104 --> 00:16:31.611
that 98 percent of first-class mail
gets there the next day.

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:33.156
That's pretty good.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.388
I would argue, in Britain,
there's a much better frame of reference,

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.779
which is to tell people that more
first-class mail arrives the next day

00:16:39.803 --> 00:16:42.518
in the UK than in Germany,
because generally, in Britain,

00:16:42.542 --> 00:16:44.826
if you want to make us happy
about something,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.042
just tell us we do it
better than the Germans.

00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:48.796
(Laughter)

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.072
(Applause)

00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:54.317
Choose your frame of reference
and the perceived value,

00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:57.747
and therefore, the actual value
is completely transformed.

00:16:57.771 --> 00:16:59.416
It has to be said of the Germans

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.142
that the Germans and the French
are doing a brilliant job

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.620
of creating a united Europe.

00:17:03.644 --> 00:17:06.514
The only thing they didn't expect
is they're uniting Europe

00:17:06.538 --> 00:17:09.536
through a shared mild hatred
of the French and Germans.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.610
But I'm British;
that's the way we like it.

00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:13.759
(Laughter)

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.220
What you'll also notice
is that, in any case,

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.434
our perception is leaky.

00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:20.336
We can't tell the difference
between the quality of the food

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.373
and the environment
in which we consume it.

00:17:22.397 --> 00:17:24.435
All of you will have seen this phenomenon

00:17:24.459 --> 00:17:26.441
if you have your car washed or valeted.

00:17:26.465 --> 00:17:29.586
When you drive away,
your car feels as if it drives better.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.951
(Laughter)

00:17:30.975 --> 00:17:32.231
And the reason for this --

00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:34.903
unless my car valet
mysteriously is changing the oil

00:17:34.927 --> 00:17:38.270
and performing work which I'm not paying
him for and I'm unaware of --

00:17:38.294 --> 00:17:40.601
is because perception
is, in any case, leaky.

00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:44.542
Analgesics that are branded
are more effective at reducing pain

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:46.377
than analgesics that are not branded.

00:17:46.401 --> 00:17:49.019
I don't just mean through reported
pain reduction --

00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:50.714
actual measured pain reduction.

00:17:50.738 --> 00:17:55.362
And so perception
actually is leaky in any case.

00:17:56.021 --> 00:17:59.039
So if you do something
that's perceptually bad in one respect,

00:17:59.063 --> 00:18:00.286
you can damage the other.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.461
Thank you very much.

00:18:01.485 --> 00:18:03.873
(Applause)
