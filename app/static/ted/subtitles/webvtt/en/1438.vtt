00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.563
Four years ago today, exactly, actually,

00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:05.659
I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.

00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:09.779
Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.654
for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.

00:00:13.654 --> 00:00:17.845
My name's Tavi Gevinson, and

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:20.985
the title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out,"

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:23.232
and the MS Paint quality of my slides

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:26.544
was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:28.160
and has nothing to do with my inability

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.505
to use PowerPoint. (Laughter)

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:36.065
So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.936
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.352
what makes a strong female character,

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:43.440
and, you know, movies and TV shows,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.706
these things have influence. My own website.

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:50.497
So I think the question of what makes a strong female

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:52.874
character often goes misinterpreted,

00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:56.167
and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:59.759
who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot,

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.352
like a Catwoman type,

00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:06.230
or she plays her sexuality up a lot,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.422
and it's seen as power.

00:01:07.422 --> 00:01:10.821
But they're not strong characters who happen to be female.

00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:12.549
They're completely flat,

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.033
and they're basically cardboard characters.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.850
The problem with this is that then

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:20.712
people expect women to be that easy to understand,

00:01:20.712 --> 00:01:23.039
and women are mad at themselves

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.381
for not being that simple,

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:27.338
when, in actuality, women are complicated,

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:30.736
women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy,

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:32.488
but because people are crazy,

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:36.150
and women happen to be people. (Laughter)

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420
So the flaws are the key.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.278
I'm not the first person to say this.

00:01:40.278 --> 00:01:42.326
What makes a strong female character

00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:47.230
is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.214
who is maybe not immediately likable,

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:51.676
but eventually relatable.

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:53.145
I don't like to acknowledge a problem

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:55.811
without also acknowledging those who work to fix it,

00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:58.878
so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men,"

00:01:58.878 --> 00:02:01.758
movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters

00:02:01.758 --> 00:02:05.889
or protagonists are complex, multifaceted.

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:10.105
Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO

00:02:10.105 --> 00:02:12.296
that premiers next month, "Girls,"

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:14.813
she said she wanted to start it because she felt that

00:02:14.813 --> 00:02:17.801
every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:20.009
and that feels accurate for all people,

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.673
but you don't see women represented like that as much.

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:26.257
Congrats, guys. (Laughs)

00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:29.960
But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.496
of women who are not represented that way,

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:34.952
and one group that we'll focus on today are teens,

00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:38.232
because I think teenagers are especially contradictory

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:41.272
and still figuring it out,

00:02:41.272 --> 00:02:44.621
and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks"

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:47.400
and "My So-Called Life," and their characters,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.056
Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase,

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:52.744
I mean, the whole premise of the shows

00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:56.190
were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.288
but those shows only lasted a season each,

00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:04.250
and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.636
So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) —

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:12.093
around the time when I was,

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.750
when I started watching those TV shows.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.945
I was ending middle school, starting high school --

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:19.209
I'm a sophomore now —

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.965
and I was trying to reconcile

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:24.624
all of these differences that you're told you can't be

00:03:24.624 --> 00:03:25.971
when you're growing up as a girl.

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.591
You can't be smart and pretty.

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:31.414
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:35.308
You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake

00:03:35.308 --> 00:03:38.341
of what other people, usually men, will think of you.

00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:41.312
So I was trying to figure all that out,

00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:44.613
and I felt a little confused,

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:46.355
and I said so on my blog,

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:50.540
and I said that I wanted to start

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.044
a website for teenage girls

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:56.482
that was not this kind of one-dimensional

00:03:56.482 --> 00:03:59.186
strong character empowerment thing

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:02.176
because I think one thing that can be very alienating

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:04.808
about a misconception of feminism is that

00:04:04.808 --> 00:04:08.403
girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to

00:04:08.403 --> 00:04:10.894
being perfectly consistent in your beliefs,

00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:14.305
never being insecure, never having doubts,

00:04:14.305 --> 00:04:17.207
having all of the answers. And this is not true,

00:04:17.207 --> 00:04:21.260
and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.003
became easier once I understood that feminism

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:27.206
was not a rulebook but a discussion,

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:29.330
a conversation, a process,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.501
and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.851
when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit

00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.954
on the illustration front since.

00:04:37.954 --> 00:04:41.928
But, yeah.

00:04:41.944 --> 00:04:46.343
So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication

00:04:46.343 --> 00:04:48.832
for teenage girls and ask people to submit

00:04:48.832 --> 00:04:50.937
their writing, their photography, whatever,

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:52.603
to be a member of our staff.

00:04:52.603 --> 00:04:55.527
I got about 3,000 emails.

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:58.199
My editorial director and I went through them and

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.202
put together a staff of people,

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:03.802
and we launched last September.

00:05:03.802 --> 00:05:06.157
And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,

00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:09.511
where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers,

00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:12.240
we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.199
give girls the answers, and not even give them permission

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.773
to find the answers themselves,

00:05:18.773 --> 00:05:20.941
but hopefully inspire them to understand that

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.664
they can give themselves that permission,

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:25.548
they can ask their own questions, find their own answers,

00:05:25.548 --> 00:05:28.299
all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:33.642
a nice place for all of that to be figured out.

00:05:33.642 --> 00:05:35.577
So I'm not saying, "Be like us,"

00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:37.945
and "We're perfect role models," because we're not,

00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:43.057
but we just want to help represent girls

00:05:43.057 --> 00:05:46.078
in a way that shows those different dimensions.

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:49.872
I mean, we have articles called

00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:53.054
"On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"

00:05:53.054 --> 00:05:55.021
but we also have articles like,

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.982
oops -- I'm figuring it out!

00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:01.508
Ha ha. (Laughter)

00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:05.306
If you use that, you can get away with anything.

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:06.497
We also have articles called

00:06:06.497 --> 00:06:10.003
"How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:13.036
So all of that being said, I still really appreciate

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:17.003
those characters in movies and

00:06:17.003 --> 00:06:18.816
articles like that on our site,

00:06:18.816 --> 00:06:22.059
that aren't just about being totally powerful,

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:25.109
maybe finding your acceptance with yourself

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:30.668
and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.

00:06:30.668 --> 00:06:34.286
So what I you to take away from my talk,

00:06:34.286 --> 00:06:38.508
the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.

00:06:38.508 --> 00:06:41.882
Like, that's all you have to do. (Laughter)

00:06:41.882 --> 00:06:44.761
Because my favorite thing about her,

00:06:44.761 --> 00:06:47.821
other than, like, everything, is that

00:06:47.821 --> 00:06:50.229
she is very -- has always been

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:53.134
unapologetically present on stage,

00:06:53.134 --> 00:06:55.941
and unapologetic about her flaws

00:06:55.941 --> 00:07:00.079
and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:03.671
and she makes you listen to them and think about them,

00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:05.053
and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.

00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:10.151
Thank you. (Applause)
