00:00:00.323 --> 00:00:02.788
I'll tell you a little bit about my story
and who I am.

00:00:02.788 --> 00:00:05.436
I'm a fashion photographer
based in New York City.

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.258
I've worked for lots 
of different magazines in New York,

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:13.056
I've worked for Elle and for Marie Claire,

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:14.998
and for Interview and for GQ,

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:17.505
and I got to work 
with some really beautiful people.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.826
My studio is in New York,

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:21.047
but I also lived in Milan
for about eight years,

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:22.746
and in Paris as well,

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:25.644
and worked for the house 
of Yves St. Laurent.

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:28.358
I also did portraiture as well.

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.904
I've worked for lots 
of different magazines,

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:34.653
lots of great clients.

00:00:34.653 --> 00:00:37.294
But I was always told,
every single day, who was beautiful.

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:38.826
I was forced to work

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:41.268
within certain parameters 
of the beauty standard.

00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:43.841
I was told, "This is the most 
amazing model of the moment,

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:45.227
you've got to photograph her.

00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:47.305
She's incredible, you've got to."

00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:49.421
And then the next season,
it would change again,

00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:51.768
and I'd have to shift my ideas of beauty,

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:53.474
and so we'd go to the next model,

00:00:53.474 --> 00:00:56.205
and it was kind of really crazy,
because I'm an artist.

00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:57.849
I saw beauty everywhere.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.769
I didn't see beauty 
just on a magazine cover.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.764
I did a shoot with, of 
course, Cindy, for Revlon,

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:06.602
and really fantastic, beautiful people.

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:07.888
But I thought,

00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:10.590
someone's always telling me 
who's beautiful.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.086
And I was kind of frustrated.

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:13.840
I left my studio one 
afternoon in New York,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.461
and I was walking down Park Avenue,

00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:18.552
and I saw, waiting for a bus 
at the corner of Park and 20th,

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:20.593
this gorgeous kid.

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:24.406
She had long, white, beautiful hair,
and pale, pale skin.

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:27.109
She had a genetic condition 
called albinism.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.939
I didn't know much about it, 
but she was stunning,

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.721
and I'd never met 
a model like this before.

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.281
And I went to grab her and say,

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:34.431
"I have to take your photograph, 
you're amazing!"

00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:36.392
And the bus came, she got on, 
and then she took off,

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:38.413
and I was really glad because she was 12,

00:01:38.413 --> 00:01:40.324
and I'd be in prison at the moment.
(Laughter)

00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:43.057
But really, it was 
extraordinary to see this kid.

00:01:43.057 --> 00:01:45.505
So I continued right down to Union Square,

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.916
to the huge Barnes and Noble,

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:49.548
and started pulling any books,
or any information I could

00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:51.644
about this genetic condition, albinism.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.975
And I found really kind of sad images.

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:55.673
I didn't find images of this kid.

00:01:55.673 --> 00:01:59.171
I found images of people 
sitting in hospital beds, looking sad,

00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:02.742
looking downtrodden, 
just images of despair.

00:02:02.742 --> 00:02:06.105
I found images 
of a bright red eye, the albino eye.

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.320
I'm thinking, 
this kid had beautiful blue eyes,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.785
she didn't have red eyes.

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:11.812
And then I started seeing 
images from Africa,

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:15.322
where kids were surrounded by tribes 
pointing spears at them

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.261
or in cancer wards and clinics,

00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:20.114
or they're just in beds, 
and images of illness,

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:22.107
of sadness, of sickness.

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:23.661
And then, I started, of course,

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:25.161
going through
those same medical textbooks,

00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.362
and started finding 
these typical images

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:30.996
of kids and adults in their underwear, 
against walls in doctor's offices,

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:34.118
with the black bar across their eyes 
saying "disease."

00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:36.572
This is a disease, defined by a disease.

00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:39.186
And I was like, this is crazy.

00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:40.964
And then I started going into it further,

00:02:40.964 --> 00:02:42.308
looking on the Internet,

00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:44.068
and all these different medical textbooks,

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:46.978
and everything was so sad, 
and so negative.

00:02:46.978 --> 00:02:51.125
I then started finding images 
of the albino freak family in the circus,

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.145
and then of course, 
all the movie references,

00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:57.835
from "Powder," who had albinism because
his mother was struck by lightning,

00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:01.467
to "The Princess Bride" and 
to "The Matrix Reloaded,"

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:04.157
there were the ghost-like twins 
that came in and wreaked havoc,

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:06.552
and destroyed things and then disappeared.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.808
Even most recently, "The Da Vinci Code,"

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:11.698
there was like the evil albino 
driving around Paris at night,

00:03:11.698 --> 00:03:13.944
killing people, shooting at people.

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:15.949
Well, I found out, through my research,

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.193
that people with albinism 
have a visual impairment.

00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:21.507
There's always vision, 
but they're considered legally blind.

00:03:21.507 --> 00:03:23.831
So they certainly wouldn't be driving 
around Paris at night

00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.971
shooting at anybody
and expect to hit anything.

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.358
So I'm thinking, this is crazy.

00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:29.852
So I contact NOAH.

00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:34.753
Now, NOAH is the National Organization 
for Albinism and Hypopigmentation.

00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:37.229
It's a support group for people 
living with this condition,

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.575
and their families.

00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:40.611
And I'm like, "Hey, I'm a 
fashion photographer.

00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:42.847
Let's show the world 
the beauty of albinism!"

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.661
And they said, "Get lost."

00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:47.003
And I'm pretty persistent. I'm 
like, "Won't you talk to me?"

00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:48.934
And they made it very clear to me

00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:51.135
about their fears of exploitation,

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:52.884
that every time there 
was a magazine article

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:54.753
that came out about a kid with albinism,

00:03:54.753 --> 00:03:56.460
it was a story about a victim.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.915
It was sad, or it was exploitative,

00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:02.316
or sensational — never 
positive, always negative.

00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:05.351
And I said, "Okay, well then, 
what do we do here?"

00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.067
So, let's form a nontraditional partnership —

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:10.685
fashion photographer, 
genetic support group —

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.092
and we'll work together.

00:04:12.092 --> 00:04:13.150
And you can keep an eye on me

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.228
to make sure that we create 
something positive and powerful,

00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:18.797
showing the world the beauty of albinism.

00:04:18.797 --> 00:04:19.988
And they said okay.

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:21.694
And I was like, fantastic, let's do this!

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.834
So in walks the first person 
I'm about to photograph.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:27.421
Her name is Christine, 
and Christine is a knockout.

00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:30.196
Long white hair, really tall. 
She's stunning.

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:31.968
She walks into my studio.

00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:35.005
The way that she walks in, though, 
instead of this gorgeous girl,

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.538
she walks in like this, her head's down,

00:04:37.538 --> 00:04:42.068
shoulders hunched, one-word answers, 
she looks down, no eye contact.

00:04:42.068 --> 00:04:46.020
This kid has been teased her whole life 
because of her difference.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.852
And it was so apparent in the fact 
that it left her with zero self-esteem.

00:04:51.852 --> 00:04:55.879
And I'm thinking, oh, this 
kid is just so fragile.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.752
And just the day before, 
I was shooting Cindy

00:04:57.752 --> 00:04:59.801
on the same set, in my studio.

00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.391
I'm thinking well, 
I have to be so careful with her — no,

00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:05.151
out of respect for this gorgeous kid,

00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:06.983
I'm going to photograph her 
like I would anybody else.

00:05:06.983 --> 00:05:09.534
So the fan went on, the music went on,

00:05:09.534 --> 00:05:11.075
and I grabbed a mirror 
that was next to the set,

00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:12.992
and I held it up to her, and I said

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:17.071
Christine, look at yourself. 
You're magnificent.

00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:19.852
And she looked in the mirror, 
and she got it.

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.768
And she went from this to that.

00:05:22.768 --> 00:05:26.480
And that's our Christine, 
and she just exploded in front of the set.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.602
By the time she left the studio, 
she was kissing everybody on both cheeks,

00:05:30.602 --> 00:05:33.602
and saying, "Ciao!" 
and she was unbelievable.

00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:36.799
And I saw this transformation 
right in front of the lens,

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:39.596
through photography, 
that she was now transformed,

00:05:39.596 --> 00:05:42.943
with a powerful and positive sense 
of who she is.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.787
The next day, she goes to school,

00:05:44.787 --> 00:05:47.847
she's going to change the way 
her community sees her difference.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.185
Instead of walking into 
that classroom like this,

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:51.608
she's walking in like this.

00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:54.046
So it's all about ambassadors for change.

00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:55.104
It was extraordinary.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:57.894
And those first images, right after,
we did a series of them,

00:05:57.894 --> 00:06:01.327
using several individuals 
with this condition,

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:04.541
they were in Life magazine in 1998.

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:05.911
So it was a while ago.

00:06:05.911 --> 00:06:08.153
It was a cover story, 
it was a five-page spread.

00:06:08.153 --> 00:06:12.325
It was really a fantastic editorial.
It was great; I loved it.

00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:15.632
Then we used a lot of the images, 
though, from Life,

00:06:15.632 --> 00:06:18.768
and put them in other magazines, 
magazines worldwide.

00:06:18.768 --> 00:06:22.435
Magazines in the U.K., in France, 
in Italy and Canada,

00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:25.237
and other magazines in the States.
It was amazing.

00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:27.475
So this is from the U.K., Christine again.

00:06:27.475 --> 00:06:30.351
Friends Jen and Ruthie are sisters, 
and Kristen.

00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:33.913
That's Lauren. 
We did a campaign for sunglasses.

00:06:33.913 --> 00:06:36.606
A lot of kids with this condition 
are photophobic,

00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:39.018
so they have 
a real strong light sensitivity.

00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:41.988
So we thought, 
perfect for a sunglass campaign.

00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:45.518
People magazine did a great story.

00:06:45.518 --> 00:06:48.586
So it was circulating, 
people were saying all this great stuff.

00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:50.174
It was fantastic.

00:06:50.174 --> 00:06:51.724
So I was getting calls, though.

00:06:51.724 --> 00:06:54.428
Getting calls from the U.K.,
saying, well we just saw this spread,

00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:57.725
can you come photograph our 
kids with this condition?

00:06:57.725 --> 00:07:00.253
We have a support group here, 
can you come meet our families?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.370
People in Africa were calling in the same.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.342
New Zealand, can you help 
us start a support group?

00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:07.133
I'm like, fantastic! 
This is great! Let's do it!

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:09.527
So I would travel in all these places,

00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:11.951
as I was shooting 
and doing my commercial work,

00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:14.436
I was at a local chapter conference 
in Philadelphia.

00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:16.503
Small family conference, 
about 40 families,

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:18.934
did my presentation of kids with albinism,

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:20.947
this mom came up to me, and she said,

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:23.281
"My son Randy, when he was a little boy,

00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:25.848
he'd come home from school, 
and I could see the kids were teasing him,

00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:27.225
and he'd be in tears.

00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:30.313
And I'd buy him an ice-cream cone,
or a toy truck,

00:07:30.313 --> 00:07:31.655
and he'd forget about it."

00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:34.574
She said, "Now he's in high school.
He comes home from school,

00:07:34.574 --> 00:07:38.018
I can see the pain, 
the anguish in his eyes.

00:07:38.018 --> 00:07:40.914
He walks in, he walks right past me,

00:07:40.914 --> 00:07:42.482
goes up to his room, slams the door,

00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:44.365
and I don't see him until the next day.

00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:45.976
He's not going to want to be photographed,

00:07:45.976 --> 00:07:47.317
he has zero self-esteem,

00:07:47.317 --> 00:07:52.383
this kid has such poor body image,
and he's just so shy.

00:07:52.383 --> 00:07:55.852
But if you could just show him 
photographs of kids his own age,

00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:58.068
so that he knows he's not alone."

00:07:58.068 --> 00:08:00.095
I'm like, "Of course. Where is he? Show me!"

00:08:00.095 --> 00:08:01.385
She points over to Randy.

00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:03.306
Now Randy's sitting there — 
his pants are hanging down to here,

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:06.158
his underwear's hanging out, 
he has this long, great big shirt,

00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:09.240
he has ten earrings, he has a tattoo.
He's amazing, this kid.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.874
I crawl over to Randy.

00:08:10.874 --> 00:08:14.244
I'm like, "Randy, 
I speak to moms and dads every single day,

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.484
terrified about the future 
of their kids with albinism.

00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:19.169
All they have to do 
is take one look at you,

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:20.403
and they're going to be fine.

00:08:20.403 --> 00:08:21.957
Please let me take a photo of you.

00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:23.122
Your mother said, she told me,

00:08:23.122 --> 00:08:24.848
that you didn't want to be photographed."

00:08:24.848 --> 00:08:26.685
He said, "Rick, 
what do you mean?

00:08:26.685 --> 00:08:29.402
You have to understand, I'm 16 years old.

00:08:29.402 --> 00:08:31.139
I don't talk to my mother."

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:34.727
And then he said, "I want to be photographed.

00:08:34.727 --> 00:08:36.784
I want to show the world that who I am,

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:38.192
with my albinism, but also 
other things about me —"

00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:39.686
You see how shy he was.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.183
Very, very shy, Randy.

00:08:41.183 --> 00:08:43.895
But Randy created, 
early days in this idea,

00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:46.027
of this nonprofit group 
Positive Exposure,

00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:47.549
the idea of networking stories,

00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:50.939
sharing experiences and the images 
around the world.

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:53.419
I'll kind of quickly go through the album.

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:55.192
I was very interested, at that point,

00:08:55.192 --> 00:08:57.251
getting calls from everybody in the world,

00:08:57.251 --> 00:09:00.559
to find out more about this idea, 
a message, about albinism,

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:04.795
or perceptions of people in communities 
about this syndrome, albinism.

00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:08.322
So I started hearing about stigmas, 
and discrimination,

00:09:08.322 --> 00:09:11.695
so what I looked at is really trying 
to explore cultural perceptions

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:14.221
and attitudes towards this condition.

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:16.928
This is my friend [unclear], 
who's a Kuna Indian

00:09:16.928 --> 00:09:19.268
in the San Blas region of the world,

00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:22.602
the San Blas region of Panama.

00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:24.064
She's extraordinary.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.618
So the incidence of albinism 
is about one in 20,000 worldwide.

00:09:27.618 --> 00:09:32.858
In the Kuna Indian, it's one in 125, 
the highest incidence in the world.

00:09:32.858 --> 00:09:36.458
We went to Fiji, actually, where we 
found out at the turn of the 19th century,

00:09:36.458 --> 00:09:38.767
a tribe could not hold their territory

00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:43.225
unless they had somebody with albinism 
in a powerful political position.

00:09:43.225 --> 00:09:46.022
My great friend Keke, 
I photographed in New Zealand,

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:48.769
she's from India, from Delhi,

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:52.037
but her family left Delhi 
because she was getting death threats.

00:09:52.037 --> 00:09:54.295
Now I'm thinking, 
this is horrible that they had to move,

00:09:54.295 --> 00:09:55.733
because she's eight years old.

00:09:55.733 --> 00:09:58.072
And we actually started 
a support group in Delhi,

00:09:58.072 --> 00:10:00.946
we found out that there are many kids
that we worked with in their communities,

00:10:00.946 --> 00:10:02.829
after we started this group in India,

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:05.078
that have had really positive experiences.

00:10:05.078 --> 00:10:07.137
So one of the things 
we want to make very clear

00:10:07.137 --> 00:10:09.099
is that we're not making generalizations

00:10:09.099 --> 00:10:10.611
about a community or a culture,

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.545
and their reaction 
to people that are different.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.235
Keke's experiences were very different,

00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:15.827
but we've met many kids there

00:10:15.827 --> 00:10:19.209
that have been embraced 
by their communities throughout India.

00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:22.272
A great friend Sue Anna from Korea.

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:27.414
Tom, who was just adopted 
by an American family, from China,

00:10:27.414 --> 00:10:30.685
This is my great friend 
Harry from Puerto Rico.

00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:31.928
And Natalia.

00:10:31.928 --> 00:10:35.591
She and I started 
the first albinism society in Russia.

00:10:35.591 --> 00:10:39.726
Maizan and her sister 
and mom in Malaysia.

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:42.725
Ceara. All she ever wanted to do 
was be a dancer.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.841
She was told that 
because of her visual impairment,

00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:46.217
she'll never dance.

00:10:46.217 --> 00:10:49.283
She'll never be able to follow 
the choreography or the dance steps.

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:53.804
She's like, they said, 
find another love, another passion.

00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:55.221
She's like, no.

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:57.367
She's New Zealand's Celtic dance champion,

00:10:57.367 --> 00:11:00.647
and just started a school for dance 
for kids with visual impairment.

00:11:00.647 --> 00:11:03.850
I'm going to zip through this. 
Roz, from Australia.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.534
I spend a lot of time in Africa,

00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:08.310
where there's a high incidence 
of mortality associated with albinism,

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.956
due to skin cancer.

00:11:09.956 --> 00:11:12.603
This is my friend Siri, 
who when she was born,

00:11:12.603 --> 00:11:14.504
the father's family 
put her out of the house,

00:11:14.504 --> 00:11:16.865
thinking she was cursed.

00:11:16.865 --> 00:11:18.686
and Mom, not knowing what to do,

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:21.771
put Siri in the sun to get her dark 
like her brothers and sisters.

00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:24.672
So you can see, it's all sun damage.

00:11:24.672 --> 00:11:28.980
A lot of kids that I met throughout Africa
were put in special schools,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.168
schools for the blind,

00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:34.237
not because the tools were better there 
for kids with visual impairment,

00:11:34.237 --> 00:11:36.640
but more importantly, 
because the teasing was so great,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.879
the discrimination is so great,

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:41.218
these kids don't do well 
in mainstream schools.

00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:44.688
I started an albinism society in Kenya 
with my friend C.K.,

00:11:44.688 --> 00:11:46.188
who actually went to a mainstream school.

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:49.092
I'm like, C.K., how is it possible 
you went to a mainstream school?

00:11:49.092 --> 00:11:50.943
Nobody in Africa goes 
to mainstream schools.

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:53.383
She said, "It's because 
of my twin sister, Delphine."

00:11:53.383 --> 00:11:57.237
Fantastic. She said Delphine would get 
all the work off the board,

00:11:57.237 --> 00:11:59.627
the things I couldn't see, 
she'd help me with it.

00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:02.276
If the type was too small, 
she'd blow it up for me, she said.

00:12:02.276 --> 00:12:04.408
But more importantly, 
when kids would tease me,

00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:06.136
Delphine would beat them up.

00:12:06.136 --> 00:12:07.734
(Laughter)

00:12:07.734 --> 00:12:10.093
But on a sadder note, I was spending 
a lot of time in Tanzania,

00:12:10.093 --> 00:12:11.280
where witch doctors are saying,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.490
bring me the bones of an albino,

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.760
and I'll make a potion
that will make you rich.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.922
So we're working very closely 
with the government there,

00:12:17.922 --> 00:12:19.638
I've been there six times 
in the last two years,

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:25.862
to create public awareness programs
to save these kids.

00:12:25.862 --> 00:12:27.711
This is the dancer.

00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:29.900
This is in the Shinyanga region.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.739
This is one of the visuals 
that we created in East Africa,

00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:36.718
trying to fight and educate the public.

00:12:36.718 --> 00:12:39.986
I received the Art of Reporting award, 
from an organization

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:42.040
called the Chromosome 18 Registry.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.789
The larger organization 
was the Genetic Alliance,

00:12:45.789 --> 00:12:47.768
which was a coalition 
of all the genetic support groups,

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:50.788
and it was the award 
for the Life magazine piece.

00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:52.268
The president at the time said,

00:12:52.268 --> 00:12:53.637
I'm also the founder and director

00:12:53.637 --> 00:12:56.346
of the Chromosome 18 Research Society 
and Registry.

00:12:56.346 --> 00:12:58.587
I'm like, fantastic! 
That's great. What's that?

00:12:58.587 --> 00:13:01.803
She's like, well, if you have an anomaly 
on your 18th chromosome,

00:13:01.803 --> 00:13:05.071
then you have all kinds of problems 
and difficulties and challenges,

00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:08.387
and then we look after you, 
through this support group, like NOAH is.

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.462
So I'm like, that's great.

00:13:10.462 --> 00:13:12.427
She said, 
I see there's a universal message here,

00:13:12.427 --> 00:13:15.094
about all kids with differences, 
so it's not just about albinism.

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:17.793
Would you come and speak 
to our families in San Antonio

00:13:17.793 --> 00:13:19.472
with these chromosome 18 anomalies?

00:13:19.472 --> 00:13:22.102
I'm like, sure! 
I went back to them thinking,

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:23.502
what the hell is 
a chromosome 18 anomaly?

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.952
I was an art major
at the school of visual arts,

00:13:24.952 --> 00:13:26.641
I had no idea.

00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:30.070
But I looked it up, 
these are the images that I saw.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.886
I'm thinking, albinism was so easy, 
this is going to be rough.

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:34.961
But I went to San Antonio,

00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:37.596
walked down to the auditorium 
where the kids and young adults were,

00:13:37.596 --> 00:13:39.488
opened the door, 
and I was instantly surrounded

00:13:39.488 --> 00:13:40.920
by kids screaming with laughter.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.404
There were kids with cleft palates, 
kids with mobility issues,

00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:47.346
feeding tubes, trachs, 
but they were kids, first and foremost.

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:48.917
That's Rebecca and Pauline.

00:13:48.917 --> 00:13:52.487
My great friend, that's Ellington. 
He's awesome.

00:13:52.593 --> 00:13:54.109
Remy.

00:13:54.247 --> 00:13:56.693
That's Emory.

00:13:56.693 --> 00:13:58.386
Byron.

00:13:58.386 --> 00:14:00.248
Taylor.

00:14:00.248 --> 00:14:01.795
Elizabeth.

00:14:01.795 --> 00:14:03.872
And my great friend Sean.

00:14:03.872 --> 00:14:07.733
So we decided at that point 
to involve other organizations

00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:10.975
to be part of this larger exhibition

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:16.187
that was going to be sent out from 
the People's Genome Celebration in 2001.

00:14:16.187 --> 00:14:19.435
The National Human Genome Research 
Institute and the Genetic Alliance

00:14:19.435 --> 00:14:22.476
invited me to create an exhibition 
at the Smithsonian,

00:14:22.476 --> 00:14:24.666
commemorating the mapping 
of the human genome.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:27.109
So we actually invited 
other genetic support groups

00:14:27.109 --> 00:14:30.428
to be part of this exhibition, 
not just on albinism, but all groups,

00:14:30.428 --> 00:14:32.874
again illustrating 
the universal applicability.

00:14:32.874 --> 00:14:35.102
I saw these images 
from the Marfan Foundation,

00:14:35.102 --> 00:14:38.574
these kids grow very, very tall, 
at risk of an aortic dissection,

00:14:38.574 --> 00:14:40.891
but they're amazing kids,
and I thought, how gorgeous.

00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:43.811
And I understood 
the importance of this image,

00:14:43.811 --> 00:14:45.920
how important it was 
to show how beautiful,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.919
and to show how the image presents itself.

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:49.778
But isn't there another way to show it?

00:14:49.778 --> 00:14:51.940
Because nobody, and I've photographed 
thousands of kids now,

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.022
with Marfan Syndrome,

00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:56.055
and nobody stands like this, 
with a portable black bar.

00:14:56.055 --> 00:14:58.734
It's extraordinary. 
So we decided to put them in a pool,

00:14:58.734 --> 00:15:00.980
show Billy swimming --
["Bill with Marfan Syndrome"] --

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.897
show how it presents itself, 
but keep going,

00:15:02.897 --> 00:15:05.574
and keep presenting how these kids look,

00:15:05.574 --> 00:15:08.481
but put the humanity 
back in these gorgeous images.

00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:11.709
I only have a few seconds here, 
so I'm going to go through.

00:15:11.709 --> 00:15:13.528
Cool girls at the Costello Conference.

00:15:13.528 --> 00:15:15.628
These are great friends 
Danielle and Maggie,

00:15:15.628 --> 00:15:17.958
who actually met 
at the last Costello Conference.

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.870
For both, the first time they ever met 
anybody with the same syndrome.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.701
They go to the same conferences 
every year and I go and photograph them.

00:15:24.701 --> 00:15:26.187
And this year, 
they were there again in Florida,

00:15:26.187 --> 00:15:28.103
but this time it's a little different.

00:15:28.103 --> 00:15:31.299
They're gangsters now. (Laughter)
But they're pretty amazing kids.

00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:35.320
I just want to talk very briefly 
about this really great kid,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.793
to talk very briefly about a project 
that we're taking these images,

00:15:41.793 --> 00:15:43.348
and bringing them into high schools.

00:15:43.348 --> 00:15:46.068
I can photograph a great kid in my studio,

00:15:46.068 --> 00:15:49.267
and she's having a brilliant time, 
and she feels 10,000 feet tall.

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:53.282
By the time she leaves my studio 
and gets to Park Avenue,

00:15:53.282 --> 00:15:55.583
five people point at her, 
point at her birthmark,

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:58.094
or at her white hair, or her wheelchair.

00:15:58.094 --> 00:16:01.196
So we have to make it relevant 
for all of us, for all these kids,

00:16:01.213 --> 00:16:05.606
to make people understand what the idea 
of celebrating diversity actually means.

00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:07.512
So we started a project 
called the PEARLS Project,

00:16:07.512 --> 00:16:09.986
where these photographs 
are going into high schools,

00:16:09.986 --> 00:16:12.333
and the kids that are in the images 
are blogging,

00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:14.460
and the students
are following their blogs.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.329
And they all have 
these great video intros.

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:18.885
I just want to give you this last one, 
and this is actually Byron,

00:16:18.885 --> 00:16:20.997
who is actually one of our bloggers.

00:16:20.997 --> 00:16:22.899
(Video) Byron: Hi, my name is Byron.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.601
I live in the D.C. area. I'm 14.

00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:27.339
When I was 10 months old,

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:30.375
I had a left hemispherectomy.

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:34.277
I had the left half of my brain removed,

00:16:34.277 --> 00:16:39.063
because I have something 
called Sturge-Weber Syndrome.

00:16:39.063 --> 00:16:43.835
I wear a brace
on my right leg and right arm.

00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:47.394
I only see out of 
the right side of each eye,

00:16:47.394 --> 00:16:54.875
so sometimes it's harder 
for me to see things on the right side.

00:16:54.875 --> 00:17:01.301
So playing sports can be frustrating, 
because I might not see a ball coming.

00:17:07.122 --> 00:17:10.214
I didn't see that coming. Excuse me.

00:17:10.224 --> 00:17:13.700
Rick Guidotti: So we're using 
all the visual art

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.454
to change public perceptions 
through these great kids.

00:17:16.454 --> 00:17:18.751
I feel as an artist, 
it's my responsibility.

00:17:18.751 --> 00:17:19.992
I know that when I was a kid,

00:17:19.992 --> 00:17:22.553
and I saw someone that was different 
walking down the street,

00:17:22.553 --> 00:17:24.846
If I stared, I got slapped by my mom.

00:17:24.846 --> 00:17:28.300
So the idea was
if you don't stare, look away.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.317
And I think as an artist, 
it's my responsibility,

00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:32.004
and all of our responsibilities,

00:17:32.004 --> 00:17:34.242
to steady that gaze a little bit longer.

00:17:34.242 --> 00:17:37.543
Because you stand there, 
and you'll see a difference.

00:17:37.543 --> 00:17:39.979
You'll start seeing beauty 
in that difference.

00:17:39.979 --> 00:17:42.072
And you'll start seeing 
beautiful gorgeousness,

00:17:42.072 --> 00:17:45.059
and then this light just spreads, 
and once you're enlightened,

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:46.736
it just changes your whole world.

00:17:46.736 --> 00:17:49.186
It's about seeing 
the beauty in all differences.

00:17:49.186 --> 00:17:50.667
Thank you so much, I'm sorry I ran over.

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:52.892
Thank you guys, thank you.
