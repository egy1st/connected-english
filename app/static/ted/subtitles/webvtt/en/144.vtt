00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I really consider myself a storyteller.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But I don't really tell stories in the usual way,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
large numbers of other people to tell their stories,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
people all around the world.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I think people are very similar,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and I think we all see a lot of gaps.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And we define ourselves by our gaps.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There's language gaps,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
there's also religious gaps.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
because they make us feel like we identify with something,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
some smaller community.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But I think that actually, despite our gaps,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we really have a lot in common.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to express ourselves.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But the thing about self-expression

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is that there's traditionally been this imbalance

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
between the desire that we have to express ourselves

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and the number of sympathetic friends

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
who are willing to stand around and listen.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
(Laughter)

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This, also, is nothing new.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by making art, writing poems, singing songs,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
What's new is that in the last several years

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
a lot of these very traditional physical human activities,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And so what I do is, I write computer programs

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that study very large sets of these footprints,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
what they feel, what they think,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
what's different in the world today than usual,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
these sorts of questions.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
One project that explores these ideas,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
which was made about a year ago,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is a piece called We Feel Fine.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This is a piece that every two or three minutes

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
scans the world's newly-posted blog entries

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
for occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And when it finds one of those phrases,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it grabs the sentence up to the period,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Then, knowing the geographical location and the time,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we can also then figure out the weather

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
when that person wrote the sentence.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
All of this information is saved in a database

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It's been running for about a year and a half.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And I'll show you a glimpse

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
each of which represents a single human feeling

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that was stated in the last few hours.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The diameter of each dot

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
represents the length of the sentence inside,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
so that the large dots contain large sentences,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and the small dots contain small sentences.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
"I would just feel so much better

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
in the world of human emotions.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And all of these are stated by people:

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
it's nice to feel bigger again."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And then they also exhibit curiosity.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
You can see some other ones

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
around six words. Those six words represent the six movements

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And I'll walk you through a few of those now.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
"I feel a bit better now."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
"I feel gypped out of something awesome here."

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
"I feel so free; I feel so good."

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
from which it was collected. And in that way,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you can connect with the authors of these statements

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
if you feel some degree of empathy.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The next movement is called Montage.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
to become extracted and display themselves in a grid.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in the last few hours, if you will.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
if it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
(Laughter)

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
These are automatically constructed using the found objects:

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
"I think I feel a little full."

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The next movement is called mobs.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
followed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We can also get a gender breakdown.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And we see that women are slightly more prolific

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
of the world's emotional distribution by age.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We see people in their twenties are the most prolific,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and it dies out very quickly from there.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
of the weather that they represent,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
so that the ones collected on a sunny day

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
swirl around as if they're part of the sun.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
We see that the world is feeling "used"

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
at 3.3 times the normal level right now.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
(Laughter)

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Other views are also available.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Here are gender, age, weather, location.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The final movement is called Mounds.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It's a bit different from the others.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
which kind of jiggle.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
You can see the little pink cursor moving along,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
representing our position.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
There's also a search capability,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted"

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
(Laughter)

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But I'll spare you that.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
"I feel very lonely."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
so that I can feel beautiful."

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
"I feel invisible to you."

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
"I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
(Laughter)

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
"I love how I feel today."

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that I call "passive observation."

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
What I mean by that is that it passively observes people

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and looks at what people are writing,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And because of that,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that are often very moving.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
because people don't know they're being interviewed.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Another technique is directly questioning people.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
the Yahoo! Time Capsule,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It was divided into ten very simple themes --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
love, anger, sadness and so on --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
each of which contained a single, very open-ended question

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The time capsule was available for one month online,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It's a spinning globe,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and words and drawings of people

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that submitted to the time capsule.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
This is in response to, What's beautiful? "Miss World."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
There are two modes to the time capsule.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
There's One World, which presents the spinning globe,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and lets you sift through them one by one.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And we also projected the contents of the time capsule

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
because the first night I looked at all this information

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and saw these images go across the rocks,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
depicted again and again and again.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And there was something very moving

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and how humans have always used the night sky

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
to project their great stories.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I would often look up into the dark sky

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And as an adult, I've been more aware

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And it caused me to wonder about our world today.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And it caused me to wonder specifically,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
if we could make new constellations today,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
what would those look like? What would those be?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
What are the great stories of today?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And those are the questions that inspired my new project,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
which is debuting here today at TED.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So, Universe will open here.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and we'll put it down here to red.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Each of those stars actually represents

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
a specific event in the real world --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
a quote that was stated by somebody, an image,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
a news story, a person, a company. You know,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
some kind of heroic personality.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And you might notice that as the cursor begins

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And we see here a photograph with a head.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
You can start to see words emerging here.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And those are

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
the constellations of today.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And I can turn them all on,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and you can see them moving across the sky now.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The data from this is global news coverage

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
from thousands of news sources around the world.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It's using the API of a really great company that I work with

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
in New York, actually, called Daylife.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words --

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
playing a big role recently.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
We can actually click anything in Universe

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and have it become the center of the universe,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and everything else will enter its orbit.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and swirl around it.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We can click on one of those

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and have the photograph be the center of the universe.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We can click on this and we see this iconic image

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
In Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and you can just kind of click on stuff.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So, if we want to,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
to all things Bill Clinton.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We can have his constellations emerge here.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We can pull out his secrets,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
We can see the stories

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Any of those can be opened up.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You can see that this is an important story;

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
we get different perspectives on this story.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You can click any of those to go out and read the article

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
We can also see the superstars. These would be the people

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby --

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
of Bill Clinton in the last week or so.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We can see he's been focused in America

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
because he's been campaigning, probably,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And then we can also see a timeline.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
but he was back to work on Sunday morning,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and actually been tapering off since then this week.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And it's not limited to just people or dates,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
but we can actually put in concepts also.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So if I put in climate change for all of 2006,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
we'll see what that universe looks like.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Here we have our secrets.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So we see again, climate change is large:

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Nairobi, global conference, environmental.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And there are also quotes that you can see,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
You know, this is really an infinite thing.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
The superstars of climate change in 2006:

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
United States, Britain, China. You know,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So this is a piece that demands exploration.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
what your own personal mythology might be.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe --

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
it supports both the notion of a global mythology,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and also a personal mythology.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and then see what the constellations of those might look like.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(Applause)
