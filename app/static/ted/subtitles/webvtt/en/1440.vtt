00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:03.280
Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.073
because, you see, my father's name was Ted,

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:11.087
and much of my life, especially my musical life,

00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:14.208
is really a talk that I'm still having with him,

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:17.956
or the part of me that he continues to be.

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.560
Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.875
and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.410
He didn't read a note,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.375
and he was profoundly hearing impaired.

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.633
Yet, he was my greatest teacher.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:37.070
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.250
his understanding of music was profound.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.631
And for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes

00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:47.827
as about what it witnesses and where it can take you.

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.444
And he did a painting of this experience,

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:53.533
which he called "In the Realm of Music."

00:00:53.533 --> 00:01:00.021
Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:02.802
in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:09.644
(Music)

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:12.998
But he was tough when it came to music.

00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:15.704
He said, "There are only two things that matter in music:

00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:17.917
what and how.

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:21.704
And the thing about classical music,

00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:25.032
that what and how, it's inexhaustible."

00:01:25.032 --> 00:01:27.200
That was his passion for the music.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.057
Both my parents really loved it.

00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:31.315
They didn't know all that much about it,

00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:35.042
but they gave me the opportunity to discover it

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:36.958
together with them.

00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.170
And I think inspired by that memory,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.173
it's been my desire to try and bring it

00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:43.218
to as many other people as I can,

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:46.792
sort of pass it on through whatever means.

00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:51.802
And how people get this music, how it comes into their lives,

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:53.258
really fascinates me.

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:55.515
One day in New York, I was on the street

00:01:55.515 --> 00:02:00.920
and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.621
And a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat,

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:06.325
and he took a swing and really connected.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.027
And he watched the ball fly for a second,

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.431
and then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.917
Brah dada dadadadah."

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:16.750
And he ran around the bases.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.485
And I thought, go figure.

00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:24.566
How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:29.238
turn into the victory crow of this New York kid?

00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:33.640
How was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.561
Well when it comes to classical music,

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:37.817
there's an awful lot to pass on,

00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:41.554
much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.

00:02:41.554 --> 00:02:43.166
Because classical music

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:46.583
is an unbroken living tradition

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.833
that goes back over 1,000 years.

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.877
And every one of those years

00:02:51.877 --> 00:02:55.375
has had something unique and powerful to say to us

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.600
about what it's like to be alive.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.159
Now the raw material of it, of course,

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.875
is just the music of everyday life.

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:05.908
It's all the anthems and dance crazes

00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:07.643
and ballads and marches.

00:03:07.643 --> 00:03:10.333
But what classical music does

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:15.193
is to distill all of these musics down,

00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:18.879
to condense them to their absolute essence,

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.167
and from that essence create a new language,

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:27.652
a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly

00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:29.752
about who we really are.

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:32.596
It's a language that's still evolving.

00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:36.167
Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of,

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:39.167
like concertos and symphonies,

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.498
but even the most ambitious masterpiece

00:03:42.498 --> 00:03:44.917
can have as its central mission

00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:49.417
to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment --

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:52.625
like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.

00:03:52.625 --> 00:04:15.011
(Music)

00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:20.995
It's so simple, so evocative.

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.855
So many emotions seem to be inside of it.

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:25.583
Yet, of course, like all music,

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:28.042
it's essentially not about anything.

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:31.825
It's just a design of pitches and silence and time.

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:35.917
And the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:38.870
They're locations in the spectrum of sound.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.971
And whether we call them 440 per second, A,

00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:49.689
or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right --

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.785
they're just phenomena.

00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:57.542
But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:01.336
is complex and emotional and not totally understood.

00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:05.167
And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries,

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:07.542
as have our preferences for them.

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:10.833
So for example, in the 11th century,

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:14.673
people liked pieces that ended like this.

00:05:14.673 --> 00:05:26.406
(Music)

00:05:26.406 --> 00:05:31.562
And in the 17th century, it was more like this.

00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:37.000
(Music)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.842
And in the 21st century ...

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:48.250
(Music)

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.569
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord,

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.042
even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you

00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.542
or sent some of you running from the room.

00:05:58.542 --> 00:05:59.958
And the reason you like it

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.446
is because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not,

00:06:02.446 --> 00:06:05.000
centuries-worth of changes

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.500
in musical theory, practice and fashion.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.590
And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.573
because of the music's powerful silent partner,

00:06:17.573 --> 00:06:21.202
the way it's been passed on: notation.

00:06:21.202 --> 00:06:23.167
Now the impulse to notate,

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:25.958
or, more exactly I should say, encode music

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.016
has been with us for a very long time.

00:06:29.016 --> 00:06:32.917
In 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:35.867
wrote this song for his departed wife

00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:37.458
and inscribed it on her gravestone

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:40.083
in the notational system of the Greeks.

00:06:40.083 --> 00:07:07.458
(Music)

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:09.875
And a thousand years later,

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:13.885
this impulse to notate took an entirely different form.

00:07:13.885 --> 00:07:15.250
And you can see how this happened

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:21.833
in these excerpts from the Christmas mass "Puer Natus est nobis,"

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:24.208
"For Us is Born."

00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:28.841
(Music)

00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:31.083
In the 10th century, little squiggles were used

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:34.125
just to indicate the general shape of the tune.

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:41.167
And in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line,

00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:44.745
to better pinpoint the pitch's location.

00:07:44.745 --> 00:07:53.075
And then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.708
locked in the concept of the tune exactly,

00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:59.375
and that led to the kind of notation we have today.

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:03.046
Well notation not only passed the music on,

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:07.727
notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely,

00:08:07.727 --> 00:08:09.683
because it enabled the musicians

00:08:09.683 --> 00:08:13.339
to imagine music on a much vaster scale.

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:16.667
Now inspired moves of improvisation

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:20.667
could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized,

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.208
made into intricate designs.

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:26.448
And from this moment, classical music became

00:08:26.448 --> 00:08:29.042
what it most essentially is,

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:34.083
a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature:

00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:36.458
instinct and intelligence.

00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:39.833
And there began to be a real difference at this point

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:42.750
between the art of improvisation

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.158
and the art of composition.

00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:48.675
Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move,

00:08:48.675 --> 00:08:52.292
but a composer is considering all possible moves,

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:55.611
testing them out, prioritizing them out,

00:08:55.611 --> 00:09:00.083
until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design

00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:04.490
of ultimate and enduring coolness.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.042
Now some of the greatest composers, like Bach,

00:09:06.042 --> 00:09:08.271
were combinations of these two things.

00:09:08.271 --> 00:09:12.556
Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.

00:09:12.556 --> 00:09:14.500
Mozart was the same way.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.746
But every musician strikes a different balance

00:09:17.746 --> 00:09:21.542
between faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:26.450
And every musical era had different priorities of these things,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.417
different things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'.

00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:34.985
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition

00:09:34.985 --> 00:09:37.833
the big 'what' was to praise God.

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:40.458
And by the 1400s, music was being written

00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:44.542
that tried to mirror God's mind

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:48.458
as could be seen in the design of the night sky.

00:09:48.458 --> 00:09:51.750
The 'how' was a style called polyphony,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.500
music of many independently moving voices

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.208
that suggested the way the planets seemed to move

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:00.837
in Ptolemy's geocentric universe.

00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:04.623
This was truly the music of the spheres.

00:10:04.623 --> 00:10:33.917
(Music)

00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:39.167
This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.

00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:42.765
And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity

00:10:42.765 --> 00:10:45.625
meant that something new had to happen --

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:49.750
a radical new move, which in 1600 is what did happen.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:56.583
(Music) Singer: Ah, bitter blow!

00:10:56.583 --> 00:11:01.375
Ah, wicked, cruel fate!

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:08.292
Ah, baleful stars!

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:15.250
Ah, avaricious heaven!

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.958
MTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera,

00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.570
and its development put music on a radical new course.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.910
The what now was not to mirror the mind of God,

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:28.875
but to follow the emotion turbulence of man.

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:32.167
And the how was harmony,

00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:35.458
stacking up the pitches to form chords.

00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:37.208
And the chords, it turned out,

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:41.292
were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.

00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:46.091
And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us,

00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:47.352
the triads,

00:11:47.352 --> 00:11:50.611
either the major one,

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:55.219
which we think is happy,

00:11:55.219 --> 00:11:58.564
or the minor one,

00:11:58.564 --> 00:12:02.500
which we perceive as sad.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.769
But what's the actual difference between these two chords?

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:08.006
It's just these two notes in the middle.

00:12:08.006 --> 00:12:10.971
It's either E natural,

00:12:10.971 --> 00:12:15.671
and 659 vibrations per second,

00:12:15.687 --> 00:12:20.375
or E flat, at 622.

00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:26.000
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.750
37 freakin' vibrations.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.667
So you can see in a system like this

00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:34.696
there was enormous subtle potential

00:12:34.696 --> 00:12:36.571
of representing human emotions.

00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:40.304
And in fact, as man began to understand more

00:12:40.304 --> 00:12:42.467
his complex and ambivalent nature,

00:12:42.467 --> 00:12:45.125
harmony grew more complex to reflect it.

00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:49.184
Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions

00:12:49.184 --> 00:12:50.917
beyond the ability of words.

00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:54.250
Now with all this possibility,

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.333
classical music really took off.

00:12:58.333 --> 00:13:01.729
It's the time in which the big forms began to arise.

00:13:01.729 --> 00:13:06.333
And the effects of technology began to be felt also,

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:10.769
because printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music,

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:12.779
into the hands of performers everywhere.

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:15.000
And new and improved instruments

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.292
made the age of the virtuoso possible.

00:13:18.292 --> 00:13:21.542
This is when those big forms arose --

00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:24.661
the symphonies, the sonatas, the concertos.

00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:28.667
And in these big architectures of time,

00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:34.375
composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:36.835
A piece like Beethoven's Fifth

00:13:36.835 --> 00:13:41.193
basically witnessing how it was possible

00:13:41.193 --> 00:13:46.710
for him to go from sorrow and anger,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.417
over the course of a half an hour,

00:13:50.417 --> 00:13:54.208
step by exacting step of his route,

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:58.548
to the moment when he could make it across to joy.

00:13:58.548 --> 00:14:21.042
(Music)

00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:26.083
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues,

00:14:26.083 --> 00:14:28.710
like gripping ones of culture,

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.458
such as nationalism or quest for freedom

00:14:31.458 --> 00:14:35.329
or the frontiers of sensuality.

00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:39.100
But whatever direction the music took,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.638
one thing until recently was always the same,

00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:44.667
and that was when the musicians stopped playing,

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:47.042
the music stopped.

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:50.405
Now this moment so fascinates me.

00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:52.316
I find it such a profound one.

00:14:52.316 --> 00:14:53.683
What happens when the music stops?

00:14:53.683 --> 00:14:57.125
Where does it go? What's left?

00:14:57.125 --> 00:15:00.413
What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?

00:15:00.413 --> 00:15:02.185
Is it a melody or a rhythm

00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:04.965
or a mood or an attitude?

00:15:04.965 --> 00:15:07.234
And how might that change their lives?

00:15:07.234 --> 00:15:11.167
To me this is the intimate, personal side of music.

00:15:11.167 --> 00:15:15.708
It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.

00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:18.966
And to me that's the most essential of all.

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:22.925
Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing,

00:15:22.925 --> 00:15:25.532
a teacher-student, performer-audience thing,

00:15:25.532 --> 00:15:28.309
and then around 1880 came this new technology

00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:31.000
that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.287
created a new and miraculous way of passing things on,

00:15:35.287 --> 00:15:37.075
albeit an impersonal one.

00:15:37.075 --> 00:15:40.792
People could now hear music all the time,

00:15:40.792 --> 00:15:41.667
even though it wasn't necessary

00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:46.208
for them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.

00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:51.512
And technology democratized music by making everything available.

00:15:51.512 --> 00:15:53.273
It spearheaded a cultural revolution

00:15:53.273 --> 00:15:58.133
in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.

00:15:58.133 --> 00:16:02.054
And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes,

00:16:02.054 --> 00:16:03.754
using computers and synthesizers

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.673
to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity

00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:11.208
beyond the means of performers and audiences.

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.708
At the same time technology,

00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:17.000
by taking over the role that notation had always played,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.542
shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence

00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:24.833
way over to the instinctive side.

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:26.723
The culture in which we live now

00:16:26.723 --> 00:16:29.792
is awash with music of improvisation

00:16:29.792 --> 00:16:31.417
that's been sliced, diced, layered

00:16:31.417 --> 00:16:35.167
and, God knows, distributed and sold.

00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:38.454
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music?

00:16:38.454 --> 00:16:39.461
Nobody knows.

00:16:39.461 --> 00:16:43.183
The question remains: What happens when the music stops?

00:16:43.183 --> 00:16:45.134
What sticks with people?

00:16:45.165 --> 00:16:49.117
Now that we have unlimited access to music, what does stick with us?

00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:51.537
Well let me show you a story of what I mean

00:16:51.537 --> 00:16:53.329
by "really sticking with us."

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:56.417
I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home,

00:16:56.417 --> 00:16:59.752
and I spied a very shaky old man

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:02.029
making his way across the room on a walker.

00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:04.545
He came over to a piano that was there,

00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:08.875
and he balanced himself and began playing something like this.

00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:13.410
(Music)

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:22.273
And he said something like, "Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven."

00:17:22.273 --> 00:17:23.825
And I suddenly got it,

00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:26.745
and I said, "Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?"

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:31.696
(Music)

00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:34.125
And he said, "Yes, yes. I was a little boy.

00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:38.721
The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."

00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:40.404
And I thought, my God,

00:17:40.404 --> 00:17:43.250
how much must this music mean to this man

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.367
that he would get himself out of his bed, across the room

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:50.667
to recover the memory of this music

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:53.575
that, after everything else in his life is sloughing away,

00:17:53.575 --> 00:17:55.833
still means so much to him?

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:59.756
Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously,

00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:01.506
why it matters to me so much.

00:18:01.506 --> 00:18:04.958
I never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it

00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.708
and what will happen to it in their life.

00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:11.795
But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible

00:18:11.795 --> 00:18:13.125
of sharing this music.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.871
That's what drives my interest in projects

00:18:14.871 --> 00:18:18.250
like the TV series "Keeping Score" with the San Francisco Symphony

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.817
that looks at the backstories of music,

00:18:20.817 --> 00:18:23.994
and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony

00:18:23.994 --> 00:18:25.588
on projects that explore the potential

00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:29.094
of the new performing arts centers

00:18:29.094 --> 00:18:31.468
for both entertainment and education.

00:18:31.468 --> 00:18:33.435
And of course, the New World Symphony

00:18:33.435 --> 00:18:37.083
led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet

00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:40.087
that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world.

00:18:40.087 --> 00:18:44.867
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.

00:18:44.867 --> 00:18:47.105
There's just a role here for so many people --

00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:49.917
teachers, parents, performers --

00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:52.777
to be explorers together.

00:18:52.777 --> 00:18:55.562
Sure, the big events attract a lot of attention,

00:18:55.562 --> 00:18:59.042
but what really matters is what goes on every single day.

00:18:59.042 --> 00:19:03.512
We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.

00:19:03.512 --> 00:19:06.602
And it excites me now to meet people

00:19:06.602 --> 00:19:09.700
who are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers,

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.465
people I never would have guessed who loved the music

00:19:12.465 --> 00:19:13.580
and who are passing it on.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.321
You don't need to worry about knowing anything.

00:19:17.321 --> 00:19:21.083
If you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive,

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:24.143
you know all that you need to know.

00:19:24.143 --> 00:19:26.352
You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit.

00:19:26.352 --> 00:19:30.456
Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.

00:19:30.456 --> 00:19:35.075
All that 'what', all that 'how' is out there

00:19:35.075 --> 00:19:37.538
waiting for you to discover its 'why',

00:19:37.569 --> 00:19:40.627
to dive in and pass it on.

00:19:40.627 --> 00:19:43.125
Thank you.

00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:50.237
(Applause)
