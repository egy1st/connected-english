00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.375
I love my food.

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:05.181
And I love information.

00:00:05.181 --> 00:00:08.496
My children usually tell me

00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:11.958
that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other.

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.042
(Laughter)

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:16.292
But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:18.500
is to take you through how those passions developed,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.860
the point in my life when the two passions merged,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.825
the journey of learning that took place from that point.

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:29.621
And one idea I want to leave you with today

00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:32.227
is what would would happen differently in your life

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:36.869
if you saw information the way you saw food?

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.040
I was born in Calcutta --

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.875
a family where my father and his father before him

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.602
were journalists,

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:47.625
and they wrote magazines in the English language.

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.833
That was the family business.

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.583
And as a result of that,

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:54.542
I grew up with books everywhere around the house.

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:57.987
And I mean books everywhere around the house.

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:00.458
And that's actually a shop in Calcutta,

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.960
but it's a place where we like our books.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.262
In fact, I've got 38,000 of them now

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:09.740
and no Kindle in sight.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.155
But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere,

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:17.677
with people to talk to about those books,

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.748
this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing.

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:24.258
By the time I was 18, I had a deep passion for books.

00:01:24.258 --> 00:01:26.779
It wasn't the only passion I had.

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:28.913
I was a South Indian

00:01:28.913 --> 00:01:31.060
brought up in Bengal.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.540
And two of the things about Bengal:

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.052
they like their savory dishes

00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:37.864
and they like their sweets.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.635
So by the time I grew up,

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:43.290
again, I had a well-established passion for food.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.446
Now I was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s,

00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:49.906
and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in,

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:53.223
but these two were the ones that differentiated me.

00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:54.583
(Laughter)

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:57.434
And then life was fine, dandy.

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:59.092
Everything was okay,

00:01:59.092 --> 00:02:02.971
until I got to about the age of 26,

00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:06.583
and I went to a movie called "Short Circuit."

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:08.583
Oh, some of you have seen it.

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:11.958
And apparently it's being remade right now

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.987
and it's going to be coming out next year.

00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:17.406
It's the story of this experimental robot

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:20.363
which got electrocuted and found a life.

00:02:20.363 --> 00:02:24.500
And as it ran, this thing was saying, "Give me input. Give me input."

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.004
And I suddenly realized that for a robot

00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:30.473
both information as well as food

00:02:30.473 --> 00:02:32.667
were the same thing.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:35.292
Energy came to it in some form or shape,

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:37.429
data came to it in some form or shape.

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.875
And I began to think,

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:41.625
I wonder what it would be like

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.069
to start imagining myself

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.450
as if energy and information were the two things I had as input --

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.507
as if food and information were similar in some form or shape.

00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:55.898
I started doing some research then, and this was the 25-year journey,

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:57.327
and started finding out

00:02:57.327 --> 00:03:01.035
that actually human beings as primates

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:03.650
have far smaller stomachs

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.884
than should be the size for our body weight

00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:09.819
and far larger brains.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.113
And as I went to research that even further,

00:03:13.113 --> 00:03:16.708
I got to a point where I discovered something

00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:20.102
called the expensive tissue hypothesis.

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:24.192
That actually for a given body mass of a primate

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:26.755
the metabolic rate was static.

00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:30.513
What changed was the balance of the tissues available.

00:03:30.513 --> 00:03:34.133
And two of the most expensive tissues in our human body

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:37.902
are nervous tissue and digestive tissue.

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:42.079
And what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.584
that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995.

00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:49.542
It's a lady named Leslie Aiello.

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:54.334
And the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:58.042
If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large,

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:01.189
you had to live with a smaller gut.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.023
That then set me off completely

00:04:04.023 --> 00:04:06.743
to say, Okay, these two are connected.

00:04:06.743 --> 00:04:10.929
So I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.750
and said, So we were hunter-gathers of information.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.125
We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:19.875
Does that really explain what we're seeing

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:22.625
with the intellectual property battles nowadays?

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.958
Because those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.625
wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted,

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:32.250
and those that were in the business of farming information

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.625
wanted to build fences around it,

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:38.296
create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement.

00:04:38.296 --> 00:04:41.260
So there was always going to be a tension within that.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.317
And everything I saw in the cultivation

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:45.875
said there were huge fights amongst the foodies

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:48.102
between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers.

00:04:48.102 --> 00:04:50.417
And this is happening here.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:53.298
When I moved to preparation, this same thing was true,

00:04:53.298 --> 00:04:55.625
expect that there were two schools.

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.708
One group of people said you can distill your information,

00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:02.083
you can extract value, separate it and serve it up,

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:03.827
while another group turned around

00:05:03.827 --> 00:05:05.564
and said no, no you can ferment it.

00:05:05.564 --> 00:05:08.229
You bring it all together and mash it up

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.318
and the value emerges that way.

00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:12.979
The same is again true with information.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.698
But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable.

00:05:16.698 --> 00:05:19.055
Because what I began to see then

00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:22.500
was there were so many different ways people would consume this.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.988
They'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients.

00:05:24.988 --> 00:05:27.129
Do you cook it? Do you have it served to you?

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:28.817
Do you go to a restaurant?

00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:32.591
The same is true every time as I started thinking about information.

00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:35.104
The analogies were getting crazy --

00:05:35.104 --> 00:05:37.800
that information had sell-by dates,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.750
that people had misused information that wasn't dated properly

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.083
and could really make an effect on the stock market,

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:46.486
on corporate values, etc.

00:05:46.486 --> 00:05:48.882
And by this time I was hooked.

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:51.877
And this is about 23 years into this process.

00:05:51.877 --> 00:05:54.167
And I began to start thinking of myself

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:57.638
as we start having mash-ups of fact and fiction,

00:05:57.638 --> 00:06:01.125
docu-dramas, mockumentaries, whatever you call it.

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:02.585
Are we going to reach the stage

00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:07.143
where information has a percentage for fact associated with it?

00:06:07.143 --> 00:06:10.580
We start labeling information for the fact percentage?

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.208
Are we going to start looking at what happens

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:16.787
when your information source is turned off, as a famine?

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:19.354
Which brings me to the final element of this.

00:06:19.354 --> 00:06:22.500
Clay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.667
there is only filter failure.

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.292
I put it to you that information,

00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:30.689
if viewed from the point of food,

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.575
is never a production issue; you never speak of food overload.

00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:36.771
Fundamentally it's a consumption issue.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.792
And we have to start thinking

00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:44.173
about how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves,

00:06:44.173 --> 00:06:46.708
to have the faculties to be able to deal with information,

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:50.458
to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly.

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:54.292
In fact, when I saw "Supersize Me," I starting thinking of saying,

00:06:54.292 --> 00:06:56.250
What would happen

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.444
if an individual had 31 days nonstop Fox News?

00:07:00.444 --> 00:07:01.808
(Laughter)

00:07:01.808 --> 00:07:04.710
Would there be time to be able to work with it?

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.673
So you start really understanding

00:07:07.673 --> 00:07:14.027
that you can have diseases, toxins, a need to balance your diet,

00:07:14.027 --> 00:07:16.938
and once you start looking, and from that point on,

00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:20.625
everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information,

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:23.955
the production of information, the preparation of information,

00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:27.488
I've looked at from the viewpoint of food.

00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:29.958
It has probably not helped my waistline any

00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.446
because I like practicing on both sides.

00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:36.167
But I'd like to leave you with just that question:

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:39.150
If you began to think of all the information that you consume

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.733
the way you think of food,

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:42.507
what would you do differently?

00:07:42.507 --> 00:07:44.708
Thank you very much for your time.

00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:46.598
(Applause)
