WEBVTT

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.059
I'm a very lucky person.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.537
I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:10.865
and the people and creatures that live on it.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.485
And my passion was inspired at the age of seven,

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:16.820
when my parents first took me to Morocco,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.946
at the edge of the Sahara Desert.

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:21.321
Now imagine a little Brit

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.442
somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:26.718
What an amazing experience.

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:29.211
And it made me want to explore more.

00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:31.814
So as a filmmaker,

00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:34.625
I've been from one end of the Earth to the other

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:37.333
trying to get the perfect shot

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:41.125
and to capture animal behavior never seen before.

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:43.757
And what's more, I'm really lucky,

00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:46.875
because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:52.125
Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:55.958
and actually being able to get that message out

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.816
gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:01.958
You might think that it's quite hard

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.208
to find new stories and new subjects,

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:08.539
but new technology is changing the way we can film.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.375
It's enabling us to get fresh, new images

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.492
and tell brand new stories.

00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:17.375
In Nature's Great Events,

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:20.917
a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough,

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:23.167
we wanted to do just that.

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.208
Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:29.458
You see them all the time, you think.

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:33.542
But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:35.250
and had never been filmed.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.500
So what we did, we went to Alaska,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.868
which is where the grizzlies rely

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:44.854
on really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.789
for their denning.

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.137
And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.

00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:58.917
(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia,

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:04.129
thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:08.083
There is nothing to eat up here,

00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:11.583
but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:17.014
Lots of snow in which to dig a den.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.440
To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.292
where the snow will already be melting.

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:39.650
But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.

00:03:05.723 --> 00:03:09.458
These mountains are dangerous places,

00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:12.917
but ultimately the fate of these bear families,

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:16.431
and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific,

00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:21.048
depends on the salmon.

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:23.625
KB: I love that shot.

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:25.917
I always get goosebumps every time I see it.

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:27.958
That was filmed from a helicopter

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.750
using a gyro-stabilized camera.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.208
And it's a wonderful bit of gear,

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:37.167
because it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:40.375
But technology alone isn't enough.

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:42.875
To really get the money shots,

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.917
it's down to being in the right place at the right time.

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:48.875
And that sequence was especially difficult.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:52.375
The first year we got nothing.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:55.958
We had to go back the following year,

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958
all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.583
And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.625
And eventually we got lucky.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:08.958
The cloud lifted, the wind was still,

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.708
and even the bear showed up.

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:13.292
And we managed to get that magic moment.

00:04:13.292 --> 00:04:15.167
For a filmmaker,

00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:19.340
new technology is an amazing tool,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.546
but the other thing that really, really excites me

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:25.500
is when new species are discovered.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.787
Now, when I heard about one animal,

00:04:27.787 --> 00:04:30.750
I knew we had to get it for my next series,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.500
Untamed Americas, for National Geographic.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.811
In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered

00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.083
in the cloud forests of Ecuador.

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:44.167
And what was amazing about that discovery

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.583
is that it also solved the mystery

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:49.620
of what pollinated a unique flower.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.583
It depends solely on the bat.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.317
Now, the series hasn't even aired yet,

00:04:54.317 --> 00:04:56.744
so you're the very first to see this.

00:04:56.744 --> 00:04:57.859
See what you think.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.548
(Video) Narrator: The tube-lipped nectar bat.

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:12.877
A pool of delicious nectar

00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:15.042
lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.

00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:19.887
But how to reach it?

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:25.083
Necessity is the mother of evolution.

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:48.489
(Music)

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:51.496
This two-and-a-half-inch bat

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:58.221
has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue,

00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:02.119
the longest relative to body length

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:04.438
of any mammal in the world.

00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:11.577
If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.

00:06:16.122 --> 00:06:18.612
(Applause)

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:20.677
KB: What a tongue.

00:06:20.677 --> 00:06:25.542
We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:30.167
and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:33.250
So imagine how quick that thing is in real life.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.462
Now people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?"

00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:40.995
And the truth is I just don't have one.

00:06:40.995 --> 00:06:43.542
There are so many wonderful places.

00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:47.042
But some locations draw you back time and time again.

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:49.790
And one remote location --

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.810
I first went there as a backpacker;

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.125
I've been back several times for filming,

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:55.875
most recently for Untamed Americas --

00:06:55.875 --> 00:07:00.625
it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America,

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:05.792
and it's the most otherworldly place I know.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.894
But at 15,000 feet, it's tough.

00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:10.417
It's freezing cold,

00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:15.083
and that thin air really gets you.

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:17.394
Sometimes it's hard to breathe,

00:07:17.394 --> 00:07:20.437
especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.

00:07:20.437 --> 00:07:25.042
And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:29.333
But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:33.271
is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens

00:07:33.271 --> 00:07:35.710
with amazing clarity.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.896
Have a look.

00:07:39.896 --> 00:07:43.552
(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics,

00:07:43.552 --> 00:07:45.237
between Chile and Bolivia,

00:07:45.237 --> 00:07:50.413
the Andes completely change.

00:07:50.413 --> 00:07:55.042
It's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" --

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:58.925
a place of extremes

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:02.614
and extreme contrasts.

00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:07.125
Where deserts freeze

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:10.958
and waters boil.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.458
More like Mars than Earth,

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:16.881
it seems just as hostile to life.

00:08:25.196 --> 00:08:28.865
The stars themselves --

00:08:35.065 --> 00:08:38.786
at 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air

00:08:38.786 --> 00:08:46.929
makes for perfect stargazing.

00:08:46.929 --> 00:08:52.813
Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.

00:08:52.813 --> 00:08:56.885
But just looking up with the naked eye,

00:08:56.885 --> 00:09:00.130
you really don't need one.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:47.140
(Music)

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:53.167
(Applause)

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:56.484
KB: Thank you so much

00:09:56.484 --> 00:09:58.958
for letting me share some images

00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.867
of our magnificent, wonderful Earth.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.764
Thank you for letting me share that with you.

00:10:03.764 --> 00:10:07.296
(Applause)
