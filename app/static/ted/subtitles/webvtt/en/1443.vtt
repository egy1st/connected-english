00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:04.047
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.

00:00:06.063 --> 00:00:11.099
Imagine yourself standing
outside the front door of your home.

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.768
I'd like you to notice
the color of the door,

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:16.773
the material that it's made out of.

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:25.036
Now visualize a pack
of overweight nudists on bicycles.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.491
(Laughter)

00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:29.189
They are competing
in a naked bicycle race,

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:32.434
and they are headed straight
for your front door.

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.299
I need you to actually see this.

00:00:34.323 --> 00:00:38.060
They are pedaling
really hard, they're sweaty,

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:40.380
they're bouncing around a lot.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:44.431
And they crash straight
into the front door of your home.

00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:48.747
Bicycles fly everywhere,
wheels roll past you,

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:51.389
spokes end up in awkward places.

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:56.875
Step over the threshold of your door
into your foyer, your hallway,

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.478
whatever's on the other side,

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:01.715
and appreciate the quality of the light.

00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:07.360
The light is shining
down on Cookie Monster.

00:01:08.837 --> 00:01:13.472
Cookie Monster is waving at you
from his perch on top of a tan horse.

00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:15.280
It's a talking horse.

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:20.120
You can practically feel
his blue fur tickling your nose.

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:24.090
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie
that he's about to shovel into his mouth.

00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:25.716
Walk past him.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.651
Walk past him into your living room.

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:31.317
In your living room,
in full imaginative broadband,

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.619
picture Britney Spears.

00:01:34.373 --> 00:01:39.472
She is scantily clad, she's dancing
on your coffee table,

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:41.785
and she's singing
"Hit Me Baby One More Time."

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:44.707
And then, follow me into your kitchen.

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:49.361
In your kitchen, the floor has been
paved over with a yellow brick road,

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:54.768
and out of your oven are coming
towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.713
the Scarecrow and the Lion
from "The Wizard of Oz,"

00:01:57.737 --> 00:01:59.976
hand-in-hand, skipping
straight towards you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.546
Okay. Open your eyes.

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:08.189
I want to tell you
about a very bizarre contest

00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:10.851
that is held every spring
in New York City.

00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:14.498
It's called the United States
Memory Championship.

00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:17.236
And I had gone to cover
this contest a few years back

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.125
as a science journalist,

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:24.597
expecting, I guess, that this was going
to be like the Superbowl of savants.

00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:28.632
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:32.121
widely varying in both age
and hygienic upkeep.

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.126
(Laughter)

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.335
They were memorizing
hundreds of random numbers,

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.747
looking at them just once.

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:45.334
They were memorizing the names of dozens
and dozens and dozens of strangers.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.818
They were memorizing
entire poems in just a few minutes.

00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:51.380
They were competing
to see who could memorize

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.460
the order of a shuffled pack
of playing cards the fastest.

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.849
I was like, this is unbelievable.

00:02:56.873 --> 00:02:59.825
These people must be freaks of nature.

00:03:00.404 --> 00:03:03.294
And I started talking
to a few of the competitors.

00:03:03.318 --> 00:03:06.658
This is a guy called Ed Cook,
who had come over from England,

00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:08.896
where he had one
of the best-trained memories.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.500
And I said to him,
"Ed, when did you realize

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:14.182
that you were a savant?"

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.296
And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.628
In fact, I have just an average memory.

00:03:19.652 --> 00:03:22.661
Everybody who competes
in this contest will tell you

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:24.805
that they have just an average memory.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.698
We've all trained ourselves to perform
these utterly miraculous feats of memory

00:03:31.722 --> 00:03:33.689
using a set of ancient techniques,

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.511
techniques invented
2,500 years ago in Greece,

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:41.503
the same techniques that Cicero
had used to memorize his speeches,

00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:45.300
that medieval scholars had used
to memorize entire books."

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.413
And I said, "Whoa. How come
I never heard of this before?"

00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:52.641
And we were standing
outside the competition hall,

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:59.031
and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant,
but somewhat eccentric English guy,

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:03.522
says to me, "Josh, you're
an American journalist.

00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:05.482
Do you know Britney Spears?"

00:04:06.023 --> 00:04:10.112
I'm like, "What? No. Why?"

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:13.193
"Because I really want
to teach Britney Spears

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:16.097
how to memorize the order
of a shuffled pack of playing cards

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.907
on U.S. national television.

00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:21.010
It will prove to the world
that anybody can do this."

00:04:21.034 --> 00:04:24.410
(Laughter)

00:04:26.263 --> 00:04:29.716
I was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.709
but maybe you could teach me.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.716
I mean, you've got to start
somewhere, right?"

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.351
And that was the beginning
of a very strange journey for me.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.689
I ended up spending
the better part of the next year

00:04:41.713 --> 00:04:43.507
not only training my memory,

00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:45.467
but also investigating it,

00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:47.475
trying to understand how it works,

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.478
why it sometimes doesn't work,

00:04:49.502 --> 00:04:52.152
and what its potential might be.

00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:54.369
And I met a host
of really interesting people.

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.263
This is a guy called E.P.

00:04:56.287 --> 00:04:58.559
He's an amnesic who had, very possibly,

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:01.268
the worst memory in the world.

00:05:01.292 --> 00:05:03.061
His memory was so bad,

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:06.006
that he didn't even remember
he had a memory problem,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.564
which is amazing.

00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:09.542
And he was this incredibly tragic figure,

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:15.078
but he was a window into the extent
to which our memories make us who we are.

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:18.673
At the other end
of the spectrum, I met this guy.

00:05:18.697 --> 00:05:22.324
This is Kim Peek, he was the basis
for Dustin Hoffman's character

00:05:22.348 --> 00:05:23.625
in the movie "Rain Man."

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:28.188
We spent an afternoon together
in the Salt Lake City Public Library

00:05:28.212 --> 00:05:30.343
memorizing phone books,

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:32.946
which was scintillating.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.703
(Laughter)

00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:39.885
And I went back and I read
a whole host of memory treatises,

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.297
treatises written 2,000-plus
years ago in Latin,

00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:46.995
in antiquity, and then later,
in the Middle Ages.

00:05:47.456 --> 00:05:50.170
And I learned a whole bunch
of really interesting stuff.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.216
One of the really interesting
things that I learned

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.490
is that once upon a time,

00:05:55.514 --> 00:06:01.782
this idea of having a trained,
disciplined, cultivated memory

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:06.401
was not nearly so alien
as it would seem to us to be today.

00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:11.047
Once upon a time,
people invested in their memories,

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:15.295
in laboriously furnishing their minds.

00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:18.195
Over the last few millenia,

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:20.941
we've invented a series of technologies --

00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:23.351
from the alphabet, to the scroll,

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.670
to the codex, the printing
press, photography,

00:06:25.694 --> 00:06:27.961
the computer, the smartphone --

00:06:27.985 --> 00:06:30.516
that have made it progressively
easier and easier

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.346
for us to externalize our memories,

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.690
for us to essentially outsource
this fundamental human capacity.

00:06:39.737 --> 00:06:42.992
These technologies have made
our modern world possible,

00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:44.453
but they've also changed us.

00:06:45.047 --> 00:06:46.734
They've changed us culturally,

00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:49.892
and I would argue that they've
changed us cognitively.

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:52.622
Having little need to remember anymore,

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:54.861
it sometimes seems
like we've forgotten how.

00:06:55.734 --> 00:06:58.289
One of the last places on Earth
where you still find

00:06:58.313 --> 00:07:03.706
people passionate about this idea of
a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.353
is at this totally singular
memory contest.

00:07:06.377 --> 00:07:08.021
It's actually not that singular,

00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:10.066
there are contests held
all over the world.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.891
And I was fascinated,
I wanted to know how do these guys do it.

00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:19.035
A few years back a group of researchers
at University College London

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:21.785
brought a bunch of memory
champions into the lab.

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:23.065
They wanted to know:

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:26.024
Do these guys have brains
that are somehow structurally,

00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:28.746
anatomically different
from the rest of ours?

00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:31.166
The answer was no.

00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:34.982
Are they smarter than the rest of us?

00:07:35.307 --> 00:07:39.045
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests,
and the answer was: not really.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:42.291
There was, however, one really
interesting and telling difference

00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:44.399
between the brains of the memory champions

00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:47.185
and the control subjects
that they were comparing them to.

00:07:47.682 --> 00:07:50.675
When they put these guys
in an fMRI machine,

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:54.036
scanned their brains
while they were memorizing numbers

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.693
and people's faces
and pictures of snowflakes,

00:07:56.717 --> 00:08:01.573
they found that the memory champions were
lighting up different parts of the brain

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:02.882
than everyone else.

00:08:03.288 --> 00:08:06.549
Of note, they were using,
or they seemed to be using,

00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:10.673
a part of the brain that's involved
in spatial memory and navigation.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.689
Why?

00:08:12.713 --> 00:08:16.368
And is there something
that the rest of us can learn from this?

00:08:17.847 --> 00:08:24.546
The sport of competitive memorizing
is driven by a kind of arms race where,

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.629
every year, somebody comes up with a new
way to remember more stuff more quickly,

00:08:29.653 --> 00:08:32.105
and then the rest of the field
has to play catch-up.

00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:33.748
This is my friend Ben Pridmore,

00:08:33.772 --> 00:08:35.914
three-time world memory champion.

00:08:35.938 --> 00:08:41.096
On his desk in front of him
are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.184
that he is about to try
to memorize in one hour,

00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:48.263
using a technique that he invented
and he alone has mastered.

00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:51.008
He used a similar technique

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:57.830
to memorize the precise order
of 4,140 random binary digits

00:08:57.854 --> 00:08:59.905
in half an hour.

00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:01.453
(Laughter)

00:09:01.477 --> 00:09:02.692
Yeah.

00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:06.399
And while there are a whole host of ways

00:09:06.423 --> 00:09:10.434
of remembering stuff
in these competitions,

00:09:10.458 --> 00:09:13.116
everything, all of the techniques
that are being used,

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.476
ultimately come down to a concept

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.833
that psychologists refer to
as "elaborative encoding."

00:09:19.317 --> 00:09:21.805
And it's well-illustrated
by a nifty paradox

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:25.413
known as the Baker/baker paradox,
which goes like this:

00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:28.309
If I tell two people
to remember the same word,

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:29.876
if I say to you,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.503
"Remember that
there is a guy named Baker."

00:09:33.527 --> 00:09:35.009
That's his name.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:39.797
And I say to you, "Remember
that there is a guy who is a baker."

00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:40.986
Okay?

00:09:41.454 --> 00:09:44.636
And I come back to you
at some point later on,

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.355
and I say, "Do you remember that word
that I told you a while back?

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.251
Do you remember what it was?"

00:09:50.275 --> 00:09:53.518
The person who was told his name is Baker

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:56.603
is less likely to remember the same word

00:09:56.627 --> 00:09:59.905
than the person was told
his job is a baker.

00:10:00.238 --> 00:10:03.325
Same word, different amount
of remembering; that's weird.

00:10:03.349 --> 00:10:04.992
What's going on here?

00:10:05.016 --> 00:10:10.010
Well, the name Baker
doesn't actually mean anything to you.

00:10:10.034 --> 00:10:14.247
It is entirely untethered
from all of the other memories

00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:15.762
floating around in your skull.

00:10:15.786 --> 00:10:18.940
But the common noun "baker" --
we know bakers.

00:10:19.298 --> 00:10:21.099
Bakers wear funny white hats.

00:10:21.123 --> 00:10:22.726
Bakers have flour on their hands.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.036
Bakers smell good
when they come home from work.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.065
Maybe we even know a baker.

00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:28.818
And when we first hear that word,

00:10:28.842 --> 00:10:31.358
we start putting these
associational hooks into it,

00:10:31.382 --> 00:10:34.897
that make it easier to fish it
back out at some later date.

00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:40.328
The entire art of what is going on
in these memory contests,

00:10:40.352 --> 00:10:44.164
and the entire art of remembering
stuff better in everyday life,

00:10:44.188 --> 00:10:47.949
is figuring out ways
to transform capital B Bakers

00:10:47.973 --> 00:10:49.838
into lower-case B bakers --

00:10:49.862 --> 00:10:53.150
to take information
that is lacking in context,

00:10:53.174 --> 00:10:55.230
in significance, in meaning,

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.780
and transform it in some way,

00:10:56.804 --> 00:11:01.002
so that it becomes meaningful
in the light of all the other things

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:02.985
that you have in your mind.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.863
One of the more elaborate
techniques for doing this

00:11:07.887 --> 00:11:11.088
dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.580
It came to be known as the memory palace.

00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:16.179
The story behind its creation
goes like this:

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:21.834
There was a poet called Simonides,
who was attending a banquet.

00:11:21.858 --> 00:11:23.922
He was actually the hired entertainment,

00:11:23.946 --> 00:11:27.042
because back then, if you wanted
to throw a really slamming party,

00:11:27.066 --> 00:11:29.674
you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.

00:11:30.237 --> 00:11:35.672
And he stands up, delivers his poem
from memory, walks out the door,

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.800
and at the moment he does,

00:11:37.824 --> 00:11:39.497
the banquet hall collapses.

00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:42.809
Kills everybody inside.

00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:45.675
It doesn't just kill everybody,

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:48.681
it mangles the bodies
beyond all recognition.

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.142
Nobody can say who was inside,

00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:54.730
nobody can say where they were sitting.

00:11:54.754 --> 00:11:56.969
The bodies can't be properly buried.

00:11:56.993 --> 00:12:00.256
It's one tragedy compounding another.

00:12:01.613 --> 00:12:03.516
Simonides, standing outside,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.647
the sole survivor amid the wreckage,

00:12:05.671 --> 00:12:10.064
closes his eyes and has this realization,

00:12:10.088 --> 00:12:12.029
which is that in his mind's eye,

00:12:12.053 --> 00:12:16.744
he can see where each of the guests
at the banquet had been sitting.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.562
And he takes the relatives by the hand,

00:12:19.586 --> 00:12:22.374
and guides them each
to their loved ones amid the wreckage.

00:12:23.998 --> 00:12:26.996
What Simonides figured out at that moment,

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.219
is something that I think
we all kind of intuitively know,

00:12:30.243 --> 00:12:35.370
which is that, as bad as we are
at remembering names and phone numbers,

00:12:35.394 --> 00:12:38.393
and word-for-word instructions
from our colleagues,

00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:42.780
we have really exceptional
visual and spatial memories.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.583
If I asked you to recount
the first 10 words of the story

00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:50.209
that I just told you about Simonides,

00:12:50.233 --> 00:12:52.803
chances are you would have
a tough time with it.

00:12:52.827 --> 00:12:57.246
But, I would wager
that if I asked you to recall

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.967
who is sitting on top
of a talking tan horse

00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:04.007
in your foyer right now,

00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:05.546
you would be able to see that.

00:13:06.498 --> 00:13:08.674
The idea behind the memory palace

00:13:08.698 --> 00:13:13.261
is to create this imagined edifice
in your mind's eye,

00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:17.348
and populate it with images
of the things that you want to remember --

00:13:17.372 --> 00:13:20.617
the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,

00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:24.488
funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.155
the more unforgettable it's likely to be.

00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:29.925
This is advice that goes
back 2,000-plus years

00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:32.124
to the earliest Latin memory treatises.

00:13:32.506 --> 00:13:33.727
So how does this work?

00:13:34.473 --> 00:13:41.256
Let's say that you've been invited
to TED center stage to give a speech,

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.918
and you want to do it from memory,

00:13:43.942 --> 00:13:48.526
and you want to do it the way
that Cicero would have done it,

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.065
if he had been invited
to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.

00:13:52.462 --> 00:13:53.660
(Laughter)

00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:55.455
What you might do

00:13:55.479 --> 00:14:00.009
is picture yourself
at the front door of your house.

00:14:01.084 --> 00:14:06.309
And you'd come up with some sort
of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,

00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:09.101
to remind you that the first thing
you want to talk about

00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:11.383
is this totally bizarre contest.

00:14:11.407 --> 00:14:12.541
(Laughter)

00:14:12.565 --> 00:14:14.530
And then you'd go inside your house,

00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:19.269
and you would see an image
of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:20.538
And that would remind you

00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:23.439
that you would want to then
introduce your friend Ed Cook.

00:14:23.933 --> 00:14:26.376
And then you'd see
an image of Britney Spears

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.188
to remind you of this funny
anecdote you want to tell.

00:14:29.212 --> 00:14:30.717
And you'd go into your kitchen,

00:14:30.741 --> 00:14:33.073
and the fourth topic
you were going to talk about

00:14:33.097 --> 00:14:35.643
was this strange journey
that you went on for a year,

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.976
and you'd have some friends
to help you remember that.

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:44.826
This is how Roman orators
memorized their speeches --

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.147
not word-for-word, which is just
going to screw you up,

00:14:48.171 --> 00:14:50.234
but topic-for-topic.

00:14:50.877 --> 00:14:53.162
In fact, the phrase "topic sentence" --

00:14:54.733 --> 00:14:57.178
that comes from the Greek word "topos,"

00:14:57.202 --> 00:14:58.559
which means "place."

00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:02.770
That's a vestige of when people used
to think about oratory and rhetoric

00:15:02.794 --> 00:15:04.684
in these sorts of spatial terms.

00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:07.014
The phrase "in the first place,"

00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:09.739
that's like "in the first place
of your memory palace."

00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:12.333
I thought this was just fascinating,

00:15:12.357 --> 00:15:13.890
and I got really into it.

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:16.672
And I went to a few more
of these memory contests,

00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:19.411
and I had this notion
that I might write something longer

00:15:19.435 --> 00:15:22.292
about this subculture
of competitive memorizers.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.030
But there was a problem.

00:15:24.577 --> 00:15:27.625
The problem was that a memory contest

00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:30.881
is a pathologically boring event.

00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:34.064
(Laughter)

00:15:34.088 --> 00:15:38.057
Truly, it is like a bunch of people
sitting around taking the SATs --

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:40.340
I mean, the most dramatic it gets

00:15:40.364 --> 00:15:42.673
is when somebody
starts massaging their temples.

00:15:42.697 --> 00:15:45.244
And I'm a journalist,
I need something to write about.

00:15:45.268 --> 00:15:48.696
I know that there's incredible stuff
happening in these people's minds,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.465
but I don't have access to it.

00:15:50.489 --> 00:15:53.640
And I realized, if I was going
to tell this story,

00:15:53.664 --> 00:15:55.822
I needed to walk
in their shoes a little bit.

00:15:56.482 --> 00:15:59.573
And so I started trying
to spend 15 or 20 minutes

00:15:59.597 --> 00:16:02.335
every morning, before I sat
down with my New York Times,

00:16:02.359 --> 00:16:04.509
just trying to remember something.

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:06.530
Maybe it was a poem,

00:16:06.554 --> 00:16:10.262
maybe it was names from an old yearbook
that I bought at a flea market.

00:16:11.244 --> 00:16:16.041
And I found that this was shockingly fun.

00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:18.319
I never would have expected that.

00:16:18.652 --> 00:16:21.875
It was fun because this is actually
not about training your memory.

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:24.895
What you're doing, is you're trying
to get better and better

00:16:24.919 --> 00:16:26.951
at creating, at dreaming up,

00:16:26.975 --> 00:16:30.361
these utterly ludicrous,
raunchy, hilarious,

00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:33.462
and hopefully unforgettable
images in your mind's eye.

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:35.553
And I got pretty into it.

00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:41.514
This is me wearing my standard
competitive memorizer's training kit.

00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:42.751
(Laughter)

00:16:42.775 --> 00:16:44.176
It's a pair of earmuffs

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.152
and a set of safety goggles
that have been masked over

00:16:48.176 --> 00:16:50.258
except for two small pinholes,

00:16:50.282 --> 00:16:55.470
because distraction is the competitive
memorizer's greatest enemy.

00:16:56.684 --> 00:16:59.649
I ended up coming back
to that same contest

00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:01.514
that I had covered a year earlier,

00:17:01.538 --> 00:17:03.664
and I had this notion
that I might enter it,

00:17:03.688 --> 00:17:06.989
sort of as an experiment
in participatory journalism.

00:17:07.537 --> 00:17:10.655
It'd make, I thought, maybe
a nice epilogue to all my research.

00:17:11.105 --> 00:17:14.494
Problem was, the experiment went haywire.

00:17:15.248 --> 00:17:16.423
I won the contest --

00:17:16.447 --> 00:17:17.551
(Laughter)

00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:20.447
which really wasn't supposed to happen.

00:17:20.471 --> 00:17:26.707
(Applause)

00:17:26.731 --> 00:17:31.239
Now, it is nice to be able
to memorize speeches

00:17:31.263 --> 00:17:35.362
and phone numbers and shopping lists,

00:17:35.386 --> 00:17:37.465
but it's actually kind
of beside the point.

00:17:37.902 --> 00:17:39.073
These are just tricks.

00:17:39.746 --> 00:17:44.492
They work because they're based
on some pretty basic principles

00:17:44.516 --> 00:17:46.268
about how our brains work.

00:17:46.803 --> 00:17:50.220
And you don't have to be
building memory palaces

00:17:50.244 --> 00:17:52.482
or memorizing packs of playing cards

00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:56.883
to benefit from a little bit of insight
about how your mind works.

00:17:56.907 --> 00:17:59.098
We often talk about people
with great memories

00:17:59.122 --> 00:18:01.271
as though it were some sort
of an innate gift,

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:02.574
but that is not the case.

00:18:03.605 --> 00:18:05.581
Great memories are learned.

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:10.103
At the most basic level,
we remember when we pay attention.

00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:13.435
We remember when we are deeply engaged.

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:17.601
We remember when we are able to take
a piece of information and experience,

00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:19.707
and figure out why it is meaningful to us,

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:22.145
why it is significant, why it's colorful,

00:18:22.169 --> 00:18:26.133
when we're able to transform it
in some way that makes sense

00:18:26.157 --> 00:18:29.497
in the light of all of the other
things floating around in our minds,

00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:33.298
when we're able to transform
Bakers into bakers.

00:18:35.116 --> 00:18:37.259
The memory palace,
these memory techniques --

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.695
they're just shortcuts.

00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:41.279
In fact, they're not
even really shortcuts.

00:18:41.684 --> 00:18:44.199
They work because they make you work.

00:18:45.017 --> 00:18:48.259
They force a kind of depth of processing,

00:18:48.283 --> 00:18:49.780
a kind of mindfulness,

00:18:49.804 --> 00:18:53.684
that most of us don't normally
walk around exercising.

00:18:54.494 --> 00:18:56.295
But there actually are no shortcuts.

00:18:57.248 --> 00:18:59.280
This is how stuff is made memorable.

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:03.731
And I think if there's one thing
that I want to leave you with,

00:19:03.755 --> 00:19:10.283
it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't
even remember he had a memory problem,

00:19:10.307 --> 00:19:11.504
left me with,

00:19:11.528 --> 00:19:18.044
which is the notion that our lives
are the sum of our memories.

00:19:18.863 --> 00:19:24.829
How much are we willing to lose

00:19:24.853 --> 00:19:28.502
from our already short lives,

00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:34.098
by losing ourselves
in our Blackberries, our iPhones,

00:19:34.122 --> 00:19:38.984
by not paying attention
to the human being across from us

00:19:39.008 --> 00:19:40.559
who is talking with us,

00:19:40.583 --> 00:19:45.265
by being so lazy that we're not
willing to process deeply?

00:19:47.463 --> 00:19:49.183
I learned firsthand

00:19:49.207 --> 00:19:52.676
that there are incredible
memory capacities

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.716
latent in all of us.

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:58.182
But if you want to live a memorable life,

00:19:58.206 --> 00:20:00.515
you have to be the kind of person

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:02.912
who remembers to remember.

00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:04.088
Thank you.

00:20:04.112 --> 00:20:07.796
(Applause)
