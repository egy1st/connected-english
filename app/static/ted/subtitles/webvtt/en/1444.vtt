WEBVTT

00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:03.684
So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story

00:00:03.684 --> 00:00:07.394
about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.113
But to start it probably helps to have an understanding

00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:13.625
of what a 404 page actually is.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:16.731
The 404 page is that.

00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:19.071
It's that broken experience on the Web.

00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:21.382
It's effectively the default page

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:24.958
when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.258
And it serves you the 404 page.

00:00:27.258 --> 00:00:32.083
It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.

00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:34.708
And I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself,

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:37.750
it's annoying when you hit this thing.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.008
Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship.

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:42.750
And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.625
where does 404 come from?

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.669
It's from a family of errors actually --

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:48.779
a whole set of relationship errors,

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:51.083
which, when I started digging into them,

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:55.917
it looks almost like a checklist
for a sex therapist or a couples counselor.

00:00:55.917 --> 00:00:59.042
You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey.

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.931
(Laughter)

00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:03.958
Yes.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.202
But these things are everywhere.

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.898
They're on sites big, they're on sites small.

00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:11.583
This is a global experience.

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:14.460
What a 404 page tells you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.617
is that you fell through the cracks.

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:20.375
And that's not a good experience

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.819
when you're used to experiences like this.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.092
You can get on your Kinect

00:01:24.092 --> 00:01:26.250
and you can have unicorns dancing

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.887
and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.

00:01:28.887 --> 00:01:30.977
A 404 page is not what you're looking for.

00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:34.429
You get that, and it's like a slap in the face.

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.662
Trying to think about how a 404 felt,

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.542
and it would be like if you went to Starbucks

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:40.292
and there's the guy behind the counter

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:42.104
and you're over there and there's no skim milk.

00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:44.083
And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:46.248
And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:49.190
And you're like, "Oh, I didn't want to see that."

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.279
That's the 404 feeling.

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:52.952
(Laughter)

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:55.208
I mean, I've heard about that.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:59.346
So where this comes into play and why this is important

00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:00.677
is I head up a technology incubator,

00:02:00.677 --> 00:02:02.677
and we had eight startups sitting around there.

00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:05.713
And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not,

00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:07.509
until one day Athletepath,

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.187
which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes,

00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:12.625
found this video.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:16.190
(Video) Guy: Joey!

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.994
Crowd: Whoa!

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:24.375
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:28.418
They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page

00:02:28.418 --> 00:02:31.250
and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.958
Because finally there was a page

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.159
that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.685
(Laughter)

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:40.466
(Applause)

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.833
So this turned into a contest.

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:45.083
Dailypath that offers inspiration

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.579
put inspiration on their 404 page.

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.495
Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network,

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:53.315
commiserated with your pet.

00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:54.708
Each one of them found this.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:55.958
It turned into a 24-hour contest.

00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.083
At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:00.500
And what they learned

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.884
was that those little things, done right, actually matter,

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.530
and that well-designed moments can build brands.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.458
So you take a look out in the real world,

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.900
and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.831
You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop.

00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:14.829
This is one that commiserates with you.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.579
This is one that blames you.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.417
This is one that I loved.

00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:20.750
This is an error page,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.796
but what if this error page was also an opportunity?

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.962
So it was a moment in time

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:29.233
where all of these startups had to sit and think

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.555
and got really excited about what they could be.

00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:34.152
Because back to the whole relationship issue,

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:36.409
what they figured out through this exercise

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.246
was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not,

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:42.565
or it can remind me of why I should love you.

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.323
Thank you.

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:46.913
(Applause)
