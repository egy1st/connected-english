00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.666
(Mosquito buzzing)

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.240
(Swat)

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.630
Gotcha.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.160
Mosquitoes.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.080
I hate them.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.320
Don't you?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.576
That awful buzzing sound at night
around your ears

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200
that drives you absolutely crazy?

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.776
Knowing that she wants
to stick a needle in your skin

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.000
and suck out your blood?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.720
That's awful, right?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.840
In fact, there's only one good thing
I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.920
When they fly into our bedroom at night,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.134
they prefer to bite my wife.

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:44.816
(Laughter)

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.296
But that's fascinating, right?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.760
Why does she receive more bites than I do?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.016
And the answer is smell,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.240
the smell of her body.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.976
And since we all smell different
and produce chemicals on our skin

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.936
that either attract or repel mosquitoes,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.640
some of us are just
more attractive than others.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.600
So my wife smells nicer than I do,
or I just stink more than she does.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.776
Either way, mosquitoes find us in the dark
by sniffing us out. They smell us.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.096
And during my PhD,
I wanted to know exactly

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.200
what chemicals from our skin
African malaria mosquitoes use

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:26.464
to track us down at night.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.320
And there's a whole range
of compounds that they do use.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.800
And this was not going to be an easy task.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.640
And therefore we set up
various experiments.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.816
Why did we set up these experiments?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.136
Because half the world's population

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.456
runs the risk of contracting
a killer disease like malaria

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.040
through a simple mosquito bite.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.256
Every 30 seconds,
somewhere on this planet,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.736
a child dies of malaria,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.656
and Paul Levy this morning,
he was talking about the metaphor

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.176
of the 727 crashing
into the United States.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.856
Well, in Africa, we have
the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.160
crashing every day.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.615
But perhaps if we can attract
these mosquitoes to traps,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.216
bait it with our smell,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.160
we may be able
to stop transmission of disease.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.576
Now, solving this puzzle
was not an easy thing,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.576
because we produce hundreds
of different chemicals on the skin,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.256
but we undertook
some remarkable experiments

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.576
that managed us to resolve
this puzzle very quickly indeed.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.936
First, we observed
that not all mosquito species

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.880
bite on the same part of the body.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.816
Strange.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.416
So we set up an experiment

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.797
where we put a naked volunteer
in a large cage,

00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:40.836
(Laughter)

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.296
and in that cage, we released mosquitoes

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.000
to see where they were biting
on the body of that person.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.560
And we found some remarkable differences.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.016
On the left here you see the bites

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.296
by the Dutch malaria mosquito
on this person.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.000
They had a very strong preference
for biting on the face.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.336
In contrast, the African malaria mosquito

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.536
had a very strong preference for biting
the ankles and feet of this person.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.016
And that, of course,
we should have known all along,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.176
because they're called
mosqui-toes, you see?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.536
(Laughter)

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.776
That's right.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.056
(Applause)

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.440
And so we started
focusing on the smell of feet ...

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.056
on the smell of human feet,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.816
until we came across
a remarkable statement in the literature

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.616
that said that cheese smells after feet

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.240
rather than the reverse.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.296
Think of it.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.749
And this triggered us
to do a remarkable experiment.

00:03:36.773 --> 00:03:41.816
We tried, with a tiny little piece
of Limburger cheese,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.600
which smells badly after feet,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.376
to attract African malaria mosquitoes.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.280
And you know what? It worked.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.416
In fact, it worked so well

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.976
that now we have a synthetic mixture
of the aroma of Limburger cheese

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.776
that we're using in Tanzania

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.016
and has been shown there

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.000
to be two to three times
more attractive to mosquitoes than humans.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.256
Limburg, be proud of your cheese,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.416
as it is now used
in the fight against malaria.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.698
(Applause)

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.399
That's the cheese, just to show you.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.880
My second story is remarkable as well.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.080
It's about man's best friend.
It's about dogs.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.320
And I will show you how we can use dogs
in the fight against malaria.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.736
One of the best ways of killing mosquitoes

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.056
is not to wait until
they fly around like adults

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.960
and bite people and transmit disease.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.200
It's to kill them when they're still
in the water as larvae.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.136
Why?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.520
Because they are just like the CIA.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.456
In that pool of water,
these larvae are concentrated.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.136
They're all together there.
They are immobile.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.816
They can't escape from that water.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.416
They can't fly.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.136
And they're accessible.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.200
You can actually walk up to that pool
and you can kill them there, right?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.736
So the problem that we face with this

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.656
is that, throughout the landscape,
all these pools of water with the larvae,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.656
they are scattered all over the place,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.896
which makes it very hard
for an inspector like this

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.480
to actually find all these breeding sites
and treat them with insecticides.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.240
And last year we thought very, very hard,
how can we resolve this problem?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.416
Until we realized that just like us --
we have a unique smell --

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.720
mosquito larvae
also have a very unique smell.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.656
And so we set up another crazy experiment,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.016
because we collected
the smell of these larvae,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.320
put it on pieces of cloth,
and then did something very remarkable.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.376
Here we have a bar with four holes

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.176
and we put the smell
of these larvae in the left hole.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.416
Oh, that was very quick.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.576
And then you see the dog.
It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.216
He's examining these holes
and now he's got it already.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.576
He's going back to check
the control holes again,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.456
but he's coming back to the first one,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.296
and now he's locking into that smell,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.936
which means that now,
we can use dogs with these inspectors

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.176
to much better find the breeding sites
of mosquitoes in the field,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.600
and therefore have
a much bigger impact on malaria.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.936
This lady is Ellen van der Zweep.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.199
She's one of the best
dog trainers in the world,

00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:21.263
and she believes
that we can do a lot more.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.616
Since we also know that people
that carry malaria parasites

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.496
smell different compared to people
that are uninfected,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.920
she's convinced that we can train dogs
to find people that carry the parasite.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.216
That means that in a population
where malaria has gone down all the way

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.656
and there's few people
remaining with parasites,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.416
that the dogs can find these people,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.336
we can treat them with antimalarial drugs
and give the final blow to malaria.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.640
Man's best friend
in the fight against malaria.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.446
My third story is perhaps
even more remarkable ...

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.756
and, I should say, has never been shown
to the public until today.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.781
(Audience cheers)

00:06:57.805 --> 00:06:59.005
Yeah.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.736
It's a crazy story, but I believe
it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.960
against mosquitoes ever.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.936
In fact, people have told me

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.440
that now they will enjoy
being bitten by mosquitoes.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.056
And the question of course is,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.240
what would make someone
enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.120
And the answer I have right here ...

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.522
in my pocket --

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:23.547
(Laughter)

00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:24.771
if I get it.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.160
It's a tablet.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.216
A simple tablet,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.600
and when I take it with water ...

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.080
it does miracles.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.240
Thank you.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.280
Now, let me show you how this works.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.680
Here in this box, I have a cage

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:58.992
with several hundred
hungry female mosquitoes ...

00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.296
(Laughter)

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.776
that I'm just about to release.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.576
(Laughter)

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.941
Just kidding, just kidding.

00:08:05.965 --> 00:08:07.336
(Laughter)

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.416
What I'm going to show you
is, I'm gonna stick my arm into it

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.720
and I will show you
how quickly they will bite.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.680
There we go.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.671
Don't worry, I do this
all the time in the lab.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.520
There we go.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.760
OK.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.240
Now, on the video --

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.136
on the video here,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.296
I'm going to show you
exactly the same thing,

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.456
except that what
I'm showing you on the video

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.280
happened one hour after I took the tablet.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.000
Have a look.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.936
That doesn't work.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.159
OK. Sorry about that.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.576
I'm sticking in my arm,
I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.096
I'm shaking them off,
and we follow them through time

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.616
to see these mosquitoes
get very, very sick indeed,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.160
here shown in fast motion.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.856
And three hours later,
what we see at the bottom of the cage

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.080
is dead mosquitoes ...

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.960
very dead mosquitoes.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.816
And I'm going to say,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.840
we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes.

00:09:02.864 --> 00:09:06.416
They don't kill us. We kill them.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:13.440
(Applause)

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.840
Now --

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.136
(Laughter)

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.680
Maastricht, be prepared.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.296
Now, think of what we can do with this.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.456
We can actually use this
to contain outbreaks

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.560
of mosquito-born diseases,
of epidemics, right?

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.176
And better still,
imagine what would happen

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.400
if, in a very large area, everyone would
take these drugs, for just three weeks.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.536
That would give us an opportunity

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.680
to actually eliminate
malaria as a disease.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.296
So cheese, dogs and a pill
to kill mosquitoes.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.280
That's the kind of out-of-the-box
science that I love doing ...

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.136
for the betterment of mankind,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.776
but especially for her,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.696
so that she can grow up
in a world without malaria.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.936
Thank you.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.341
(Applause)
