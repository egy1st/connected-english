00:00:01.598 --> 00:00:05.050
This was the first title
I thought of for this talk,

00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:06.538
"Beethoven as Bill Gates."

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:07.712
Does that make sense?

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:11.104
Maybe not. OK, so think about that.

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:14.975
Being an educator,
I am going to tell you the story,

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.281
and then you'll figure it out
for yourselves.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:22.770
So the second thought I had
was that I would tell the story

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:26.920
of the history of music delivery,
literally from the beginning,

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:29.098
from pounding rocks to pounding rock.

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:34.504
The good news about this is
the first 10,000 years just sailed by.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:39.256
So for 10,000 years,
if you want to make music,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.905
you literally pick up rocks, later
instruments, those sorts of things.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.167
And this goes on for a very long time.

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.865
Gradually in the West, mostly
we start to get a performing class,

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:53.109
people who were experts,
who were really good at pounding rocks.

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:56.947
So, by the 18th century,
we're still basically doing this.

00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:59.778
We have a class of experts, professionals,

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:02.481
who play very expensive instruments,
for the most part,

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.739
things like the organ,
complicated instruments,

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.487
and if you wanted to hear music
in the 18th century,

00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:08.686
it was live.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.706
You had to go to a concert.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.397
You had to go to church,
you had to go to a civic event,

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.041
you had to go hear somebody
making music live.

00:01:16.065 --> 00:01:18.417
So, music always involved
social interaction.

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:20.465
There were no headphones you could put on,

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:22.799
there was no iPhone,
there was no record player.

00:01:22.823 --> 00:01:26.106
If you wanted to hear music,
you had to get out of the house.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.225
There's really, basically,
no music in your house.

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.487
This goes on through the 18th century
from the beginning,

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:33.673
and then we have ...

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.731
our first disruption.

00:01:36.488 --> 00:01:39.821
These two things actually happened
together, these two disruptions.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.684
We get the piano, right?

00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:44.909
The piano was a new technology

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:48.040
that really starts to happen
in the 18th century,

00:01:48.064 --> 00:01:51.490
and then it becomes something
that you could mass-produce cheaply.

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:54.759
So you can now have an instrument
that's not too expensive,

00:01:54.783 --> 00:01:56.158
that everyone can have one,

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.722
that you can have at home.

00:01:57.746 --> 00:02:00.037
So this allows for a kind of disruption,

00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.435
but it wouldn't have happened
if the second disruption hadn't happened

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.610
at the same time,

00:02:04.634 --> 00:02:07.855
which is that somebody figured out
how to do cheap music printing.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.418
Remember Gutenberg
and the other kind of printing?

00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:12.155
Music is a little more complicated.

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.037
It took a little longer to figure out:

00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:16.638
How do I create a cheap way
to distribute sheet music?

00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:19.569
In London, at the time
of the American Revolution,

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:20.912
there are 12 music shops.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:24.525
By 1800, there are 30.

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:27.346
By 1820, there are 150.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.725
So the internet wasn't
the first time this happened,

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.578
because think about what happens
when, all of a sudden,

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:37.990
you go from "If I want to hear music,

00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:40.664
I've got to go hear Bach,
I've got to go hear Mozart."

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:43.492
That meant you had
to actually go hear Mozart.

00:02:44.182 --> 00:02:47.913
You didn't buy a CD of Mozart,
you didn't download Mozart.

00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:51.430
You couldn't even buy Mozart sheet music,
at least not easily or cheaply.

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:53.515
But if you wanted to hear Mozart or Bach,

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.725
you had to go to Germany and go hear them.

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.359
But that's not true for Beethoven.

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:02.049
And Beethoven figures out that,
in fact, there's a new market.

00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:04.134
Beethoven is an entrepreneur,

00:03:04.158 --> 00:03:06.093
not unlike our other friend, Bill Gates.

00:03:06.117 --> 00:03:08.028
He's an entrepreneur that figures out,

00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:10.843
"Hey, I don't have
to actually go to London.

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:13.184
I can actually just sell sheet music.

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:15.529
And it can be printed
and mass-distributed,

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:18.977
and I will be famous everywhere,
and everybody else will play my music."

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.821
So that changes the experience
of music for everybody.

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:24.470
It changes the variety, it
changes the global pyramid,

00:03:24.494 --> 00:03:25.999
it changes all sorts of things.

00:03:26.478 --> 00:03:30.459
It creates a new class of musicians,
of composers and performers --

00:03:30.483 --> 00:03:31.867
there's a division of labor.

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.578
If you hire Bach to play for your wedding,

00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:35.893
guess who shows up?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.913
Bach!

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:38.961
(Laughter)

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.929
That's what he does for a living, right?

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.575
He has no way to expand his business.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.426
But Beethoven does.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.914
Then this happens again.

00:03:46.938 --> 00:03:49.867
It happens 100 years later, so
you're starting to see a theme.

00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.197
By the turn of the century,

00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.281
it's an interesting time
for music delivery;

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:56.934
100 years later, we get the record
player, the gramophone, the player piano.

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.207
Now you could buy
Rachmaninoff sheet music,

00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.188
but if you wanted to hear Rachmaninoff,

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:03.712
you had to actually go
to the concert hall.

00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:04.926
Not anymore.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.931
Now you can buy a record of Rachmaninoff,

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.392
or you can buy a player piano

00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:11.268
and a roll that fits into another kind
of recording device.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.629
And later, the radio.

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:13.908
So think about this:

00:04:13.932 --> 00:04:18.199
you're a band in Texas;
you're Doc Ross in Texas,

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:21.824
and you've got the Texas big band
market, you've got it nailed.

00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:24.831
And all of a sudden,
there's this new thing called "radio."

00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:28.778
And now everybody can hear Count Basie
and Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman.

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.216
Man, the competition just sucks now.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.391
All of a sudden, the competition
has gone global,

00:04:34.415 --> 00:04:36.715
just like it does a hundred years later,

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:40.586
with the iPod, the internet
and digital files and Garage Band,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.625
that do all of these things
all over again.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:47.231
So now, maybe we can talk
about these two guys.

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.727
First of all, both of these guys
are entrepreneurs.

00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:55.591
But second of all, both of these guys
are software designers.

00:04:56.154 --> 00:04:58.115
That's what Beethoven does.

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.794
He writes software that runs
on that piece of hardware over there.

00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:02.851
(Laughter)

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.173
That's a piece of hardware.

00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:07.199
That's a device that you can use
if you have my piece of paper.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.293
If you have sheet music,
does it sound good?

00:05:09.317 --> 00:05:10.561
No, it's a piece of paper.

00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:14.665
It's like those floppy disks;
they weren't very useful.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.726
You can use them as coasters, I guess.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.723
But they're not very useful on their own.

00:05:18.747 --> 00:05:21.952
So both Beethoven and Bill Gates
are software designers.

00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:24.980
What's interesting is that
they also both live at a time

00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:27.897
where the hardware
is changing very quickly.

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:30.655
Those of you who are
old enough to remember,

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:34.366
go back to the '90s, go
back to Windows whatever,

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.375
and remember your joy
and your love of Bill Gates,

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:41.667
as every time a new
software package came out,

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:43.124
you had to get a new computer.

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:45.652
So, guess what?

00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:49.087
When Beethoven started writing music,
he had this instrument up on top,

00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:50.796
with five octaves.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.357
This one's bigger, it's got more pedals,

00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:55.046
it's louder, it can do more stuff.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.960
When Beethoven starts off,
he doesn't have a piano that can do this.

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.538
He actually just cannot do this.

00:06:00.562 --> 00:06:02.916
He can't go -- (Musical chords)

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.598
Can't do that.

00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:08.038
So in 1803, a French piano maker --

00:06:08.062 --> 00:06:10.391
alright, think about how smart this is:

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:12.729
If you're a piano maker,

00:06:12.753 --> 00:06:16.474
into whose hands
do you want to get that piano?

00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:18.581
Composers.

00:06:18.605 --> 00:06:20.304
Artists who will use the technology

00:06:20.328 --> 00:06:22.956
and make everybody else
have to adopt your technology.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.597
It's like sending Bill Gates
your fastest, latest computer,

00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:28.766
because you know he'll use up
all the memory.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.828
(Laughter)

00:06:29.852 --> 00:06:33.926
So in 1803, Érard sends
Beethoven a new piano.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.136
And it has more notes.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.997
And it can do that.

00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:41.588
So the first thing Beethoven does is,
he writes a piece that can do that.

00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:44.440
If you've got a German or a Viennese piano

00:06:44.464 --> 00:06:45.827
or a British piano,

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.671
it can't do that.

00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:50.379
So what do you do?

00:06:50.403 --> 00:06:53.397
You've gone to the music store.

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.798
And you've bought the latest
Beethoven piano sonata,

00:06:56.822 --> 00:06:59.490
and you take it home,
and you've got a five-octave piano

00:06:59.514 --> 00:07:02.435
that was the brand-spanking-new,
latest technology last year.

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:05.942
You start playing that new Beethoven
piano sonata, and what happens?

00:07:05.966 --> 00:07:07.635
Not enough notes!

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:09.208
You run out of room.

00:07:10.183 --> 00:07:14.198
So, in fact, Beethoven has
the same relationship with his audience

00:07:14.222 --> 00:07:15.373
that Bill Gates does.

00:07:15.397 --> 00:07:17.349
He's a software producer,

00:07:17.373 --> 00:07:19.757
and he has to deal with the hardware.

00:07:20.255 --> 00:07:22.419
And what's interesting about this

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:25.281
is that Beethoven was actually
smarter than Bill Gates.

00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:28.202
So when Beethoven gets
his new Érard piano,

00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:30.370
he's writing his third piano concerto,

00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:33.881
he goes and he gives a concert,
and he and uses all those extra notes.

00:07:34.452 --> 00:07:37.048
But what does he do when he goes
and gives the concert?

00:07:37.072 --> 00:07:38.719
He has to take the piano with him,

00:07:38.743 --> 00:07:40.839
because it's the only piano
he has in Vienna

00:07:40.863 --> 00:07:42.178
that has those extra notes.

00:07:42.202 --> 00:07:44.563
So he plays the concerto
on the piano. It's great.

00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:48.162
But he realizes, "Oh, wait. Not everybody
has one of these latest things.

00:07:48.186 --> 00:07:50.405
So he publishes piano sonatas --

00:07:51.024 --> 00:07:52.187
He waits; he delays:

00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:55.381
for the next 10 years, he still
publishes piano sonatas

00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:57.055
that don't use the extra notes.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.485
He actually waits, because --

00:07:58.509 --> 00:07:59.996
This idea of Beethoven?

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.955
Everything you know
about Beethoven -- basically wrong.

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:05.353
Beethoven was a very clever entrepreneur.

00:08:05.377 --> 00:08:07.588
So the music he wrote
for the popular market --

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.879
not the pieces he was going to play
himself, but the piano sonatas --

00:08:10.903 --> 00:08:13.418
he limits himself to the amount of keys

00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:17.442
that you have at home
in some part of Southern Italy,

00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:19.304
where you have last year's piano.

00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:25.662
So what are the effects of these
disruptions in music technology?

00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:27.882
How do composers, how do people respond?

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:31.336
We've had three of these things,
and they really all worked the same way.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.433
We started off with printing
and the piano.

00:08:33.457 --> 00:08:36.775
The very first thing that happens
is: it redefines the product.

00:08:37.923 --> 00:08:40.450
So the product becomes sheet music,

00:08:40.474 --> 00:08:43.243
becomes a piece of paper
that you can then take home.

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:45.715
In the 20th century, it becomes a record,

00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:47.449
something that you then take home.

00:08:47.473 --> 00:08:49.718
In the 21st century,
it becomes a digital file.

00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:51.593
The nature of the product changes.

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:54.052
Second, there's a division of labor.

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:57.900
If you want to listen to Bach,
you've got to go listen to Bach;

00:08:57.924 --> 00:08:59.682
there's no other way to do this.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:04.343
In the 19th century, we've got performers,
and we've got composers,

00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:05.862
people who do different things.

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:09.239
We have listeners who can now
manipulate music like you just saw.

00:09:10.076 --> 00:09:11.743
It changes expectations of quality.

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:14.745
Once everybody's heard
Count Basie and Benny Goodman,

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:18.389
maybe you're not quite so happy
with your local band as much anymore.

00:09:18.413 --> 00:09:21.900
You've now heard ... -- "I want to go
listen to Benny Goodman some more."

00:09:21.924 --> 00:09:23.552
You have now a global market.

00:09:23.576 --> 00:09:25.986
You can hear things
that you didn't use to hear.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.620
Every time this happens,
we take away some social interaction.

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:33.849
With Beethoven, you can now
play Beethoven at home.

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.161
You can't play Mozart at home.

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:39.279
But with Beethoven, you can buy
the sheet music, you can go home,

00:09:39.303 --> 00:09:41.341
you can close the door and play the piano.

00:09:41.365 --> 00:09:42.524
And only you are there.

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.766
Now you have headphones
that do the same thing.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.287
With each of these disruptions,

00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:48.394
it changes the amount
of social interaction.

00:09:48.418 --> 00:09:51.766
It's a new personalized
experience each time.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.678
I can play Beethoven the way I want to.

00:09:53.702 --> 00:09:55.781
I can play it faster,
I can play it slower.

00:09:55.805 --> 00:09:58.212
I can actually personalize
the experience now.

00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:00.998
There's more consumer choice,
the marketplace gets bigger.

00:10:01.022 --> 00:10:04.720
The number of titles on sale
in those music stores goes up.

00:10:05.577 --> 00:10:06.987
But there's also less choice,

00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:10.138
because in a global pyramid,
you can't always tell what you want.

00:10:10.162 --> 00:10:12.544
There's so much choice out there.
How do you pick?

00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:14.258
And so marketing starts to come in,

00:10:14.282 --> 00:10:16.073
and "Who is the flavor of the month?"

00:10:16.097 --> 00:10:18.749
There's one more thing
that's not on the list:

00:10:18.773 --> 00:10:20.165
piracy.

00:10:20.678 --> 00:10:23.992
One of Haydn and Chopin's biggest worries

00:10:24.016 --> 00:10:26.693
is that people were going
to write fake Chopin

00:10:27.534 --> 00:10:28.830
and put "Chopin" on it.

00:10:28.854 --> 00:10:31.721
Do you think Chopin would have been
comforted by the thought,

00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:34.158
"Hey, 20 percent of the people
who buy fake Chopin

00:10:34.182 --> 00:10:36.123
are more likely to go buy real Chopin"?

00:10:36.147 --> 00:10:37.635
I mean -- I don't know.

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:39.269
(Laughter)

00:10:39.293 --> 00:10:42.384
But Chopin, another clever entrepreneur --
you know what he does?

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.268
He publishes his music in Italy,
France, Germany and England

00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:46.452
on the same day,

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:48.498
because there's no
international copyright,

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:51.230
so he's got to have everything
published on the same day.

00:10:51.254 --> 00:10:53.234
And he puts differences in every country.

00:10:53.258 --> 00:10:54.704
So if you're playing Chopin,

00:10:54.728 --> 00:10:57.771
the additions from different countries
are different on purpose,

00:10:57.795 --> 00:11:00.901
because he wanted to be able
to track who was a pirate.

00:11:00.925 --> 00:11:03.550
So, this wasn't something
that Sony thought of.

00:11:03.574 --> 00:11:05.459
So, the question is ...

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.525
This new technology,

00:11:08.549 --> 00:11:11.469
it makes more choice for more people,
it makes it more global,

00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:14.110
but it also allows more piracy.

00:11:14.134 --> 00:11:18.407
It also allows for people
to have a marketing filter.

00:11:18.431 --> 00:11:22.656
They have some way to interact
that's not always direct.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.447
So the next time somebody says, you know,

00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:27.669
"Nothing like the internet ever happened."

00:11:28.202 --> 00:11:32.641
Well, it's true, but these kinds
of disruptions in music technology

00:11:32.665 --> 00:11:34.263
have happened before.

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:37.257
And the model for these disruptions
is the same as we see

00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:38.731
in other kinds of businesses.

00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:41.205
It changes the nature of the product.

00:11:41.229 --> 00:11:43.531
So if you're in book publishing,

00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:47.623
you thought you were in book publishing
because of these things called books.

00:11:47.647 --> 00:11:49.974
Well, you can still sell
novels without books.

00:11:49.998 --> 00:11:51.928
You can still be in the music business

00:11:51.952 --> 00:11:54.235
even though you're not
in the record business.

00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:57.155
You were selling records
only because that was the technology

00:11:57.179 --> 00:11:58.751
that you inherited.

00:11:58.775 --> 00:12:00.668
Newspaper business: dead.

00:12:00.692 --> 00:12:02.297
But journalism isn't dead.

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.069
And finally, schools.

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.728
School is the next big horizon,

00:12:06.752 --> 00:12:08.678
because what were we in the business of?

00:12:08.702 --> 00:12:11.995
Schools used to be like buying
gas or buying food;

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:15.297
they had to have local entry
points all over the place.

00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:18.768
But now, with the internet, we have
a different distribution system.

00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:22.391
And so schools have got to think
about what we're selling.

00:12:22.415 --> 00:12:26.481
But I think that the face-to-face
interaction is not going to go away.

00:12:26.505 --> 00:12:29.675
There's still something of value
here, as we've demonstrated today,

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:31.576
because we're at this thing called TED,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.748
where we still want to get
to know each other.

00:12:33.772 --> 00:12:34.928
Thank you very much.

00:12:34.952 --> 00:12:36.813
(Applause)
