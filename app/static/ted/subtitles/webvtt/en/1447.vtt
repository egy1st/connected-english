00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:03.530
I'm going to talk to you about optimism --

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.013
or more precisely, the optimism bias.

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:07.658
It's a cognitive illusion

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:10.400
that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.135
and 80 percent of us have it.

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.869
It's our tendency to overestimate

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.792
our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:21.900
and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.917
So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:26.423
being in a car accident.

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:29.609
We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.054
In short, we're more optimistic than realistic,

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:35.216
but we are oblivious to the fact.

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:37.443
Take marriage for example.

00:00:37.443 --> 00:00:40.977
In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:44.446
That means that out of five married couples,

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:47.167
two will end up splitting their assets.

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:50.542
But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce,

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:54.234
they estimate it at zero percent.

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:57.963
And even divorce lawyers, who should really know better,

00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:01.812
hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:04.938
So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce,

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:07.468
but they are more likely to remarry.

00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:09.771
In the words of Samuel Johnson,

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:13.768
"Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience."

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:15.730
(Laughter)

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.304
So if we're married, we're more likely to have kids.

00:01:20.304 --> 00:01:23.569
And we all think our kids will be especially talented.

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.167
This, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:28.542
And I just want to make it absolutely clear

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:31.313
that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias,

00:01:31.313 --> 00:01:34.125
because he is in fact uniquely talented.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:35.560
(Laughter)

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.167
And I'm not alone.

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.642
Out of four British people, three said

00:01:39.642 --> 00:01:43.381
that they were optimistic about the future of their own families.

00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.132
That's 75 percent.

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:47.190
But only 30 percent said

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.750
that they thought families in general

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.162
are doing better than a few generations ago.

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:54.183
And this is a really important point,

00:01:54.183 --> 00:01:56.071
because we're optimistic about ourselves,

00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.889
we're optimistic about our kids,

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:59.677
we're optimistic about our families,

00:01:59.677 --> 00:02:02.860
but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.089
and we're somewhat pessimistic

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:08.968
about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:13.004
But private optimism about our own personal future

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:15.015
remains persistent.

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:19.081
And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay,

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:23.113
but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.

00:02:23.113 --> 00:02:25.954
Now I'm a scientist, I do experiments.

00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:27.746
So to show you what I mean,

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.548
I'm going to do an experiment here with you.

00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:34.398
So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics,

00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:37.292
and I want you to think for each of these abilities

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:41.685
where you stand relative to the rest of the population.

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:45.471
The first one is getting along well with others.

00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:51.123
Who here believes they're at the bottom 25 percent?

00:02:51.123 --> 00:02:55.445
Okay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500.

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:59.458
Who believes they're at the top 25 percent?

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.168
That's most of us here.

00:03:02.168 --> 00:03:07.098
Okay, now do the same for your driving ability.

00:03:07.098 --> 00:03:09.681
How interesting are you?

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:12.525
How attractive are you?

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.479
How honest are you?

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:20.479
And finally, how modest are you?

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.167
So most of us put ourselves above average

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:25.196
on most of these abilities.

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:27.327
Now this is statistically impossible.

00:03:27.327 --> 00:03:30.556
We can't all be better than everyone else.

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:32.198
(Laughter)

00:03:32.198 --> 00:03:34.875
But if we believe we're better than the other guy,

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:38.958
well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married,

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.556
because we're more social, more interesting.

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:43.719
And it's a global phenomenon.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.187
The optimism bias has been observed

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:47.906
in many different countries --

00:03:47.906 --> 00:03:51.010
in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.516
in females and males,

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:54.240
in kids, in the elderly.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.023
It's quite widespread.

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:59.523
But the question is, is it good for us?

00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:01.977
So some people say no.

00:04:01.977 --> 00:04:04.495
Some people say the secret to happiness

00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:07.248
is low expectations.

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:09.752
I think the logic goes something like this:

00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:12.010
If we don't expect greatness,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.890
if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful,

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.988
well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen.

00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:22.396
And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen,

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:24.375
and we're pleasantly surprised when they do,

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:26.156
we will be happy.

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:27.858
So it's a very good theory,

00:04:27.858 --> 00:04:30.885
but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.

00:04:30.885 --> 00:04:35.500
Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.358
people with high expectations always feel better.

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:43.290
Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.320
depends on how we interpret that event.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.370
The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.364
studied students with high and low expectations.

00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:57.548
And they found that when people with high expectations succeed,

00:04:57.548 --> 00:05:00.458
they attribute that success to their own traits.

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:02.654
"I'm a genius, therefore I got an A,

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:05.329
therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future."

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:08.302
When they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb,

00:05:08.302 --> 00:05:11.475
but because the exam just happened to be unfair.

00:05:11.475 --> 00:05:13.758
Next time they will do better.

00:05:13.758 --> 00:05:16.835
People with low expectations do the opposite.

00:05:16.835 --> 00:05:19.667
So when they failed it was because they were dumb,

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:21.167
and when they succeeded

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:24.484
it was because the exam just happened to be really easy.

00:05:24.484 --> 00:05:26.885
Next time reality would catch up with them.

00:05:26.885 --> 00:05:28.958
So they felt worse.

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.198
Number two: Regardless of the outcome,

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:36.245
the pure act of anticipation makes us happy.

00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:39.421
The behavioral economist George Lowenstein

00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:41.140
asked students in his university

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.502
to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.

00:05:45.502 --> 00:05:48.387
Then he said, "How much are you willing to pay

00:05:48.387 --> 00:05:50.375
to get a kiss from a celebrity

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.602
if the kiss was delivered immediately,

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:57.625
in three hours, in 24 hours, in three days,

00:05:57.625 --> 00:06:00.058
in one year, in 10 years?

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:03.188
He found that the students were willing to pay the most

00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:05.187
not to get a kiss immediately,

00:06:05.187 --> 00:06:08.167
but to get a kiss in three days.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:12.414
They were willing to pay extra in order to wait.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:15.417
Now they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years;

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:16.838
no one wants an aging celebrity.

00:06:16.838 --> 00:06:21.627
But three days seemed to be the optimum amount.

00:06:21.627 --> 00:06:23.930
So why is that?

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.354
Well if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with.

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:29.304
But if you get the kiss in three days,

00:06:29.304 --> 00:06:33.458
well that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.

00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.327
The students wanted that time

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:37.708
to imagine where is it going to happen,

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:39.337
how is it going to happen.

00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:41.548
Anticipation made them happy.

00:06:41.548 --> 00:06:45.417
This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.

00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:47.500
It's a really curious fact,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.917
because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure,

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:53.821
so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday,

00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:55.542
but they don't.

00:06:55.542 --> 00:06:58.417
It's not because they really, really like being in the office

00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:00.384
and they can't stand strolling in the park

00:07:00.384 --> 00:07:02.045
or having a lazy brunch.

00:07:02.045 --> 00:07:04.181
We know that, because when you ask people

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:06.885
about their ultimate favorite day of the week,

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.705
surprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first,

00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:12.625
then Friday, then Sunday.

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:14.494
People prefer Friday

00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:18.458
because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead,

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:20.375
all the plans that you have.

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:23.079
On Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.333
is the work week.

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:30.210
So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future,

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.131
more strolls in the park.

00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:36.038
And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:39.002
In fact, without the optimism bias,

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:41.752
we would all be slightly depressed.

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:44.019
People with mild depression,

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:46.998
they don't have a bias when they look into the future.

00:07:46.998 --> 00:07:51.220
They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.321
But individuals with severe depression,

00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:55.150
they have a pessimistic bias.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.613
So they tend to expect the future

00:07:57.613 --> 00:08:00.090
to be worse than it ends up being.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.333
So optimism changes subjective reality.

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:07.083
The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:10.325
But it also changes objective reality.

00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:13.052
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:15.120
And that is the third reason

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.300
why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.135
Controlled experiments have shown

00:08:20.135 --> 00:08:23.052
that optimism is not only related to success,

00:08:23.052 --> 00:08:24.859
it leads to success.

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:29.729
Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:34.204
And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.

00:08:34.204 --> 00:08:37.529
If we expect the future to be bright,

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:40.269
stress and anxiety are reduced.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:44.489
So all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.

00:08:44.489 --> 00:08:47.500
But the question that was really confusing to me was,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.169
how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?

00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:55.187
As an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing,

00:08:55.187 --> 00:08:58.083
because according to all the theories out there,

00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:02.271
when your expectations are not met, you should alter them.

00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:03.823
But this is not what we find.

00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:07.306
We asked people to come into our lab

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:10.116
in order to try and figure out what was going on.

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:12.663
We asked them to estimate their likelihood

00:09:12.663 --> 00:09:15.167
of experiencing different terrible events in their lives.

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:19.542
So, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:21.894
And then we told them the average likelihood

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.875
of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.

00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:28.440
So cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.375
And then we asked them again,

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:34.250
"How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.498
What we wanted to know was

00:09:36.498 --> 00:09:39.167
whether people will take the information that we gave them

00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:41.298
to change their beliefs.

00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:43.667
And indeed they did --

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:46.248
but mostly when the information we gave them

00:09:46.248 --> 00:09:49.079
was better than what they expected.

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:50.440
So for example,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.350
if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.731
is about 50 percent,"

00:09:55.731 --> 00:09:58.252
and we said, "Hey, good news.

00:09:58.252 --> 00:10:00.833
The average likelihood is only 30 percent,"

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.879
the next time around they would say,

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:05.594
"Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent."

00:10:05.594 --> 00:10:08.230
So they learned quickly and efficiently.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.780
But if someone started off saying,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.183
"My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent,"

00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:16.875
and we said, "Hey, bad news.

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:19.948
The average likelihood is about 30 percent,"

00:10:19.948 --> 00:10:22.006
the next time around they would say,

00:10:22.006 --> 00:10:25.125
"Yep. Still think it's about 11 percent."

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.815
(Laughter)

00:10:26.815 --> 00:10:30.134
So it's not that they didn't learn at all -- they did --

00:10:30.134 --> 00:10:32.470
but much, much less than when we gave them

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.943
positive information about the future.

00:10:34.943 --> 00:10:37.977
And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them;

00:10:37.977 --> 00:10:41.050
everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.550
is about 30 percent

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.329
and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.

00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:49.960
But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.108
What this means is that warning signs such as these

00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:57.000
may only have limited impact.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.159
Yes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:03.042
What I wanted to know was

00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:05.902
what was going on inside the human brain

00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:09.996
that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally.

00:11:09.996 --> 00:11:11.483
But at the same time,

00:11:11.483 --> 00:11:13.461
when we hear that the housing market is hopeful,

00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:17.577
we think, "Oh, my house is definitely going to double in price."

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:19.662
To try and figure that out,

00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:22.135
I asked the participants in the experiment

00:11:22.135 --> 00:11:24.296
to lie in a brain imaging scanner.

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:25.823
It looks like this.

00:11:25.823 --> 00:11:28.854
And using a method called functional MRI,

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:32.460
we were able to identify regions in the brain

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.277
that were responding to positive information.

00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:38.856
One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.

00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:42.644
So if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent,"

00:11:42.644 --> 00:11:44.500
and we said, "Hey, good news.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.790
Average likelihood is 30 percent,"

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.362
the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.

00:11:50.362 --> 00:11:55.094
And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist

00:11:55.094 --> 00:11:56.915
or slightly pessimistic,

00:11:56.915 --> 00:11:59.500
everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.344
was functioning perfectly well,

00:12:01.344 --> 00:12:04.250
whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.894
On the other side of the brain,

00:12:05.894 --> 00:12:10.680
the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.406
And here's the thing: it wasn't doing a very good job.

00:12:14.406 --> 00:12:16.421
The more optimistic you were,

00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:18.758
the less likely this region was

00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:21.740
to respond to unexpected negative information.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.798
And if your brain is failing

00:12:24.798 --> 00:12:28.023
at integrating bad news about the future,

00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:32.646
you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on.

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:37.615
So we wanted to know, could we change this?

00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:41.058
Could we alter people's optimism bias

00:12:41.058 --> 00:12:44.990
by interfering with the brain activity in these regions?

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.585
And there's a way for us to do that.

00:12:47.585 --> 00:12:50.212
This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai.

00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:54.167
And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse

00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:56.286
through the skull of the participant in our study

00:12:56.286 --> 00:12:58.531
into their inferior frontal gyrus.

00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:00.458
And by doing that,

00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:03.362
he's interfering with the activity of this brain region

00:13:03.362 --> 00:13:04.577
for about half an hour.

00:13:04.577 --> 00:13:07.498
After that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.

00:13:07.498 --> 00:13:09.491
(Laughter)

00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.645
So let's see what happens.

00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:14.742
First of all, I'm going to show you

00:13:14.742 --> 00:13:17.446
the average amount of bias that we see.

00:13:17.446 --> 00:13:20.269
So if I was to test all of you now,

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:22.063
this is the amount that you would learn

00:13:22.063 --> 00:13:25.183
more from good news relative to bad news.

00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:27.667
Now we interfere with the region

00:13:27.667 --> 00:13:32.134
that we found to integrate negative information in this task,

00:13:32.134 --> 00:13:35.698
and the optimism bias grew even larger.

00:13:35.698 --> 00:13:41.168
We made people more biased in the way that they process information.

00:13:41.168 --> 00:13:44.065
Then we interfered with the brain region

00:13:44.065 --> 00:13:47.583
that we found to integrate good news in this task,

00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:52.054
and the optimism bias disappeared.

00:13:52.054 --> 00:13:54.062
We were quite amazed by these results

00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:56.254
because we were able to eliminate

00:13:56.254 --> 00:13:59.450
a deep-rooted bias in humans.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:04.223
And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves,

00:14:04.223 --> 00:14:09.325
would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?

00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:14.369
If we could do that, would we want to take people's optimism bias away?

00:14:14.369 --> 00:14:18.969
Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias,

00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:23.290
which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.375
But there are, of course, pitfalls,

00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:28.495
and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them.

00:14:28.495 --> 00:14:32.041
Take for example this email I recieved

00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:34.735
from a firefighter here in California.

00:14:34.735 --> 00:14:38.039
He says, "Fatality investigations for firefighters

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:42.181
often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,'

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.483
even when all of the available information

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.738
was there to make safe decisions."

00:14:46.738 --> 00:14:50.612
This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias

00:14:50.612 --> 00:14:52.804
to try to explain to the firefighters

00:14:52.804 --> 00:14:55.013
why they think the way they do,

00:14:55.013 --> 00:15:02.139
to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans.

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:07.258
So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior,

00:15:07.258 --> 00:15:10.896
to financial collapse, to faulty planning.

00:15:10.896 --> 00:15:13.034
The British government, for example,

00:15:13.034 --> 00:15:15.708
has acknowledged that the optimism bias

00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:18.995
can make individuals more likely

00:15:18.995 --> 00:15:23.021
to underestimate the costs and durations of projects.

00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:27.275
So they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget

00:15:27.275 --> 00:15:29.386
for the optimism bias.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:31.573
My friend who's getting married in a few weeks

00:15:31.573 --> 00:15:34.007
has done the same for his wedding budget.

00:15:34.007 --> 00:15:37.069
And by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce,

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:40.629
he said he was quite sure it was zero percent.

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:43.046
So what we would really like to do,

00:15:43.046 --> 00:15:47.207
is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism,

00:15:47.207 --> 00:15:50.435
but at the same time remain hopeful,

00:15:50.435 --> 00:15:53.279
benefiting from the many fruits of optimism.

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:56.083
And I believe there's a way for us to do that.

00:15:56.083 --> 00:15:58.143
The key here really is knowledge.

00:15:58.143 --> 00:16:01.454
We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases.

00:16:01.454 --> 00:16:05.295
These have to be identified by scientific investigation.

00:16:05.295 --> 00:16:09.479
But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias

00:16:09.479 --> 00:16:11.254
does not shatter the illusion.

00:16:11.254 --> 00:16:12.802
It's like visual illusions,

00:16:12.802 --> 00:16:16.292
in which understanding them does not make them go away.

00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:18.529
And this is good because it means

00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:21.002
we should be able to strike a balance,

00:16:21.002 --> 00:16:23.429
to come up with plans and rules

00:16:23.429 --> 00:16:26.212
to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism,

00:16:26.212 --> 00:16:29.364
but at the same time remain hopeful.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:32.788
I think this cartoon portrays it nicely.

00:16:32.788 --> 00:16:36.314
Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there

00:16:36.314 --> 00:16:38.433
who just does not believe they can fly,

00:16:38.433 --> 00:16:40.792
you certainly never will.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.623
Because to make any kind of progress,

00:16:42.623 --> 00:16:44.973
we need to be able to imagine a different reality,

00:16:44.973 --> 00:16:48.704
and then we need to believe that that reality is possible.

00:16:48.714 --> 00:16:52.238
But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin

00:16:52.238 --> 00:16:55.000
who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.781
you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.

00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:01.670
But if you're an optimistic penguin

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.466
who believes they can fly,

00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:06.129
but then adjusts a parachute to your back

00:17:06.129 --> 00:17:09.146
just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned,

00:17:09.146 --> 00:17:11.009
you will soar like an eagle,

00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:14.058
even if you're just a penguin.

00:17:14.058 --> 00:17:15.820
Thank you.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.756
(Applause)
