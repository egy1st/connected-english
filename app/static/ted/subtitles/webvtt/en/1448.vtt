00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.671
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:05.983
It has generated considerable insight in physics,

00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:08.083
in biology and economics,

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:10.900
but not that much in the humanities and in history.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.183
I think there's a belief that it's just impossible,

00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:15.829
that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind,

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.348
that you cannot measure history.

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:19.875
But I don't think that's right.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.917
I want to show you a couple of examples why.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.875
So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact:

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.604
that two kings separated by centuries

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.371
will speak a very different language.

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.675
That's a powerful historical force.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:33.448
So the king of England, Alfred the Great,

00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:35.088
will use a vocabulary and grammar

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:38.788
that is quite different from the king of hip hop, Jay-Z.

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.454
(Laughter)

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:42.625
Now it's just the way it is.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.917
Language changes over time, and it's a powerful force.

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:47.204
So Erez and I wanted to know more about that.

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:50.861
So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule, past-tense conjugation.

00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:54.125
So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.052
"Today I walk. Yesterday I walked."

00:00:56.052 --> 00:00:57.396
But some verbs are irregular.

00:00:57.396 --> 00:00:58.792
"Yesterday I thought."

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.458
Now what's interesting about that

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:04.288
is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay-Z have become more regular.

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:07.023
Like the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular.

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:11.045
So Erez and I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:12.964
through 12 centuries of English language,

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:15.875
and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.417
that captures this complex historical change,

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:22.077
namely, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another,

00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:24.742
it regularizes 10 times slower.

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:28.677
That's a piece of history, but it comes in a mathematical wrapping.

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:32.331
Now in some cases math can even help explain,

00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:35.210
or propose explanations for, historical forces.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.042
So here Steve Pinker and I

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:40.894
were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries.

00:01:40.894 --> 00:01:43.389
There's actually a well-known regularity to them

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:46.811
where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier

00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:48.763
is 10 times smaller.

00:01:48.763 --> 00:01:52.107
So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War,

00:01:52.107 --> 00:01:54.927
but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier --

00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:56.904
like World War I.

00:01:56.904 --> 00:01:59.827
So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that?

00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:01.827
What's the origin of this?

00:02:01.827 --> 00:02:04.092
So Steve and I, through mathematical analysis,

00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:08.333
propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this,

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.023
which lies in our brains.

00:02:10.023 --> 00:02:12.042
This is a very well-known feature

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:15.017
in which we perceive quantities in relative ways --

00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:18.733
quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound.

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:24.042
For instance, committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot.

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:27.486
It's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously.

00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:29.313
But it doesn't sound so much,

00:02:29.313 --> 00:02:32.333
it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:35.285
if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously.

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:38.898
So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities,

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:40.665
as the war drags on,

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:43.750
the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.433
will increase not linearly --

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:47.321
like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 --

00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:51.596
but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000.

00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:54.681
And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before.

00:02:54.681 --> 00:03:00.179
So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.168
with a long-term historical pattern

00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:06.025
that unfolds over centuries and across continents.

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:10.042
So these types of examples, today there are just a few of them,

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.731
but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace.

00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.123
The reason for that is that the historical record

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.583
is becoming digitized at a very fast pace.

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:20.193
So there's about 130 million books

00:03:20.193 --> 00:03:22.504
that have been written since the dawn of time.

00:03:22.504 --> 00:03:24.958
Companies like Google have digitized many of them --

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.542
above 20 million actually.

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:30.120
And when the stuff of history is available in digital form,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.500
it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.875
to very quickly and very conveniently

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:37.600
review trends in our history and our culture.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.321
So I think in the next decade,

00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:43.071
the sciences and the humanities will come closer together

00:03:43.071 --> 00:03:46.400
to be able to answer deep questions about mankind.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.521
And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.667
It will be able to reveal new trends in our history,

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.417
sometimes to explain them,

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:58.723
and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.

00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:00.214
Thank you very much.

00:04:00.214 --> 00:04:03.892
(Applause)
