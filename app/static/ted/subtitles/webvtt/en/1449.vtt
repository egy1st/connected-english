00:00:01.173 --> 00:00:04.802
I wanted to talk to you today
about creative confidence.

00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:08.587
I'm going to start way back
in the third grade

00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.532
at Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio.

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:15.977
I remember one day my best friend
Brian was working on a project.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.853
He was making a horse out of the clay
our teacher kept under the sink.

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:25.675
And at one point, one of the girls
that was sitting at his table,

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.313
seeing what he was doing,
leaned over and said to him,

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:32.391
"That's terrible. That doesn't look
anything like a horse."

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:35.543
And Brian's shoulders sank.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:38.880
And he wadded up the clay horse
and he threw it back in the bin.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:44.089
I never saw Brian do a project
like that ever again.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.256
And I wonder how often
that happens, you know?

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:51.581
It seems like when I tell
that story of Brian to my class,

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.049
a lot of them want to come up after class

00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:57.090
and tell me about
their similar experience,

00:00:57.114 --> 00:00:58.724
how a teacher shut them down,

00:00:58.748 --> 00:01:01.409
or how a student
was particularly cruel to them.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.975
And then some kind of opt out
of thinking of themselves as creative

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:06.154
at that point.

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:10.777
And I see that opting out
that happens in childhood,

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.096
and it moves in and becomes
more ingrained, even,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.120
by the time you get to adult life.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:22.278
So we see a lot of this.

00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:23.702
When we have a workshop

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:26.472
or when we have clients
in to work with us side by side,

00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:28.773
eventually we get
to the point in the process

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.118
that's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.

00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:35.281
And eventually, these big-shot executives
whip out their BlackBerrys

00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:38.850
and they say they have to make
really important phone calls,

00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:40.445
and they head for the exits.

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:42.854
And they're just so uncomfortable.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.909
When we track them down
and ask them what's going on,

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.856
they say something like,
"I'm just not the creative type."

00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:51.187
But we know that's not true.

00:01:51.703 --> 00:01:54.371
If they stick with the process,
if they stick with it,

00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:56.616
they end up doing amazing things.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.590
And they surprise themselves
at just how innovative

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.785
they and their teams really are.

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:07.694
So I've been looking
at this fear of judgment that we have,

00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:11.200
that you don't do things, you're afraid
you're going to be judged;

00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:15.021
if you don't say the right creative thing,
you're going to be judged.

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:17.716
And I had a major breakthrough,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.907
when I met the psychologist
Albert Bandura.

00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:25.208
I don't know if you know Albert Bandura,
but if you go to Wikipedia,

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:29.374
it says that he's the fourth most
important psychologist in history --

00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:33.107
you know, like Freud, Skinner,
somebody and Bandura.

00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:34.543
(Laughter)

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:37.551
Bandura is 86 and he still
works at Stanford.

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:39.331
And he's just a lovely guy.

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:42.362
So I went to see him,

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:45.888
because he's just worked
on phobias for a long time,

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:47.345
which I'm very interested in.

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:51.607
He had developed this way,

00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:54.357
this, kind of, methodology,

00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:57.332
that ended up curing people
in a very short amount of time,

00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:58.715
like, in four hours.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.175
He had a huge cure rate
of people who had phobias.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.163
And we talked about snakes
-- I don't know why --

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:09.369
we talked about snakes
and fear of snakes as a phobia.

00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:13.227
And it was really enjoyable,
really interesting.

00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:18.194
He told me that he'd invite
the test subject in,

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:21.105
and he'd say, "You know,
there's a snake in the next room

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.733
and we're going to go in there."

00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.561
To which, he reported,
most of them replied,

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:31.365
"Hell no! I'm not going in there,
certainly if there's a snake in there."

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.689
But Bandura has a step-by-step
process that was super successful.

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:38.619
So he'd take people to this two-way mirror

00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:40.938
looking into the room where the snake was.

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:43.408
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:44.988
Then through a series of steps,

00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:48.697
he'd move them and they'd be standing
in the doorway with the door open,

00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:50.235
and they'd be looking in there.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.206
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.920
And then many more steps
later, baby steps,

00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:59.016
they'd be in the room, they'd have
a leather glove like a welder's glove on,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.694
and they'd eventually touch the snake.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:07.179
And when they touched the snake,
everything was fine. They were cured.

00:04:07.203 --> 00:04:09.323
In fact, everything was better than fine.

00:04:09.347 --> 00:04:12.600
These people who had
lifelong fears of snakes

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.729
were saying things like,

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:17.374
"Look how beautiful that snake is."

00:04:17.398 --> 00:04:20.513
And they were holding it in their laps.

00:04:21.673 --> 00:04:25.226
Bandura calls this process
"guided mastery."

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.169
I love that term: guided mastery.

00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:30.761
And something else happened.

00:04:31.222 --> 00:04:34.724
These people who went through the process
and touched the snake

00:04:34.748 --> 00:04:38.251
ended up having less anxiety
about other things in their lives.

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:42.091
They tried harder, they persevered longer,

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.871
and they were more resilient
in the face of failure.

00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:48.548
They just gained a new confidence.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.218
And Bandura calls
that confidence "self-efficacy,"

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.487
the sense that you can change the world

00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:00.335
and that you can attain
what you set out to do.

00:05:01.457 --> 00:05:04.221
Well, meeting Bandura
was really cathartic for me,

00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:07.778
because I realized
that this famous scientist

00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:10.962
had documented
and scientifically validated

00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:14.377
something that we've seen happen
for the last 30 years:

00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:18.190
that we could take people who had the fear
that they weren't creative,

00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:20.940
and we could take them
through a series of steps,

00:05:20.964 --> 00:05:24.360
kind of like a series of small successes,

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:27.734
and they turn fear into familiarity.

00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:29.790
And they surprise themselves.

00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:31.817
That transformation is amazing.

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.237
We see it at the d.school all the time.

00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:36.967
People from all different
kinds of disciplines,

00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:39.482
they think of themselves
as only analytical.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:43.010
And they come in and they go
through the process, our process,

00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:46.216
they build confidence and now
they think of themselves differently.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.305
And they're totally emotionally excited
about the fact that they walk around

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:53.592
thinking of themselves
as a creative person.

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:57.622
So I thought one
of the things I'd do today

00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:00.848
is take you through and show you
what this journey looks like.

00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:05.972
To me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.

00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:10.140
Doug Dietz is a technical person.

00:06:10.164 --> 00:06:13.962
He designs large
medical imaging equipment.

00:06:14.432 --> 00:06:17.692
He's worked for GE, and he's had
a fantastic career.

00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:20.668
But at one point,
he had a moment of crisis.

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:25.139
He was in the hospital looking
at one of his MRI machines in use,

00:06:25.163 --> 00:06:28.410
when he saw a young family,
and this little girl.

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:32.239
And that little girl was crying
and was terrified.

00:06:32.263 --> 00:06:34.809
And Doug was really disappointed to learn

00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:39.497
that nearly 80 percent
of the pediatric patients in this hospital

00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:43.239
had to be sedated in order
to deal with his MRI machine.

00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:47.144
And this was really disappointing to Doug,

00:06:47.168 --> 00:06:49.821
because before this time,
he was proud of what he did.

00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:51.976
He was saving lives with this machine.

00:06:52.437 --> 00:06:56.957
But it really hurt him to see the fear
that this machine caused in kids.

00:06:57.438 --> 00:07:01.898
About that time, he was at the d.school
at Stanford taking classes.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:06.573
He was learning about our process,
about design thinking, about empathy,

00:07:06.597 --> 00:07:08.422
about iterative prototyping.

00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:13.135
And he would take this new knowledge
and do something quite extraordinary.

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.896
He would redesign the entire experience

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.158
of being scanned.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.159
And this is what he came up with.

00:07:20.183 --> 00:07:21.202
(Laughter)

00:07:21.226 --> 00:07:23.799
He turned it into
an adventure for the kids.

00:07:23.823 --> 00:07:26.081
He painted the walls
and he painted the machine,

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:28.884
and he got the operators retrained
by people who know kids,

00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:31.418
like children's museum people.

00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:35.140
And now when the kid comes,
it's an experience.

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:38.770
And they talk to them about the noise
and the movement of the ship.

00:07:38.794 --> 00:07:40.191
And when they come, they say,

00:07:40.215 --> 00:07:42.342
"OK, you're going to go
into the pirate ship,

00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:45.883
but be very still, because we don't want
the pirates to find you."

00:07:47.314 --> 00:07:50.070
And the results were super dramatic:

00:07:50.974 --> 00:07:54.124
from something like 80 percent
of the kids needing to be sedated,

00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:58.402
to something like 10 percent
of the kids needing to be sedated.

00:07:58.426 --> 00:08:00.465
And the hospital and GE were happy, too,

00:08:00.489 --> 00:08:03.648
because you didn't have to call
the anesthesiologist all the time,

00:08:03.672 --> 00:08:06.480
and they could put more kids
through the machine in a day.

00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:08.411
So the quantitative results were great.

00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:12.101
But Doug's results that he cared about
were much more qualitative.

00:08:12.463 --> 00:08:14.189
He was with one of the mothers

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:16.523
waiting for her child
to come out of the scan.

00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:18.913
And when the little girl
came out of her scan,

00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:20.833
she ran up to her mother and said,

00:08:20.857 --> 00:08:22.797
"Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"

00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:25.049
(Laughter)

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:29.467
And so, I've heard Doug tell
the story many times

00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:31.777
of his personal transformation

00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:35.147
and the breakthrough design
that happened from it,

00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:38.282
but I've never really seen him
tell the story of the little girl

00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:39.743
without a tear in his eye.

00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:42.320
Doug's story takes place in a hospital.

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:45.200
I know a thing or two about hospitals.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.640
A few years ago, I felt a lump
on the side of my neck.

00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:53.406
It was my turn in the MRI machine.

00:08:53.964 --> 00:08:56.924
It was cancer, it was the bad kind.

00:08:56.948 --> 00:09:00.107
I was told I had a 40 percent
chance of survival.

00:09:00.903 --> 00:09:03.809
So while you're sitting
around with the other patients,

00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:05.057
in your pajamas,

00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:07.109
and everybody's pale and thin --

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:08.149
(Laughter)

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:11.438
you know? -- and you're waiting
for your turn to get the gamma rays,

00:09:11.462 --> 00:09:13.114
you think of a lot of things.

00:09:13.138 --> 00:09:15.716
Mostly, you think about:
Am I going to survive?

00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:17.649
And I thought a lot about:

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:20.591
What was my daughter's life
going to be like without me?

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.914
But you think about other things.

00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:27.924
I thought a lot about:
What was I put on Earth to do?

00:09:27.948 --> 00:09:31.190
What was my calling? What should I do?

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.411
I was lucky because I had lots of options.

00:09:33.435 --> 00:09:35.394
We'd been working in health and wellness,

00:09:35.418 --> 00:09:37.516
and K-12, and the developing world.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.192
so there were lots of projects
that I could work on.

00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:42.930
But then I decided
and committed at this point,

00:09:42.954 --> 00:09:44.799
to the thing I most wanted to do,

00:09:46.234 --> 00:09:49.925
which was to help as many
people as possible

00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:53.081
regain the creative confidence
they lost along their way.

00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:56.646
And if I was going to survive,
that's what I wanted to do.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.131
I survived, just so you know.

00:09:58.155 --> 00:10:00.226
(Laughter)

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:06.869
(Applause)

00:10:06.983 --> 00:10:10.888
I really believe that when people
gain this confidence --

00:10:10.912 --> 00:10:13.913
and we see it all the time
at the d.school and at IDEO --

00:10:13.937 --> 00:10:16.735
that they actually start
working on the things

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:18.746
that are really important in their lives.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.481
We see people quit what they're doing
and go in new directions.

00:10:22.505 --> 00:10:28.954
We see them come up with more
interesting -- and just more -- ideas,

00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:31.881
so they can choose from better ideas.

00:10:31.905 --> 00:10:33.928
And they just make better decisions.

00:10:34.498 --> 00:10:37.991
I know at TED, you're supposed to have
a change-the-world kind of thing,

00:10:38.015 --> 00:10:40.715
isn't that -- everybody has
a change-the-world thing?

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:43.866
If there is one for me, this is it,
to help this happen.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.630
So I hope you'll join me on my quest,

00:10:46.654 --> 00:10:48.264
you as, kind of, thought leaders.

00:10:48.288 --> 00:10:52.529
It would be really great if you didn't let
people divide the world

00:10:52.553 --> 00:10:56.515
into the creatives and the non-creatives,
like it's some God-given thing,

00:10:56.539 --> 00:11:00.895
and to have people realize
that they're naturally creative,

00:11:01.049 --> 00:11:04.578
and that those natural people
should let their ideas fly;

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:09.841
that they should achieve
what Bandura calls self-efficacy,

00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:13.128
that you can do what you set out to do,

00:11:13.152 --> 00:11:16.840
and that you can reach a place
of creative confidence

00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:18.548
and touch the snake.

00:11:18.572 --> 00:11:19.724
Thank you.

00:11:19.748 --> 00:11:26.063
(Applause)
