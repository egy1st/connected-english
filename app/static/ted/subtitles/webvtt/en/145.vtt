WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And in particular, how the simple parts of organizations

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
interact to create the behavior of the whole organization.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and there are many others. The web is one.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are many biological systems like that --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
brains, cells, developing embryos.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There are about 10,000 species of ants.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Nobody tells anybody what to do.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
No ant directs the behavior of any other ant.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I try to figure out how that works.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And I've been working for the past 20 years

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
on a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Here's my study site. This is really a picture of ants,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and the rabbit just happens to be there.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is the nest of the mature colony, and there's the nest entrance.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And they forage maybe for about 20 meters away,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest, and store them.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This is just a road. And it's not very big:

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
it's about 250 meters on one side, 400 on the other.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And every colony has a name, which is a number,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
which is painted on a rock. And I go there every year

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and figure out which ones have died, and put all the new ones on the map.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And by doing this I know how old they all are.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And because of that, I've been able to study how their behavior changes

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
as the colony gets older and larger.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Ants never make more ants; colonies make more colonies.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
those are the ones with wings -- on a mating flight.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So every year, on the same day -- and it's a mystery exactly how that happens --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
each colony sends out its virgin, unmated queens with wings, and the males,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and they all fly to a common place. And they mate.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And she's in the process of mating with this male,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and there's another male on top waiting his turn.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Often the queens mate more than once.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And after that, the males all die. That's it for them.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
(Laughter)

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere, drop their wings,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And they will live for 15 or 20 years, continuing to lay eggs

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
using the sperm from that original mating.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So the queen goes down in there.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
She lays eggs, she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg, then it's a larva.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Then, as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
they're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and the queen never comes out again.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So this is a one-year-old colony -- this happens to be 536.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
This is a three-year-old colony.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They make a midden, a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This is a five-year-old colony. This is the nest entrance, here's a pencil for scale.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
This is about as big as they get, about a meter across.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
so this is about 10,000 worker ants --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
changes as a function of colony age, in years.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And it stays that size until the queen dies

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And it's when they reach this stable size, in numbers of ants,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that they start to reproduce.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That is, to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants. (Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So that's not the most fun part of this research, although it's interesting.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
(Laughter)

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
That's not just how is the colony organized,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but how does it change what it's doing?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
How is it that the colony manages to adjust

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So, things happen to an ant colony.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
When it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
There's a lot of damage to the nest,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
When extra food becomes available --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and this is what everybody knows about picnics --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
then extra ants are allocated to collect the food.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So, with nobody telling anybody what to do, how is it that

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And that's the process that I call task allocation.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And in harvester ants, I divide the tasks

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
of the ants I see just outside the nest

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
into these four categories: where an ant is foraging,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The patrollers -- that's supposed to be a magnifying glass --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
are an interesting group that go out early in the morning

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
before the foragers are active.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and by coming back -- just by making it back --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That is, that there are chambers inside,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of the Hopi people that are in that area.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
put it down, turn around, and go back in.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And finally, the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
On one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
they'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So that's what the midden workers do.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So that's only about 25 percent of the colony, and they're the oldest ants.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So, an ant starts out somewhere near the queen.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
as the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And then there's another long tunnel and a chamber, where we often find the queen,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and my crew of students with pickaxes,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
but instead because when there's flooding,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
occasionally the colony has to go down deep.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So there's this whole network of chambers.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
There's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And this is true of most ants --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and other ants come up from below, get the food,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So, despite what it says in the Bible,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
about, you know, "Look to the ant, thou sluggard,"

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
in fact, you could think of those ants as reserves.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
That is to say, if something happened -- and I've never seen anything like this happen,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but I've only been looking for 20 years --

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
if something happened, they might all come out if they were needed.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And I think it's a very interesting question --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
what is there about the way the colony is organized

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And they sort of stand as a buffer in between

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And if you mark ants that are working outside, and dig up a colony,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
you never see them deep down.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
They somehow get into this reserve.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Now ants -- most ants, including these, don't see very well.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
but they mostly work by smell.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
about ant queens isn't true --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
to tell the ants outside what to do,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So when I first set out to work on task allocation,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
my first question was, "What's the relationship

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
between the ants doing different tasks?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing?"

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
was somehow dedicated to its task from birth

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and sort of performed independently of the others,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
knowing its place on the assembly line.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?"

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So I did experiments where I changed one thing.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
This is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Here it is about 40 minutes later.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And what I wanted to know was, "OK,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited --

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So here's some blue nest maintenance workers.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And lately we've gotten more sophisticated

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and we have this three-color system.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We started out with model airplane paint

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and they work really well.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And so just to summarize the result,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
well it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, if I change the numbers performing one task,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
it changes the numbers performing another.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So for example, if I make a mess

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
then I see fewer ants out foraging.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And the second result, which was surprising to a lot of people,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
was that ants actually switch tasks.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So for example, if I put out extra food, everybody else --

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
they become foragers.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
The nest maintenance workers become foragers.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
The patrollers become foragers.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Like I just said, if there is more food to collect, the patrollers, the midden workers,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
If there's more patrolling to do --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
so I created a disturbance, so extra patrollers were needed --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
But if more nest maintenance work is needed --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
for example, if I put out a bunch of toothpicks --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So foraging acts as a sink, and the ants inside the nest act as a source.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And finally, it looks like each ant is deciding

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
moment to moment whether to be active or not.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
it's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
But the foragers somehow decide not to come out.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And here was the most intriguing result: the task allocation.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
This process changes with colony age, and it changes like this.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
When I do these experiments with older colonies --

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
so ones that are five years or older --

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
they're much more consistent from one time to another

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and much more homeostatic. The worse things get,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the more I hassle them, the more they act like undisturbed colonies.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Whereas the young, small colonies --

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It could be this year, or this year.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So, the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
are not any older than the ants in the younger colony.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It's not due to the experience of older, wiser ants.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Instead, something about the organization

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
must be changing as the colony gets older.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And the obvious thing that's changing is its size.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So since I've had this result, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
what kinds of decision rules -- very simple, local, probably olfactory, chemical

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
rules could an ant could be using, since no ant can assess the global situation --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that would have the outcome that I see,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
these predictable dynamics, in who does what task.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And it would change as the colony gets larger.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
They smell with their antennae.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
When one ant touches another, it's smelling it,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And so what the message is, is not any message

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that they transmit from one ant to another, but the pattern.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
The pattern itself is the message.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
But first you might be wondering:

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
how is it that an ant can tell, for example, I'm a forager.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I expect to meet another forager every so often.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I'm less likely to forage.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So it has to know the difference between

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
a forager and a nest maintenance worker.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And we've learned that, in this species --

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and I suspect in others as well --

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
these hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
is different as ants perform different tasks.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And we've done experiments that show that

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
that's because the longer an ant stays outside,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons --

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And we've just recently demonstrated this

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
as they would to contact with real ants.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So I want now to show you a bit of film --

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and this will start out, first of all, showing you the nest entrance.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
They've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
each ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
In the beginning you see the ants

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But the idea is that the ants are in there,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it --

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
a stream of contacts with other ants.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And the pattern of these interactions determines

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
whether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Each ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
to decide whether to go out on their next trip,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
are contacting the ants coming in.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
It's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
The first is that the experience of the ant -- of each ant -- can't be very predictable.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
And the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So, we do a lot of simulation and modeling, and also experimental work,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
in the aggregate, produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Again, I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
In fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
because they never seem to be doing anything

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
So it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts, perfection arises.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
But it works pretty well.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Ants have been around for several hundred million years.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
They cover the earth, except for Antarctica.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Something that they're doing is clearly successful enough

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
that this pattern of haphazard contacts, in the aggregate,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns --

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
this network of interaction patterns --

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
So the one thing, though, that I want you to remember about this

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
is that these patterns of interactions

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony --

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
like "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds."

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
But in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So this is the kind of rule that, as the colony develops and gets older and larger,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Thank you.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
(Applause)
