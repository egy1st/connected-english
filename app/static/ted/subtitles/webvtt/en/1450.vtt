00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.355
This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain.

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:06.267
It's a diagram of the visual system.

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:09.017
And some things look very familiar today.

00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:13.384
Two eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:15.504
There's a very large nose

00:00:15.504 --> 00:00:18.821
that doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular.

00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:20.521
And if we compare this

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.595
to more recent representations of the visual system,

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:25.552
you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:27.125
over the intervening thousand years.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.090
And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.571
rather than just looking at its overall shape.

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:36.550
Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.729
and all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.125
You really would be kind of out of luck.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.167
You want to be able to open it up, crack it open,

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:46.011
look at the wiring inside.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.875
And up until a little more than a century ago,

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.875
nobody was able to do that with the brain.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.755
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.707
And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull

00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:56.396
and you cut a thin slice of it,

00:00:56.396 --> 00:00:58.894
put it under even a very powerful microscope,

00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:00.075
there's nothing there.

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:01.688
It's gray, formless.

00:01:01.688 --> 00:01:04.292
There's no structure. It won't tell you anything.

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:07.146
And this all changed in the late 19th century.

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:11.021
Suddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed

00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:13.833
and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:15.846
The computer was cracked open.

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:18.702
So what really launched modern neuroscience

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:20.667
was a stain called the Golgi stain.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.548
And it works in a very particular way.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:25.658
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue,

00:01:25.658 --> 00:01:28.690
it somehow only stains about one percent of them.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.032
It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.

00:01:32.032 --> 00:01:34.704
If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.

00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:36.750
So somehow it shows what's there.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.417
Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal,

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:42.262
who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience,

00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:46.159
applied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this,

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.917
and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:52.531
And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer,

00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:54.542
this is the transistor.

00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:56.617
And very quickly Cajal realized

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.954
that neurons don't operate alone,

00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:00.792
but rather make connections with others

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:03.298
that form circuits just like in a computer.

00:02:03.298 --> 00:02:06.689
Today, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons,

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.456
they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.

00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:10.606
And there's several ways of doing this.

00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:12.333
But one of the most popular ones

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:14.425
involves green fluorescent protein.

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.084
Now green fluorescent protein,

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:19.229
which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish,

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.467
is very useful.

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:23.105
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:24.780
and deliver it to a cell,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.527
that cell will glow green --

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:30.273
or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein,

00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:31.937
you get a cell to glow many different colors.

00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:33.458
And so coming back to the brain,

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:37.258
this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:38.808
And it's so called, of course,

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:42.420
because all of these neurons are glowing different colors.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.871
Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify

00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:48.915
individual molecular components of neurons, molecules,

00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:50.713
rather than the entire cell.

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:52.419
And there's several ways of doing this,

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.888
but one of the most popular ones

00:02:53.888 --> 00:02:56.083
involves using antibodies.

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:57.420
And you're familiar, of course,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.371
with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.

00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.789
But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.339
because they can recognize specific molecules,

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:07.458
like, for example, the coat protein

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.846
of a virus that's invading the body.

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:11.891
And researchers have used this fact

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.216
in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain,

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:18.856
recognize specific substructures of the cell

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:21.100
and identify them individually.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.125
And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful,

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.031
but they're also very powerful.

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:27.667
They have great explanatory power.

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:29.757
This, for example, is an antibody staining

00:03:29.757 --> 00:03:33.277
against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.

00:03:33.277 --> 00:03:34.958
And you've heard of serotonin, of course,

00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.785
in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.193
You've heard of SSRIs,

00:03:39.193 --> 00:03:42.090
which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.980
And in order to understand how serotonin works,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.056
it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:49.652
And antibody stainings like this one

00:03:49.652 --> 00:03:53.198
can be used to understand that sort of question.

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:55.756
I'd like to leave you with the following thought:

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:58.366
Green fluorescent protein and antibodies

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:01.373
are both totally natural products at the get-go.

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:04.152
They were evolved by nature

00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:06.719
in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason,

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:11.102
or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.

00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:14.119
And only much later did scientists come onto the scene

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.142
and say, "Hey, these are tools,

00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:18.255
these are functions that we could use

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:20.263
in our own research tool palette."

00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:23.891
And instead of applying feeble human minds

00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:25.775
to designing these tools from scratch,

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:28.679
there were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:31.915
developed and refined steadily for millions of years

00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:33.615
by the greatest engineer of all.

00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:34.877
Thank you.

00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:37.415
(Applause)
