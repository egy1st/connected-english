00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:04.342
Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:06.181
to say, "I exist."

00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:11.174
Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.531
to say, "They exist."

00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:18.046
From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine,

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:20.456
the rooftops of Kenya

00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:22.344
to the favelas of Rio,

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:26.087
paper and glue -- as easy as that.

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:28.306
I asked a question last year:

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:30.581
Can art change the world?

00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:32.583
Well let me tell you,

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:36.323
in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year,

00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:39.517
because the Arab Spring is still spreading,

00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:42.827
the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:45.820
The Occupy movement found a voice,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.292
and I still have to speak English constantly.

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:51.125
So there has been a lot of change.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.260
So when I had my TED wish last year,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.423
I said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.091
You are going to take the photos.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.671
You're going to send them to me.

00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.888
I'm going to print them and send them back to you.

00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:07.370
Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.260
for you to place your own statement.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.729
This is Inside Out.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.896
One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.

00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:19.912
Those are the kind of posters, let me show you.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:22.167
And we keep sending more every day.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:23.611
This is the size.

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.517
Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:31.048
This one was from Haiti.

00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:33.500
When I launched my wish last year,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.925
hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:40.142
But I say it has to be

00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:43.596
under the conditions I've always worked:

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:47.858
no credit, no logos, no sponsoring.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:52.208
A week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:54.662
and empower the people on the ground

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:56.208
who wanted to change the world.

00:01:56.208 --> 00:02:01.020
These are the people I want to talk about to you today.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.794
Two weeks after my speech, in Tunisia,

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:10.545
hundreds of portraits were made.

00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:14.792
And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:16.292
[with] their own photos.

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:19.125
Boom! This is what happened.

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.875
Slim and his friends went through the country

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:23.250
and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.413
to show the diversity in the country.

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:30.496
They really make Inside Out their own project.

00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:34.042
Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station,

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:35.546
and what you see on the ground

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:41.707
are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police.

00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:46.417
Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia.

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:50.940
He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.000
and stood there with the photos

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.760
to say, "We have rights."

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.291
They used Inside Out as a platform for protest.

00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:01.208
Karachi, Pakistan.

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:03.008
Sharmeen is actually here.

00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:06.373
She organized a TEDx action out there

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:09.404
and made all the unseen faces of the city

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:11.667
on the walls in her town.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:13.998
And I want to thank her today.

00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:17.773
North Dakota. Standing Rock Nation,

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:23.508
in this Turtle Island, [unclear name] from the Dakota Lakota tribe

00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:26.865
wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here.

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:30.500
The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.475
He pasted up portraits all over his reservation.

00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:35.342
And he's here also today.

00:03:35.342 --> 00:03:38.842
Each time I get a wall in New York,

00:03:38.842 --> 00:03:43.863
I use his photos to continue spreading the project.

00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:46.917
Juarez: You've heard of the border --

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:49.750
one of the most dangerous borders in the world.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.523
Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers

00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:57.308
and covered the entire border.

00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:59.333
Do you know what it takes to do this?

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:03.435
People, energy, make the glue, organize the team.

00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:05.554
It was amazing.

00:04:05.554 --> 00:04:08.354
While in Iran at the same time

00:04:08.354 --> 00:04:10.717
Abololo -- of course a nickname --

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:13.662
has pasted one single face of a woman

00:04:13.662 --> 00:04:17.261
to show his resistance against the government.

00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:21.971
I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action.

00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.573
There are tons of school projects.

00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:28.223
Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.

00:04:28.223 --> 00:04:30.123
Education is so essential.

00:04:30.123 --> 00:04:33.458
Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them,

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:35.133
they paste them on the school.

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:37.125
Here they even got the help of the firemen.

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:40.900
There should be even more schools doing this kind of project.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.735
Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:49.770
So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.981
You go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo,

00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:56.104
30 seconds later take it from the side, you're ready to rock.

00:04:56.104 --> 00:04:59.066
Thousands of people use them

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:03.237
and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:05.167
and then walk in the street.

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:09.244
This is march, the 450,000 march -- beginning of September.

00:05:09.244 --> 00:05:11.554
They were all holding their photo as a statement.

00:05:11.554 --> 00:05:15.583
On the other side, people were wrapping up streets, buildings.

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:17.085
It's everywhere.

00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:20.104
Come on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there.

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:24.792
These projects took thousands of actions in one year,

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:27.958
making hundreds of thousands of people participating,

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.633
creating millions of views.

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:38.738
This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:42.600
So back to the question, "Can art change the world?"

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.456
Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning.

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:49.186
But maybe we should change the question.

00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:51.725
Can art change people's lives?

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:55.600
From what I've seen this year, yes.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.283
And you know what? It's just the beginning.

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:01.056
Let's turn the world inside out together.

00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:02.464
Thank you.

00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:08.238
(Applause)
