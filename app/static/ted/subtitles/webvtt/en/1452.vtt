WEBVTT

00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:05.500
So, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.631
Forty-two million people

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:10.741
were displaced by natural disasters in 2010.

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:13.812
Now, there was nothing particularly special about 2010,

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:17.108
because, on average, 31 and a half million people

00:00:17.108 --> 00:00:20.211
are displaced by natural disasters every single year.

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:22.759
Now, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that,

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.553
you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:28.973
exotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:32.096
right here in the United States every single year.

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:35.111
Last year alone, 99 federally declared disasters

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:37.357
were on file with FEMA,

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:40.548
from Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama,

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:44.939
to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:47.004
Now, how does the most powerful country in the world

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.103
handle these displaced people?

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:51.532
They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings

00:00:51.532 --> 00:00:53.700
in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.715
and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena,

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:00.226
or a gymnasium.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.288
So obviously there's a massive housing gap,

00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:06.196
and this really upset me, because academia tells you

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:08.485
after a major disaster, there's typically about

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.824
an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover,

00:01:11.824 --> 00:01:13.401
start the recovery process,

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:15.766
but what most people don't realize is that on average

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.830
it takes 45 to 60 days or more

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.692
for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.

00:01:21.692 --> 00:01:25.310
Before that time, people are left to their own devices.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.686
So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way

00:01:28.686 --> 00:01:30.836
to actually fill this gap.

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:33.390
This actually became my creative obsession.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.095
I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:41.837
just focusing particularly on this problem.

00:01:41.837 --> 00:01:43.196
So I started sketching.

00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:45.220
Two days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.068
and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this,

00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:50.226
and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form,

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.452
I started sketching digitally on the computer,

00:01:52.452 --> 00:01:55.921
but it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there.

00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:58.060
I started experimenting, making models,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.838
talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback,

00:02:00.838 --> 00:02:03.749
and refining, and I kept on refining and refining

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.805
for nights and weekends for over five years.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:10.290
Now, my obsession ended up driving me to create

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.575
full-size prototypes in my own backyard — (Laughter) —

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:14.941
and actually spending my own personal savings on

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.190
everything from tooling to patents

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.806
and a variety of other costs,

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.670
but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.332
that can react to any situation or disaster.

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:28.431
It can be put up in any environment,

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:32.374
from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields,

00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:34.377
because it doesn't require any special setup

00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:36.559
or specialty tools.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.279
Now, at the foundation and kind of the core

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.213
of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit,

00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:43.646
which is just the individual shelter module.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:45.378
And though it's light, light enough that you can actually

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:47.534
lift it by hand and move it around,

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:51.233
and it actually sleeps four people.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.901
And you can arrange these things as kind of more

00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:56.676
for encampments and more of a city grid type layout,

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.571
or you can circle the wagons, essentially,

00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:00.582
and form these circular pods out of them,

00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:03.038
which give you this semi-private communal area

00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:05.807
for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:07.906
trapped inside these units.

00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:10.331
Now this fundamentally changes

00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.489
the way we respond to disasters,

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.467
because gone are the horrid conditions

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:17.192
inside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people

00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:19.204
are crammed on these cots inside.

00:03:19.204 --> 00:03:24.791
Now we have instant neighborhoods outside.

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.766
So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:30.008
like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.933
so we get extremely efficient transportation

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.184
and storage out of them.

00:03:35.184 --> 00:03:39.820
In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.994
This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:47.978
faster than any other housing option available today.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:49.967
But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there,

00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:51.856
so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:54.164
actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving,

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:55.676
so the same unit can now be used

00:03:55.676 --> 00:03:58.901
for an office or storage location.

00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:02.619
The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.488
a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control,

00:04:05.488 --> 00:04:07.954
or a connector module that would allow you to actually

00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:10.339
connect multiple units together, which gives you

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:14.005
larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces,

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:16.317
so now this same kit of parts, this same unit

00:04:16.317 --> 00:04:20.960
can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.067
or an office, a living space and secure storage.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:30.134
Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:32.138
So the first idea I had, initially, was just

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.994
to go the federal and state governments and go,

00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:36.657
"Here, take it, for free."

00:04:36.657 --> 00:04:38.640
But I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.898
doesn't really work like that." (Laughter)

00:04:40.898 --> 00:04:44.883
Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:47.726
to kind of help consult and get this idea going

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.829
along with the government, but then I was told,

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:52.304
"Son, our government looks to private sector

00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:53.901
for things like this."

00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:56.891
Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go

00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:59.311
to private corporations that would have this mutually shared

00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:02.214
benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations

00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:06.495
that my personal passion project was not a brand fit

00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:09.073
because they didn't want their logos stamped

00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:11.497
across the ghettos of Haiti.

00:05:11.497 --> 00:05:17.433
Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.)

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:21.850
So I decided, kind of told myself,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.725
"Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself." (Laughter)

00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:29.905
Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:33.059
our Milan office for a few months, so I was like,

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.796
what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar,

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:38.996
and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:43.016
with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers.

00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:44.470
And we found through this whole process, we found

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.844
this great little manufacturer in Virginia,

00:05:46.844 --> 00:05:48.997
and if his body language is any indication,

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:51.076
that's the owner — (Laughter) — of what it's like

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:53.169
for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer,

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.372
you've got to see what happens here. (Laughter)

00:05:56.372 --> 00:05:58.628
But G.S. Industries was fantastic.

00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:03.008
They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.

00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:06.155
So now we have prototypes that can show that four people

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:08.571
can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably

00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.068
than a tent could ever provide.

00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:14.818
And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.

00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:16.271
Now, a funny thing started happening.

00:06:16.271 --> 00:06:18.739
Other people started to believe in what we were doing,

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:20.656
and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar

00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:22.940
space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.046
was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.

00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:28.707
So now we had a hangar space to work in,

00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:31.789
and prototypes to demo with.

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.356
So in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements,

00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:38.017
been awarded one patent, filed our second patent,

00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:40.700
talked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.948
and its consultants to rave reviews,

00:06:42.948 --> 00:06:45.131
and then started talking to some other people who requested

00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:47.622
information, this little group called the United Nations.

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:49.727
And on top of that, now we have

00:06:49.727 --> 00:06:52.371
a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.862
and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps,

00:06:55.862 --> 00:06:58.294
mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup

00:06:58.294 --> 00:07:00.879
and the Olympics.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:07.971
So, in closing, on this whole thing here

00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:12.627
is hopefully very soon we will not have to

00:07:12.627 --> 00:07:14.548
respond to these painful phone calls that we get

00:07:14.548 --> 00:07:16.544
after disasters where we don't really have anything

00:07:16.544 --> 00:07:18.932
to sell or give you yet.

00:07:18.932 --> 00:07:21.364
Hopefully very soon we will be there,

00:07:21.364 --> 00:07:23.571
because we are destined,

00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:27.677
obsessed with making it real.

00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:30.018
Thank you. (Applause)
