WEBVTT

00:00:00.812 --> 00:00:03.536
In the next ten minutes,
we will immerse ourselves

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.143
in an amazing and beautiful marine world

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:07.874
that's very often overlooked.

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:10.868
I'd like to take you
on a journey into the sea,

00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:14.476
looking at it from the perspective
of its smallest inhabitants:

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.868
the microbes.

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:18.292
My goal is that after this short journey,

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:22.349
you'll share my amazement
at how deeply connected our lives are

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:24.175
to these microscopic creatures

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.372
and also perhaps my concern

00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:29.164
that these relationships
are often neglected

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:32.753
when it comes to making decisions
and policies about our oceans.

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:37.560
When you look out on a clear blue ocean,

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:41.610
you're actually gazing at
a microbial soup full of vibrant life.

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:45.435
What you see here
are marine bacteria buzzing about

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:48.073
and exploring other members
of the marine food web.

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:51.463
To emphasize how small
this world really is,

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:56.314
I've added a white line
to most of my slides

00:00:56.338 --> 00:00:59.708
that shows you the thickness
of a single strand of human hair --

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:00.890
very tiny.

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:05.923
An average teaspoon of clean seawater
has five million bacteria

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:08.006
and 50 million viruses in it.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.292
If I were to scoop up
two gallons of seawater,

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:13.787
there would be more bacteria
in those two gallons

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:16.051
than there are people on this planet.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.939
Take just a moment and think about

00:01:18.963 --> 00:01:21.028
how many gallons might make up an ocean.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.799
Or maybe I've already made
your stomach turn,

00:01:23.823 --> 00:01:27.123
as you think of all of the seawater
we've each accidentally swallowed

00:01:27.147 --> 00:01:28.373
over the years.

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:31.375
But luckily, we rarely get sick
from that seawater,

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.345
because most marine microbes
are working for us,

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.564
not against us.

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:38.876
One of my favorite examples
is that they provide

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.658
half of the oxygen we breathe.

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.788
In middle school, we all learn
to thank the trees.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:47.348
And admittedly, they may be
more huggable than the microbes.

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:50.344
But it turns out
that land plants only create

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:52.401
a quarter of the oxygen we breathe.

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:55.401
Another quarter comes
from macroalgae like kelp

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:58.340
and a full 50% from the microbes.

00:01:58.364 --> 00:01:59.712
Take a deep breath in.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:01.906
Thank the trees.

00:02:02.672 --> 00:02:04.291
Take another deep breath in.

00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:06.719
Thank the macroalgae.

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:10.817
Your next two breaths --
tip your hats to the microbes.

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:12.674
This picture is of a bacterium

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:16.878
that happens to be the single most
abundant photosynthesizer

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.070
on our planet.

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:19.788
It's called, "Prochlorococcus,"

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:25.603
and this is oceans' oxygen-producing
powerhouse and, I might argue,

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:29.397
one of the most amazing discoveries
of recent marine microbiology.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.974
We didn't know it existed until 1988.

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:36.185
All of human history has depended
on this little microbe

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.085
for the oxygen they breathe every day,
no matter where or when they lived.

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.265
And we've only been aware
of that relationship for a mere 24 years.

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:46.979
I find that astounding.

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.567
How many more critical
relationships are out there

00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:51.075
that we have yet to discover?

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.225
I see our relationship with marine
microbes as parallel in many ways

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.056
to the relationship we have
with microbes in our gut.

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.146
We've all experienced the wrath
of unhappy gut microbes

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.493
at one point or another,

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:06.022
perhaps food poisoning or tainted water.

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:10.240
But we may be less aware of the connection
we have with marine microbes

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:15.450
and the physical discomforts we can feel
when those communities change.

00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:19.828
As an extreme example: the disease
cholera is caused by a bacterium

00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:21.500
that thrives in the ocean.

00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:25.203
So while most marine microbes
are indeed helping us,

00:03:25.227 --> 00:03:27.158
there do remain plenty that are not.

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.967
Our relationship with the ocean,
much like our gut,

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.537
is dependent on the right
balance of microbes.

00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:38.477
The old phrase, "You are what you eat"
applies to our ocean microbes as well.

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:42.054
To give you a sense of what
an overfed ocean may look like,

00:03:42.078 --> 00:03:44.611
here are two examples
of me sampling seawater.

00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:47.736
On your left, it's a clean coral reef,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.677
and on your right is
a nearly dead coral reef

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:54.593
that has a very intense fish farming
operation in the waters there.

00:03:54.617 --> 00:03:58.693
You'll notice I'm only smiling
in one of these two pictures,

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:02.466
and in the other one my dive buddy
had to be a whole lot closer

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.697
to capture that image.

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:09.115
So if we were to take a drop of seawater
from each of these samples

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.859
and put it under the microscope,

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:14.071
this is what the bacteria and viral
communities would look like.

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:17.803
So again, clean reef on your left,
fish farm reef on your right.

00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:21.640
As we all have had a feeling of discomfort

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:24.150
from imbalanced gut microbes,

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:26.384
a fish swimming through
a part of the ocean

00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:28.173
that has been overfed in this way --

00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:31.388
in this case, by intense aquaculture,
but it could be a sewage spill

00:04:31.412 --> 00:04:34.623
or fertilizer runoff or any number
of other sources --

00:04:34.647 --> 00:04:36.907
that fish will feel
the physical discomforts

00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.377
of the ocean microbes being out of whack.

00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:41.491
There may be less oxygen present,

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.471
there may be more pathogens there,

00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:46.403
and there may be toxins
produced by some of these microbes.

00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:50.688
The bottom line is that
from their tiny-scale existence,

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:53.915
these tiny microbes have
a very large-scale power

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.981
to control how our ocean smells,

00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.235
how it tastes,

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.451
how it feels

00:04:58.475 --> 00:04:59.801
and how it looks.

00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:04.882
If you take one idea away
from my talk today, let it be this:

00:05:05.883 --> 00:05:09.922
we have an incredibly important
relationship with these marine microbes

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:12.442
that have very large-scale consequences,

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:14.813
and we're just barely
beginning to understand

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:16.555
what that relationship looks like

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:18.172
and how it may be changing.

00:05:18.196 --> 00:05:22.673
Just as a physician will have trouble
curing a disease of unknown cause,

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.295
we will have similar trouble
restoring ocean health

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.401
without understanding the microbes better.

00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:30.909
They are the invisible engineers
that control the chemistry of the ocean

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:33.111
and therefore, what creatures
can live there,

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:35.440
whether or not it's safe
for us to swim there

00:05:35.464 --> 00:05:38.033
and all of the other
characteristics we sense

00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:40.232
with our eyes, noses and taste buds.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:41.656
And the more we pay attention

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.733
to these small but very numerous
members of the ocean,

00:05:44.757 --> 00:05:48.372
the more we're learning
they do indeed respond to human actions,

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:50.487
such as in this fish farm example.

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:53.844
Now, as the past few slides
about coral reefs may have suggested,

00:05:53.868 --> 00:05:56.478
I do indeed spend much
of my time as a researcher

00:05:56.502 --> 00:05:59.041
thinking about human-microbe interactions,

00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:00.617
specifically on coral reefs.

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:02.522
It turns out,

00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:05.824
we're not alone in having
our own protective community of microbes.

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:09.478
Corals, along with most other
organisms on this planet,

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:12.203
have their own protective
communities as well.

00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:16.679
However, rather than keeping theirs
on the inside as we do in our gut,

00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:20.605
they keep theirs on the outside,
to protect them from their surroundings

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.935
So what you're seeing here
is a three-dimensional image

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:28.292
of a live spot on a living coral
with all of its living bacteria,

00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:30.419
that I took with some
exciting technology --

00:06:30.443 --> 00:06:33.909
a high-speed laser-scanning
confocal microscope.

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:37.018
All of the red circles
are the symbiotic algae

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:39.005
that live inside the coral tissue,

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.683
turning sunlight and into sugars
they both can use,

00:06:42.707 --> 00:06:47.455
and all of the little blue dots
are the protective bacteria.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.272
So when I use image analysis software

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:54.552
to highlight the outer layer
of the coral in white,

00:06:54.576 --> 00:06:57.491
you can see that there are still
some tiny little blue dots

00:06:57.515 --> 00:06:59.071
above that layer.

00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:02.421
And those bacteria are sitting
in a mucus layer,

00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:05.527
which is also part
of the coral's protective layer.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:07.449
From the bigger perspective,

00:07:07.473 --> 00:07:09.928
I spend my time thinking
about these relationships,

00:07:09.952 --> 00:07:13.557
because too many reefs are going
from looking like the picture on your left

00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:15.010
to the picture on your right.

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.195
Believe it or not,

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:19.761
the picture on your right remains
a very popular tourist snorkeling spot

00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:20.992
on the island of Maui,

00:07:21.016 --> 00:07:24.637
even though it's lost most of its coral
cover over the past decade or so.

00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:27.695
Corals are getting sick
all around the globe at alarming rates,

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.960
and we really don't know how or why.

00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:36.157
I see the microbes on the coral reefs,
both the good ones and the bad ones,

00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:40.915
trying to link their micro-scale
behaviors to this big picture

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:44.631
of: How do we help the reef
that looks like the right

00:07:44.655 --> 00:07:47.270
back towards something
that looks more like the left?

00:07:47.294 --> 00:07:49.849
Or: How do we stop
coral disease from spreading?

00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:53.184
Just over a year ago,
no one had ever seen a view like this.

00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:58.520
This video is a prime example
of making the invisible visible.

00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:01.946
We're looking at a side view
of the same coral as before,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.234
where the protective layer
meets the seawater;

00:08:04.258 --> 00:08:05.849
so, seawater on your right,

00:08:05.873 --> 00:08:07.105
coral on your left.

00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:11.522
It's incredibly exciting to me
that we can finally see these bacteria

00:08:11.546 --> 00:08:15.359
in real life, in real time,
at their micro scale,

00:08:15.383 --> 00:08:18.316
and learn how they interact
with the world around them.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.841
Ecologists all over the world
are used to being able

00:08:20.865 --> 00:08:22.209
to grab a pair of binoculars

00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:25.571
and go out and observe
what their study creatures do each day.

00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:28.405
But microbial ecologists
have desperately needed

00:08:28.429 --> 00:08:30.023
breakthroughs in technology,

00:08:30.047 --> 00:08:32.020
such as with this fast confocal,

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:33.784
to make similar observations.

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:38.763
I work to find ways that cutting-edge
technologies like this

00:08:38.787 --> 00:08:41.341
can help make the unseen seeable,

00:08:41.928 --> 00:08:45.577
to see marine bacteria in action
and learn how they behave.

00:08:46.023 --> 00:08:48.876
In doing so, we can learn how they respond

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.535
to our actions and our behaviors
and the environment around them

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:55.269
in ways that will help us
better manage our oceans.

00:08:55.293 --> 00:09:02.217
Another example of how I'm doing this
is by using microfluidics

00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:06.491
to study specifically how pathogens
behave in the ocean.

00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:08.956
The basic idea behind microfluidics

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.677
is that you can use
nanofabrication techniques

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:15.790
to recreate or mimic
the conditions bacteria experience

00:09:15.814 --> 00:09:18.422
at their own tiny scale in the ocean.

00:09:18.446 --> 00:09:23.434
What you see here is a microfluidic
chamber on a microscope slide

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:26.069
with a microscope lens underneath it.

00:09:26.093 --> 00:09:30.497
We use high-speed video microscopy
to record bacteria behavior.

00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:33.610
The colored tubing is where
bacteria and seawater flow

00:09:33.634 --> 00:09:35.013
in and out of the device.

00:09:35.037 --> 00:09:38.993
And it's using a device like this
that I recently discovered

00:09:39.017 --> 00:09:42.062
that a known coral pathogen
actually has the ability

00:09:42.086 --> 00:09:44.982
to sniff around the seawater
and hunt for corals.

00:09:46.547 --> 00:09:48.624
Here's the video of in action.

00:09:48.648 --> 00:09:53.403
You'll see all of the pathogens
which are the tiny green dots on the left

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:57.196
start detecting the coral mucus I put
on the right side of the channel,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.274
and they swim quickly
over in that direction and stay there.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:03.523
Up until now, it was thought

00:10:03.547 --> 00:10:07.690
that a pathogen would need some good luck
to find its host in the ocean.

00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:11.873
But simply by watching
and observing, we can learn

00:10:11.897 --> 00:10:15.565
that these bacteria are very well adapted
to seeking out their victims.

00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:19.540
These micro-channels are bringing
us closer than ever before

00:10:19.564 --> 00:10:22.894
to understanding how bacteria
navigate that big blue ocean.

00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:29.015
It turns out that this pathogen
can even detect the coral mucus

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:31.818
when I dilute it 20,000 fold.

00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:38.509
So these bacteria are very well adapted
to hunting down these corals.

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:42.353
I'm currently testing
different environmental conditions

00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:46.510
to see what scenarios make
this pathogen more or less capable

00:10:46.534 --> 00:10:47.887
of hunting corals.

00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:50.550
By learning more
about what triggers the hunt,

00:10:50.574 --> 00:10:52.201
we should be able to find ways

00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:54.717
to help slow down or prevent this disease.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.998
There's also some evidence

00:10:57.022 --> 00:11:01.999
that the healthy microbes on the coral
can fight off the pathogen

00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:03.759
if the conditions are right.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:08.502
So, one final image of a coral
and its healthy bacteria.

00:11:08.526 --> 00:11:11.828
I hope you've enjoyed this short journey
into our microbial oceans

00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:14.133
and that the next time you
look out at the sea,

00:11:14.157 --> 00:11:17.429
you'll take in a deep breath
of fresh ocean air and wonder:

00:11:17.453 --> 00:11:20.200
What else are all
of the unseen microbes doing

00:11:20.224 --> 00:11:22.230
to keep us and our oceans healthy?

00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:23.951
Thank you.
