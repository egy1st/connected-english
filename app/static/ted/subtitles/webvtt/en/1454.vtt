00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:03.181
Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin.

00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:06.829
And I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer,

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:08.871
Roy Chapman Andrews.

00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:11.715
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History,

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:15.815
Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions,

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.550
like here in the Gobi Desert.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.958
He was quite a figure.

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.632
He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.829
And when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin,

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.962
I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.531
And I'm here to tell you,

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.235
if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED,

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:35.067
it'll be trying to hold the attention

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:38.960
of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.839
Don't try that one.

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.381
At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions,

00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:47.683
but there was one that's really stuck with me since then.

00:00:47.683 --> 00:00:49.600
There was a young girl who stood up,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.931
and she asked the question:

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:52.979
"Where should we explore?"

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.110
I think there's a sense that many of us have

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.929
that the great age of exploration on Earth is over,

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.461
that for the next generation

00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:02.879
they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.429
in order to find something significant to explore.

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:07.929
But is that really the case?

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:10.925
Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:12.650
left here on Earth?

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.833
It sort of made me think back

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.583
to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:19.917
This is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Beijerinck.

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:22.375
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:24.740
of tobacco mosaic disease.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.292
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:31.229
and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.795
And he reached the point

00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:35.806
where he felt that there must be something out there

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:39.250
that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known --

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.294
bacteria, at the time.

00:01:41.294 --> 00:01:44.682
He came up with a name for his mystery agent.

00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:46.708
He called it the virus --

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:48.983
Latin for "poison."

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.760
And in uncovering viruses,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.381
Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.375
We now know that viruses make up the majority

00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.667
of the genetic information on our planet,

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:01.333
more than the genetic information

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.083
of all other forms of life combined.

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:06.177
And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications

00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:07.431
associated with this world --

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.833
things like the eradication of smallpox,

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:13.488
the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer,

00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:17.087
which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:18.760
And Beijerinck's discovery,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.481
this was not something that occurred 500 years ago.

00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:24.160
It was a little over 100 years ago

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.580
that Beijerinck discovered viruses.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.467
So basically we had automobiles,

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:30.710
but we were unaware of the forms of life

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.716
that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:35.898
We now have these amazing tools

00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:38.208
to allow us to explore the unseen world --

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.221
things like deep sequencing,

00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.785
which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:46.875
and look at individual genomes from a particular species,

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.370
but to look at entire metagenomes,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.550
the communities of teeming microorganisms in, on and around us

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.071
and to document all of the genetic information in these species.

00:02:57.071 --> 00:02:58.542
We can apply these techniques

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:03.052
to things from soil to skin and everything in between.

00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:06.042
In my organization we now do this on a regular basis

00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:08.421
to identify the causes of outbreaks

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:11.710
that are unclear exactly what causes them.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.042
And just to give you a sense of how this works,

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:17.042
imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you.

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:18.404
And this is something we commonly do

00:03:18.404 --> 00:03:21.398
to look for respiratory viruses like influenza.

00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:23.250
The first thing we would see

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.300
is a tremendous amount of genetic information.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.708
And if we started looking into that genetic information,

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.043
we'd see a number of usual suspects out there --

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:32.836
of course, a lot of human genetic information,

00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:35.708
but also bacterial and viral information,

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:38.875
mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:41.787
But we'd also see something very, very surprising.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.862
As we started to look at this information,

00:03:43.862 --> 00:03:48.208
we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.125
doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before --

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:54.296
no plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria.

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:57.800
Basically we have no clue what this is.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.920
And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.635
a few of us have actually begun to call this information

00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:08.037
biological dark matter.

00:04:08.037 --> 00:04:10.985
We know it's not anything that we've seen before;

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:14.092
it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:16.810
right within our own genetic information.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.187
And there's a lot of it.

00:04:18.187 --> 00:04:21.673
If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot

00:04:21.673 --> 00:04:23.292
of biological dark matter,

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:25.042
if we looked at your gut,

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:28.738
up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter.

00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:30.977
And even in the relatively sterile blood,

00:04:30.977 --> 00:04:33.958
around one to two percent of this information is dark matter --

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:38.706
can't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before.

00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:41.333
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:44.585
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:46.658
But as they become more and more accurate,

00:04:46.658 --> 00:04:50.246
we've determined that this information is a form of life,

00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:52.833
or at least some of it is a form of life.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:57.198
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter

00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:59.136
are really only in their infancy,

00:04:59.136 --> 00:05:02.813
there's a very, very exciting possibility that exists:

00:05:02.813 --> 00:05:06.292
that buried in this life, in this genetic information,

00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:10.780
are signatures of as of yet unidentified life.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.715
That as we explore these strings of A's, T's, C's and G's,

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:18.050
we may uncover a completely new class of life

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.462
that, like Beijerinck, will fundamentally change

00:05:20.462 --> 00:05:22.658
the way that we think about the nature of biology.

00:05:22.658 --> 00:05:27.087
That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us

00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:30.619
or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:33.513
or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.

00:05:33.513 --> 00:05:35.198
I'm pleased to announce that,

00:05:35.198 --> 00:05:40.140
along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.779
we're currently starting an initiative

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.752
to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life.

00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:47.896
A little over a hundred years ago,

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:50.600
people were unaware of viruses,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.839
the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.421
A hundred years from now, people may marvel

00:05:57.421 --> 00:06:00.875
that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:04.179
that literally was right under our noses.

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:07.502
It's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet

00:06:07.502 --> 00:06:10.583
and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there,

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:14.139
but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.144
Beijerinck and his kind

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:19.831
provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers --

00:06:19.831 --> 00:06:23.163
people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.

00:06:23.163 --> 00:06:26.958
And I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this:

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:31.187
Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.

00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:36.250
Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.369
There are unknowns all around us

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:40.750
and they're just waiting to be discovered.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.419
Thank you.

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.367
(Applause)
