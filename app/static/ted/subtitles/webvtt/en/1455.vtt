00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:04.222
I'm going to talk about religion.

00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:09.474
But it's a broad and very delicate subject,

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:11.145
so I have to limit myself.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:13.625
And therefore I will limit myself

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:18.034
to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality.

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:19.600
(Laughter)

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.160
This is a very serious talk.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.255
So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:28.600
It's when the young couple whisper,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.772
"Tonight we are going to make a baby."

00:00:31.772 --> 00:00:37.108
My talk will be about the impact of religions

00:00:37.108 --> 00:00:41.277
on the number of babies per woman.

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:42.942
This is indeed important,

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.472
because everyone understands

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:46.754
that there is some sort of limit

00:00:46.754 --> 00:00:49.982
on how many people we can be on this planet.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.929
And there are some people

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.348
who say that the world population is growing like this --

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:57.155
three billion in 1960,

00:00:57.155 --> 00:00:59.794
seven billion just last year --

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.340
and it will continue to grow

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.120
because there are religions that stop women from having few babies,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.523
and it may continue like this.

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:11.425
To what extent are these people right?

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:16.305
When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world,

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:20.480
and today, 2000, there's almost two billion.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.182
What has happened since,

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.877
and what do the experts predict will happen

00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:27.360
with the number of children during this century?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.978
This is a quiz. What do you think?

00:01:29.978 --> 00:01:33.880
Do you think it will decrease to one billion?

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.708
Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century?

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:41.425
Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years,

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:43.929
or will it continue in the same fast rate

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.418
and be four billion children up there?

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:49.843
I will tell you by the end of my speech.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:54.865
But now, what does religion have to do with it?

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:57.197
When you want to classify religion,

00:01:57.197 --> 00:01:58.728
it's more difficult than you think.

00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:01.932
You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this.

00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:07.465
It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion,

00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:09.237
but that's not detailed enough.

00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:13.046
So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia, we found this map.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:17.692
But that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism

00:02:17.692 --> 00:02:19.295
into many subgroups,

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:20.800
which was too detailed.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.218
Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map,

00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:26.591
and it looks like this.

00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:29.994
Each country's a bubble.

00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:33.418
The size is the population -- big China, big India here.

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:37.532
And the color now is the majority religion.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:40.763
It's the religion where more than 50 percent of the people

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:42.018
say that they belong.

00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:46.735
It's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries.

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:48.708
Islam is the majority religion

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:52.483
all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East,

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:54.763
Southern Europe and through Asia

00:02:54.763 --> 00:02:57.000
all the way to Indonesia.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.917
That's where we find Islamic majority.

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:04.720
And Christian majority religions, we see in these countries. They are blue.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.745
And that is most countries in America and Europe,

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:12.415
many countries in Africa and a few in Asia.

00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:15.095
The white here are countries which cannot be classified,

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:17.720
because one religion does not reach 50 percent

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.077
or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason.

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:22.837
So we were careful with that.

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:26.695
So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot.

00:03:26.695 --> 00:03:28.708
This is in 1960.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:32.240
And now I show the number of babies per woman here:

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.326
two, four or six --

00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:37.517
many babies, few babies.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:40.698
And here the income per person in comparable dollars.

00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:44.295
The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first

00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:45.965
before you get few babies.

00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:49.597
So low income here, high income there.

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:51.235
And indeed in 1960,

00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:53.972
you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies.

00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:56.246
The exception was Japan.

00:03:56.246 --> 00:03:59.483
Japan here was regarded as an exception.

00:03:59.483 --> 00:04:01.511
Otherwise it was only Christian countries.

00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:03.720
But there was also many Christian countries

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.292
that had six to seven babies per woman.

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:11.769
But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.942
And countries with Islam as the majority religion,

00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:20.572
all of them almost had six to seven children per woman,

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.997
irregardless of the income level.

00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:27.240
And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.160
Now let's see what has happened in the world.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.080
I start the world, and here we go.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.298
Now 1962 -- can you see they're getting a little richer,

00:04:34.298 --> 00:04:36.972
but the number of babies per woman is falling?

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:39.145
Look at China. They're falling fairly fast.

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:43.908
And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down,

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:48.871
as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range.

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.400
And when we enter into this century,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.760
you'll find more than half of mankind down here.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.686
And by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:04.000
who live in countries with about two children per woman.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.538
(Applause)

00:05:07.538 --> 00:05:11.498
It's a quite amazing development which has happened.

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:12.875
(Applause)

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:16.077
And these are countries from United States here,

00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:18.238
with $40,000 per capita,

00:05:18.238 --> 00:05:21.185
France, Russia, Iran,

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:24.837
Mexico, Turkey, Algeria,

00:05:24.837 --> 00:05:27.062
Indonesia, India

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:29.791
and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam,

00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:33.834
which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:36.991
and the same amount of babies per woman.

00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:40.222
I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman

00:05:40.222 --> 00:05:42.311
is surprisingly good in all countries.

00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:44.258
We get that from the census data.

00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:47.651
It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful.

00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:48.957
So what we can conclude

00:05:48.957 --> 00:05:51.738
is you don't have to get rich to have few children.

00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:54.080
It has happened across the world.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.658
And then when we look at religions,

00:05:56.658 --> 00:05:59.185
we can see that the Eastern religions,

00:05:59.185 --> 00:06:02.185
indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:04.080
that has more than three children.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.132
Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity,

00:06:08.132 --> 00:06:10.040
you see countries all the way.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.818
But there's no major difference.

00:06:11.818 --> 00:06:15.320
There's no major difference between these religions.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.671
There is a difference with income.

00:06:17.671 --> 00:06:21.600
The countries which have many babies per woman here,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.532
they have quite low income.

00:06:23.532 --> 00:06:26.963
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:29.625
But there are also countries here

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:33.742
like Guatemala, like Papua New Guinea,

00:06:33.742 --> 00:06:36.548
like Yemen and Afghanistan.

00:06:36.548 --> 00:06:40.425
Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo,

00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:43.875
which have suffered severe conflicts,

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.632
that they don't have fast population growth.

00:06:46.632 --> 00:06:48.409
It's the other way around.

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.302
In the world today, it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates

00:06:52.302 --> 00:06:54.538
that have the fastest population growth.

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:58.526
Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child.

00:06:58.526 --> 00:07:01.434
These countries have six children per woman.

00:07:01.434 --> 00:07:05.566
They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman.

00:07:05.566 --> 00:07:09.385
But 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million.

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:12.792
Congo will go from 60 to 120.

00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:15.683
That's where we have the fast population growth.

00:07:15.683 --> 00:07:20.028
And many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not.

00:07:20.028 --> 00:07:23.542
Let me compare Senegal, a Muslim dominated country,

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:26.000
with a Christian dominated country, Ghana.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.597
I take them backwards here to their independence,

00:07:29.597 --> 00:07:33.280
when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.378
Just look what they have done.

00:07:35.378 --> 00:07:36.929
It's an amazing improvement,

00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:39.166
from seven children per woman,

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:42.231
they've gone all the way down to between four and five.

00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:43.818
It's a tremendous improvement.

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:45.243
So what does it take?

00:07:45.243 --> 00:07:48.840
Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.329
You need to have children to survive.

00:07:51.329 --> 00:07:53.942
You need to get out of the deepest poverty

00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:57.520
so children are not of importance for work in the family.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.391
You need to have access to some family planning.

00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:04.723
And you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor.

00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:07.631
But let me illustrate that fourth factor

00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:09.732
by looking at Qatar.

00:08:09.732 --> 00:08:13.532
Here we have Qatar today, and there we have Bangladesh today.

00:08:13.532 --> 00:08:17.169
If I take these countries back to the years of their independence,

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:20.240
which is almost the same year -- '71, '72 --

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.114
it's a quite amazing development which had happened.

00:08:24.114 --> 00:08:25.920
Look at Bangladesh and Qatar.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.178
With so different incomes, it's almost the same drop

00:08:29.178 --> 00:08:31.292
in number of babies per woman.

00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:33.295
And what is the reason in Qatar?

00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:34.954
Well I do as I always do.

00:08:34.954 --> 00:08:38.726
I went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage --

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:40.857
It's a very good webpage. I recommend it --

00:08:40.857 --> 00:08:47.348
and I looked up -- oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here --

00:08:47.348 --> 00:08:51.415
and provided free of charge, I found Qatar's social trends.

00:08:51.415 --> 00:08:53.760
Very interesting. Lots to read.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.332
I found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman.

00:08:58.332 --> 00:09:01.883
These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar,

00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:04.538
and they say the most important factors are:

00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:06.480
"Increased age at first marriage,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.505
increased educational level of Qatari woman

00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:12.818
and more women integrated in the labor force."

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:16.560
I couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.077
This is a country that indeed has gone through

00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:22.612
a very, very interesting modernization.

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:25.237
So what it is, is these four:

00:09:25.237 --> 00:09:28.320
Children should survive, children shouldn't be needed for work,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.222
women should get education and join the labor force

00:09:31.222 --> 00:09:33.495
and family planning should be accessible.

00:09:33.495 --> 00:09:36.883
Now look again at this.

00:09:36.883 --> 00:09:39.175
The average number of children in the world

00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:42.597
is like in Colombia -- it's 2.4 today.

00:09:42.597 --> 00:09:45.634
There are countries up here which are very poor.

00:09:45.634 --> 00:09:49.585
And that's where family planning, better child survival is needed.

00:09:49.585 --> 00:09:53.372
I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk.

00:09:53.372 --> 00:09:58.831
And here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman.

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:02.443
So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz,

00:10:02.443 --> 00:10:03.985
it's two.

00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:06.514
We have reached peak child.

00:10:06.514 --> 00:10:09.403
The number of children is not growing any longer in the world.

00:10:09.403 --> 00:10:11.395
We are still debating peak oil,

00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:14.326
but we have definitely reached peak child.

00:10:14.326 --> 00:10:17.049
And the world population will stop growing.

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:19.151
The United Nations Population Division has said

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:21.591
it will stop growing at 10 billion.

00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:25.631
But why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow?

00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:28.077
Well I will show you here.

00:10:28.077 --> 00:10:31.852
I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came.

00:10:31.852 --> 00:10:35.686
They are quite useful for educational purposes.

00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:38.594
Each card box is one billion people.

00:10:38.594 --> 00:10:41.262
And there are two billion children in the world.

00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:48.132
There are two billion young people between 15 and 30.

00:10:48.132 --> 00:10:49.602
These are rounded numbers.

00:10:49.602 --> 00:10:54.628
Then there is one billion between 30 and 45,

00:10:54.628 --> 00:10:58.471
almost one between 45 and 60.

00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:00.095
And then it's my box.

00:11:00.095 --> 00:11:02.120
This is me: 60-plus.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.282
We are here on top.

00:11:04.282 --> 00:11:09.514
So what will happen now is what we call "the big fill-up."

00:11:09.514 --> 00:11:12.502
You can see that it's like three billion missing here.

00:11:12.502 --> 00:11:16.809
They are not missing because they've died; they were never born.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:20.917
Because before 1980, there were much fewer people born

00:11:20.917 --> 00:11:23.674
than there were during the last 30 years.

00:11:23.674 --> 00:11:26.828
So what will happen now is quite straightforward.

00:11:26.828 --> 00:11:29.625
The old, sadly, we will die.

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:34.280
The rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.888
Then the old will die.

00:11:36.888 --> 00:11:40.926
The rest will grow older and get two billion children.

00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:46.695
And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children.

00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:48.949
(Applause)

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:52.582
This is the great fill-up.

00:11:52.582 --> 00:11:55.354
It's inevitable.

00:11:55.354 --> 00:11:58.000
And can you see that this increase took place

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.803
without life getting longer and without adding children?

00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:07.708
Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman.

00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:10.977
All the religions in the world are fully capable

00:12:10.977 --> 00:12:16.102
to maintain their values and adapt to this new world.

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:21.385
And we will be just 10 billion in this world,

00:12:21.385 --> 00:12:24.969
if the poorest people get out of poverty,

00:12:24.969 --> 00:12:28.142
their children survive, they get access to family planning.

00:12:28.142 --> 00:12:30.042
That is needed.

00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:35.757
But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more.

00:12:35.757 --> 00:12:38.969
So when you discuss and when you plan

00:12:38.969 --> 00:12:42.372
for the resources and the energy needed for the future,

00:12:42.372 --> 00:12:44.705
for human beings on this planet,

00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:46.862
you have to plan for 10 billion.

00:12:46.862 --> 00:12:49.012
Thank you very much.

00:12:49.012 --> 00:12:55.098
(Applause)
