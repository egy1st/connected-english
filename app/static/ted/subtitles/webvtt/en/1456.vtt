00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.853
This sound,

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:09.588
this smell,

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:13.693
this sight

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:17.221
all remind me of the campfires of my childhood,

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:24.617
when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:27.540
There was this wondrous ending

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.106
when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:36.087
It was dreaming time.

00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:39.424
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming,

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:43.134
although I'm known to make my dreams come true.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:46.425
Last year, I created a one-man show.

00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:50.658
For an hour and a half I shared with the audience

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:53.325
a lifetime of creativity,

00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:57.759
how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.108
And then TED challenged me:

00:01:00.108 --> 00:01:03.273
"Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?"

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:04.663
(Laughter)

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:08.190
Eighteen minutes, clearly impossible.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.453
But here I am.

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.815
One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:15.016
in which every syllable, every second will have its importance

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:16.781
and hope to God the audience will be able to follow me.

00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:18.199
No, no, no.

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:21.080
No, the best way for me to start

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.749
is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.066
So please join me for a minute of silence.

00:01:46.026 --> 00:01:48.186
Okay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds.

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:50.889
But hey, we're on TED time.

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:52.961
When I was six years old,

00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:55.759
I fell in love with magic.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.178
For Christmas I got a magic box

00:01:58.178 --> 00:02:02.633
and a very old book on card manipulation.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:05.786
Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:10.019
than in all the silly little tricks in the box.

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.285
So I looked in the book for the most difficult move,

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:16.907
and it was this.

00:02:16.907 --> 00:02:18.800
Now I'm not supposed to share that with you,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.097
but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:26.600
Now that manipulation

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.060
was broken down into seven moves

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.174
described over seven pages.

00:02:33.174 --> 00:02:35.769
One, two, three,

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.383
four, five, six and seven.

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:40.984
And let me show you something else.

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:51.433
The cards were bigger than my hands.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:54.036
Two months later, six years old,

00:02:54.036 --> 00:02:57.295
I'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:02:57.295 --> 00:02:59.435
And I go to see a famous magician

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:02.161
and proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?"

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:03.501
Six years old.

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:06.883
The magician looked at me and said, "This is a disaster.

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:09.769
You cannot do that in two seconds

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.234
and have a minuscule part of the card showing.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:18.718
For the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second

00:03:18.718 --> 00:03:22.840
and it has to be perfect."

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.453
Two years later, one -- zoop.

00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:35.270
And I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.639
Passion is the motto

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.816
of all my actions.

00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:48.041
As I'm studying magic,

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:50.658
juggling is mentioned repeatedly

00:03:50.658 --> 00:03:55.226
as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:59.541
Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly

00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:01.775
jugglers make objects fly.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.703
So that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.

00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:09.491
I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe,

00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:13.942
and he agrees to sell me three clubs.

00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:16.109
But in America you have to explain. What are clubs?

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.625
Nothing to do with golf.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:22.159
They are those beautiful oblong objects,

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.759
but quite difficult to make.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.625
They have to be precisely lathed.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.793
Oh, when I was buying the clubs,

00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:30.942
somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:33.292
Well I didn't think much of it at the time.

00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:37.258
Anyway, here I was progressing with my new clubs.

00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:39.594
But I could not understand.

00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:43.360
I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.542
The clubs were escaping me at each throw.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:49.559
And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:53.692
Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn,

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:55.860
the world's greatest juggler.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.375
And he was frowning.

00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:59.792
And he finally asked, "Can I see those?"

00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:02.158
So I proudly showed him my clubs.

00:05:02.158 --> 00:05:04.575
He said, "Philippe, you have been had.

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:07.976
These are rejects. They are completely out of alignment.

00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:13.127
They are impossible to juggle."

00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:19.492
Tenacity is how I kept at it

00:05:19.492 --> 00:05:21.374
against all odds.

00:05:21.374 --> 00:05:24.926
So I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers,

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:27.408
and I saw -- oh no, no, no, I didn't see.

00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:29.326
It was more interesting; I heard.

00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:31.693
I heard about those amazing men and women

00:05:31.693 --> 00:05:34.378
who walk on thin air --

00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:37.234
the high-wire walkers.

00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:40.896
Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood,

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:45.619
so that's it. I'm 16; I'm becoming a wire walker.

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:50.092
I found two trees --

00:05:50.092 --> 00:05:52.278
but not any kind of trees,

00:05:52.278 --> 00:05:54.747
trees with character --

00:05:54.747 --> 00:05:56.496
and then a very long rope.

00:05:56.496 --> 00:05:58.281
And I put the rope around and around

00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.746
and around and around and around till I had no more rope.

00:06:00.746 --> 00:06:03.263
Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:05.783
I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers,

00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:11.215
and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.

00:06:11.215 --> 00:06:14.833
So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:18.311
What did I need? I needed the widest shoes in the world.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:22.150
So I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.333
and then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes.

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:29.344
Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing.

00:06:29.344 --> 00:06:31.387
So I cut one rope off.

00:06:31.387 --> 00:06:33.132
And the next day one rope off.

00:06:33.132 --> 00:06:37.931
And a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.731
Now you can imagine at that time

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:44.165
I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.

00:06:44.165 --> 00:06:49.132
So that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try --

00:06:49.132 --> 00:06:52.602
this is how not to learn wire walking.

00:06:52.602 --> 00:06:54.116
(Laughter)

00:06:54.116 --> 00:07:02.648
Intuition is a tool essential in my life.

00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:07.266
In the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schools

00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:08.934
because instead of listening to the teachers,

00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:12.965
I am my own teacher, progressing in my new art

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:16.099
and becoming a street juggler.

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.750
On the high wire, within months,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.432
I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus,

00:07:21.432 --> 00:07:24.015
except I am not satisfied.

00:07:24.015 --> 00:07:32.276
I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:34.980
But nobody wanted to hire me.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.399
So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission.

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:44.285
Notre Dame,

00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:48.323
the Sydney Harbor Bridge,

00:07:48.323 --> 00:07:51.417
the World Trade Center.

00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:53.690
And I developed a certitude, a faith

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.250
that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.002
If not, I will never do that first step.

00:08:00.002 --> 00:08:02.201
Well nonetheless,

00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:05.214
on the top of the World Trade Center

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:13.111
my first step was terrifying.

00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:17.384
All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.

00:08:17.384 --> 00:08:20.220
Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.500
The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.233
whose chilling power I no longer feel.

00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:30.099
I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge.

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:31.831
I step over the beam.

00:08:31.831 --> 00:08:35.214
I put my left foot on the cable,

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:38.598
the weight of my body raised on my right leg

00:08:38.598 --> 00:08:41.878
anchored to the flank of the building.

00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:45.697
Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?

00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:48.214
My right leg will be unburdened,

00:08:48.214 --> 00:08:51.717
my right foot will freely meet the wire.

00:08:51.717 --> 00:08:56.289
On one side, a mass of a mountain, a life I know.

00:08:56.289 --> 00:08:59.014
On the other, the universe of the clouds,

00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:02.582
so full of unknown we think it's empty.

00:09:02.582 --> 00:09:08.797
At my feet, the path to the north tower -- 60 yards of wire rope.

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:12.178
It's a straight line, which sags,

00:09:12.178 --> 00:09:15.699
which sways, which vibrates,

00:09:15.699 --> 00:09:17.263
which rolls on itself,

00:09:17.263 --> 00:09:18.998
which is ice,

00:09:18.998 --> 00:09:23.367
which is three tons tight, ready to explode,

00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:25.981
ready to swallow me.

00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:28.947
An inner howl assails me,

00:09:28.947 --> 00:09:31.964
the wild longing to flee.

00:09:31.964 --> 00:09:34.431
But it is too late.

00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:37.081
The wire is ready.

00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:42.519
Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable.

00:09:49.718 --> 00:09:54.213
Faith is what replaces doubt

00:09:54.213 --> 00:09:56.243
in my dictionary.

00:09:56.243 --> 00:09:57.469
So after the walk

00:09:57.469 --> 00:09:59.313
people ask me, "How can you top that?"

00:09:59.313 --> 00:10:01.618
Well I didn't have that problem.

00:10:01.618 --> 00:10:04.220
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.302
in breaking records.

00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:11.331
In fact, I put my World Trade Center crossing

00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:14.881
at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks --

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:19.797
or some completely different type of performance.

00:10:19.797 --> 00:10:25.959
Let's see, such as my street juggling, for example.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.427
So each time

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:31.648
I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement

00:10:31.648 --> 00:10:36.491
and enter as the improvising comic silent character

00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:38.416
I created 45 years ago,

00:10:38.416 --> 00:10:42.463
I am as happy as when I am in the clouds.

00:10:42.463 --> 00:10:44.418
But this here,

00:10:44.418 --> 00:10:46.749
this is not the street.

00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:49.325
So I cannot street juggle here, you understand.

00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:51.498
So you don't want me to street juggle here, right?

00:10:51.498 --> 00:10:52.864
You know that, right?

00:10:52.864 --> 00:10:55.113
You don't want me to juggle, right?

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.406
(Applause)

00:11:03.335 --> 00:11:08.542
(Music)

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.238
(Applause)

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.819
Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.672
Each time I street juggle

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:24.888
I use improvisation.

00:13:28.765 --> 00:13:30.967
Now improvisation is empowering

00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:35.167
because it welcomes the unknown.

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:39.299
And since what's impossible is always unknown,

00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:46.889
it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible.

00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:49.333
Now I have done the impossible not once,

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:51.518
but many times.

00:13:51.518 --> 00:13:53.964
So what should I share? Oh, I know. Israel.

00:13:53.964 --> 00:13:58.635
Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival

00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:00.601
by a high-wire walk.

00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:02.450
And I chose to put my wire

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.453
between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem

00:14:06.453 --> 00:14:08.384
over the Ben Hinnom Valley.

00:14:08.384 --> 00:14:10.551
And I thought it would be incredible

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:12.374
if in the middle of the wire

00:14:12.374 --> 00:14:14.357
I stopped and, like a magician,

00:14:14.357 --> 00:14:18.122
I produce a dove and send her in the sky

00:14:18.122 --> 00:14:20.472
as a living symbol of peace.

00:14:20.472 --> 00:14:23.289
Well now I must say,

00:14:23.289 --> 00:14:26.273
it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.

00:14:26.273 --> 00:14:29.197
And in my hotel room,

00:14:29.197 --> 00:14:34.177
each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air,

00:14:34.177 --> 00:14:36.796
she would graze the wall and end up on the bed.

00:14:36.796 --> 00:14:39.561
So I said, now it's okay. The room is too small.

00:14:39.561 --> 00:14:41.310
I mean, a bird needs space to fly.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.562
It will go perfectly on the day of the walk.

00:14:43.562 --> 00:14:46.943
Now comes the day of the walk.

00:14:46.943 --> 00:14:50.593
Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley.

00:14:50.593 --> 00:14:55.177
The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, comes to wish me the best.

00:14:55.177 --> 00:14:58.062
But he seemed nervous.

00:14:58.062 --> 00:15:00.311
There was tension in my wire,

00:15:00.311 --> 00:15:02.426
but I also could feel tension on the ground.

00:15:02.426 --> 00:15:03.744
Because all those people

00:15:03.744 --> 00:15:06.843
were made up of people who, for the most part,

00:15:06.843 --> 00:15:09.728
considered each other enemies.

00:15:09.728 --> 00:15:12.464
So I start the walk. Everything is fine.

00:15:12.464 --> 00:15:14.242
I stop in the middle.

00:15:14.242 --> 00:15:16.961
I make the dove appear.

00:15:16.961 --> 00:15:18.877
People applaud in delight.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.646
And then in the most magnificent gesture,

00:15:21.646 --> 00:15:25.177
I send the bird of peace into the azure.

00:15:25.177 --> 00:15:26.926
But the bird, instead of flying away,

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.977
goes flop, flop, flop and lands on my head.

00:15:29.977 --> 00:15:32.061
(Laughter)

00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:33.960
And people scream.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.578
So I grab the dove,

00:15:36.578 --> 00:15:41.374
and for the second time I send her in the air.

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:44.547
But the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school,

00:15:44.547 --> 00:15:48.594
goes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.

00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:49.910
(Laughter)

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.165
You laugh, you laugh. But hey.

00:15:52.165 --> 00:15:55.594
I sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers.

00:15:55.594 --> 00:15:58.813
Now in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.

00:15:58.813 --> 00:16:01.177
They must think this guy with this dove,

00:16:01.177 --> 00:16:03.343
he must have spent years working with him.

00:16:03.343 --> 00:16:04.760
What a genius, what a professional.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.731
(Laughter)

00:16:06.731 --> 00:16:09.710
So I take a bow. I salute with my hand.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.778
And at the end I bang my hand against the pole

00:16:11.778 --> 00:16:13.295
to dislodge the bird.

00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:16.944
Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly,

00:16:16.944 --> 00:16:19.695
does for the third time a little flop, flop, flop

00:16:19.695 --> 00:16:21.728
and ends up on the wire behind me.

00:16:21.728 --> 00:16:24.744
And the entire valley goes crazy.

00:16:24.744 --> 00:16:26.827
Now but hold on, I'm not finished.

00:16:26.827 --> 00:16:29.361
So now I'm like 50 yards from my arrival

00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:32.010
and I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.593
And something happened.

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:36.062
Somebody somewhere, a group of people,

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:39.244
starts clapping in rhythm with my steps.

00:16:39.244 --> 00:16:41.093
And within seconds the entire valley

00:16:41.093 --> 00:16:45.077
is applauding in unison with each of my steps.

00:16:45.077 --> 00:16:47.210
But not an applause of delight like before,

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.594
an applause encouragement.

00:16:50.594 --> 00:16:54.759
For a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:59.708
They had become one, pushing me to triumph.

00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:02.375
I want you just for a second

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:05.388
to experience this amazing human symphony.

00:17:05.388 --> 00:17:08.524
So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival.

00:17:08.524 --> 00:17:12.424
So I walk, you clap, everybody in unison.

00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:18.638
(Clapping)

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:22.940
(Applause)

00:17:25.063 --> 00:17:27.919
So after the walk, Teddy and I become friends.

00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:31.572
And he tells me, he has on his desk a picture of me

00:17:31.572 --> 00:17:34.007
in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:35.424
He didn't know the true story.

00:17:35.424 --> 00:17:39.072
And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation

00:17:39.072 --> 00:17:41.472
to solve in this hard-to-manage city,

00:17:41.472 --> 00:17:44.490
instead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says,

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.823
"If Philippe can do that, I can do this,"

00:17:46.823 --> 00:17:50.442
and he goes back to work.

00:17:50.442 --> 00:17:55.653
Inspiration.

00:17:59.468 --> 00:18:01.916
By inspiring ourselves

00:18:01.916 --> 00:18:04.106
we inspire others.

00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:05.889
I will never forget this music,

00:18:05.889 --> 00:18:08.406
and I hope now neither will you.

00:18:08.406 --> 00:18:11.138
Please take this music with you home,

00:18:11.138 --> 00:18:14.644
and start gluing feathers to your arms

00:18:14.644 --> 00:18:16.962
and take off and fly,

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:22.970
and look at the world from a different perspective.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.415
And when you see mountains,

00:18:25.415 --> 00:18:28.208
remember mountains can be moved.

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:36.340
(Applause)

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.342
Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:39.358 --> 00:18:43.030
Thank you.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.352
(Applause)
