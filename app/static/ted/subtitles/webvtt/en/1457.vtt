00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.326
Let's begin with a story.

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:06.277
Once upon a time --

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:09.343
well actually less than two years ago --

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.376
in a kingdom not so very far away,

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:14.127
there was a man

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:15.994
who traveled many miles

00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:19.576
to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown --

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:22.160
an internationally famous company.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.278
Let's call it Island Networks.

00:00:25.278 --> 00:00:28.126
Now this kingdom had many resources

00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:30.343
and mighty ambitions,

00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:32.910
but the one thing it lacked was people.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.343
And so it invited workers from around the world

00:00:36.343 --> 00:00:38.993
to come and help it build the nation.

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:41.960
But in order to enter and to stay

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.495
these migrants had to pass a few tests.

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:47.978
And so it was, our man presented himself

00:00:47.978 --> 00:00:49.747
to authorities in the kingdom,

00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:52.945
looking forward to settling into his new life.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:56.195
But then something unexpected happened.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:59.795
The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:03.478
never actually told him what they were testing for.

00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:07.747
He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test,

00:01:07.747 --> 00:01:10.078
which is best medical practice.

00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:13.079
He was never informed of the results of the test.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.195
And yet, a couple of weeks later,

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:18.229
he was picked up and taken to prison

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.763
where he was subjected to a medical exam,

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:23.514
including a full-body search

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:27.112
in full view of the others in the cell.

00:01:27.112 --> 00:01:30.879
He was released, but then a day or two later,

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:35.848
he was taken to the airport and he was deported.

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:39.113
What on earth did this man do

00:01:39.113 --> 00:01:41.263
to merit this treatment?

00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:43.865
What was his terrible crime?

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:47.513
He was infected with HIV.

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:50.644
Now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:54.916
that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:57.516
of people living with HIV.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.117
The kingdom argues

00:01:59.117 --> 00:02:04.317
that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners

00:02:04.317 --> 00:02:07.016
who pose a risk to the economy

00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:10.516
or the security or the public health

00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:12.633
or the morals of the state.

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:16.466
But these laws, when applied to people living with HIV,

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:19.848
are a violation of international human rights agreements

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:23.068
to which these countries are signatories.

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:24.316
But you know what?

00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:25.799
Matters of principle aside,

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.784
practically speaking, these laws drive HIV underground.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:33.382
People are less likely to come forth

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:37.416
to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition,

00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:40.248
none of which helps these individuals

00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:44.417
or the communities these laws purport to protect.

00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:48.482
Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV.

00:02:48.482 --> 00:02:51.901
And with treatment, it is a manageable condition.

00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:54.732
We are very far from the days

00:02:54.732 --> 00:02:57.918
when the only practical response to dread disease

00:02:57.918 --> 00:03:00.498
was to have banished the afflicted --

00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:03.400
like this, "The Exile of the Leper."

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.617
So you tell me why, in our age of science,

00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:09.183
we still have laws and policies

00:03:09.183 --> 00:03:12.466
which come from an age of superstition.

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:15.733
Time for a quick show of hands.

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:18.998
Who here has been touched by HIV --

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:22.082
either because you yourself have the virus

00:03:22.082 --> 00:03:25.567
or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.600
who is living with HIV?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.700
Hands up.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.681
Wow. Wow.

00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:33.600
That's a significant number of us.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.132
You know better than anyone

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.399
that HIV brings out

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.982
the best and the worst in humanity.

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:44.702
And the laws reflect these attitudes.

00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:47.382
I'm not just talking about laws on the books,

00:03:47.382 --> 00:03:50.749
but laws as they are enforced on the streets

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.682
and laws as they are decided in the courts.

00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:56.232
And I'm not just talking about laws

00:03:56.232 --> 00:03:58.601
as they relate to people living with HIV,

00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:01.832
but people who are at greatest risk of infection --

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:05.600
people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.749
or men who have sex with men

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:09.632
or transgendered persons

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:12.100
or migrants or prisoners.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.650
And in many parts of the world that includes women and children

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.681
who are especially vulnerable.

00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:20.483
Now there are laws in many parts of the world

00:04:20.483 --> 00:04:23.915
which reflect the best of human nature.

00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:27.201
These laws treat people touched by HIV

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:30.100
with compassion and acceptance.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.499
These laws respect universal human rights

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.183
and they are grounded in evidence.

00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:39.316
These laws ensure that people living with HIV

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:41.432
and those at greatest risk

00:04:41.432 --> 00:04:45.016
are protected from violence and discrimination

00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:49.232
and that they get access to prevention and to treatment.

00:04:49.232 --> 00:04:52.028
Unfortunately, these good laws

00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:54.164
are counter-balanced by a mass

00:04:54.164 --> 00:04:57.165
of really bad law --

00:04:57.165 --> 00:05:01.614
law which is grounded in moral judgement

00:05:01.614 --> 00:05:04.467
and in fear and in misinformation,

00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:08.566
laws which specifically punish people living with HIV

00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:10.198
or those at greatest risk.

00:05:10.198 --> 00:05:12.965
These laws fly in the face of science,

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:16.248
and they are grounded in prejudice

00:05:16.248 --> 00:05:20.066
and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:23.348
and a selective reading of religion.

00:05:23.348 --> 00:05:25.965
But you know what? You don't have to take my word for it.

00:05:25.965 --> 00:05:27.849
We're going to hear from two people

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.382
who are on the sharp end of the law.

00:05:30.382 --> 00:05:32.583
The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American.

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:36.581
And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law

00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:39.466
on HIV transmission and exposure --

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:42.918
neither of which offense he actually committed.

00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:46.116
(Video) Nick Rhoades: If something is against the law

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:47.315
then that is telling society

00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:49.916
that is unacceptable, that's bad behavior.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.486
And I think the severity of that punishment

00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:56.175
tells you how bad you are as a person.

00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:58.665
You're a class B felon,

00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:01.449
lifetime sex offender.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.482
You are a very, very, very bad person.

00:06:05.482 --> 00:06:08.869
And you did a very, very, very bad thing.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:11.424
And so that's just programmed into you.

00:06:11.424 --> 00:06:14.657
And you go through the correctional system

00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:16.458
and everyone's telling you the same thing.

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:21.422
And you're just like, I'm a very bad person.

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:23.387
Shereen El-Feki: It's not just a question

00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:26.486
of unfair or ineffective laws.

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:28.587
Some countries have good laws,

00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:31.237
laws which could stem the tide of HIV.

00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:34.337
The problem is that these laws are flouted.

00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:37.304
Because stigma gives unofficial license

00:06:37.304 --> 00:06:39.621
to treat people living with HIV

00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:40.937
or those at greatest risk

00:06:40.937 --> 00:06:43.271
unlike other citizens.

00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:44.970
And this is exactly what happened

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.184
to Helma and Dongo from Namibia.

00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:49.911
(Video) Hilma: I found out

00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:52.825
when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up.

00:06:52.856 --> 00:06:56.508
The nurse announced that every pregnant woman

00:06:56.508 --> 00:06:58.603
must also be tested for HIV that day.

00:06:58.603 --> 00:07:01.652
I took the test and the result showed I was positive.

00:07:01.652 --> 00:07:04.248
That's the day I found out.

00:07:04.248 --> 00:07:06.860
The nurse said to me, "Why should you people bcome pregnant

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.388
when you know you are HIV positive?

00:07:08.388 --> 00:07:10.783
Why are you pregnant when you are living positive?"

00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:13.772
I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me.

00:07:13.772 --> 00:07:18.904
Because I am HIV positive.

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:21.935
They didn't give the forms to me

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.672
or explain what was in the form.

00:07:25.672 --> 00:07:28.072
The nurse just came with it

00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:30.154
already marked where I had to sign.

00:07:30.154 --> 00:07:32.098
And with the labor pain,

00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:39.168
I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me.

00:07:39.168 --> 00:07:41.697
I just signed.

00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:44.850
SE: Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.201
are among the 34 million people living with HIV

00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:51.317
according to recent estimates.

00:07:51.317 --> 00:07:53.185
They're the lucky ones

00:07:53.185 --> 00:07:54.869
because they're still alive.

00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:56.734
According to those same estimates,

00:07:56.734 --> 00:08:00.718
in 2010 1.8 million people died

00:08:00.718 --> 00:08:03.117
of AIDS related causes.

00:08:03.117 --> 00:08:06.620
These are terrible and tragic figures.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.051
But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics,

00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:14.252
we actually see some reason for hope.

00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:19.652
Looking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining.

00:08:19.652 --> 00:08:22.103
And looking globally as well,

00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:25.469
deaths are also starting to fall.

00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:27.502
There are many reasons for these positive developments,

00:08:27.502 --> 00:08:29.635
but one of the most remarkable

00:08:29.635 --> 00:08:32.802
is in the increase in the number of people around the world

00:08:32.802 --> 00:08:34.985
on anti-retroviral therapy,

00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:39.118
the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check.

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:41.151
Now there are still many problems.

00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:44.501
Only about half of the people who need treatment

00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:46.734
are currently receiving it.

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:48.586
In some parts of the world --

00:08:48.586 --> 00:08:50.935
like here in the Middle East and North Africa --

00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:54.318
new infections are rising and so are deaths.

00:08:54.318 --> 00:08:57.469
And the money, the money we need

00:08:57.469 --> 00:08:59.402
for the global response to HIV,

00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:02.398
that is shrinking.

00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:04.687
But for the first time

00:09:04.687 --> 00:09:07.905
in three decades into this epidemic

00:09:07.905 --> 00:09:12.022
we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV.

00:09:12.022 --> 00:09:13.988
But in order to do that

00:09:13.988 --> 00:09:17.887
we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law.

00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:19.505
It's for this reason

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:21.635
that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law,

00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:22.934
of which I'm a member,

00:09:22.934 --> 00:09:26.000
was established by the agencies of the United Nations --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.650
to look at the ways that legal environments

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.667
are affecting people living with HIV

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:32.801
and those at greatest risk,

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:34.551
and to recommend what should be done

00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:37.787
to make the law an ally, not an enemy,

00:09:37.787 --> 00:09:40.519
of the global response to HIV.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:42.868
Let me give you just one example

00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:45.518
of the way a legal environment

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:48.084
can make a positive difference.

00:09:48.084 --> 00:09:50.899
People who inject drugs

00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:52.714
are one of those groups I mentioned.

00:09:52.714 --> 00:09:54.835
They're at high risk of HIV

00:09:54.835 --> 00:09:56.700
through contaminated injection equipment

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.382
and other risk-related behaviors.

00:09:59.382 --> 00:10:03.064
In fact, one in every 10 new infections of HIV

00:10:03.064 --> 00:10:05.798
is among people who inject drugs.

00:10:05.798 --> 00:10:08.399
Now drug use or possession

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.548
is illegal in almost every country.

00:10:10.548 --> 00:10:14.798
But some countries take a harder line on this than others.

00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:17.482
In Thailand people who use drugs,

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:20.333
or are merely suspected of using drugs,

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:22.199
are placed in detention centers,

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:24.116
like the one you see here,

00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:26.199
where they are supposed to clean up.

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:29.131
There is absolutely no evidence

00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:31.982
to show that throwing people into detention

00:10:31.982 --> 00:10:34.315
cures their drug dependence.

00:10:34.315 --> 00:10:36.482
There is, however, ample evidence

00:10:36.482 --> 00:10:38.482
to show that incarcerating people

00:10:38.482 --> 00:10:43.700
increases their risk of HIV and other infections.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.350
We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.115
in people who inject drugs.

00:10:51.115 --> 00:10:53.246
It's called harm reduction,

00:10:53.246 --> 00:10:55.030
and it involves, among other things,

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.161
providing clean needles and syringes,

00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:00.996
offering opioid substitution therapy

00:11:00.996 --> 00:11:03.262
and other evidence-based treatments

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.512
to reduce drug dependence.

00:11:05.512 --> 00:11:08.029
It involves providing information

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:10.047
and education and condoms

00:11:10.047 --> 00:11:13.178
to reduce HIV transmission,

00:11:13.178 --> 00:11:15.695
and also providing HIV testing

00:11:15.695 --> 00:11:17.528
and counseling and treatment

00:11:17.528 --> 00:11:19.346
should people become infected.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.879
Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:25.133
the results are striking.

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:26.963
Australia and Switzerland

00:11:26.963 --> 00:11:29.564
were two countries which introduced harm reduction

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:32.264
very early on in their HIV epidemics,

00:11:32.264 --> 00:11:35.283
and they have a very low rate of HIV

00:11:35.283 --> 00:11:37.446
among injecting drug users.

00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:39.797
The U.S. and Malaysia

00:11:39.797 --> 00:11:42.347
came to harm reduction a little later,

00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:46.314
and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations.

00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:47.997
Thailand and Russia, however,

00:11:47.997 --> 00:11:49.899
have resisted harm reduction

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:51.631
and have stringent laws

00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:53.197
which punish drug use.

00:11:53.197 --> 00:11:54.697
And hey, surprise,

00:11:54.697 --> 00:12:00.064
very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs.

00:12:00.064 --> 00:12:02.930
At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence,

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.681
and we've heard the experiences

00:12:04.681 --> 00:12:09.014
of over 700 people from 140 countries.

00:12:09.014 --> 00:12:11.272
And the trend? Well the trend is clear.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:14.597
Where you criminalize people living with HIV

00:12:14.597 --> 00:12:15.963
or those at greatest risk,

00:12:15.963 --> 00:12:18.712
you fuel the epidemic.

00:12:18.712 --> 00:12:22.981
Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV

00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:24.182
or a cure for AIDS --

00:12:24.182 --> 00:12:26.680
now that's rocket science.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.463
But changing the law isn't.

00:12:28.463 --> 00:12:31.176
And in fact, a number of countries are starting to make progress

00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:32.759
on a number of points.

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:36.797
To begin, countries need to review their legislation

00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:40.329
as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups.

00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:42.446
On the back of those reviews,

00:12:42.446 --> 00:12:44.412
governments should repeal laws

00:12:44.412 --> 00:12:47.580
that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.797
or those at greatest risk.

00:12:49.797 --> 00:12:52.313
Repealing a law isn't easy,

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.097
and it's particularly difficult

00:12:54.097 --> 00:12:58.380
when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.947
But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:06.246
One of the key points is to reform the police

00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:09.063
so that they have better practices on the ground.

00:13:09.063 --> 00:13:10.818
So for example, outreach workers

00:13:10.818 --> 00:13:13.818
who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations

00:13:13.818 --> 00:13:16.934
are not themselves subject to police harassment

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:19.884
or abuse or arbitrary arrest.

00:13:19.884 --> 00:13:21.385
We can also train judges

00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:24.552
so that they find flexibilities in the law

00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:27.702
and so that they rule on the side of tolerance

00:13:27.702 --> 00:13:29.601
rather than prejudice.

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.119
We can retool prisons

00:13:31.119 --> 00:13:34.484
so that HIV prevention and harm reduction

00:13:34.484 --> 00:13:36.704
is available to prisoners.

00:13:36.704 --> 00:13:41.219
The key to all this is reinforcing civil society.

00:13:41.219 --> 00:13:42.902
Because civil society is key

00:13:42.902 --> 00:13:45.768
to raising awareness among vulnerable groups

00:13:45.768 --> 00:13:47.552
of their legal rights.

00:13:47.552 --> 00:13:49.169
But awareness needs action.

00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:50.635
And so we need to ensure

00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:52.968
that these people who are living with HIV

00:13:52.968 --> 00:13:54.635
or at greatest risk of HIV

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:57.369
have access to legal services

00:13:57.369 --> 00:14:00.285
and they have equal access to the courts.

00:14:00.285 --> 00:14:02.986
And also important is talking to communities

00:14:02.986 --> 00:14:05.135
so that we change interpretations

00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:07.635
of religious or customary law,

00:14:07.635 --> 00:14:09.453
which is too often used

00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:12.936
to justify punishment and fuel stigma.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.184
For many of us here

00:14:14.184 --> 00:14:17.703
HIV is not an abstract threat.

00:14:17.703 --> 00:14:20.202
It hits very close to home.

00:14:20.202 --> 00:14:22.719
The law, on the other hand,

00:14:22.719 --> 00:14:27.152
can seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists,

00:14:27.152 --> 00:14:29.234
but it isn't.

00:14:29.234 --> 00:14:32.119
Because for those of us who live in democracies,

00:14:32.119 --> 00:14:34.435
or in aspiring democracies,

00:14:34.435 --> 00:14:37.452
the law begins with us.

00:14:37.452 --> 00:14:40.385
Laws that treat people living with HIV

00:14:40.385 --> 00:14:43.053
or those at greatest risk with respect

00:14:43.053 --> 00:14:47.901
start with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals.

00:14:47.901 --> 00:14:52.535
If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime,

00:14:52.535 --> 00:14:56.202
then that is the change we need to spread.

00:14:56.202 --> 00:14:57.601
Thank you.

00:14:57.601 --> 00:15:05.435
(Applause)
