00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.798
(Non English)

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:28.940
(French) Mais Des fois on peut voir
parce Que Les gens

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:31.271
ici faire Des choses on peut manger.

00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:35.269
(French) Mais quand
tu es fâché avec quelqu'un

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:37.161
c'est pas passé the first time.

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.454
(British English) And that's one
of the things that I enjoy most

00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:43.185
about this convention.

00:00:43.963 --> 00:00:50.531
It's not so much, as so little
has to do with what everything is.

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:52.707
(Laughter)

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:56.838
But it is within our self-interest

00:00:56.862 --> 00:00:59.792
to understand the topography of our lives

00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:01.210
unto ourselves.

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:05.851
(Laughter)

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:09.935
The future states that there is no time

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:13.261
other than the collapsation
of that sensation

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:15.907
of the mirror of the memories
in which we are living.

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:19.283
(Laughter)

00:01:19.307 --> 00:01:21.144
Common knowledge,

00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:22.684
but important nonetheless.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:26.098
(Laughter)

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:28.456
As we face fear in these times,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.490
and fear is all around us,

00:01:30.514 --> 00:01:32.378
we also have anti-fear.

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:35.562
It's hard to imagine or measure.

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:38.682
The background radiation
is simply too static

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:42.209
to be able to be seen
under the normal spectral analysis.

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.769
(American accent) But we feel
as though there are times

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:48.246
when a lot of us --
you know what I'm saying?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.114
But -- you know what I'm saying?

00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:52.677
Because, as a hip hop thing,
you know what I'm saying,

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:54.962
TED be rocking --
you know what I'm saying.

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:57.888
Like so I wrote a song,

00:01:57.912 --> 00:01:59.990
and I hope you guys dig it.

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:02.236
It's a song about people

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.013
and sasquatches --

00:02:04.037 --> 00:02:07.291
(Laughter)

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.776
And other French science stuff.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.863
That's French science.

00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:13.030
Okay, here we go.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.209
(Singing) I've been trying inside

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.621
I know that I'm in trouble

00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:28.955
(Applause)

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:33.942
that I'm in trouble

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.838
by myself

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:42.755
But every time it gets me

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:50.484
(Vocalization)

00:02:53.183 --> 00:02:55.293
(Beatbox)

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.485
(Singing) And I've been trying
to be the one that you believe in

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.882
And you're the one
that I want to be so saucy

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:38.697
And you're the one
I want to [unclear], baby

00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:41.162
And you can do anything

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:44.035
as long as you don't get hurt
along the way back

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.415
(Beatbox)

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.361
If I survive, I'm going
to tell you what is wrong

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.044
Because if you were [unclear]

00:03:55.068 --> 00:04:00.798
And I think that you're looking
like a [unclear]

00:04:00.822 --> 00:04:06.082
I give you what I want to be

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:08.545
(Music)

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.220
(Music ends abruptly)

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:23.196
(British accent) And it's like,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.062
you could use as many
of those things that you want.

00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:30.508
(Applause)

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:32.150
And the computer models,

00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:33.708
no matter how many that you have

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.304
and how many people that you use,

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:38.241
are never going to be able to arrive
at the same conclusions.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.744
Four years ago I worked with a few people
at the Brookings Institute,

00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:44.431
and I arrived at a conclusion.

00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:50.199
(Laughter)

00:04:52.344 --> 00:04:53.962
Tomorrow is another day.

00:04:53.986 --> 00:04:56.678
(Laughter)

00:04:56.702 --> 00:04:58.401
Not just any day,

00:04:58.425 --> 00:04:59.702
but it is a day.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.211
It will get here, there's no question.

00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:06.432
And the important thing to remember

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:09.627
is that this simulation is a good one.

00:05:10.162 --> 00:05:12.716
It's believable, it's tactile.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.621
You can reach out -- things are solid.

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:17.134
You can move objects
from one area to another.

00:05:17.866 --> 00:05:19.404
You can feel your body.

00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:21.882
You can say, "I'd like to go over
to this location,"

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:25.117
and you can move this mass
of molecules through the air

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:27.087
over to another location, at will.

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:30.577
(Laughter)

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.136
That's something
you live inside of every day.

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.772
Now with the allocation
and the understanding

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.246
of the lack of understanding,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.837
we enter into a new era of science

00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:44.473
in which we feel nothing more

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:46.726
than so much so as to say

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.852
that those within themselves,

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:51.964
comporary or non-comporary,

00:05:51.988 --> 00:05:53.489
will figuratively figure

00:05:53.513 --> 00:05:56.737
into the folding of our non-understanding

00:05:56.761 --> 00:05:58.598
and our partial understanding

00:05:58.622 --> 00:06:01.885
to the networks
of which we all draw our source

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.207
and conclusions from.

00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.774
(Laughter)

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:08.412
So, as I say before the last piece,

00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:13.277
feel not as though
it is a sphere we live on,

00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:17.349
rather an infinite plane
which has the illusion

00:06:17.373 --> 00:06:20.033
of leading yourself
back to the point of origin.

00:06:20.057 --> 00:06:21.390
(Laughter)

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:23.749
Once we understand
that all the spheres in the sky

00:06:23.773 --> 00:06:25.842
are just large infinite planes,

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:27.288
it will be plain to see.

00:06:27.312 --> 00:06:28.313
(Laughter)

00:06:28.337 --> 00:06:30.446
(Audience) (Laughter)

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.939
This is my final piece.

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:33.928
And just remember,

00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:35.798
everything you are --

00:06:35.822 --> 00:06:40.568
it's more important to realize
the negative space,

00:06:40.592 --> 00:06:43.474
as music is only the division of space;

00:06:43.498 --> 00:06:46.506
it is the space
we are listening to divided as such,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.135
which gives us the information
in comparison to something other

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.877
that gives us the idea of what the idea
that wants to be transmitted

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:54.951
wants to be.

00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:56.593
So please, without further ado.

00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:58.657
(Applause)

00:06:58.681 --> 00:06:59.757
Thank you.

00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:01.933
(Applause)

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.833
This is a fun one.

00:07:05.857 --> 00:07:06.871
It goes like this.

00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:10.214
(Beatbox)

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:16.467
(Gibberish)

00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:33.281
(Music ends)

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:35.456
Okay, for the last piece I'd like to do,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.906
this one goes very similar to this.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.331
I hope you guys recognize it.

00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:40.370
Here we go.

00:07:45.433 --> 00:07:47.772
Okay, that still works. Okay, good.

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:48.850
All right, here we go.

00:07:48.874 --> 00:07:50.836
(Laughter)

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:54.992
(Beatbox)

00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:04.956
Here we go.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.042
(Beatbox)

00:08:13.337 --> 00:08:16.495
Yeah, yo, yo, yo

00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:19.725
(Gibberish)

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:04.890
(Music fades out)

00:09:05.454 --> 00:09:07.193
Thank you. Enjoy the rest.

00:09:07.217 --> 00:09:09.950
(Applause)
