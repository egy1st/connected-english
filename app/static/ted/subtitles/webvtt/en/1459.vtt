WEBVTT

00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.358
I know this is going to sound strange,

00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:08.365
but I think robots can inspire us
to be better humans.

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:12.339
See, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,

00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:14.301
the home of Bethlehem Steel.

00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:17.103
My father was an engineer,

00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:21.446
and when I was growing up,
he would teach me how things worked.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.564
We would build projects together,

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:26.356
like model rockets and slot cars.

00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:29.640
Here's the go-kart that we built together.

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:31.952
That's me behind the wheel,

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:34.200
with my sister and my best
friend at the time.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.801
And one day,

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:40.908
he came home, when I was
about 10 years old,

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:43.558
and at the dinner table, he announced

00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:47.294
that for our next project, 
we were going to build ...

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:48.468
a robot.

00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:50.759
A robot.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.183
Now, I was thrilled about this,

00:00:53.207 --> 00:00:57.009
because at school,
there was a bully named Kevin,

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:58.922
and he was picking on me,

00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:01.336
because I was the only
Jewish kid in class.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.283
So I couldn't wait to get
started to work on this,

00:01:04.307 --> 00:01:06.917
so I could introduce Kevin to my robot.

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:07.971
(Laughter)

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:12.238
(Robot noises)

00:01:17.552 --> 00:01:18.944
(Laughter)

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:22.817
But that wasn't the kind of robot
my dad had in mind.

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:23.909
(Laughter)

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:27.565
See, he owned a chromium-plating company,

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:33.462
and they had to move heavy steel parts
between tanks of chemicals.

00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:36.859
And so he needed
an industrial robot like this,

00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:38.986
that could basically do the heavy lifting.

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:43.275
But my dad didn't get
the kind of robot he wanted, either.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.300
He and I worked on it for several years,

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:51.069
but it was the 1970s, and the technology
that was available to amateurs

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:52.419
just wasn't there yet.

00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:56.777
So Dad continued to do
this kind of work by hand.

00:01:57.595 --> 00:01:59.023
And a few years later,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.306
he was diagnosed with cancer.

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.392
You see,

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.012
what the robot we were trying
to build was telling him

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:10.192
was not about doing the heavy lifting.

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:11.367
It was a warning

00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:13.895
about his exposure to the toxic chemicals.

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:17.477
He didn't recognize that at the time,

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.187
and he contracted leukemia.

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:21.719
And he died at the age of 45.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:25.130
I was devastated by this.

00:02:25.703 --> 00:02:28.465
And I never forgot the robot
that he and I tried to build.

00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:33.748
When I was at college, I decided
to study engineering, like him.

00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:39.629
And I went to Carnegie Mellon,
and I earned my PhD in robotics.

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:41.562
I've been studying robots ever since.

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:47.316
So what I'd like to tell you about
are four robot projects,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.389
and how they've inspired me
to be a better human.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:59.820
By 1993, I was a young professor at USC,

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:02.662
and I was just building up
my own robotics lab,

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:05.907
and this was the year
the World Wide Web came out.

00:03:06.487 --> 00:03:09.472
And I remember my students
were the ones who told me about it,

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.813
and we would -- we were just amazed.

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:15.220
We started playing with this,
and that afternoon,

00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:19.522
we realized that we could use
this new, universal interface

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:23.974
to allow anyone in the world
to operate the robot in our lab.

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.381
So, rather than have it fight
or do industrial work,

00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:32.943
we decided to build a planter,

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:34.918
put the robot into the center of it,

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:36.620
and we called it the Telegarden.

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:42.253
And we had put a camera
in the gripper of the hand of the robot,

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:45.208
and we wrote some
special scripts and software,

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:47.266
so that anyone in the world could come in,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.074
and by clicking on the screen,

00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:52.719
they could move the robot around
and visit the garden.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:57.267
But we also set up some other software

00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:01.207
that lets you participate
and help us water the garden, remotely.

00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:03.932
And if you watered it a few times,

00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:06.231
we'd give you your own seed to plant.

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:10.643
Now, this was an engineering project,

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.779
and we published some papers
on the system design of it,

00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:17.448
but we also thought of it
as an art installation.

00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:20.787
It was invited, after the first year,

00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:23.831
by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria,

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:26.677
to have it installed in their lobby.

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:31.545
And I'm happy to say, it remained
online there, 24 hours a day,

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.400
for almost nine years.

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:38.144
That robot was operated by more people

00:04:38.168 --> 00:04:40.065
than any other robot in history.

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:42.930
Now, one day,

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:46.302
I got a call out of the blue
from a student,

00:04:47.211 --> 00:04:51.369
who asked a very simple
but profound question.

00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.187
He said, "Is the robot real?"

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.885
Now, everyone else had assumed it was,

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.425
and we knew it was,
because we were working with it.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:02.847
But I knew what he meant,

00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:04.313
because it would be possible

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:07.122
to take a bunch of pictures
of flowers in a garden

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:10.785
and then, basically, index them
in a computer system,

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:13.436
such that it would appear
that there was a real robot,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.610
when there wasn't.

00:05:15.088 --> 00:05:16.612
And the more I thought about it,

00:05:16.636 --> 00:05:20.215
I couldn't think of a good answer
for how he could tell the difference.

00:05:20.628 --> 00:05:23.425
This was right about the time
that I was offered a position

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:24.750
here at Berkeley.

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:26.419
And when I got here,

00:05:26.443 --> 00:05:28.805
I looked up Hubert Dreyfus,

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.756
who's a world-renowned
professor of philosophy,

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.312
And I talked with him
about this and he said,

00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:39.438
"This is one of the oldest
and most central problems in philosophy.

00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:43.479
It goes back to the Skeptics
and up through Descartes.

00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:46.685
It's the issue of epistemology,

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:49.577
the study of how do we know
that something is true."

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:52.625
So he and I started working together,

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:55.520
and we coined a new term:
"telepistemology,"

00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:58.893
the study of knowledge at a distance.

00:05:59.303 --> 00:06:03.794
We invited leading artists,
engineers and philosophers

00:06:03.818 --> 00:06:05.137
to write essays about this,

00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:08.865
and the results are collected
in this book from MIT Press.

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.055
So thanks to this student,

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:15.398
who questioned what everyone else
had assumed to be true,

00:06:15.422 --> 00:06:19.399
this project taught me
an important lesson about life,

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:22.410
which is to always question assumptions.

00:06:23.807 --> 00:06:25.983
Now, the second project
I'll tell you about

00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:27.999
grew out of the Telegarden.

00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:30.844
As it was operating, my students
and I were very interested

00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:33.209
in how people were interacting
with each other,

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:35.290
and what they were doing with the garden.

00:06:35.314 --> 00:06:36.465
So we started thinking:

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:38.457
what if the robot could leave the garden

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.295
and go out into some other
interesting environment?

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:44.060
Like, for example,
what if it could go to a dinner party

00:06:44.084 --> 00:06:45.545
at the White House?

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.068
(Laughter)

00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:51.970
So, because we were interested
more in the system design

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.937
and the user interface
than in the hardware,

00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:56.112
we decided that,

00:06:56.136 --> 00:07:00.623
rather than have a robot replace
the human to go to the party,

00:07:00.647 --> 00:07:02.877
we'd have a human replace the robot.

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:05.139
We called it the Tele-Actor.

00:07:05.978 --> 00:07:07.986
We got a human,

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.118
someone who's very
outgoing and gregarious,

00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:15.397
and she was outfitted with a helmet
with various equipment,

00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:16.705
cameras and microphones,

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.794
and then a backpack with wireless
Internet connection.

00:07:20.882 --> 00:07:23.026
And the idea was that she could go

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.500
into a remote and interesting environment,

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:27.541
and then over the Internet,

00:07:27.565 --> 00:07:30.157
people could experience
what she was experiencing.

00:07:30.736 --> 00:07:33.707
So they could see what she was seeing,

00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:37.014
but then, more importantly,
they could participate,

00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:41.788
by interacting with each other
and coming up with ideas

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:45.781
about what she should do next
and where she should go,

00:07:45.805 --> 00:07:48.011
and then conveying those
to the Tele-Actor.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.490
So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor

00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:54.322
to the Webby Awards in San Francisco.

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:58.369
And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.980
Just before the curtain went
up, I had about 30 seconds

00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:06.746
to explain to Mr. Donaldson
what we were going to do.

00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:11.636
And I said, "The Tele-Actor
is going to be joining you onstage.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.014
This is a new experimental project,

00:08:14.038 --> 00:08:16.633
and people are watching her
on their screens,

00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:19.948
there's cameras involved
and there's microphones

00:08:19.972 --> 00:08:21.758
and she's got an earbud in her ear,

00:08:21.782 --> 00:08:24.099
and people over the network
are giving her advice

00:08:24.123 --> 00:08:25.281
about what to do next."

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:26.700
And he said, "Wait a second.

00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:28.979
That's what I do."

00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:33.980
(Laughter)

00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:35.876
So he loved the concept,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.153
and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage,
she walked right up to him,

00:08:40.177 --> 00:08:42.636
and she gave him a big kiss
right on the lips.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.612
(Laughter)

00:08:44.636 --> 00:08:47.558
We were totally surprised --
we had no idea that would happen.

00:08:47.582 --> 00:08:50.200
And he was great, he just gave her
a big hug in return,

00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:51.881
and it worked out great.

00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:53.945
But that night, as we were packing up,

00:08:53.969 --> 00:08:58.524
I asked the Tele-Actor,
how did the Tele-Directors decide

00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:01.548
that they would give
a kiss to Sam Donaldson?

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:04.592
And she said they hadn't.

00:09:05.274 --> 00:09:07.892
She said, when she was
just about to walk onstage,

00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:10.890
the Tele-Directors still were trying
to agree on what to do,

00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:14.014
and so she just walked onstage
and did what felt most natural.

00:09:14.038 --> 00:09:18.552
(Laughter)

00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:21.668
So, the success
of the Tele-Actor that night

00:09:21.692 --> 00:09:25.945
was due to the fact
that she was a wonderful actor.

00:09:25.969 --> 00:09:28.398
She knew when to trust her instincts.

00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:32.351
And so that project taught me
another lesson about life,

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:36.022
which is that, when in doubt, improvise.

00:09:36.046 --> 00:09:37.712
(Laughter)

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:43.583
Now, the third project
grew out of my experience

00:09:43.607 --> 00:09:45.456
when my father was in the hospital.

00:09:47.284 --> 00:09:50.637
He was undergoing a treatment --
chemotherapy treatments --

00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:54.931
and there's a related treatment
called brachytherapy,

00:09:54.955 --> 00:09:58.743
where tiny, radioactive seeds
are placed into the body

00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:00.501
to treat cancerous tumors.

00:10:01.572 --> 00:10:03.843
And the way it's done,
as you can see here,

00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:08.234
is that surgeons
insert needles into the body

00:10:08.258 --> 00:10:09.573
to deliver the seeds.

00:10:09.974 --> 00:10:13.672
And all these needles
are inserted in parallel.

00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:19.838
So it's very common that some
of the needles penetrate sensitive organs.

00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:27.608
And as a result, the needles damage
these organs, cause damage,

00:10:27.632 --> 00:10:30.041
which leads to trauma and side effects.

00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:32.225
So my students and I wondered:

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:36.771
what if we could modify the system,

00:10:36.795 --> 00:10:39.420
so that the needles
could come in at different angles?

00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:42.238
So we simulated this;

00:10:42.262 --> 00:10:45.707
we developed some optimization
algorithms and we simulated this.

00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:46.882
And we were able to show

00:10:46.906 --> 00:10:49.468
that we are able to avoid
the delicate organs,

00:10:49.492 --> 00:10:54.545
and yet still achieve the coverage
of the tumors with the radiation.

00:10:55.313 --> 00:10:58.787
So now, we're working with doctors at UCSF

00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:01.078
and engineers at Johns Hopkins,

00:11:01.102 --> 00:11:05.064
and we're building a robot
that has a number of --

00:11:05.088 --> 00:11:07.687
it's a specialized design
with different joints

00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:12.034
that can allow the needles to come in
at an infinite variety of angles.

00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:16.205
And as you can see here,
they can avoid delicate organs

00:11:16.229 --> 00:11:18.893
and still reach the targets
they're aiming for.

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:25.004
So, by questioning this assumption
that all the needles have to be parallel,

00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:27.654
this project also taught me
an important lesson:

00:11:28.114 --> 00:11:32.869
When in doubt, when your path
is blocked, pivot.

00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:37.637
And the last project
also has to do with medical robotics.

00:11:38.187 --> 00:11:41.757
And this is something
that's grown out of a system

00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:45.129
called the da Vinci surgical robot.

00:11:45.866 --> 00:11:48.310
And this is a commercially
available device.

00:11:48.334 --> 00:11:51.307
It's being used in over 2,000
hospitals around the world.

00:11:52.013 --> 00:11:56.386
The idea is it allows the surgeon
to operate comfortably

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.187
in his own coordinate frame.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:06.531
Many of the subtasks in surgery are very
routine and tedious, like suturing,

00:12:06.555 --> 00:12:08.822
and currently, all of these are performed

00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:12.713
under the specific and immediate
control of the surgeon.

00:12:13.374 --> 00:12:15.642
So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time.

00:12:16.086 --> 00:12:17.522
And we've been wondering,

00:12:17.546 --> 00:12:21.917
what if we could program the robot
to perform some of these subtasks,

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.322
and thereby free the surgeon

00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:26.581
to focus on the more complicated
parts of the surgery,

00:12:26.605 --> 00:12:29.405
and also cut down on the time
that the surgery would take

00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:32.268
if we could get the robot
to do them a little bit faster?

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.380
Now, it's hard to program a robot
to do delicate things like this.

00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:41.149
But it turns out my colleague
Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley,

00:12:41.173 --> 00:12:46.653
has developed a new set of techniques
for teaching robots from example.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.913
So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters,

00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:53.191
do incredibly interesting,
beautiful acrobatics,

00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:55.182
by watching human experts fly them.

00:12:56.152 --> 00:12:58.058
So we got one of these robots.

00:12:58.082 --> 00:13:00.622
We started working with Pieter
and his students.

00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:04.826
And we asked a surgeon
to perform a task --

00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:07.912
with the robot.

00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:10.961
So what we're doing is asking
the surgeon to perform the task,

00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:13.021
and we record the motions of the robot.

00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:14.471
So here's an example.

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:17.616
I'll use tracing out
a figure eight as an example.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.804
So here's what it looks like
when the robot --

00:13:21.828 --> 00:13:24.896
this is what the robot's path
looks like, those three examples.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.056
Now, those are much better
than what a novice like me could do,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.774
but they're still jerky and imprecise.

00:13:31.798 --> 00:13:34.739
So we record all these examples, the data,

00:13:34.763 --> 00:13:37.624
and then go through a sequence of steps.

00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:41.404
First, we use a technique
called dynamic time warping

00:13:41.428 --> 00:13:42.918
from speech recognition.

00:13:42.942 --> 00:13:46.279
And this allows us to temporally
align all of the examples.

00:13:46.918 --> 00:13:52.120
And then we apply Kalman filtering,
a technique from control theory,

00:13:52.144 --> 00:13:55.113
that allows us to statistically
analyze all the noise

00:13:55.137 --> 00:13:59.259
and extract the desired
trajectory that underlies them.

00:14:01.283 --> 00:14:03.833
Now we take those human demonstrations --

00:14:03.857 --> 00:14:05.532
they're all noisy and imperfect --

00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:08.154
and we extract from them
an inferred task trajectory

00:14:08.178 --> 00:14:10.704
and control sequence for the robot.

00:14:11.181 --> 00:14:13.497
We then execute that on the robot,

00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:15.546
we observe what happens,

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.927
then we adjust the controls,

00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:19.747
using a sequence of techniques
called iterative learning.

00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:24.538
Then what we do is we increase
the velocity a little bit.

00:14:25.244 --> 00:14:28.379
We observe the results,
adjust the controls again,

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.112
and observe what happens.

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:33.303
And we go through this several rounds.

00:14:33.327 --> 00:14:34.508
And here's the result.

00:14:34.968 --> 00:14:36.706
That's the inferred task trajectory,

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.951
and here's the robot
moving at the speed of the human.

00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:42.080
Here's four times the speed of the human.

00:14:42.477 --> 00:14:43.961
Here's seven times.

00:14:45.004 --> 00:14:49.829
And here's the robot operating
at 10 times the speed of the human.

00:14:50.762 --> 00:14:53.663
So we're able to get a robot
to perform a delicate task

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:56.573
like a surgical subtask,

00:14:57.081 --> 00:14:58.962
at 10 times the speed of a human.

00:15:00.185 --> 00:15:02.445
So this project also,

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:04.994
because of its involved
practicing and learning,

00:15:05.018 --> 00:15:06.780
doing something over and over again,

00:15:06.804 --> 00:15:09.381
this project also has a lesson, which is:

00:15:09.405 --> 00:15:11.809
if you want to do something well,

00:15:13.084 --> 00:15:17.524
there's no substitute
for practice, practice, practice.

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:24.673
So these are four of the lessons
that I've learned from robots

00:15:24.697 --> 00:15:25.995
over the years.

00:15:27.312 --> 00:15:32.819
And the field of robotics
has gotten much better over time.

00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:36.595
Nowadays, high school students
can build robots,

00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:39.503
like the industrial robot
my dad and I tried to build.

00:15:40.675 --> 00:15:43.445
But, it's very -- now ...

00:15:43.954 --> 00:15:47.255
And now, I have a daughter,

00:15:47.857 --> 00:15:49.014
named Odessa.

00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:50.926
She's eight years old.

00:15:51.682 --> 00:15:53.331
And she likes robots, too.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.366
Maybe it runs in the family.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.630
(Laughter)

00:15:56.654 --> 00:15:58.749
I wish she could meet my dad.

00:16:00.303 --> 00:16:03.043
And now I get to teach her
how things work,

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:05.297
and we get to build projects together.

00:16:05.321 --> 00:16:08.527
And I wonder what kind of lessons
she'll learn from them.

00:16:10.147 --> 00:16:14.154
Robots are the most human of our machines.

00:16:14.983 --> 00:16:17.937
They can't solve all
of the world's problems,

00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:21.484
but I think they have something
important to teach us.

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:24.277
I invite all of you

00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:27.879
to think about the innovations
that you're interested in,

00:16:28.712 --> 00:16:30.955
the machines that you wish for.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.267
And think about
what they might be telling you.

00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:38.956
Because I have a hunch that many
of our technological innovations,

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.651
the devices we dream about,

00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:45.015
can inspire us to be better humans.

00:16:45.984 --> 00:16:47.135
Thank you.

00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:49.071
(Applause)
