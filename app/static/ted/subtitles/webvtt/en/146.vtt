WEBVTT

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.256
I've always wanted to be a cyborg.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.456
One of my favorite shows as a kid
was "The Six Million Dollar Man,"

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.656
and this is a little bit closer
to the 240-dollar man or so, but --

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.976
(Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.416
At any rate, I would normally
feel very self-conscious and geeky

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.656
wearing this around,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.016
but a few days ago
I saw one world-renowned statistician

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.616
swallowing swords on stage here,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.600
so I figure it's OK amongst this group.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.496
But that's not what I want
to talk about today.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.416
I want to talk about toys,
and the power that I see inherent in them.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.616
When I was a kid,
I attended Montessori school

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.016
up to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.176
And at the time
I didn't think much about it,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.616
but then later, I realized that that was
the high point of my education.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.896
From that point on, everything else
was pretty much downhill.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.856
And it wasn't until later,
as I started making games, that --

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.016
I really actually
think of them more as toys.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.576
People call me a game designer,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.856
but I really think
of these things more as toys.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.236
I started getting very interested
in Maria Montessori and her methods,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.916
and the way she went about things,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.276
and the way she thought it
very valuable for kids

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.836
to discover things on their own

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.036
rather than being taught
these things overtly.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.296
And she would design these toys,
where kids in playing with the toys

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.496
would come to understand
these deep principles

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.096
of life and nature through play.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.136
And since they discovered this,
it stuck with them so much more,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.536
and also they would experience
their own failures.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.056
There was a failure-based aspect
to learning there. It was very important.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.456
And so, the games that I do,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.816
I think of really more
as modern Montessori toys.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.436
And I really kind of want them
to be presented in a way

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.656
to where kids can kind of explore
and discover their own principles.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.845
So a few years ago,

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.436
I started getting very interested
in the SETI program.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.757
And that's the way I work.

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.858
I get interested in different subjects,
I dive in, research them,

00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:39.639
and then try to figure out
how to craft a toy around that,

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:42.640
so that other people can experience
the same sense of discovery

00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:44.703
that I did as I was learning that subject.

00:01:44.727 --> 00:01:46.184
And it led me to astrobiology,

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:48.265
the study of possible life
in the universe.

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.586
And then Drake's equation,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.187
looking at the probability
of life arising on planets,

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.828
how long it might last,
how many planets are out there.

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:57.789
And I started looking
at how interesting Drake's equation was,

00:01:57.813 --> 00:02:00.190
because it spanned
all these different subjects --

00:02:00.214 --> 00:02:04.136
physics, chemistry,
sociology, economics, astronomy.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.896
And another thing that really
impressed me a long time ago

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.895
was "Powers of Ten,"
Charles and Ray Eames' film.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.496
And I started putting those two together
and wondering, could I build a toy

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.856
where kids would trip across
all these interesting principles of life,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.056
as it exists and as it might
go in the future.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.056
Things where you might trip across things

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.416
like the Copernican principle,
the Fermi paradox,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.976
the anthropic principle,
the origin of life.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.176
And so I'm going to show you a toy today
that I've been working on,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.136
that I think of more
as kind of a philosophy toy.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.536
Playing this toy will bring up
philosophical questions in you.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.616
The game is "Spore."
I've been working on it for several years.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.656
It's getting pretty close to finished now.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.057
It occurs at all these different scales,
from very small to very large.

00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:46.218
I'm going to pop in
at the start of the game.

00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:48.699
And you actually start this game
in a drop of water,

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:50.740
as a very, very small
single-cell creature,

00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:54.797
and right off the bat you basically
just have to live, survive, reproduce.

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:57.776
So here we are,
at a very microscopic scale,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.256
swimming around.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.656
And I actually realize
that cells don't have eyes,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.976
but it helps to make it cute.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.856
The players are going to play
through every generation of this species,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.136
and as you play the game,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.256
the creature is actually
growing bit by bit.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.856
And as we start growing,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.936
the camera will
actually start zooming out,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.176
and things that you see
in the background there

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.376
will start slowly
pulling into the foreground,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.816
showing you a little bit of what
you'll be interacting with as you grow.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.976
So as we eat, the camera
starts pulling out,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.976
and then we start interacting
with larger and larger organisms.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.216
We actually play
through many generations here,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.456
at the cellular scale.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.896
I'm going to skip ahead here.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.296
At some point we get larger,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.285
and we actually get
to a macroevolution scale.

00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:40.976
Now, at this point
we're leaving the water,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.736
and one thing that's kind of important
about this game is that, at every level,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.016
the player is designing their creature,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.976
and that's a fundamental aspect of this.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.976
Now, in the evolution game here,
the creature scale,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.576
basically you have to eat,
survive, and then reproduce.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.416
You know, very Darwinian.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.416
One thing we noticed with "The Sims,"
a game I did earlier,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.096
is that players love making stuff.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.296
When they were able
to make stuff in the game,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.537
they had a lot of empathy
in connection to it.

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:07.237
Even if it wasn't as pretty

00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:09.952
as a professional artist
would make for games,

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:11.193
it really stuck with them

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.674
and they really cared
about what would happen to it.

00:04:13.698 --> 00:04:17.128
At this point, we've left the water,
and now with this little creature --

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:19.222
we could bring up
the volume a little bit --

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:21.182
and now we might try to eat.

00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:24.299
We might sneak up
on this little guy over here maybe,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.280
and try and eat him.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.376
OK, well, we fight.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.800
(Creatures grunting)

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.960
OK, we got him.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.480
Now we get a meal.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:40.096
So really, at this part of the game,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.736
what we're doing is we're
running around and surviving,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.696
and also getting to the next generation,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.016
because we're going to play
through every generation of this creature.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.616
We can mate, so I'm going to see

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.200
if one of these creatures
wants to mate with me. Yeah.

00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:58.656
(Creatures grunting)

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.496
We didn't want to replay
actual evolution with humans and all that,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.256
because it's almost more interesting

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.536
to look at alternate
possibilities in evolution.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.816
Evolution is usually presented
as this one path that we took through,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.496
but really it represents
this huge set of possibilities.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.416
Now, once we mate, we click on the egg.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.976
And this is where the game
starts getting interesting,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.416
because one of the things
we really focused on here

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.696
was giving the players
very high-leverage tools,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.296
so that for very little effort,
the player can make something very cool.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.976
And it involves a lot
of intelligence on the tool side.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.576
But basically, this is the editor

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.878
where we're going to design
the next generation.

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:34.936
So it has a little spine.
I can move around, I can extend.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.496
I can also inflate or deflate it
with the mouse wheel,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.856
so you sculpt it like clay.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.216
We have parts here
that I can put on or pull off.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.496
The idea is that the player
can basically design

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.536
anything they can think of in this editor,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.376
and we'll basically bring it to life.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.656
So I might put some limbs
on the character here.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.256
I'll inflate them kind of large.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.240
And in this case
I might decide I'm going to put --

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.640
I'll put mouths on the limbs.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.096
So pretty much players are encouraged
to be very creative in the game.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.416
Here, I'll give it one eye in the middle,
maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.120
And I'll also give it a few legs.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.336
So in some sense

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.776
we want this to feel like an amplifier
for the player's imagination,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.536
so that with a very small number of clicks
a player can create something

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.936
that they didn't really think
was possible before.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.416
This is almost like designing
something like Maya --

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.936
that an eight-year-old can use.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.376
But really the goal here was,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.896
within about a minute,
I wanted somebody to replicate

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.176
what typically takes a pictorial artist
several weeks to create.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.136
OK, now I'll put some hands on it.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.056
OK, so here I've basically
thrown together a little creature.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.160
Let me give it a little weapon
on the tail here, so it can fight.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.496
OK, so that's the complete model.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.656
Now we can actually
go to the painting phase.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.176
At this phase, the program
has some understanding

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.816
of the topology of this creature.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.876
It knows where the backbone is,
where the spine, the limbs are,

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.156
how stripes should run,
how it should be shaded.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.676
And so we're procedurally
generating the texture map,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.576
something a texture artist
would take many days to work on.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.536
And then we can test it out,
and see how it would move around.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.056
And so at this point the computer
is procedurally animating this creature.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.576
It's looking at whatever I've designed.
It will actually bring it to life.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.176
And I can see how it might dance.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.416
(Laughter)

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.800
How it might show emotions,
how it might fight.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.616
So it's acting with its two mouths there.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.496
I can even have it pose for a photo.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.976
Snap a little photo of it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.976
(Laughter)

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.016
So then I bring this back into the game.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.576
It's born, and I play the next generation
of my creature through evolution.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.056
Now again, the empathy
that the players have

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.096
when they create
the content is tremendous.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.896
When players create content in this game,
it's automatically sent up to a server

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.856
and then redistributed
to all the other players transparently.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.016
So in fact, as I'm interacting
in this world with other creatures,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.936
these creatures are transparently
coming from other players as they play.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.616
So the process of playing the game

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.496
is a process of building up
this huge database of content.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.376
And pretty much everything
you're going to see in this game,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.056
there's an editor for
that the player can create,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.679
up through civilization.

00:08:03.703 --> 00:08:06.396
This is my baby. When I eat,
I'll actually start growing.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.456
This is the next generation.
But I'm going to skip ahead here.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.816
Normally what would happen is
these creatures would work their way up,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.296
eventually become intelligent.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.816
I'd start dealing with tribes, cities
and civilizations of them over time.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.056
I'm going to skip way ahead
to the space phase.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.016
Eventually they would go out into space,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.656
and start colonizing
and exploring the universe.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.358
Now, really, in some sense,

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.656
I want the players to be building
this world in their imagination,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.696
and then extracting it from them
with the least amount of pain.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.856
So that's kind of
what these tools are about.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.135
How do we make the gameplay,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.336
you know, basically
the player's imagination amplifier?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.066
And how do we make
these tools, these editors,

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.096
something that are just as fun
as the game itself?

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.376
So this is the planet
that we've been playing on

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.056
up to this point in the game.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.856
So far the entire game has been played
on the surface of this little world here.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.056
At this point we're actually
dealing with a very little toy planet.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.176
Almost, again,
like the Montessori toy idea.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.416
What happens if you give
somebody a toy planet,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.656
and let them play
with a lot of dynamics on it?

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.336
What could they discover?
What might they learn on this?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.376
This world was actually extracted
from the player's imagination.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.776
So, this is the planet
that the player evolved on.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.216
Things like the buildings, the vehicles,
the architecture, civilizations

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.576
were all designed by the player
up to this point.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.776
So here's a little city with some
of our guys walking around in it.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.656
And most games put the player
in the role of Luke Skywalker,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.776
this protagonist
playing through this story.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.936
This is more about putting the player
in the role of George Lucas.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.056
I want them, after they've
played this game,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.296
to have extracted an entire world
that they're now interacting with.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.536
As we pull down here,

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.096
we still have a whole set of creatures
living on the surface of the planet.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.136
All these different
dynamics going on here.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.096
I can look over here, and this is
a little simplified food web

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.816
that's going on with the creatures.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.696
I can open this up and then scan
what exists on the surface.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.076
You get some sense of the diversity
of creatures that were brought in.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.076
Some of these were created by the player,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.696
others by other players,
automatically sent over here.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.436
But there's a very simple
calculation of what's required,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.116
how many plants are required
for the herbivores to live,

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.596
how many herbivores
for the carnivores to eat, etc.,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.276
that you have to balance actively.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.516
Also with this phase,

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.316
we're getting more and more
God-like powers for the player,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.656
and you can experiment
with this planet as a toy.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.456
So I can come in and I can do things,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.576
and just treat this planet
as a lump of clay.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.057
We have very simple
weather systems, simple geology.

00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:23.558
For instance, I could open one of my tools
here and then carve out rivers.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.136
So this whole thing is kind of
like a big lump of clay, a sculpture.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.896
I can also play with the dynamics
in this world over time.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.336
So one of the things I can do

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.736
is start pumping more CO2 gases
into the atmosphere,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.416
and so that's what I'm doing here.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.536
There's actually
a little readout down there

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.360
of our planetary atmosphere,
pressure and temperature.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.856
So as I start pumping in more atmosphere,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.576
we're going to start pushing up
the greenhouse gases here

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.016
and if you'll start noticing,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.446
we start seeing
the ocean levels rise over time.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.936
And our cities
are going to be at risk too,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.976
because a lot of these are coastal cities.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.016
You can see the ocean levels
are rising now

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.316
and as they encroach upon the cities,
I'll start losing cities here.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.596
So basically, I want the players
to be able to experiment and explore

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.156
a huge amount of failure space.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.620
So there goes one city.

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.896
Now, over time, this is
going to heat up the planet.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.616
So at first what we're going to see

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.176
is a global ocean rise
here on this little toy planet,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.217
but then over time --
I can speed it up --

00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:19.338
we'll see the heat impact of that as well.

00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:21.265
Not only will it get hotter,

00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:24.606
but at some point it's going to get so hot
the oceans will evaporate.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.947
They'll go up, and then they'll evaporate,
and that'll be my planet.

00:11:27.971 --> 00:11:29.748
So basically, what we're getting here

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:32.749
is the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"
in about two minutes,

00:11:32.773 --> 00:11:35.910
and that actually brings up
an interesting point about games.

00:11:35.934 --> 00:11:39.094
Now here, our entire oceans
are evaporating off the surface,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.656
and as it keeps getting hotter,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.216
at some point the entire planet
is going to melt down. Here it goes.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.656
So we're not only
simulating biological dynamics --

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.896
food webs and all that --

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.616
but also geologic, you know,
on a very simple core scale.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.545
And what's interesting to me about games

00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:56.176
is that I think we can take
a lot of long-term dynamics

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.216
and compress them
into very short-term experiences.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.136
Because it's so hard for people
to think 50 or 100 years out,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.776
but when you can give them a toy,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.136
and they can experience these
long-term dynamics in just a few minutes,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.496
I think it's an entirely
different point of view,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.296
where we're actually using the game
to remap our intuition.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.656
It's almost in the same way

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.416
that a telescope or microscope
recalibrates your eyesight;

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.176
I think computer simulations
can recalibrate your instinct

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.200
across vast scales of both space and time.

00:12:21.224 --> 00:12:22.856
So here's our little solar system,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.976
as we pull away
from our melted planet here.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.056
We actually have a couple
of other planets in this solar system.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.296
Let's fly to another one.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.776
We're going to have this unlimited
number of worlds you can explore here.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.136
As we move into the future,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.536
and we start going out
into space and doing stuff,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.056
we're drawing a lot
from things like science fiction.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.096
And all my favorite science fiction movies

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.296
I want to play out here
as different dynamics.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.296
This planet actually has some life on it.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.336
Here it is, some indigenous
life down here.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.696
One of the tools
I can eventually earn for my UFO

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.416
is a monolith that I can drop down.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.080
(Laughter)

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.976
Now, as you can see,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.296
these guys are actually
starting to go up and bow to it,

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.336
and over time, once they touch it,
they will become intelligent.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.456
So I can actually
pick a species on a planet

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.856
and then make them sentient.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.016
Now they've actually
gone to tribal dynamics.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.056
And now, because
I'm actually the one here,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.896
I can get out of the UFO and walk up,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.016
and they should be worshipping me
at this point as a god.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.000
At first they're a little freaked out.

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:23.536
OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.576
(Laughter)

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.720
I think I'll leave
before they get hostile.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.936
But we basically want
a diversity of activities

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.616
the players can play through this.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.896
I want to be able to play

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.616
"The Day the Earth Stood Still,"
"2001: A Space Odyssey,"

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.256
"Star Trek," "War Of the Worlds."

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.256
Now, as we pull away from this world --

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.696
we're going to keep
pulling away from the star now.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.536
One of the things that always
frustrated me about astronomy

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.776
when I was a kid

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.936
is how it was always presented
so two-dimensionally and so static.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.656
As we pull away from the star here,

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.176
we're actually going now
out into interstellar space,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.056
and we're getting a sense
of the space around our home star.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.776
What I really wanted to do
is to present this, basically,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.096
as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.096
And also show the dynamics,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.816
and a lot of the interesting objects
that you might find, like, in the Hubble,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.096
at pretty much realistic
frequencies and scales.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.256
So most people
have no idea of the difference

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.656
between an emission nebula
and a planetary nebula.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.936
But these are the things

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.016
that we can put
in this little galaxy here.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.776
So we're flying over here
to what looks like a black hole.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.496
I want to basically have
the entire zoo of Hubble objects

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.376
that people can interact with
and play with, again, as toys.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.816
So here's a little black hole

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.160
that we probably
don't want to get too close to.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.136
But we also have stars and things as well.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.616
If we pull all the way back,
we start seeing the entire galaxy here,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.576
kind of slowly in motion.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.816
Typically, when people present galaxies,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.523
it's always beautiful photos,
but they're always static.

00:14:43.547 --> 00:14:46.436
And when you bring it forward in time
and start animating it,

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.254
it's amazing what a galaxy
would look like fast forwarded.

00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:51.435
This would be about
a million years a second,

00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:54.056
because you have about
one supernova every century.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.416
And so you'd have
this wonderful sparkling thing,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.896
with the disk slowly rotating,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.016
and this is roughly
what it would look like.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.036
Part of this is about bringing
the beauty of the natural world

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.916
to somebody in a very imaginative way,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.276
so that they can start
calibrating their instinct

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.356
across these vast scales
of space and time.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.616
Chris was wondering what kind of gods
the players would become.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.096
Because if you think about it,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.716
you're going to have 15-year-olds,
20-year-olds flying around this universe.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.196
They might be a nurturing god.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.316
They might be bootstrapping
life on planets,

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.436
trying to terraform
and spread civilization.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.696
You might be a vengeful god, conquesting,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.176
because you actually can do that,
you can attack other intelligent races.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.222
You might be a networking god,
building alliances,

00:15:33.246 --> 00:15:37.102
or just curious, going around and wanting
to explore as much as you possibly can.

00:15:37.682 --> 00:15:41.427
But basically, the reason
why I make toys like this

00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:43.713
is because I think
if there's one difference

00:15:43.737 --> 00:15:46.456
I could possibly make in the world,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.856
that I would choose to make,

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.016
it's that I would like
to somehow give people

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.856
just a little bit better calibration
on long-term thinking.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.216
Because I think most of the problems
that our world is facing right now

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.056
are the result of short-term thinking,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.256
and the fact that it is so hard for us
to think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.936
And I think by giving kids toys like this
and letting them replay dynamics,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.056
very long-term dynamics
over the short term,

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.296
and getting some sense
of what we're doing now,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.256
what it's going to be like in 100 years,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.256
I think probably is the most effective
thing I can be doing to help the world.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.947
And so that's why I think
that toys can change the world.

00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:20.171
Thank you.
