00:00:00.493 --> 00:00:02.991
When the Industrial Revolution started,

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:07.073
the amount of carbon sitting
underneath Britain in the form of coal

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:11.083
was as big as the amount of carbon
sitting under Saudi Arabia

00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:12.445
in the form of oil.

00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:15.966
This carbon powered
the Industrial Revolution,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.705
it put the "Great" in Great Britain,

00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:21.013
and led to Britain's temporary
world domination.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:26.506
And then, in 1918,
coal production in Britain peaked,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.297
and has declined ever since.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:33.056
In due course, Britain started using
oil and gas from the North Sea,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.991
and in the year 2000,

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.514
oil and gas production
from the North Sea also peaked,

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.684
and they're now on the decline.

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:44.799
These observations about the finiteness

00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:48.690
of easily accessible, local,
secure fossil fuels,

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:52.377
is a motivation for saying,
"Well, what's next?

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:55.324
What is life after fossil fuels
going to be like?

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:58.814
Shouldn't we be thinking hard
about how to get off fossil fuels?"

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:01.802
Another motivation,
of course, is climate change.

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:04.815
And when people talk
about life after fossil fuels

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.710
and climate change action,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.280
I think there's a lot of fluff,

00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:12.168
a lot of greenwash,
a lot of misleading advertising,

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:16.681
and I feel a duty as a physicist to try
to guide people around the claptrap

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:20.479
and help people understand the actions
that really make a difference,

00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:23.153
and to focus on ideas that do add up.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.589
Let me illustrate this

00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:29.796
with what physicists call
a back-of-envelope calculation.

00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:32.073
We love back-of-envelope calculations.

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:34.168
You ask a question,
write down some numbers,

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:35.355
and get an answer.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:38.579
It may not be very accurate,
but it may make you say, "Hmm."

00:01:38.603 --> 00:01:40.025
So here's a question:

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.252
Imagine if we said, "Oh yes,
we can get off fossil fuels.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:44.944
We'll use biofuels. Problem solved.

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:47.248
Transport ... We don't need oil anymore."

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:53.706
Well, what if we grew
the biofuels for a road

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.504
on the grass verge
at the edge of the road?

00:01:57.274 --> 00:02:01.487
How wide would the verge
have to be for that to work out?

00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:03.159
OK, so let's put in some numbers.

00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:05.893
Let's have our cars go
at 60 miles per hour.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.727
Let's say they do 30 miles per gallon.

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:10.586
That's the European average for new cars.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.263
Let's say the productivity
of biofuel plantations

00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:16.387
is 1,200 liters of biofuel
per hectare per year.

00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:18.982
That's true of European biofuels.

00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:22.891
And let's imagine the cars are spaced
80 meters apart from each other,

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:25.091
and they're perpetually
going along this road.

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:26.955
The length of the road doesn't matter,

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.710
because the longer the road,
the more biofuel plantation.

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.322
What do we do with these numbers?

00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:35.375
Take the first number, divide by the other
three, and get eight kilometers.

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:36.555
And that's the answer.

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.939
That's how wide the plantation
would have to be,

00:02:38.963 --> 00:02:40.814
given these assumptions.

00:02:41.296 --> 00:02:44.029
And maybe that makes you say, "Hmm.

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:46.484
Maybe this isn't going
to be quite so easy."

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.384
And it might make you think,

00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:53.267
perhaps there's an issue to do with areas.

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:57.188
And in this talk, I'd like to talk
about land areas, and ask:

00:02:57.212 --> 00:02:58.695
Is there an issue about areas?

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.379
The answer is going to be yes,
but it depends which country you are in.

00:03:03.403 --> 00:03:05.441
So let's start in the United Kingdom,

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:07.757
since that's where we are today.

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.126
The energy consumption
of the United Kingdom,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.837
the total energy consumption --
not just transport, but everything --

00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:16.364
I like to quantify it in lightbulbs.

00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:19.870
It's as if we've all got
125 lightbulbs on all the time,

00:03:19.894 --> 00:03:23.570
125 kilowatt-hours per day per person

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:26.284
is the energy consumption of the UK.

00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:29.454
So there's 40 lightbulbs'
worth for transport,

00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:31.130
40 lightbulbs' worth for heating,

00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:33.682
and 40 lightbulbs' worth
for making electricity,

00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:35.620
and other things are relatively small,

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:38.277
compared to those three big fish.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.031
It's actually a bigger footprint
if we take into account

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:44.677
the embodied energy in the stuff
we import into our country as well.

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:49.435
And 90 percent of this energy, today,
still comes from fossil fuels,

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.137
and 10 percent, only, from other,
greener -- possibly greener -- sources,

00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:55.134
like nuclear power and renewables.

00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:57.518
So.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:58.799
That's the UK.

00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:04.044
The population density of the UK
is 250 people per square kilometer.

00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:07.330
I'm now going to show you other countries
by these same two measures.

00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:10.490
On the vertical axis, I'm going
to show you how many lightbulbs --

00:04:10.514 --> 00:04:12.954
what our energy consumption per person is.

00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:15.097
We're at 125 lightbulbs per person,

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:18.735
and that little blue dot there
is showing you the land area

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.449
of the United Kingdom.

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:23.262
The population density
is on the horizontal axis,

00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:26.009
and we're 250 people per square kilometer.

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.602
Let's add European countries in blue,

00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:31.127
and you can see there's quite a variety.

00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:34.228
I should emphasize,
both of these axes are logarithmic;

00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:36.807
as you go from one gray bar
to the next gray bar,

00:04:36.831 --> 00:04:38.586
you're going up a factor of 10.

00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:41.888
Next, let's add Asia in red,

00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:44.398
the Middle East and North Africa in green,

00:04:45.413 --> 00:04:47.806
sub-Saharan Africa in blue,

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:50.847
black is South America,

00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:54.239
purple is Central America,

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:57.788
and then in pukey-yellow,
we have North America,

00:04:57.812 --> 00:04:59.529
Australia and New Zealand.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.350
You can see the great diversity
of population densities

00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:05.961
and of per capita consumptions.

00:05:06.317 --> 00:05:08.556
Countries are different from each other.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.136
Top left, we have Canada and Australia,
with enormous land areas,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.648
very high per capita consumption --
200 or 300 lightbulbs per person --

00:05:16.672 --> 00:05:19.509
and very low population densities.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.492
Top right: Bahrain has
the same energy consumption

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:25.499
per person, roughly, as Canada --

00:05:25.523 --> 00:05:27.765
over 300 lightbulbs per person,

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.811
but their population density
is a factor of 300 times greater,

00:05:30.835 --> 00:05:32.664
1,000 people per square kilometer.

00:05:32.688 --> 00:05:37.565
Bottom right: Bangladesh has
the same population density as Bahrain,

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.440
but consumes 100 times less per person.

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:43.662
Bottom left: well, there's no one.

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:45.782
But there used to be
a whole load of people.

00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:47.759
Here's another message from this diagram.

00:05:47.783 --> 00:05:51.149
I've added on little blue tails
behind Sudan, Libya,

00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:52.684
China, India, Bangladesh.

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:54.843
That's 15 years of progress.

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:57.388
Where were they 15 years ago,
and where are they now?

00:05:57.412 --> 00:05:58.570
And the message is,

00:05:58.594 --> 00:06:01.467
most countries are going to the right,
and they're going up.

00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.638
Up and to the right:
bigger population density

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:05.602
and higher per capita consumption.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:09.581
So, we may be off in the top
right-hand corner, slightly unusual,

00:06:09.605 --> 00:06:11.992
the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany,

00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:13.986
Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands,

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.375
and a bunch of other
slightly odd countries,

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:20.704
but many other countries are coming
up and to the right to join us.

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:22.771
So we're a picture, if you like,

00:06:22.795 --> 00:06:24.770
of what the future energy consumption

00:06:24.794 --> 00:06:27.566
might be looking
like in other countries, too.

00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:31.892
I've also added in this diagram
now some pink lines

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:33.805
that go down and to the right.

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:37.670
Those are lines of equal
power consumption per unit area,

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:39.765
which I measure in watts per square meter.

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.636
So, for example, the middle line there,
0.1 watts per square meter,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.512
is the energy consumption
per unit area of Saudi Arabia,

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:51.717
Norway, Mexico in purple,
and Bangladesh 15 years ago.

00:06:52.637 --> 00:06:55.826
Half of the world's population
lives in countries

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.955
that are already above that line.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.902
The United Kingdom is consuming
1.25 watts per square meter.

00:07:04.926 --> 00:07:07.948
So is Germany, and Japan
is consuming a bit more.

00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:13.188
So, let's now say why this is relevant.

00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:14.599
Why is it relevant?

00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:17.489
Well, we can measure
renewables in the same units

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:20.318
and other forms of power
production in the same units.

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:23.471
Renewables is one of the leading ideas

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:27.469
for how we could get off
our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit.

00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:29.214
So here come some renewables.

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:31.898
Energy crops deliver
half a watt per square meter

00:07:31.922 --> 00:07:33.279
in European climates.

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:35.860
What does that mean?

00:07:35.884 --> 00:07:37.866
You might have anticipated that result,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.078
given what I told you about the biofuel
plantation a moment ago.

00:07:41.102 --> 00:07:44.098
Well, we consume 1.25 watts
per square meter.

00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:45.279
What this means is,

00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:48.690
even if you covered the whole
of the United Kingdom with energy crops,

00:07:48.714 --> 00:07:51.522
you couldn't match
today's energy consumption.

00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:56.470
Wind power produces a bit more --
2.5 watts per square meter.

00:07:56.494 --> 00:08:00.507
But that's only twice as big
as 1.25 watts per square meter.

00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:05.165
So that means if you wanted, literally,
to produce total energy consumption

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:07.420
in all forms, on average, from wind farms,

00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:10.076
you need wind farms
half the area of the UK.

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:15.000
I've got data to back up
all these assertions, by the way.

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:17.552
Next, let's look at solar power.

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:20.137
Solar panels, when you put them on a roof,

00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:24.476
deliver about 20 watts
per square meter in England.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.282
If you really want to get
a lot from solar panels,

00:08:28.306 --> 00:08:31.110
you need to adopt the traditional
Bavarian farming method,

00:08:31.134 --> 00:08:32.485
where you leap off the roof,

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:35.013
and coat the countryside
with solar panels, too.

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:38.233
Solar parks, because of the gaps
between the panels, deliver less.

00:08:38.257 --> 00:08:41.664
They deliver about 5 watts
per square meter of land area.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.990
And here's a solar park
in Vermont, with real data,

00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:47.538
delivering 4.2 watts per square meter.

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:50.968
Remember where we are,
1.25 watts per square meter,

00:08:50.992 --> 00:08:54.043
wind farms 2.5, solar parks about five.

00:08:54.897 --> 00:08:58.327
So whichever of those renewables you pick,

00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:01.900
the message is, whatever mix
of those renewables you're using,

00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:04.105
if you want to power the UK on them,

00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:06.230
you're going to need
to cover something like

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.112
20 percent or 25 percent of the country

00:09:09.136 --> 00:09:10.775
with those renewables.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.662
I'm not saying that's a bad idea;
we just need to understand the numbers.

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:17.258
I'm absolutely not anti-renewables.
I love renewables.

00:09:17.282 --> 00:09:18.918
But I'm also pro-arithmetic.

00:09:18.942 --> 00:09:20.647
(Laughter)

00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.803
Concentrating solar power in deserts
delivers larger powers per unit area,

00:09:24.827 --> 00:09:27.178
because you don't have
the problem of clouds.

00:09:27.202 --> 00:09:30.406
So, this facility delivers
14 watts per square meter;

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.141
this one 10 watts per square meter;

00:09:32.165 --> 00:09:34.921
and this one in Spain,
5 watts per square meter.

00:09:34.945 --> 00:09:37.119
Being generous
to concentrating solar power,

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:40.807
I think it's perfectly credible it could
deliver 20 watts per square meter.

00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:41.997
So that's nice.

00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:44.573
Of course, Britain
doesn't have any deserts.

00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:46.111
Yet.

00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:47.820
(Laughter)

00:09:47.844 --> 00:09:50.209
So here's a summary so far:

00:09:51.035 --> 00:09:53.659
All renewables, much
as I love them, are diffuse.

00:09:53.683 --> 00:09:55.722
They all have a small power per unit area,

00:09:55.746 --> 00:09:57.541
and we have to live with that fact.

00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:03.563
And that means, if you do want renewables
to make a substantial difference

00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:05.375
for a country like the United Kingdom

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.491
on the scale of today's consumption,

00:10:07.515 --> 00:10:11.916
you need to be imagining renewable
facilities that are country-sized.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.253
Not the entire country,

00:10:13.277 --> 00:10:16.644
but a fraction of the country,
a substantial fraction.

00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:20.231
There are other options
for generating power as well,

00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:21.939
which don't involve fossil fuels.

00:10:21.963 --> 00:10:25.118
So there's nuclear power,
and on this ordinance survey map,

00:10:25.142 --> 00:10:28.881
you can see there's a Sizewell B
inside a blue square kilometer.

00:10:28.905 --> 00:10:30.908
That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer,

00:10:30.932 --> 00:10:33.357
which works out to 1,000 watts
per square meter.

00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:35.517
So by this particular metric,

00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:40.736
nuclear power isn't
as intrusive as renewables.

00:10:41.322 --> 00:10:43.317
Of course, other metrics matter, too,

00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:46.051
and nuclear power has
all sorts of popularity problems.

00:10:46.964 --> 00:10:49.001
But the same goes for renewables as well.

00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:51.853
Here's a photograph of a consultation
exercise in full swing

00:10:51.877 --> 00:10:54.565
in the little town of Penicuik
just outside Edinburgh,

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:57.083
and you can see the children
of Penicuik celebrating

00:10:57.107 --> 00:10:59.477
the burning of the effigy of the windmill.

00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:00.660
So --

00:11:00.684 --> 00:11:01.734
(Laughter)

00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:03.087
People are anti-everything,

00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:05.769
and we've got to keep
all the options on the table.

00:11:06.328 --> 00:11:09.967
What can a country like the UK
do on the supply side?

00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:12.910
Well, the options are,
I'd say, these three:

00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:14.112
power renewables,

00:11:14.136 --> 00:11:17.847
and recognizing that they need
to be close to country-sized;

00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:19.117
other people's renewables,

00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:21.268
so we could go back and talk very politely

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:24.329
to the people in the top left-hand side
of the diagram and say,

00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:26.604
"Uh, we don't want
renewables in our backyard,

00:11:26.628 --> 00:11:29.222
but, um, please could we put
them in yours instead?"

00:11:29.246 --> 00:11:31.211
And that's a serious option.

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:34.819
It's a way for the world
to handle this issue.

00:11:34.843 --> 00:11:38.975
So countries like Australia,
Russia, Libya, Kazakhstan,

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.999
could be our best friends
for renewable production.

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:45.392
And a third option is nuclear power.

00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:47.632
So that's some supply-side options.

00:11:47.656 --> 00:11:50.948
In addition to the supply levers
that we can push --

00:11:50.972 --> 00:11:53.007
and remember, we need large amounts,

00:11:53.031 --> 00:11:56.558
because at the moment, we get 90 percent
of our energy from fossil fuels --

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:57.942
in addition to those levers,

00:11:57.966 --> 00:12:01.017
we could talk about other ways
of solving this issue.

00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:04.437
Namely, we could reduce demand,
and that means reducing population --

00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:06.276
I'm not sure how to do that --

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.112
or reducing per capita consumption.

00:12:09.136 --> 00:12:11.599
So let's talk about three more big levers

00:12:11.623 --> 00:12:13.949
that could really help
on the consumption side.

00:12:13.973 --> 00:12:15.127
First, transport.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.694
Here are the physics principles

00:12:16.718 --> 00:12:19.768
that tell you how to reduce
the energy consumption of transport.

00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:22.238
People often say,
"Technology can answer everything.

00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:25.038
We can make vehicles
that are 100 times more efficient."

00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:27.042
And that's almost true. Let me show you.

00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:29.534
The energy consumption
of this typical tank here

00:12:29.558 --> 00:12:32.982
is 80 kilowatt hours
per hundred person kilometers.

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:36.801
That's the average European car.

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:38.498
Eighty kilowatt hours.

00:12:38.522 --> 00:12:40.610
Can we make something 100 times better

00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:42.947
by applying the physics
principles I just listed?

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:44.614
Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle.

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:47.284
It's 80 times better
in energy consumption,

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.532
and it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.

00:12:49.556 --> 00:12:51.694
(Laughter)

00:12:51.718 --> 00:12:53.585
And there are other options in between,

00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:55.736
because maybe the lady
in the tank would say,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.916
"No, that's a lifestyle change.
Don't change my lifestyle, please."

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.587
We could persuade her to take a train,
still a lot more efficient than a car,

00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:04.386
but that might be a lifestyle change.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.994
Or there's the EcoCAR, top-left.

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:09.753
It comfortably accommodates one teenager
and it's shorter than a traffic cone,

00:13:09.777 --> 00:13:11.813
and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle,

00:13:11.837 --> 00:13:14.877
as long as you drive it
at 15 miles per hour.

00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:17.526
In between, perhaps
some more realistic options

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.515
on the transport lever
are electric vehicles,

00:13:20.539 --> 00:13:22.918
so electric bikes
and electric cars in the middle,

00:13:22.942 --> 00:13:27.968
perhaps four times as energy efficient
as the standard petrol-powered tank.

00:13:28.778 --> 00:13:30.676
Next, there's the heating lever.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.191
Heating is a third of our energy
consumption in Britain,

00:13:34.215 --> 00:13:36.288
and quite a lot of that
is going into homes

00:13:36.312 --> 00:13:37.695
and other buildings,

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:39.696
doing space heating and water heating.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.004
So here's a typical crappy British house.

00:13:42.028 --> 00:13:44.747
It's my house, with a Ferrari out front.

00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:45.836
(Laughter)

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.013
What can we do to it?

00:13:47.037 --> 00:13:50.698
Well, the laws of physics
are written up there,

00:13:50.722 --> 00:13:55.970
which describe how the power
consumption for heating

00:13:55.994 --> 00:13:57.902
is driven by the things you can control.

00:13:57.926 --> 00:14:00.820
The things you can control
are the temperature difference

00:14:00.844 --> 00:14:02.527
between the inside and the outside.

00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:05.165
There's this remarkable technology
called a thermostat:

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:06.925
you grasp it, rotate it to the left,

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:09.478
and your energy consumption
in the home will decrease.

00:14:09.502 --> 00:14:12.605
I've tried it. It works.
Some people call it a lifestyle change.

00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:13.713
(Laughter)

00:14:13.737 --> 00:14:17.217
You can also get the fluff men
in to reduce the leakiness

00:14:17.241 --> 00:14:20.210
of your building -- put fluff
in the walls, fluff in the roof,

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:22.028
a new front door, and so forth.

00:14:23.452 --> 00:14:26.037
The sad truth is,
this will save you money.

00:14:26.061 --> 00:14:27.401
That's not sad, that's good.

00:14:27.425 --> 00:14:28.603
But the sad truth is,

00:14:28.627 --> 00:14:31.826
it'll only get about 25 percent
of the leakiness of your building

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.545
if you do these things,
which are good ideas.

00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:37.828
If you really want to get a bit closer
to Swedish building standards

00:14:37.852 --> 00:14:39.502
with a crappy house like this,

00:14:39.526 --> 00:14:42.972
you need to be putting
external insulation on the building,

00:14:42.996 --> 00:14:45.268
as shown by this block of flats in London.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:49.657
You can also deliver heat
more efficiently using heat pumps,

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:53.151
which use a smaller bit
of high-grade energy like electricity

00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:55.740
to move heat from your garden
into your house.

00:14:56.676 --> 00:14:59.046
The third demand-side option
I want to talk about,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.216
the third way to reduce energy
consumption is: read your meters.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.069
People talk a lot about smart meters,

00:15:04.093 --> 00:15:05.440
but you can do it yourself.

00:15:05.464 --> 00:15:07.389
Use your own eyes and be smart.

00:15:07.413 --> 00:15:11.076
Read your meter, and if you're anything
like me, it'll change your life.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.532
Here's a graph I made.

00:15:12.556 --> 00:15:14.700
I was writing a book
about sustainable energy,

00:15:14.724 --> 00:15:15.878
and a friend asked me,

00:15:15.902 --> 00:15:17.716
"How much energy do you use at home?"

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.760
I was embarrassed; I didn't actually know.

00:15:19.784 --> 00:15:21.985
And so I started reading
the meter every week.

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:25.801
The old meter readings are shown
in the top half of the graph,

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:28.050
and then 2007 is shown
in green at the bottom.

00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:30.396
That was when I was reading
the meter every week.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.586
And my life changed,

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.965
because I started doing experiments
and seeing what made a difference.

00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:36.394
My gas consumption plummeted,

00:15:36.418 --> 00:15:38.637
because I started tinkering
with the thermostat

00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:40.460
and the timing on the heating system,

00:15:40.484 --> 00:15:42.697
and I knocked more than half
off my gas bills.

00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:45.604
There's a similar story
for my electricity consumption,

00:15:45.628 --> 00:15:49.190
where switching off the DVD
players, the stereos,

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:52.008
the computer peripherals
that were on all the time,

00:15:52.032 --> 00:15:54.227
and just switching them on
when I needed them,

00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:56.876
knocked another third
off my electricity bills, too.

00:15:58.142 --> 00:15:59.908
So we need a plan that adds up.

00:15:59.932 --> 00:16:02.522
I've described for you six big levers.

00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:03.712
We need big action,

00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:06.498
because we get 90 percent
of our energy from fossil fuels,

00:16:06.522 --> 00:16:10.568
and so you need to push hard
on most, if not all, of these levers.

00:16:11.288 --> 00:16:13.574
Most of these levers
have popularity problems,

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:17.264
and if there is a lever
you don't like the use of,

00:16:17.288 --> 00:16:21.105
well, please do bear in mind
that means you need even stronger effort

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:23.010
on the other levers.

00:16:23.456 --> 00:16:26.607
So I'm a strong advocate
of having grown-up conversations

00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:28.892
that are based on numbers and facts.

00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:32.692
And I want to close with this map
that just visualizes for you

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:36.253
the requirement of land and so forth

00:16:36.277 --> 00:16:39.341
in order to get just
16 lightbulbs per person

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:42.053
from four of the big possible sources.

00:16:42.474 --> 00:16:45.634
So, if you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs --

00:16:45.658 --> 00:16:49.979
remember, today our total energy
consumption is 125 lightbulbs' worth --

00:16:50.003 --> 00:16:52.226
if you wanted 16 from wind,

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.077
this map visualizes a solution for the UK.

00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:59.258
It's got 160 wind farms,
each 100 square kilometers in size,

00:16:59.282 --> 00:17:03.166
and that would be a twentyfold increase
over today's amount of wind.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.098
Nuclear power:
to get 16 lightbulbs per person,

00:17:06.122 --> 00:17:09.211
you'd need two gigawatts
at each of the purple dots on the map.

00:17:09.235 --> 00:17:13.418
That's a fourfold increase
over today's levels of nuclear power.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.767
Biomass: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,

00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:21.053
you'd need a land area something
like three and a half Wales' worth,

00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:24.405
either in our country,
or in someone else's country,

00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:26.472
possibly Ireland, possibly somewhere else.

00:17:26.496 --> 00:17:27.575
(Laughter)

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.390
And a fourth supply-side option:

00:17:29.414 --> 00:17:32.131
concentrating solar power
in other people's deserts.

00:17:32.554 --> 00:17:34.993
If you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs' worth,

00:17:35.017 --> 00:17:38.032
then we're talking
about these eight hexagons

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:39.367
down at the bottom right.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:43.616
The total area of those hexagons
is two Greater London's worth

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.729
of someone else's Sahara,

00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:48.760
and you'll need power lines
all the way across Spain and France

00:17:48.784 --> 00:17:52.154

00:17:52.595 --> 00:17:53.745
(Laughter)

00:17:53.769 --> 00:17:55.363
We need a plan that adds up.

00:17:56.295 --> 00:17:58.797
We need to stop shouting
and start talking.

00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:04.432
And if we can have
a grown-up conversation,

00:18:04.456 --> 00:18:06.917
make a plan that adds up and get building,

00:18:06.941 --> 00:18:09.945
maybe this low-carbon revolution
will actually be fun.

00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:11.707
Thank you very much for listening.

00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:14.237
(Applause)
