00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:02.955
The great texts of the ancient world

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.270
don't survive to us in their original form.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.789
They survive because medieval scribes copied them

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.788
and copied them and copied them.

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:14.438
And so it is with Archimedes,

00:00:14.438 --> 00:00:16.204
the great Greek mathematician.

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:19.206
Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.904
we know about because of just three books,

00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:23.820
and they're called A, B and C.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.653
And A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:31.456
And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:37.288
about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:41.585
Now Codex C was only discovered in 1906,

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.134
and it landed on my desk in Baltimore

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:48.260
on the 19th of January, 1999.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.678
And this is Codex C here.

00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:55.847
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.297
It's buried treasure.

00:00:57.297 --> 00:00:59.632
Because this book is actually a prayer book.

00:00:59.632 --> 00:01:02.596
It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:06.213
on the 14th of April, 1229.

00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:08.698
And to make his prayer book he used parchment.

00:01:08.698 --> 00:01:11.113
But he didn't use new parchment,

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:14.427
he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts,

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:16.164
and there were seven of them.

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:19.647
And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven.

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:25.114
He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:28.497
He erased all of their texts,

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:30.915
and then he cut the sheets down in the middle,

00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:33.159
he shuffled them up,

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.077
and he rotated them 90 degrees,

00:01:35.077 --> 00:01:37.129
and he wrote prayers on top of these books.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:38.826
And essentially these seven manuscripts

00:01:38.826 --> 00:01:43.174
disappeared for 700 years, and we have a prayer book.

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:46.423
The prayer book was discovered by this guy,

00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:49.150
Johan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.591
And with just a magnifying glass,

00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:53.475
he transcribed as much of the text as he could.

00:01:53.475 --> 00:01:56.657
And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript

00:01:56.657 --> 00:01:58.425
that were unique texts.

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:00.025
They weren't in A and B at all;

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:01.723
they were completely new texts by Archimedes,

00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:04.958
and they were called "The Method" and "The Stomachion."

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.227
And it became a world famous manuscript.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.042
Now it should be clear by now

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:11.756
that this book is in bad condition.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:15.226
It got in worse condition in the 20th century

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:16.958
after Heiberg saw it.

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.475
Forgeries were painted over it,

00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:21.558
and it suffered very badly from mold.

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:25.308
This book is the definition of a write-off.

00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:27.042
It's the sort of book

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.707
that you thought would be in an institution.

00:02:29.707 --> 00:02:31.893
But it's not in an institution,

00:02:31.893 --> 00:02:36.525
it was bought by a private owner in 1998.

00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:38.275
Why did he buy this book?

00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:41.812
Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe.

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:45.058
He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous.

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:49.724
He wanted to make that which was expensive free.

00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:52.859
And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle.

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.391
Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek,

00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:00.075
but they should have the chance to do it.

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:03.374
So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes,

00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:05.510
and he promised to pay for all the work.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.208
And it was an expensive job,

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.678
but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think

00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:12.843
because these people, they didn't come from money,

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:14.662
they came from Archimedes.

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:16.378
And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.

00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:18.561
They came from particle physics,

00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:20.127
they came from classical philology,

00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:22.095
they came from book conservation,

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:24.677
they came from ancient mathematics,

00:03:24.677 --> 00:03:26.594
they came from data management,

00:03:26.594 --> 00:03:29.511
they came from scientific imaging and program management.

00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:33.067
And they got together to work on this manuscript.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:36.878
The first problem was a conservation problem.

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:39.311
And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with:

00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.511
There was glue on the spine of the book.

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:43.712
And if you look at this photograph carefully,

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:45.760
the bottom half of this is rather brown.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.128
And that glue is hide glue.

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:48.513
Now if you're a conservator,

00:03:48.513 --> 00:03:50.645
you can take off this glue reasonably easily.

00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:54.010
The top half is Elmer's wood glue.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.127
It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion

00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:58.794
that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.

00:03:58.794 --> 00:04:01.960
And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.311
And so before we could start imaging Archimedes,

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:06.760
we had to take this book apart.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.611
So it took four years to take apart.

00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:13.144
And this is a rare action shot, ladies and gentlemen.

00:04:13.144 --> 00:04:15.915
(Laughter)

00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:20.181
Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax,

00:04:20.181 --> 00:04:22.416
because this was used in the liturgical services

00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:24.157
of the Greek Orthodox Church

00:04:24.157 --> 00:04:25.468
and they'd used candle wax.

00:04:25.468 --> 00:04:27.331
And the candle wax was dirty,

00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:28.564
and we couldn't image through the wax.

00:04:28.564 --> 00:04:31.899
So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax.

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:33.801
It's hard to tell you exactly

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:36.515
how bad this condition of this book is,

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:39.281
but it came out in little bits very often.

00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:41.631
And normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits,

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:44.631
but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.

00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:46.930
So, tiny fragments

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.671
we actually managed to put back in the right place.

00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:55.381
Then, having done that, we started to image the manuscript.

00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:56.881
And we imaged the manuscript

00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:58.909
in 14 different wavebands of light.

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.815
Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light,

00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:04.031
you see different things.

00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:05.598
And here is an image of a page

00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:08.115
imaged in 14 different wavebands of light.

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:10.248
But none of them worked.

00:05:10.248 --> 00:05:14.665
So what we did was we processed the images together,

00:05:14.665 --> 00:05:17.965
and we put two images into one blank screen.

00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:20.798
And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript.

00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:22.614
And the image on the left

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:23.965
is the normal red image.

00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:25.877
And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.

00:05:25.877 --> 00:05:27.017
And in the image on the right

00:05:27.017 --> 00:05:29.465
you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:32.447
If you merge them together into one digital canvas,

00:05:32.447 --> 00:05:35.265
the parchment is bright in both images

00:05:35.265 --> 00:05:37.140
and it comes out bright.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.156
The prayer book is dark in both images

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:41.853
and it comes out dark.

00:05:41.853 --> 00:05:45.204
The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.

00:05:45.204 --> 00:05:47.604
And it'll come out dark but red,

00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:49.871
and then you can start to read it rather clearly.

00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:52.713
And that's what it looks like.

00:05:52.713 --> 00:05:56.055
Now that's a before and after image,

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:59.037
but you don't read the image on the screen like that.

00:05:59.037 --> 00:06:01.656
You zoom in and you zoom in

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:05.204
and you zoom in and you zoom in,

00:06:05.204 --> 00:06:07.272
and you can just read it now.

00:06:07.272 --> 00:06:13.620
(Applause)

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.200
If you process the same two images in a different way,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.770
you can actually get rid of the prayer book text.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.788
And this is terribly important,

00:06:20.788 --> 00:06:23.771
because the diagrams in the manuscript

00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:26.238
are the unique source for the diagrams

00:06:26.238 --> 00:06:29.055
that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:32.094
And there we are, I can give them to you.

00:06:32.094 --> 00:06:34.438
With this kind of imaging --

00:06:34.438 --> 00:06:37.104
this kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging --

00:06:37.104 --> 00:06:39.704
we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.

00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:41.557
How were we going to do that?

00:06:41.557 --> 00:06:43.520
Well we took the manuscript,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.807
and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:50.821
So an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left

00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:54.673
and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom.

00:06:54.673 --> 00:06:56.671
And that electron disappears.

00:06:56.671 --> 00:07:00.306
And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out

00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:02.788
jumps in and takes its place.

00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:04.221
And when it takes its place,

00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:07.055
it sheds electromagnetic radiation.

00:07:07.055 --> 00:07:08.487
It sheds an X-ray.

00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:11.138
And this X-ray is specific in its wavelength

00:07:11.138 --> 00:07:13.020
to the atom that it hits.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.188
And what we wanted to get

00:07:15.188 --> 00:07:16.921
was the iron.

00:07:16.921 --> 00:07:18.788
Because the ink was written in iron.

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:20.471
And if we can map

00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:23.055
where this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from,

00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:25.121
we can map all the iron on the page,

00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:27.720
then theoretically we can read the image.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.055
The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.

00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:35.429
So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:36.871
in California,

00:07:36.871 --> 00:07:38.439
which is a particle accelerator.

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:40.171
Electrons go around one way,

00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:41.788
positrons go around the other.

00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:43.104
They meet in the middle,

00:07:43.104 --> 00:07:45.540
and they create subatomic particles

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.770
like the charm quark and the tau lepton.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.792
Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam.

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:54.340
But as the electrons go round at the speed of light,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.607
they shed X-rays.

00:07:55.607 --> 00:07:58.257
And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system.

00:07:58.257 --> 00:08:00.206
This is called synchrotron radiation,

00:08:00.206 --> 00:08:02.024
and it's normally used to look at things

00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:03.691
like proteins and that sort of thing.

00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:07.688
But we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms,

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:10.557
so that we could read the page from before and after.

00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:12.855
And lo and behold, we found that we could do it.

00:08:12.855 --> 00:08:16.303
It took about 17 minutes to do a single page.

00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:18.958
So what did we discover?

00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.140
Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.943
is called "The Stomachion."

00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:25.357
And this didn't exist in Codices A and B.

00:08:25.357 --> 00:08:27.776
And we knew that it involved this square.

00:08:27.776 --> 00:08:29.569
And this is a perfect square,

00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:31.590
and it's divided into 14 bits.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.373
But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits.

00:08:34.373 --> 00:08:36.557
And now we think we know.

00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:38.324
He was trying to work out

00:08:38.324 --> 00:08:40.857
how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits

00:08:40.857 --> 00:08:43.184
and still make a perfect square.

00:08:43.184 --> 00:08:46.686
Anyone want to guess the answer?

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:52.048
It's 17,152 divided into 536 families.

00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:54.415
And the important point about this

00:08:54.415 --> 00:08:58.129
is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics.

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:01.893
And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics.

00:09:01.893 --> 00:09:05.128
The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.497
is that we looked at the other manuscripts

00:09:07.497 --> 00:09:08.915
that the palimpsester had made,

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:11.481
the scribe had made his book out of,

00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:14.413
and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides.

00:09:14.413 --> 00:09:18.781
Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.

00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:21.198
He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes.

00:09:21.198 --> 00:09:25.597
And in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together

00:09:25.597 --> 00:09:27.281
decided that they wanted to stand up

00:09:27.281 --> 00:09:29.281
to the military might of Philip of Macedon.

00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:32.930
So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.198
This was a bad idea,

00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:37.631
because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great,

00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:39.914
and they lost the battle of Chaeronea.

00:09:39.914 --> 00:09:42.632
Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world;

00:09:42.632 --> 00:09:45.382
Hyperides found himself on trial for treason.

00:09:45.382 --> 00:09:48.982
And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial --

00:09:48.982 --> 00:09:50.130
and it's a great speech:

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.398
"Best of all," he says, "is to win.

00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:54.132
But if you can't win,

00:09:54.132 --> 00:09:56.173
then you should fight for a noble cause,

00:09:56.173 --> 00:09:57.748
because then you'll be remembered.

00:09:57.748 --> 00:09:59.346
Consider the Spartans.

00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:01.214
They won enumerable victories,

00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:03.046
but no one remembers what they are

00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:05.181
because they were all fought for selfish ends.

00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:08.747
The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers

00:10:08.747 --> 00:10:10.463
is the the battle of Thermopylae

00:10:10.463 --> 00:10:12.466
where they were butchered to a man,

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:14.398
but fought for the freedom of Greece."

00:10:14.398 --> 00:10:16.663
It was such a great speech

00:10:16.663 --> 00:10:20.398
that the Athenian law courts let him off.

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:22.464
He lived for another 10 years,

00:10:22.464 --> 00:10:25.115
then the Macedonian faction caught up with him.

00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:27.699
They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory,

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:31.130
and no one knows what they did with his body.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.281
So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity,

00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:36.263
speaking to us, not from the grave,

00:10:36.263 --> 00:10:37.741
because his grave doesn't exist,

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:39.514
but from the Athenian law courts.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.163
Now I should say at this point

00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:43.930
that normally when you're looking

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.926
at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off,

00:10:45.926 --> 00:10:47.412
you don't find unique texts.

00:10:47.412 --> 00:10:50.514
And to find two in one manuscript is really something.

00:10:50.514 --> 00:10:53.731
To find three is completely weird.

00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:55.412
And we found three.

00:10:55.412 --> 00:10:56.678
Aristotle's "Categories"

00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:59.131
is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy.

00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:03.547
And we found a third century A.D. commentary on it,

00:11:03.547 --> 00:11:06.731
possibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry.

00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:08.929
Now all this data that we collected,

00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:11.464
all the images, all the raw images,

00:11:11.464 --> 00:11:13.814
all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing

00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:17.300
have been put online under a Creative Commons license

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.214
for anyone to use for any commercial purpose.

00:11:20.214 --> 00:11:26.747
(Applause)

00:11:26.747 --> 00:11:30.051
Why did the owner of the manuscript do this?

00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:33.797
He did this because he understands data as well as books.

00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:35.132
Now the thing to do with books,

00:11:35.132 --> 00:11:37.263
if you want to ensure their long-term utility,

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.479
is to hide them away in closets

00:11:39.479 --> 00:11:41.279
and let very few people look at them.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:43.698
The thing to do with data, if you want it to survive,

00:11:43.698 --> 00:11:46.999
is to let it out and have everybody have it

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:50.098
with as little control on that data as possible.

00:11:50.098 --> 00:11:51.262
And that's what he did.

00:11:51.262 --> 00:11:54.690
And institutions can learn from this.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.242
Because institutions at the moment

00:11:57.242 --> 00:12:00.299
confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing.

00:12:00.299 --> 00:12:02.491
And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web,

00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:05.962
at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site

00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:08.630
or the University Library of X's site,

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.529
which is about the most boring way

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.306
in which you can deal with digital data.

00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:15.299
What you want to do is to aggregate it all together.

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:18.396
Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future

00:12:18.396 --> 00:12:20.682
isn't going to be built by institutions.

00:12:20.682 --> 00:12:23.790
It's going to be built by users,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.564
by people who get this data together,

00:12:25.564 --> 00:12:29.099
by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps

00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:30.731
from wherever they come from,

00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:32.531
all sorts of medieval romances

00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:34.080
from wherever they come from,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.863
people who just want to curate their own glorious selection

00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:39.380
of beautiful things.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.997
And that is the future of the Web.

00:12:40.997 --> 00:12:44.180
And it's an attractive and beautiful future,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.782
if only we can make it happen.

00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:48.963
Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example,

00:12:48.963 --> 00:12:52.313
and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.996
for people to enjoy --

00:12:53.996 --> 00:12:56.580
all the raw data, all the descriptions, all the metadata.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.463
under a Creative Commons license.

00:12:59.463 --> 00:13:00.981
Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:02.529
and it has beautiful manuscripts,

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:04.547
but the data is fantastic.

00:13:04.547 --> 00:13:06.330
And the result of this

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.348
is that if you do a Google search on images right now

00:13:09.348 --> 00:13:12.680
and you type in "Illuminated manuscript Koran" for example,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.097
24 of the 28 images you'll find come from my institution.

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:22.647
(Applause)

00:13:22.647 --> 00:13:27.680
Now, let's think about this for a minute.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.663
What's in it for the institution?

00:13:29.663 --> 00:13:32.259
There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution.

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:34.382
You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing,

00:13:34.382 --> 00:13:36.263
but let's talk about selfish things.

00:13:36.263 --> 00:13:40.131
Because what's really in it for the institution is this:

00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:43.187
Now why do people go to the Louvre?

00:13:43.187 --> 00:13:46.171
They go to see the Mona Lisa.

00:13:46.171 --> 00:13:49.230
Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa?

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.612
Because they already know what she looks like.

00:13:51.612 --> 00:13:53.946
And they know what she looks like

00:13:53.946 --> 00:13:58.648
because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere.

00:13:58.648 --> 00:14:03.097
Now, there is no need

00:14:03.097 --> 00:14:05.376
for these restrictions at all.

00:14:05.376 --> 00:14:07.463
And I think that institutions should stand up

00:14:07.463 --> 00:14:10.597
and release all their data under unrestricted licenses,

00:14:10.597 --> 00:14:12.813
and it would be a great benefit to everybody.

00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:15.979
Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data

00:14:15.979 --> 00:14:18.315
and curate their own collection

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:20.480
of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.568
and increase the beauty and the cultural significance

00:14:23.568 --> 00:14:24.796
of the Internet.

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:26.313
Thank you very much indeed.

00:14:26.313 --> 00:14:30.746
(Applause)
