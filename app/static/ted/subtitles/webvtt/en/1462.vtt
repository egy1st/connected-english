00:00:01.747 --> 00:00:03.785
My talk today is about something

00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:06.118
maybe a couple of you have already heard about.

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.452
It's called the Arab Spring.

00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:10.350
Anyone heard of it?

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.475
(Applause)

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:18.220
So in 2011, power shifted,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.863
from the few to the many,

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:24.618
from oval offices to central squares,

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:27.611
from carefully guarded airwaves

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.298
to open-source networks.

00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:35.082
But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation,

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:37.066
there were representative surveys

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.056
already giving people a voice

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:43.549
in quieter but still powerful ways.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:48.381
I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.865
Since 2001,

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.246
we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people --

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:56.021
young and old, men and women,

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.161
educated and illiterate.

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.664
My talk today draws on this research

00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:05.597
to reveal why Arabs rose up

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:08.614
and what they want now.

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:11.796
Now this region's very diverse,

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:13.781
and every country is unique.

00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:15.431
But those who revolted

00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:18.370
shared a common set of grievances

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.547
and have similar demands today.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:24.398
I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt.

00:01:24.398 --> 00:01:27.764
It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.

00:01:27.764 --> 00:01:31.348
But it's the largest Arab country

00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:34.763
and it's also one with a great deal of influence.

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:38.747
But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region

00:01:38.747 --> 00:01:41.564
to look at the mundane topics

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:44.347
of Arab views of religion and politics

00:01:44.347 --> 00:01:47.532
and how this impacts women,

00:01:47.532 --> 00:01:51.304
revealing some surprises along the way.

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:55.433
So after analyzing mounds of data,

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:57.901
what we discovered was this:

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:01.140
Unemployment and poverty alone

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.734
did not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:08.817
If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor

00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:10.535
sparked these revolutions,

00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:14.535
it was the difference between what Arabs experienced

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:16.915
and what they expected

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:18.748
that provided the fuel.

00:02:18.748 --> 00:02:20.149
To tell you what I mean,

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.331
consider this trend in Egypt.

00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:25.307
On paper the country was doing great.

00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:28.164
In fact, it attracted accolades

00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:30.616
from multinational organizations

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:32.682
because of its economic growth.

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:35.331
But under the surface was a very different reality.

00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:39.081
In 2010, right before the revolution,

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.232
even though GDP per capita

00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:44.331
had been growing at five percent for several years,

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:48.831
Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives.

00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:51.099
Now this is very unusual,

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.400
because globally we find that, not surprisingly,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.015
people feel better as their country gets richer.

00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:00.798
And that's because they have better job opportunities

00:03:00.798 --> 00:03:04.211
and their state offers better social services.

00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.599
But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.331
As the country got more well-off,

00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:11.749
unemployment actually rose

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.399
and people's satisfaction

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:20.336
with things like housing and education plummeted.

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:24.626
But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:32.000
It was also people's deep longing for freedom.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.266
Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory,

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:39.802
Arabs didn't despise Western liberty,

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:41.754
they desired it.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:44.503
As early as 2001,

00:03:44.503 --> 00:03:47.976
we asked Arabs, and Muslims in general around the world,

00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:50.905
what they admired most about the West.

00:03:50.905 --> 00:03:53.572
Among the most frequent responses

00:03:53.572 --> 00:03:55.924
was liberty and justice.

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:59.090
In their own words to an open-ended question

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.006
we heard, "Their political system is transparent

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:05.207
and it's following democracy in its true sense."

00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:07.206
Another said it was "liberty and freedom

00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:09.938
and being open-minded with each other."

00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:14.573
Majorities as high as 90 percent and greater

00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:16.991
in Egypt, Indonesia and Iran

00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.674
told us in 2005

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:23.873
that if they were to write a new constitution

00:04:23.873 --> 00:04:27.239
for a theoretical new country

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:29.564
that they would guarantee freedom of speech

00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:31.974
as a fundamental right,

00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:34.058
especially in Egypt.

00:04:34.058 --> 00:04:38.040
Eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.606
would help Muslims progress --

00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:44.823
the highest percentage of any country we surveyed.

00:04:44.823 --> 00:04:48.523
But pressed up against these democratic aspirations

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:51.624
was a very different day-to-day experience,

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.790
especially in Egypt.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.308
While aspiring to democracy the most,

00:04:57.308 --> 00:05:02.055
they were the least likely population in the world

00:05:02.055 --> 00:05:05.782
to say that they had actually voiced their opinion

00:05:05.782 --> 00:05:08.156
to a public official in the last month --

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:11.839
at only four percent.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:16.607
So while economic development made a few people rich,

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:19.605
it left many more worse off.

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:23.191
As people felt less and less free,

00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:26.940
they also felt less and less provided for.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.690
So rather than viewing their former regimes

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.124
as generous if overprotective fathers,

00:05:34.124 --> 00:05:38.325
they viewed them as essentially prison wardens.

00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:42.741
So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30-year rule,

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.908
they potentially could be

00:05:44.908 --> 00:05:47.574
an example for the region.

00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:49.296
If Egypt is to succeed

00:05:49.296 --> 00:05:52.763
at building a society based on the rule of law,

00:05:52.763 --> 00:05:55.615
it could be a model.

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:56.940
If, however,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.364
the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed,

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:05.074
the consequences could be catastrophic --

00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:06.308
not just for Egypt,

00:06:06.308 --> 00:06:09.580
but for the entire region.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.208
The signs don't look good, some have said.

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:18.041
Islamists, not the young liberals that sparked the revolution,

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:20.640
won the majority in Parliament.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.311
The military council

00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:26.626
has cracked down on civil society and protests

00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:29.994
and the country's economy continues to suffer.

00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:34.759
Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone, however,

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.387
ignores the real revolution.

00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:41.566
Because Egyptians are more optimistic

00:06:41.566 --> 00:06:44.013
than they have been in years,

00:06:44.013 --> 00:06:47.785
far less divided on religious-secular lines

00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:49.101
than we would think

00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:53.016
and poised for the demands of democracy.

00:06:53.016 --> 00:06:55.967
Whether they support Islamists or liberals,

00:06:55.967 --> 00:06:59.311
Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical,

00:06:59.311 --> 00:07:02.067
and they are jobs, stability and education,

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:04.400
not moral policing.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.468
But most of all,

00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:06.899
for the first time in decades,

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:10.649
they expect to be active participants, not spectators,

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.950
in the affairs of their country.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.966
I was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians

00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:18.501
from Egypt and Tunisia

00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.033
a couple of weeks ago.

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:22.811
And what really struck me about them

00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:28.000
was that they weren't only optimistic,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.842
but they kind of struck me as nervous,

00:07:30.842 --> 00:07:32.193
for lack of a better word.

00:07:32.193 --> 00:07:33.482
One said to me,

00:07:33.482 --> 00:07:36.405
"Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football" --

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:39.422
or soccer, as we say in America --

00:07:39.422 --> 00:07:43.805
"and now they gather to watch Parliament."

00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:47.159
(Laughter)

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:49.381
"They're really watching us,

00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:53.368
and we can't help but worry

00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:55.888
that we're not going to live up to their expectations."

00:07:55.888 --> 00:07:57.396
And what really struck me

00:07:57.396 --> 00:07:59.588
is that less than 24 months ago,

00:07:59.588 --> 00:08:01.839
it was the people that were nervous

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:04.921
about being watched by their government.

00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:07.771
And the reason that they're expecting a lot

00:08:07.771 --> 00:08:11.375
is because they have a new-found hope for the future.

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:13.161
So right before the revolution

00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:16.638
we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives,

00:08:16.638 --> 00:08:20.938
but not only that, they thought their future would be no better.

00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:24.171
What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.005
wasn't that life got easier.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.112
It actually got harder.

00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:31.205
But people's expectations for their future

00:08:31.205 --> 00:08:33.005
went up significantly.

00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:35.402
And this hope, this optimism,

00:08:35.402 --> 00:08:39.748
endured a year of turbulent transition.

00:08:39.748 --> 00:08:43.276
One reason that there's this optimism

00:08:43.276 --> 00:08:47.007
is because, contrary to what many people have said,

00:08:47.007 --> 00:08:51.189
most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways.

00:08:51.189 --> 00:08:54.023
So while Egyptians were known

00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:57.490
for their single-digit turnout

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.758
in elections before the revolution,

00:08:59.758 --> 00:09:03.590
the last election had around 70 percent voter turnout --

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.589
men and women.

00:09:05.589 --> 00:09:10.503
Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 --

00:09:10.503 --> 00:09:12.184
I'm surprised it was a quarter --

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:16.296
90 percent thought that this last election was honest.

00:09:16.296 --> 00:09:17.874
Now why this matters

00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:21.040
is because we discovered a link

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.274
between people's faith in their democratic process

00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:29.123
and their faith that oppressed people

00:09:29.123 --> 00:09:31.640
can change their situation

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.360
through peaceful means alone.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:45.731
(Applause)

00:09:45.731 --> 00:09:48.152
Now I know what some of you are thinking.

00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:49.785
The Egyptian people,

00:09:49.785 --> 00:09:53.635
and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition,

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:57.052
have very high expectations of the government.

00:09:57.052 --> 00:10:01.850
They're just victims of a long-time autocracy,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.067
expecting a paternal state

00:10:04.067 --> 00:10:06.446
to solve all their problems.

00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:10.035
But this conclusion would ignore

00:10:10.035 --> 00:10:13.185
a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt

00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:17.201
far from the cameras in Tahrir Square.

00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:20.867
And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations

00:10:20.867 --> 00:10:24.234
are placed first on themselves.

00:10:24.234 --> 00:10:28.401
In the country once known for its passive resignation,

00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:30.267
where, as bad as things got,

00:10:30.267 --> 00:10:33.736
only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official,

00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:37.048
today 90 percent tell us

00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:39.320
that if there's a problem in their community,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.753
it's up to them to fix it.

00:10:41.753 --> 00:10:49.446
(Applause)

00:10:49.446 --> 00:10:51.249
And three-fourths

00:10:51.249 --> 00:10:54.080
believe they not only have the responsibility,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.050
but the power to make change.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.314
And this empowerment

00:10:59.314 --> 00:11:02.246
also applies to women,

00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:03.917
whose role in the revolts

00:11:03.917 --> 00:11:06.068
cannot be underestimated.

00:11:06.068 --> 00:11:08.469
They were doctors and dissidents,

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:10.035
artists and organizers.

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:15.168
A full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas

00:11:15.168 --> 00:11:20.203
to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt

00:11:20.203 --> 00:11:21.876
were women.

00:11:21.876 --> 00:11:27.519
(Applause)

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:30.208
Now people have raised some real concerns

00:11:30.208 --> 00:11:33.874
about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.

00:11:33.874 --> 00:11:38.158
What we've found about the role of religion in law

00:11:38.158 --> 00:11:40.674
and the role of religion in society

00:11:40.674 --> 00:11:43.660
is that there's no female consensus.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.843
We found that women in one country

00:11:47.843 --> 00:11:49.810
look more like the men in that country

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.474
than their female counterparts across the border.

00:11:54.474 --> 00:11:55.992
Now what this suggests

00:11:55.992 --> 00:12:00.059
is that how women view religion's role in society

00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:05.340
is shaped more by their own country's culture and context

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.855
than one monolithic view

00:12:07.855 --> 00:12:10.692
that religion is simply bad for women.

00:12:10.692 --> 00:12:14.457
Where women agree, however,

00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:16.040
is on their own role,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.573
and that it must be central and active.

00:12:18.573 --> 00:12:23.691
And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country --

00:12:23.691 --> 00:12:26.441
on the issue of women's rights.

00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:29.041
Now how men feel about women's rights

00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:32.490
matters to the future of this region.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.524
Because we discovered a link

00:12:34.524 --> 00:12:38.526
between men's support for women's employment

00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:41.725
and how many women are actually employed

00:12:41.725 --> 00:12:44.909
in professional fields in that country.

00:12:44.909 --> 00:12:46.373
So the question becomes,

00:12:46.373 --> 00:12:50.548
What drives men's support for women's rights?

00:12:50.548 --> 00:12:57.297
What about men's views of religion and law?

00:12:57.297 --> 00:13:00.182
[Does] a man's opinion

00:13:00.182 --> 00:13:03.067
of the role of religion in politics

00:13:03.067 --> 00:13:06.716
shape their view of women's rights?

00:13:06.716 --> 00:13:07.949
The answer is no.

00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:10.834
We found absolutely no correlation,

00:13:10.834 --> 00:13:12.648
no impact whatsoever,

00:13:12.648 --> 00:13:15.183
between these two variables.

00:13:15.183 --> 00:13:18.899
What drives men's support for women's employment

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:21.783
is men's employment,

00:13:21.783 --> 00:13:24.282
their level of education

00:13:24.282 --> 00:13:27.067
as well as a high score

00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:31.166
on their country's U.N. Human Development Index.

00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:32.357
What this means

00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:35.431
is that human development,

00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:37.727
not secularization,

00:13:37.727 --> 00:13:40.447
is what's key to women's empowerment

00:13:40.447 --> 00:13:44.131
in the transforming Middle East.

00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:47.080
And the transformation continues.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.963
From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street,

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:53.020
it has never been more important

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.364
to understand the aspirations

00:13:55.364 --> 00:13:57.482
of ordinary people.

00:13:57.482 --> 00:13:59.213
Thank you.

00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:09.399
(Applause)
