00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:02.977
We are today talking
about moral persuasion:

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.983
What is moral and immoral
in trying to change people's behaviors

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.460
by using technology and using design?

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:11.316
And I don't know what you expect,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.293
but when I was thinking about that issue,

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:17.356
I early on realized what I'm not able
to give you are answers.

00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:20.714
I'm not able to tell you
what is moral or immoral,

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:23.285
because we're living
in a pluralist society.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.551
My values can be radically
different from your values,

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:30.752
which means that what I consider
moral or immoral based on that

00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:34.388
might not necessarily be
what you consider moral or immoral.

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.983
But I also realized
there is one thing that I could give you,

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.540
and that is what this guy
behind me gave the world --

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:41.714
Socrates.

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:43.133
It is questions.

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.790
What I can do and what
I would like to do with you

00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:47.759
is give you, like that initial question,

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:51.193
a set of questions
to figure out for yourselves,

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.858
layer by layer, like peeling an onion,

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:59.902
getting at the core of what you believe
is moral or immoral persuasion.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.340
And I'd like to do that
with a couple of examples of technologies

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:09.344
where people have used game elements
to get people to do things.

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:13.123
So it's at first a very simple,
very obvious question

00:01:13.147 --> 00:01:14.343
I would like to give you:

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:17.054
What are your intentions
if you are designing something?

00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:20.781
And obviously, intentions
are not the only thing,

00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:23.983
so here is another example
for one of these applications.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.094
There are a couple of these kinds
of Eco dashboards right now --

00:01:27.118 --> 00:01:28.578
dashboards built into cars --

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:31.434
which try to motivate you
to drive more fuel-efficiently.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.231
This here is Nissan's MyLeaf,

00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:36.319
where your driving behavior
is compared with the driving behavior

00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:37.494
of other people,

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:40.795
so you can compete for who drives a route
the most fuel-efficiently.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.296
And these things are
very effective, it turns out --

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.259
so effective that they motivate people
to engage in unsafe driving behaviors,

00:01:47.283 --> 00:01:49.045
like not stopping at a red light,

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.784
because that way you have
to stop and restart the engine,

00:01:51.808 --> 00:01:54.531
and that would use quite
some fuel, wouldn't it?

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:59.487
So despite this being
a very well-intended application,

00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:01.886
obviously there was a side effect of that.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.458
Here's another example
for one of these side effects.

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:09.266
Commendable: a site that allows parents
to give their kids little badges

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.948
for doing the things
that parents want their kids to do,

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:13.288
like tying their shoes.

00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:15.556
And at first that sounds very nice,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.730
very benign, well-intended.

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:21.524
But it turns out, if you look into
research on people's mindset,

00:02:21.548 --> 00:02:23.035
caring about outcomes,

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.832
caring about public recognition,

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:28.717
caring about these kinds
of public tokens of recognition

00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:30.735
is not necessarily very helpful

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.066
for your long-term
psychological well-being.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.766
It's better if you care
about learning something.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.695
It's better when you care about yourself

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.293
than how you appear
in front of other people.

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:45.802
So that kind of motivational tool
that is used actually, in and of itself,

00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:47.734
has a long-term side effect,

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:49.568
in that every time we use a technology

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:52.766
that uses something
like public recognition or status,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.166
we're actually positively endorsing this

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.600
as a good and normal thing
to care about --

00:02:58.624 --> 00:03:01.488
that way, possibly having
a detrimental effect

00:03:01.512 --> 00:03:05.367
on the long-term psychological
well-being of ourselves as a culture.

00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:08.035
So that's a second, very obvious question:

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:10.370
What are the effects
of what you're doing --

00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:14.518
the effects you're having
with the device, like less fuel,

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:17.247
as well as the effects
of the actual tools you're using

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:18.945
to get people to do things --

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.540
public recognition?

00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:23.485
Now is that all -- intention, effect?

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.643
Well, there are some technologies
which obviously combine both.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.454
Both good long-term and short-term effects

00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:32.287
and a positive intention
like Fred Stutzman's "Freedom,"

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.518
where the whole point
of that application is --

00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:38.267
well, we're usually so bombarded
with constant requests by other people,

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.447
with this device,

00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:42.951
you can shut off the Internet
connectivity of your PC of choice

00:03:42.975 --> 00:03:44.423
for a pre-set amount of time,

00:03:44.447 --> 00:03:46.418
to actually get some work done.

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:49.593
And I think most of us will agree
that's something well-intended,

00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:51.837
and also has good consequences.

00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:53.507
In the words of Michel Foucault,

00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.471
it is a "technology of the self."

00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:58.332
It is a technology
that empowers the individual

00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:00.171
to determine its own life course,

00:04:00.195 --> 00:04:01.714
to shape itself.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.134
But the problem is,
as Foucault points out,

00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:06.943
that every technology of the self

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:10.412
has a technology of domination
as its flip side.

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:15.039
As you see in today's modern
liberal democracies,

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:19.746
the society, the state,
not only allows us to determine our self,

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.921
to shape our self,

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:22.936
it also demands it of us.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.921
It demands that we optimize ourselves,

00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:26.785
that we control ourselves,

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.520
that we self-manage continuously,

00:04:29.544 --> 00:04:33.437
because that's the only way
in which such a liberal society works.

00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:37.729
These technologies want us
to stay in the game

00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:40.526
that society has devised for us.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.837
They want us to fit in even better.

00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:45.439
They want us to optimize
ourselves to fit in.

00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:49.447
Now, I don't say that
is necessarily a bad thing;

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:54.361
I just think that this example
points us to a general realization,

00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:58.188
and that is: no matter what technology
or design you look at,

00:04:58.212 --> 00:05:01.233
even something we consider
as well-intended

00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:04.223
and as good in its effects
as Stutzman's Freedom,

00:05:04.247 --> 00:05:06.954
comes with certain values embedded in it.

00:05:06.978 --> 00:05:08.914
And we can question these values.

00:05:08.938 --> 00:05:10.882
We can question: Is it a good thing

00:05:10.906 --> 00:05:14.390
that all of us continuously
self-optimize ourselves

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.425
to fit better into that society?

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.941
Or to give you another example:

00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:20.441
What about a piece
of persuasive technology

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:23.656
that convinces Muslim women
to wear their headscarves?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.732
Is that a good or a bad technology

00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:28.319
in its intentions or in its effects?

00:05:28.343 --> 00:05:32.597
Well, that basically depends on
the kind of values you bring to bear

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:34.858
to make these kinds of judgments.

00:05:34.882 --> 00:05:36.410
So that's a third question:

00:05:36.434 --> 00:05:37.962
What values do you use to judge?

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:39.929
And speaking of values:

00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:43.309
I've noticed that in the discussion
about moral persuasion online

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:44.970
and when I'm talking with people,

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:47.661
more often than not,
there is a weird bias.

00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:51.099
And that bias is that we're asking:

00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:53.936
Is this or that "still" ethical?

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.610
Is it "still" permissible?

00:05:56.634 --> 00:05:57.832
We're asking things like:

00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:00.045
Is this Oxfam donation form,

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.117
where the regular monthly
donation is the preset default,

00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.220
and people, maybe without intending it,

00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:09.056
are encouraged or nudged
into giving a regular donation

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.569
instead of a one-time donation,

00:06:10.593 --> 00:06:11.936
is that "still' permissible?

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.323
Is it "still" ethical?

00:06:13.347 --> 00:06:14.826
We're fishing at the low end.

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:18.093
But in fact, that question,
"Is it 'still' ethical?"

00:06:18.117 --> 00:06:19.898
is just one way of looking at ethics.

00:06:19.922 --> 00:06:24.814
Because if you look at the beginning
of ethics in Western culture,

00:06:24.838 --> 00:06:28.370
you see a very different idea
of what ethics also could be.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.707
For Aristotle, ethics
was not about the question,

00:06:32.731 --> 00:06:35.003
"Is that still good, or is it bad?"

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:38.455
Ethics was about the question
of how to live life well.

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:41.137
And he put that in the word "arête,"

00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:43.916
which we, from [Ancient Greek],
translate as "virtue."

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.580
But really, it means "excellence."

00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:51.035
It means living up to your own
full potential as a human being.

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:53.333
And that is an idea that, I think,

00:06:53.357 --> 00:06:56.054
Paul Richard Buchanan
put nicely in a recent essay,

00:06:56.078 --> 00:06:58.221
where he said,
"Products are vivid arguments

00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:00.368
about how we should live our lives."

00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:03.403
Our designs are not ethical or unethical

00:07:03.427 --> 00:07:08.017
in that they're using ethical
or unethical means of persuading us.

00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:09.971
They have a moral component

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:14.222
just in the kind of vision
and the aspiration of the good life

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:15.594
that they present to us.

00:07:16.181 --> 00:07:19.684
And if you look into the designed
environment around us

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:20.880
with that kind of lens,

00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:23.357
asking, "What is the vision
of the good life

00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:26.119
that our products, our design,
present to us?",

00:07:26.143 --> 00:07:28.419
then you often get the shivers,

00:07:28.443 --> 00:07:30.771
because of how little
we expect of each other,

00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:34.685
of how little we actually
seem to expect of our life,

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:36.743
and what the good life looks like.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.873
So that's a fourth question
I'd like to leave you with:

00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:45.259
What vision of the good life
do your designs convey?

00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:47.361
And speaking of design,

00:07:47.385 --> 00:07:51.575
you'll notice that I already
broadened the discussion,

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:56.043
because it's not just persuasive
technology that we're talking about here,

00:07:56.067 --> 00:08:00.144
it's any piece of design
that we put out here in the world.

00:08:00.168 --> 00:08:01.568
I don't know whether you know

00:08:01.592 --> 00:08:05.147
the great communication researcher
Paul Watzlawick who, back in the '60s,

00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:07.682
made the argument
that we cannot not communicate.

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:10.307
Even if we choose to be silent,
we chose to be silent,

00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:13.287
and we're communicating something
by choosing to be silent.

00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:16.046
And in the same way
that we cannot not communicate,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.601
we cannot not persuade:

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:19.636
whatever we do or refrain from doing,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.025
whatever we put out there
as a piece of design, into the world,

00:08:24.049 --> 00:08:26.096
has a persuasive component.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.993
It tries to affect people.

00:08:28.017 --> 00:08:31.764
It puts a certain vision of the good life
out there in front of us,

00:08:31.788 --> 00:08:33.413
which is what Peter-Paul Verbeek,

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:36.153
the Dutch philosopher of technology, says.

00:08:36.177 --> 00:08:40.125
No matter whether we as designers
intend it or not,

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:42.291
we materialize morality.

00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:45.118
We make certain things
harder and easier to do.

00:08:45.142 --> 00:08:47.353
We organize the existence of people.

00:08:47.377 --> 00:08:48.528
We put a certain vision

00:08:48.552 --> 00:08:51.956
of what good or bad or normal or usual is

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.131
in front of people,

00:08:53.155 --> 00:08:55.555
by everything we put
out there in the world.

00:08:55.987 --> 00:08:59.073
Even something as innocuous
as a set of school chairs

00:08:59.097 --> 00:09:01.144
is a persuasive technology,

00:09:01.168 --> 00:09:05.858
because it presents and materializes
a certain vision of the good life --

00:09:05.882 --> 00:09:08.739
a good life in which teaching
and learning and listening

00:09:08.763 --> 00:09:11.862
is about one person teaching,
the others listening;

00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:15.939
in which it is about
learning-is-done-while-sitting;

00:09:15.963 --> 00:09:17.558
in which you learn for yourself;

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:20.002
in which you're not supposed
to change these rules,

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:22.473
because the chairs
are fixed to the ground.

00:09:23.628 --> 00:09:26.539
And even something as innocuous
as a single-design chair,

00:09:26.563 --> 00:09:28.135
like this one by Arne Jacobsen,

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.935
is a persuasive technology,

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:33.002
because, again, it communicates
an idea of the good life:

00:09:33.475 --> 00:09:38.400
a good life -- a life that you,
as a designer, consent to by saying,

00:09:38.424 --> 00:09:41.931
"In a good life, goods are produced
as sustainably or unsustainably

00:09:41.955 --> 00:09:43.566
as this chair.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.567
Workers are treated as well or as badly

00:09:45.591 --> 00:09:48.163
as the workers were treated
that built that chair."

00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:50.803
The good life is a life
where design is important

00:09:50.827 --> 00:09:53.748
because somebody obviously took
the time and spent the money

00:09:53.772 --> 00:09:55.556
for that kind of well-designed chair;

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.984
where tradition is important,

00:09:57.008 --> 00:10:00.174
because this is a traditional classic
and someone cared about this;

00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:02.888
and where there is something
as conspicuous consumption,

00:10:02.912 --> 00:10:05.868
where it is OK and normal to spend
a humongous amount of money

00:10:05.892 --> 00:10:07.043
on such a chair,

00:10:07.067 --> 00:10:09.640
to signal to other people
what your social status is.

00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:12.981
So these are the kinds of layers,
the kinds of questions

00:10:13.005 --> 00:10:14.975
I wanted to lead you through today;

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:18.033
the question of: What are the intentions
that you bring to bear

00:10:18.057 --> 00:10:19.617
when you're designing something?

00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:22.893
What are the effects, intended
and unintended, that you're having?

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:25.718
What are the values
you're using to judge those?

00:10:25.742 --> 00:10:27.715
What are the virtues, the aspirations

00:10:27.739 --> 00:10:29.767
that you're actually expressing in that?

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.997
And how does that apply,

00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:34.007
not just to persuasive technology,

00:10:34.031 --> 00:10:36.079
but to everything you design?

00:10:36.652 --> 00:10:37.943
Do we stop there?

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:39.722
I don't think so.

00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:44.469
I think that all of these things
are eventually informed

00:10:44.493 --> 00:10:45.916
by the core of all of this,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.031
and this is nothing but life itself.

00:10:49.334 --> 00:10:52.051
Why, when the question
of what the good life is

00:10:52.075 --> 00:10:54.414
informs everything that we design,

00:10:54.438 --> 00:10:57.232
should we stop at design
and not ask ourselves:

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.246
How does it apply to our own life?

00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:02.333
"Why should the lamp
or the house be an art object,

00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:03.533
but not our life?"

00:11:03.557 --> 00:11:05.040
as Michel Foucault puts it.

00:11:05.436 --> 00:11:09.047
Just to give you a practical
example of Buster Benson.

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:11.329
This is Buster setting up
a pull-up machine

00:11:11.353 --> 00:11:13.965
at the office of his new
start-up, Habit Labs,

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:17.204
where they're trying to build
other applications like "Health Month"

00:11:17.228 --> 00:11:18.386
for people.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.372
And why is he building a thing like this?

00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:22.429
Well, here is the set of axioms

00:11:22.453 --> 00:11:25.851
that Habit Labs, Buster's start-up,
put up for themselves

00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:28.580
on how they wanted to work
together as a team

00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:30.633
when they're building
these applications --

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.846
a set of moral principles
they set themselves

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.231
for working together --

00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:35.493
one of them being,

00:11:35.517 --> 00:11:38.604
"We take care of our own health
and manage our own burnout."

00:11:38.961 --> 00:11:42.461
Because ultimately,
how can you ask yourselves

00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:46.415
and how can you find an answer
on what vision of the good life

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:49.608
you want to convey and create
with your designs

00:11:49.632 --> 00:11:51.362
without asking the question:

00:11:51.386 --> 00:11:55.218
What vision of the good life
do you yourself want to live?

00:11:55.758 --> 00:11:56.932
And with that,

00:11:57.685 --> 00:11:59.097
I thank you.

00:11:59.121 --> 00:12:03.277
(Applause)
