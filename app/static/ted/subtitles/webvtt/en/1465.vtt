WEBVTT

00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:01.037
Is E.T. out there?

00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:04.016
Well, I work at the SETI Institute.

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:05.251
That's almost my name. SETI:

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:07.658
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:09.277
In other words, I look for aliens,

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:12.945
and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.706
look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.

00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:18.039
I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.799
Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic,

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:23.049
ridiculous, maybe even hopeless,

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.754
but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:30.568
that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay,

00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:32.666
and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.021
this line of work, if that's what you call it.

00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:38.029
This thing — whoops, can we go back?

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:40.728
Hello, come in, Earth.

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:42.079
There we go. All right.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.072
This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:47.508
behind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968,

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:50.417
I was working there collecting data for my thesis.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.758
Now, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data,

00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:56.291
so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:59.052
of the telescopes or even of myself,

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:04.286
because, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:06.034
within about 30 miles.

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:08.043
So here are pictures of myself.

00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:11.631
The observatory had just acquired a new book,

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:13.381
written by a Russian cosmologist

00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.999
by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.452
and translated and edited by a little-known

00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:22.061
Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan.

00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:24.058
And I remember reading that book,

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:26.066
and at 3 in the morning I was reading this book

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.759
and it was explaining how the antennas I was using

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.706
to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used

00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:36.018
to communicate, to send bits of information

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:38.610
from one star system to another.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.078
Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone,

00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:43.009
haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea,

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.898
but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.382
prove that there's somebody out there

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:51.098
just using this same technology --

00:01:51.098 --> 00:01:53.328
that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:55.301
at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:59.751
that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often

00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.584
wondered whether there was any truth in this story,

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:03.088
or I was just, you know, misremembering something,

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.836
but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine,

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:07.435
and sure enough, there you can see

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:09.546
the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.023
analog calculating device.

00:02:12.023 --> 00:02:12.926
So it was true.

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:15.367
All right. Now, the idea for doing this, it wasn't very old

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.031
at the time that I made that photo.

00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.509
The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.005
by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.615
in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars

00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:30.004
in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.

00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:31.600
Now, Frank didn't hear anything.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.009
Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force,

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.974
which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:02:36.974 --> 00:02:39.740
But Drake's idea here became very popular

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.197
because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that —

00:02:42.197 --> 00:02:45.613
and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed,

00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:47.468
we have been doing SETI ever since,

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:49.502
not continuously, but ever since.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.388
We still haven't heard anything.

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:53.066
We still haven't heard anything.

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:54.859
In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth,

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.659
but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.028
rather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,

00:03:00.028 --> 00:03:02.803
the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change

00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:04.068
is that the equipment's getting better.

00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:07.005
This is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles

00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.021
from whatever seat you're in right now.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.026
This is something that we're using today

00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:13.030
to search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.500
very much better too.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.026
This is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.

00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:19.047
This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.

00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:22.536
Some pundit with too much time on his hands

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.543
has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately

00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:30.038
100 trillion times better than they were in 1960,

00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:31.534
100 trillion times better.

00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:33.623
That's a degree of an improvement that would look good

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:36.030
on your report card, okay?

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.664
But something that's not appreciated by the public is,

00:03:38.664 --> 00:03:41.389
in fact, that the experiment continues to get better,

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.037
and, consequently, tends to get faster.

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:45.726
This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot,

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.364
you lose 10 percent of the audience.

00:03:47.364 --> 00:03:49.673
I have 12 of these. (Laughter)

00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:54.093
But what I plotted here is just some metric

00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:56.647
that shows how fast we're searching.

00:03:56.647 --> 00:03:58.755
In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:01.042
We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.

00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:03.753
But we're going through the haystack no longer

00:04:03.753 --> 00:04:06.045
with a teaspoon but with a skip loader,

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.016
because of this increase in speed.

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:09.451
In fact, those of you who are still conscious

00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:12.011
and mathematically competent,

00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.089
will note that this is a semi-log plot.

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:18.481
In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.

00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:21.214
It's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an

00:04:21.214 --> 00:04:23.533
overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:25.070
They don't really know what exponential means,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.081
but this is exponential.

00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.001
In fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,

00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:32.005
every card-carrying member of the digerati knows

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.497
that that's Moore's Law.

00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:36.098
So this means that over the course of the next

00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:40.010
two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.038
a million star systems, looking for signals

00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:43.547
that would prove somebody's out there.

00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:46.045
Well, a million star systems, is that interesting?

00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:49.059
I mean, how many of those star systems have planets?

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.204
And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:53.978
even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really

00:04:53.978 --> 00:04:56.501
didn't know it even as recently as six months ago.

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.379
But now we do. Recent results suggest

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.018
that virtually every star has planets, and more than one.

00:05:03.018 --> 00:05:06.344
They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:08.084
You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch.

00:05:08.084 --> 00:05:11.018
So in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate

00:05:11.018 --> 00:05:15.014
of the number of planets in our galaxy,

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.041
just in our galaxy, by the way,

00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:19.811
and I remind the non-astronomy majors among you

00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:22.056
that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:24.040
that we can see with our telescopes.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.563
That's a lot of real estate, but of course,

00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:27.472
most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless,

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:29.564
like, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.

00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:31.654
Neptune's probably not very big in your life.

00:05:31.654 --> 00:05:36.001
So the question is, what fraction of these planets

00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:37.683
are actually suitable for life?

00:05:37.683 --> 00:05:39.088
We don't know the answer to that either,

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:41.326
but we will learn that answer this year, thanks to

00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:43.082
NASA's Kepler Space Telescope,

00:05:43.082 --> 00:05:47.104
and in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project,

00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:50.533
the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:54.569
that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand,

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.876
one in a hundred, something like that.

00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:00.016
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:03.127
one in a thousand, that means that there are

00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:05.656
at least a billion cousins of the Earth

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:07.383
just in our own galaxy.

00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:09.636
Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here,

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:13.562
but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know,

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:16.041
keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate,

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.054
plenty of real estate in the universe,

00:06:18.054 --> 00:06:21.003
and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's

00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:24.038
some interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle,

00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:26.719
and I know you like to think you're a miracle,

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.629
but if you do science, you learn rather quickly that

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.512
every time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,

00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:33.040
so probably not the case.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.091
All right, so the bottom line is this:

00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.054
Because of the increase in speed, and because of the

00:06:38.054 --> 00:06:43.005
vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:45.050
we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.021
And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you:

00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:50.458
Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years,

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:54.076
or I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

00:06:54.076 --> 00:06:56.710
So that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.569
you open up your browser and there's news of a signal,

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.320
or you get a cup of coffee.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.293
Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that

00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:06.331
people don't think about, and that is,

00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:10.039
what happens? Suppose that what I say is true.

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:12.404
I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.

00:07:12.404 --> 00:07:13.891
Suppose some time in the next two dozen years

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:16.068
we pick up a faint line that tells us

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:17.756
we have some cosmic company.

00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:20.051
What is the effect? What's the consequence?

00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:22.015
Now, I might be at ground zero for this.

00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:23.836
I happen to know what the consequence for me would be,

00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:26.745
because we've had false alarms. This is 1997,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.044
and this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning

00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:31.053
in Mountain View here, when we were watching

00:07:31.053 --> 00:07:33.368
the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal

00:07:33.368 --> 00:07:36.446
that we thought, "This is the real deal." All right?

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:39.814
And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:44.017
I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call,

00:07:44.017 --> 00:07:47.021
somebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:50.191
Nobody called. I was so nervous

00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:52.015
that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around

00:07:52.015 --> 00:07:55.005
taking photos like this one, just for something to do.

00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:57.039
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.069
on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night,

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:01.406
the phone rings and it's The New York Times.

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:04.032
And I think there's a lesson in that, and that lesson is

00:08:04.032 --> 00:08:07.012
that if we pick up a signal, the media, the media will be on it

00:08:07.012 --> 00:08:11.346
faster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast.

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:13.024
You can be sure of that. No secrecy.

00:08:13.024 --> 00:08:16.007
That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week,

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:18.630
because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.050
But what about you? What's it going to do to you?

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.057
And the answer is that we don't know the answer.

00:08:23.057 --> 00:08:23.942
We don't know what that's going to do to you,

00:08:23.942 --> 00:08:27.066
not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.

00:08:27.066 --> 00:08:29.894
I mean, that would be a bit like

00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:33.000
asking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.014
you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:38.550
continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.325
what will be the consequences for humanity

00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:43.071
if that turns out to be the case?"

00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:45.301
And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer

00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:48.012
that you might not have understood, but it probably

00:08:48.012 --> 00:08:50.846
wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:52.605
what finding E.T.'s going to mean,

00:08:52.605 --> 00:08:53.685
we can't predict that either.

00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:55.307
But here are a couple things I can say.

00:08:55.307 --> 00:08:59.464
To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.

00:08:59.464 --> 00:09:01.088
You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.

00:09:01.088 --> 00:09:02.378
They're not building transmitters.

00:09:02.378 --> 00:09:04.304
They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand

00:09:04.304 --> 00:09:07.371
years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially

00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:09.600
ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.386
anything that they're going to say, then you might be able

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:16.476
to short-circuit history by getting information from a society

00:09:16.476 --> 00:09:18.050
that's way beyond our own.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.001
Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is,

00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:23.654
but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen,

00:09:23.654 --> 00:09:26.027
and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know,

00:09:26.027 --> 00:09:28.496
giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key

00:09:28.496 --> 00:09:29.603
to the library of Congress.

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.058
It would change his day, all right?

00:09:32.058 --> 00:09:34.053
That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure

00:09:34.053 --> 00:09:37.553
going to happen is that it will calibrate us.

00:09:37.553 --> 00:09:41.491
We will know that we're not that miracle, right,

00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:43.053
that we're just another duck in a row,

00:09:43.053 --> 00:09:45.048
we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's

00:09:45.048 --> 00:09:48.002
philosophically a very profound thing to learn.

00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:51.103
We're not a miracle, okay?

00:09:51.103 --> 00:09:54.402
The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague,

00:09:54.402 --> 00:09:56.525
but I think interesting and important,

00:09:56.525 --> 00:09:58.630
and that is, if you find a signal coming from a more

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.861
advanced society, because they will be,

00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.513
that will tell you something about our own possibilities,

00:10:03.513 --> 00:10:08.295
that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.

00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:10.091
Because they survived their technology,

00:10:10.091 --> 00:10:11.203
we could do it too.

00:10:11.203 --> 00:10:13.094
Normally when you look out into the universe,

00:10:13.094 --> 00:10:15.555
you're looking back in time. All right?

00:10:15.555 --> 00:10:17.594
That's interesting to cosmologists.

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:21.038
But in this sense, you actually can look into the future,

00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:23.053
hazily, but you can look into the future.

00:10:23.053 --> 00:10:28.590
So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.022
Now, let me talk a little bit about something that happens

00:10:31.022 --> 00:10:35.234
even in the meantime, and that is,

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:40.012
SETI, I think, is important, because it's exploration, and

00:10:40.012 --> 00:10:42.464
it's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.

00:10:42.464 --> 00:10:45.329
Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about

00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:48.044
explorers. I find exploration very interesting,

00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:51.025
Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan,

00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:54.021
Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there,

00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:57.345
Scott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration.

00:10:57.345 --> 00:10:59.584
And they're just doing it because they want to explore,

00:10:59.584 --> 00:11:01.700
and you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity,"

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.028
but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity,

00:11:05.028 --> 00:11:07.059
because, I mean, think of ants.

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:09.056
You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another

00:11:09.056 --> 00:11:11.304
along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants,

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:14.000
maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.175
pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:18.076
They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:20.074
You gotta get them with your thumb before they

00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:21.658
find the sugar or something.

00:11:21.658 --> 00:11:24.063
But those ants, even though most of them get wiped out,

00:11:24.063 --> 00:11:27.355
those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival

00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:30.929
of the hive. So exploration is important.

00:11:30.929 --> 00:11:34.309
I also think that exploration is important in terms of

00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:39.179
being able to address what I think is a critical

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:42.380
lack in our society, and that is the lack of science literacy,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.023
the lack of the ability to even understand science.

00:11:46.023 --> 00:11:48.065
Now, look, a lot has been written about the

00:11:48.065 --> 00:11:51.463
deplorable state of science literacy in this country.

00:11:51.463 --> 00:11:54.015
You've heard about it.

00:11:54.015 --> 00:11:56.067
Well, here's one example, in fact.

00:11:56.067 --> 00:11:58.386
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.

00:11:58.386 --> 00:12:00.515
It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks

00:12:00.515 --> 00:12:02.479
that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:04.097
out there, but they're here, right?

00:12:04.097 --> 00:12:06.396
Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally

00:12:06.396 --> 00:12:09.512
abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:12.685
Well, that would be interesting if it was true,

00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:14.564
and job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is

00:12:14.564 --> 00:12:18.036
very good. That's more, you know, sad than significant.

00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:20.055
But there are other things that people believe

00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:23.466
that are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy,

00:12:23.466 --> 00:12:27.017
or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea

00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:30.048
by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,

00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:32.604
all that sort of thing, or global warming.

00:12:32.604 --> 00:12:36.005
These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity,

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.080
that you can't trust the scientists.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.323
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's

00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:44.401
a critically important problem, and you might say,

00:12:44.401 --> 00:12:47.030
"Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.429
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't

00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:51.092
solve the problem, but it can address the problem.

00:12:51.092 --> 00:12:54.035
It can address the problem by getting young people

00:12:54.035 --> 00:12:57.033
interested in science. Look, science is hard, it

00:12:57.033 --> 00:13:00.086
has a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard,

00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:05.021
and that's the result of 400 years of science, right?

00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:07.500
I mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.090
you could become an expert on any field of science

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.004
in an afternoon by going to a library,

00:13:13.004 --> 00:13:15.025
if you could find the library, right?

00:13:15.025 --> 00:13:18.641
In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab,

00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:21.388
you could make major scientific discoveries

00:13:21.388 --> 00:13:23.613
in your own home. Right? Because there was all this

00:13:23.613 --> 00:13:26.488
science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.

00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:28.081
Now, that's not true anymore.

00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:30.509
Today, you've got to spend years in grad school

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:34.007
and post-doc positions just to figure out what

00:13:34.007 --> 00:13:36.063
the important questions are.

00:13:36.063 --> 00:13:38.058
It's hard. There's no doubt about it.

00:13:38.058 --> 00:13:40.367
And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson,

00:13:40.367 --> 00:13:42.276
finding the Higgs boson.

00:13:42.276 --> 00:13:44.076
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets,

00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:46.414
"Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions

00:13:46.414 --> 00:13:49.055
of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"

00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:51.376
And I bet the answer you're going to get, is,

00:13:51.376 --> 00:13:53.033
"Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is,

00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:54.265
and I don't know if it's important."

00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:56.064
And probably most of the people wouldn't even know

00:13:56.064 --> 00:13:58.511
the value of a Swiss franc, okay?

00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.041
And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.194
Okay? So that doesn't get people interested in science

00:14:03.194 --> 00:14:05.070
because they can't comprehend what it's about.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.687
SETI, on the other hand, is really simple.

00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:08.303
We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to

00:14:08.303 --> 00:14:11.055
try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that.

00:14:11.055 --> 00:14:13.064
Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated,

00:14:13.064 --> 00:14:15.070
but everybody gets the idea.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:19.008
So that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science.

00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:21.422
It's exciting because we're naturally interested

00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:23.647
in other intelligent beings, and I think that's

00:14:23.647 --> 00:14:25.071
part of our hardwiring.

00:14:25.071 --> 00:14:26.631
I mean, we're hardwired to be interested

00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:29.432
in beings that might be, if you will, competitors,

00:14:29.432 --> 00:14:33.015
or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?

00:14:33.015 --> 00:14:35.026
I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that

00:14:35.026 --> 00:14:37.047
have big teeth. Right?

00:14:37.047 --> 00:14:38.521
We're interested in things that have big teeth, and you

00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:41.066
can see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see

00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:44.754
the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.

00:14:44.754 --> 00:14:47.088
You notice they make very few programs about gerbils.

00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:49.144
It's mostly about things that have big teeth.

00:14:49.144 --> 00:14:52.091
Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:56.026
And not just us. It's also kids.

00:14:56.026 --> 00:14:59.453
This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a

00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:02.685
hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science,

00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:04.675
obviously biology, obviously astronomy,

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:08.009
but also geology, also chemistry, various scientific

00:15:08.009 --> 00:15:12.009
disciplines all can be presented in the guise of,

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:13.338
"We're looking for E.T."

00:15:13.338 --> 00:15:17.795
So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact,

00:15:17.795 --> 00:15:21.033
it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults,

00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:23.701
you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.

00:15:23.701 --> 00:15:26.623
But if you give talks to kids, you know,

00:15:26.623 --> 00:15:30.775
one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think,

00:15:30.775 --> 00:15:32.576
"Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go,

00:15:32.576 --> 00:15:34.368
you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever.

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:36.050
They get interested in something.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:41.024
Now it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal,

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:43.047
personal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless,

00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:45.520
that kids get interested in something between the ages

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.056
of eight and 11. You've got to get them there.

00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:50.676
So, all right, I give talks to adults, that's fine, but I try

00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:53.001
and make 10 percent of the talks that I give,

00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:55.078
I try and make those for kids.

00:15:55.078 --> 00:15:58.054
I remember when a guy came to our high school, actually,

00:15:58.054 --> 00:16:01.030
it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.510
And he gave some talk. All I remember from it

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.085
was one word: electronics.

00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:07.646
It was like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," right,

00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:10.044
when he said "plastics," whatever that means, plastics.

00:16:10.044 --> 00:16:12.039
All right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:14.043
anything else. In fact, I don't remember anything

00:16:14.043 --> 00:16:16.053
that my sixth grade teacher said all year,

00:16:16.053 --> 00:16:18.067
but I remember electronics.

00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:20.719
And so I got interested in electronics, and you know,

00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:23.044
I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.

00:16:23.044 --> 00:16:26.022
Here I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.

00:16:26.022 --> 00:16:27.605
Okay? That had a big effect on me.

00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:29.317
So that's my point, that you can have a big effect

00:16:29.317 --> 00:16:32.033
on these kids.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:35.694
In fact, this reminds me, I don't know, a couple years ago

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:39.020
I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.033
where there were about a dozen 11-year-olds

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.005
that had come to this talk.

00:16:42.005 --> 00:16:44.521
I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour.

00:16:44.521 --> 00:16:46.795
Eleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle

00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:49.039
looking up at me with big eyes, and I started,

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:50.695
there was a white board behind me, and I started off

00:16:50.695 --> 00:16:53.533
by writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said,

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:55.896
"All right, now look, this is the number of stars

00:16:55.896 --> 00:16:58.768
in the visible universe, and this number is so big

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:02.116
there's not even a name for it."

00:17:02.116 --> 00:17:04.581
And one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said,

00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:06.086
"Well, actually there is a name for it.

00:17:06.086 --> 00:17:09.020
It's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other." Right?

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:13.016
Now, that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude,

00:17:13.016 --> 00:17:15.488
but there was no doubt about it, these kids were smart.

00:17:15.488 --> 00:17:17.456
Okay? So I stopped giving the lecture.

00:17:17.456 --> 00:17:20.039
All they wanted to do was ask questions.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:24.031
In fact, my last comments to these kids, at the end I said,

00:17:24.031 --> 00:17:26.063
"You know, you kids are smarter

00:17:26.063 --> 00:17:31.005
than the people I work with." Now — (Laughter)

00:17:31.005 --> 00:17:32.334
They didn't even care about that.

00:17:32.334 --> 00:17:35.028
What they wanted was my email address

00:17:35.028 --> 00:17:39.013
so they could ask me more questions. (Laughter)

00:17:39.013 --> 00:17:42.172
Let me just say, look, my job is a privilege

00:17:42.172 --> 00:17:43.795
because we're in a special time.

00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:46.580
Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.405
In another generation down the line,

00:17:48.405 --> 00:17:50.021
I think we will have succeeded.

00:17:50.021 --> 00:17:53.502
So to me, it is a privilege, and when I look in the mirror,

00:17:53.502 --> 00:17:56.309
the facts are that I really don't see myself.

00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:58.073
What I see is the generation behind me.

00:17:58.073 --> 00:18:00.099
These are some kids from the Huff School, fourth graders.

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:03.044
I talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.

00:18:03.044 --> 00:18:07.654
I think that if you can instill some interest in science

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:10.613
and how it works, well, that's a payoff

00:18:10.613 --> 00:18:13.056
beyond easy measure. Thank you very much.

00:18:13.056 --> 00:18:19.047
(Applause)
