00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:03.603
So I thought I'd talk about identity.

00:00:03.627 --> 00:00:06.036
That's sort of an interesting
enough topic to me.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.214
And the reason was,
because when I was asked to do this,

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:12.777
I'd just read, in one of the papers,
I can't remember,

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:16.180
something from someone at Facebook
saying, well,

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:17.820
"we need to make everybody
use their real names."

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:20.178
and then that's basically
all the problems solved.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.123
And that's so wrong,

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:26.066
that's such a fundamentally,
reactionary view of identity,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.471
and it's going to get us
into all sorts of trouble.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:29.829
And so what I thought I'd do

00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:33.834
is I'll explain four
sort of problems about it,

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:35.797
and then I'll suggest a solution,

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:37.869
which hopefully you
might find interesting.

00:00:37.893 --> 00:00:39.920
So just to frame the problem,

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:41.510
what does authenticity mean?

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:46.600
That's me, that's
a camera phone picture of me

00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:47.580
looking at a painting.

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:48.345
[What's the Problem?]

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:49.477
That's a painting that was painted

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:51.519
by a very famous forger,

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:53.782
and because I'm not very good
at presentations,

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:56.521
I already can't remember the name
that I wrote on my card.

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:00.399
And he was incarcerated
in, I think, Wakefield Prison

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:03.965
for forging masterpieces by,
I think, French Impressionists.

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.144
And he's so good at it,
that when he was in prison,

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:08.520
everybody in prison,
the governor and whatever,

00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:11.367
wanted him to paint masterpieces
to put on the walls,

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:12.659
because they were so good.

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:14.043
And so that's a masterpiece,

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:16.042
which is a fake of a masterpiece,

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:22.705
and bonded into the canvas is a chip
which identifies that as a real fake,

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.237
if you see what I mean.

00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:25.429
(Laughter)

00:01:25.453 --> 00:01:27.672
So when we're talking about authenticity,

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:33.134
it's a little more fractal than it appears
and that's a good example to show it.

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:37.115
I tried to pick four problems
that will frame the issue properly.

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.663
So the first problem, I thought,

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:40.215
Chip and PIN, right?

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:41.729
[Banks and legacies
bringing down the system from within]

00:01:41.753 --> 00:01:42.601
[Offline solutions do not work online]

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:45.217
I'm guessing everyone's got
a chip and PIN card, right?

00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:46.983
So why is that a good example?

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:50.458
That's the example of how
legacy thinking about identity

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:53.376
subverts the security
of a well-constructed system.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.167
That chip and PIN card
that's in your pocket

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:59.409
has a little chip on it
that cost millions of pounds to develop,

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:00.986
is extremely secure,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.249
you can put scanning
electron microscopes on it,

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:05.425
you can try and grind it down,
blah blah blah.

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:08.914
Those chips have never been broken,
whatever you read in the paper.

00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:12.148
And for a joke,
we take that super-secure chip

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:15.662
and we bond it to a trivially
counterfeitable magnetic stripe

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:19.284
and for very lazy criminals,
we still emboss the card.

00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:22.791
So if you're a criminal in a hurry
and you need to copy someone's card,

00:02:22.815 --> 00:02:24.992
you can just stick a piece of paper on it
and rub a pencil over it

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:26.875
just to sort of speed things up.

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.971
And even more amusingly,
and on my debit card too,

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:32.362
we print the name and the SALT code
and everything else on the front too.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:35.701
Why?

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:39.810
There is no earthly reason why your name
is printed on a chip and PIN card.

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:41.445
And if you think about it,

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.563
it's even more insidious and perverse
than it seems at first.

00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:46.377
Because the only people that benefit

00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:48.951
from having the name
on the card are criminals.

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:50.592
You know what your name is, right?

00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:51.493
(Laughter)

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:53.745
And when you go into
a shop and buy something,

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.705
it's a PIN, he doesn't care
what the name is.

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.364
The only place where you ever have
to write your name on the back

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:00.534
is in America at the moment.

00:03:00.558 --> 00:03:01.745
And whenever I go to America,

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.545
and I have to pay with a mag stripe
on the back of the card,

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.427
I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway,

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.235
just as a security mechanism,

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.473
because if a transaction
ever gets disputed,

00:03:09.497 --> 00:03:11.450
and it comes back and it says Dave Birch,

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:13.189
I know it must have been a criminal,

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:16.024
because I would never sign it Dave Birch.

00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:17.714
(Laughter)

00:03:17.738 --> 00:03:19.505
So if you drop your card in the street,

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:21.277
it means a criminal
can pick it up and read it.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:21.982
They know the name,

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:23.911
from the name they can find the address,

00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:26.326
and then they can go off
and buy stuff online.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.538
Why do we put the name on the card?

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:32.257
Because we think identity
is something to do with names,

00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:35.952
and because we're rooted
in the idea of the identity card,

00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:37.068
which obsesses us.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.664
And I know it crashed and burned
a couple of years ago,

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:44.219
but if you're someone in politics
or the home office or whatever,

00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:45.624
and you think about identity,

00:03:45.648 --> 00:03:48.839
you can only think of identity
in terms of cards with names on them.

00:03:48.863 --> 00:03:51.985
And that's very subversive
in a modern world.

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.241
So the second example I thought I'd use

00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:56.307
is chatrooms.

00:03:56.331 --> 00:03:57.111
[Chatrooms and Children]

00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:59.301
I'm very proud of that picture,
that's my son

00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:03.377
playing in his band with his friends
for the first-ever gig,

00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.346
I believe you call it, where he got paid.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.133
(Laughter)

00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:08.011
And I love that picture.

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:10.777
I like the picture of him
getting into medical school a lot better,

00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:11.477
(Laughter)

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.590
I like that picture for the moment.

00:04:13.614 --> 00:04:14.565
Why do I use that picture?

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:19.654
Because that was very interesting,
watching that experience as an old person.

00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:21.097
So him and his friends,

00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:23.975
they get together, they booked a room,
like a church hall,

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:25.825
and they got all their friends
who had bands,

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.135
and they got them together,

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.636
and they do it all on Facebook,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.434
and then they sell tickets,
and the first band on the -

00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:33.319
I was going to say "menu,"

00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:35.629
that's probably
the wrong word for it, isn't it?

00:04:35.653 --> 00:04:37.559
The first band on the list of bands

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:42.116
that appears at some
public music performance of some kind

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.285
gets the sales from the first 20 tickets,

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:46.105
then the next band gets the next 20,

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.091
and so on.

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:48.427
They were at the bottom of the menu,

00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:50.545
they were like fifth,
I thought they had no chance.

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.807
He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?

00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:54.904
But my point is,
that all worked perfectly,

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:57.685
except on the web.

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:59.878
So they're sitting on Facebook,

00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:02.744
and they're sending these messages
and arranging things

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:05.063
and they don't know who anybody is, right?

00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:06.694
That's the big problem
we're trying to solve.

00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:08.661
If only they were using the real names,

00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:11.352
Then you wouldn't be worried
about them on the Internet.

00:05:11.376 --> 00:05:12.597
And so when he says to me,

00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:16.963
"Oh, I want to go to a chatroom
to talk about guitars" or something,

00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:20.212
I'm like, "oh, well,
I don't want you to go into a chatroom

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:23.570
to talk about guitars, because
they might not all be your friends,

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:25.833
and some of the people
that are in the chatroom

00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:29.390
might be perverts and teachers
and vicars."

00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:31.215
(Laughter)

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:34.144
I mean, they generally are,
when you look in the paper, right?

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:37.200
So I want to know who
all the people in the chatroom are.

00:05:37.224 --> 00:05:38.939
So okay, you can go in the chatroom,

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.963
but only if everybody in the chatroom
is using their real names,

00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:46.328
and they submit full copies
of their police report.

00:05:46.352 --> 00:05:49.448
But of course, if anybody
in the chatroom asked for his real name,

00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:51.690
I'd say no.
You can't give them your real name.

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:54.390
Because what happens
if they turn out to be perverts,

00:05:54.414 --> 00:05:57.063
and teachers and whatever.

00:05:57.087 --> 00:05:58.802
So you have this odd sort of paradox

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:01.133
where I'm happy for him
to go into this space

00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:03.075
if I know who everybody else is,

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.438
but I don't want anybody else
to know who he is.

00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:07.614
And so you get
this sort of logjam around identity

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:09.250
where you want full disclosure
from everybody else,

00:06:09.274 --> 00:06:10.545
but not from yourself.

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.552
And there's no progress, we get stuck.

00:06:12.576 --> 00:06:14.862
And so the chatroom thing
doesn't work properly,

00:06:14.886 --> 00:06:19.227
and it's a very bad way
of thinking about identity.

00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.162
So on my RSS feed,
I saw this thing about -

00:06:22.186 --> 00:06:24.758
I just said something bad
about my RSS feed, didn't I?

00:06:24.782 --> 00:06:26.513
I should stop saying it like that.

00:06:26.537 --> 00:06:28.046
For some random reason, I can't imagine,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.202
something about cheerleaders
turned up in my inbox.

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:32.179
And I read this story about cheerleaders,

00:06:32.203 --> 00:06:33.628
and it's a fascinating story.

00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:35.843
This happened a couple of years ago
in the U.S.

00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:38.568
There were some cheerleaders
in a team at a high school

00:06:38.592 --> 00:06:41.451
in the U.S., and they said mean things

00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:42.637
about their cheerleading coach,

00:06:42.661 --> 00:06:44.848
as I'm sure kids do
about all of their teachers

00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:46.175
all of the time,

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.255
and somehow the cheerleading coach
found out about this.

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.719
She was very upset.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.886
And so she went to one of the girls,
and said,

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.006
"you have to give me
your Facebook password."

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.695
I read this all the time,
where even at some universities

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:58.595
and places of education,

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:00.324
kids are forced to hand over
their Facebook passwords.

00:07:00.348 --> 00:07:03.079
So you've got to give them
your Facebook password.

00:07:03.103 --> 00:07:03.952
She was a kid!

00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:05.138
What she should have said

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:06.368
is, "my lawyer will be calling you

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.158
first thing in the morning.

00:07:07.182 --> 00:07:09.279
It's an outrageous imposition

00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:11.138
on my 4th Amendment right to privacy,

00:07:11.162 --> 00:07:11.923
and you're going to be sued

00:07:11.947 --> 00:07:12.518
for all the money you've got."

00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:13.574
That's what she should have said.

00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:14.553
But she's a kid,

00:07:14.577 --> 00:07:16.372
so she hands over the password.

00:07:16.396 --> 00:07:18.422
The teacher can't log into Facebook,

00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:21.594
because the school
has blocked access to Facebook.

00:07:21.618 --> 00:07:23.507
So the teacher can't log into Facebook
until she gets home.

00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:25.205
So the girl tells her friends,

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:25.766
guess what happened?

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.362
The teacher logged in, she knows.

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:29.203
So the girls just all logged into Facebook
on their phones,

00:07:29.227 --> 00:07:31.070
and deleted their profiles.

00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:33.955
And so when the teacher logged in,
there was nothing there.

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:39.607
My point is, those identities,
they don't think about them the same way.

00:07:39.631 --> 00:07:43.336
Identity is, especially when
you're a teenager, a fluid thing.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.941
You have lots of identities.

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:47.191
And you can have an identity,
you don't like it,

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:50.787
because it's subverted in some way,
or it's insecure, or it's inappropriate,

00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:52.869
you just delete it and get another one.

00:07:52.893 --> 00:07:56.193
The idea that you have an identity
that's given to you by someone,

00:07:56.217 --> 00:07:57.012
the government or whatever,

00:07:57.036 --> 00:07:59.131
and you have to stick with that identity
and use it in all places,

00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:00.839
that's absolutely wrong.

00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:03.871
Why would you want to really know
who someone was on Facebook,

00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:06.753
unless you wanted to abuse them
and harass them in some way?

00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:09.384
And it just doesn't work properly.

00:08:09.408 --> 00:08:11.598
And my fourth example is
there are some cases

00:08:11.622 --> 00:08:14.031
where you really want to be -

00:08:14.055 --> 00:08:17.601
In case you're wondering,
that's me at the G20 protest.

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:21.277
I wasn't actually at the G20 protest,
but I had a meeting at a bank

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.710
on the day of the G20 protest,
and I got an email from the bank

00:08:24.734 --> 00:08:29.271
saying please don't wear a suit,
because it'll inflame the protesters.

00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:31.045
I look pretty good in a suit, frankly,

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:32.735
so you can see why it would drive them

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:34.236
into an anti-capitalist frenzy.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.771
(Laughter)

00:08:34.795 --> 00:08:35.700
So I thought, well, look.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.869
If I don't want to inflame the protesters,

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:39.785
the obvious thing to do

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.190
is go dressed as a protester.

00:08:41.214 --> 00:08:43.208
So I went dressed completely in black,

00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:45.092
you know, with a black balaclava,

00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:45.926
I had black gloves on,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.563
but I've taken them off
to sign the visitor's book.

00:08:47.587 --> 00:08:48.135
(Laughter)

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.318
I'm wearing black trousers, black boots,

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:51.724
I'm dressed completely in black.

00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:52.898
I go into the bank at 10 o'clock,

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:53.863
go, "Hi, I'm Dave Birch,

00:08:53.887 --> 00:08:55.139
I've got a 3 o'clock
with so and so there."

00:08:55.163 --> 00:08:56.580
Sure. They sign me in.

00:08:56.604 --> 00:08:59.351
There's my visitor's badge.

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:00.242
(Laughter)

00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:01.560
So this nonsense

00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:03.614
about you've got to have real names
on Facebook and whatever,

00:09:03.638 --> 00:09:05.849
that gets you that kind of security.

00:09:05.873 --> 00:09:10.368
That gets you security theater,
where there's no actual security,

00:09:10.392 --> 00:09:13.706
but people are sort of playing parts
in a play about security.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.831
And as long as
everybody learns their lines,

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:16.367
everyone's happy.

00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:19.231
But it's not real security.

00:09:19.255 --> 00:09:22.473
Especially because I hate banks
more than the G20 protesters do,

00:09:22.497 --> 00:09:23.658
because I work for them.

00:09:23.682 --> 00:09:26.485
I know that things are actually worse
than these guys think.

00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:28.282
(Laughter)

00:09:29.872 --> 00:09:34.942
But suppose I worked
next to somebody in a bank

00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:37.974
who was doing something.

00:09:44.744 --> 00:09:46.910
Suppose I was sitting
next to a rogue trader,

00:09:46.934 --> 00:09:49.213
and I want to report it
to the boss of the bank.

00:09:49.237 --> 00:09:50.629
So I log on to do
a little bit of whistleblowing.

00:09:50.653 --> 00:09:53.094
I send a message,
this guy's a rogue trader.

00:09:53.118 --> 00:09:54.892
That message is meaningless

00:09:54.916 --> 00:09:57.840
if you don't know
that I'm a trader at the bank.

00:09:57.864 --> 00:09:59.769
If that message just comes from anybody,

00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:02.426
it has zero information value.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.919
There's no point in sending that message.

00:10:06.463 --> 00:10:09.206
But if I have to prove who I am,

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.611
I'll never send that message.

00:10:10.635 --> 00:10:14.464
It's just like the nurse in the hospital
reporting the drunk surgeon.

00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:17.385
That message will only happen
if I'm anonymous.

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:22.176
So the system has to have ways
of providing anonymity there,

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.439
otherwise we don't get
where we want to get to.

00:10:24.463 --> 00:10:27.109
So four issues.
So what are we going to do about it?

00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:31.796
Well, what we tend to do about it

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.184
is we think about Orwell space.

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:37.330
And we try to make electronic versions

00:10:37.354 --> 00:10:39.637
of the identity card
that we got rid of in 1953.

00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:42.394
So we think if we had a card,

00:10:42.418 --> 00:10:43.733
call it a Facebook login,

00:10:43.757 --> 00:10:45.030
which proves who you are,

00:10:45.054 --> 00:10:46.921
and I make you carry it all the time,

00:10:46.945 --> 00:10:47.739
that solves the problem.

00:10:47.763 --> 00:10:49.897
And of course, for all those reasons
I've just outlined,

00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.889
it doesn't, and it might, actually,

00:10:50.913 --> 00:10:51.961
make some problems worse.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.784
The more times you're forced
to use your real identity,

00:10:54.808 --> 00:10:57.024
certainly in transactional terms,

00:10:57.048 --> 00:10:59.906
the more likely that identity
is to get stolen and subverted.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.170
The goal is to stop people
from using identity

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:04.347
in transactions which don't need identity,

00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:06.856
which is actually almost all transactions.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.153
Almost all of the transactions you do

00:11:09.177 --> 00:11:10.841
are not, who are you?

00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:12.975
They're, are you allowed to drive the car,

00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:14.523
are you allowed in the building,

00:11:14.547 --> 00:11:15.380
are you over 18,

00:11:15.404 --> 00:11:17.495
etcetera, etcetera.

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:19.326
So my suggestion-I, like James,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.487
think that there should be
a resurgence of interest in R &amp; D.

00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:23.272
I think this is a solvable problem.

00:11:23.296 --> 00:11:25.092
It's something we can do about.

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:27.040
Naturally, in these circumstances,

00:11:27.064 --> 00:11:28.414
I turn to Doctor Who.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.550
Because in this,

00:11:30.574 --> 00:11:32.194
as in so many other walks of life,

00:11:32.218 --> 00:11:35.147
Doctor Who has already shown
us the answer.

00:11:35.171 --> 00:11:35.961
So I should say,

00:11:35.985 --> 00:11:38.292
for some of our foreign visitors,

00:11:38.316 --> 00:11:42.146
Doctor Who is the greatest
living scientist in England,

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.723
(Laughter)

00:11:43.747 --> 00:11:46.523
and a beacon of truth and enlightenment
to all of us.

00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:50.593
And this is Doctor Who
with his psychic paper.

00:11:50.617 --> 00:11:52.763
Come on, you guys must have seen
Doctor Who's psychic paper.

00:11:52.787 --> 00:11:54.763
You're not nerds if you say yes.

00:11:54.787 --> 00:11:56.899
Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper?

00:11:56.923 --> 00:11:59.329
Oh right, you were in the library
the whole time studying I guess.

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:01.399
Is that what you're going to tell us?

00:12:01.423 --> 00:12:02.661
Doctor Who's psychic paper

00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:04.781
is when you hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:06.319
the person, in their brain,

00:12:06.343 --> 00:12:08.668
sees the thing that they need to see.

00:12:08.692 --> 00:12:11.027
So I want to show you a British passport,

00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:12.053
I hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:12.077 --> 00:12:13.533
you see a British passport.

00:12:13.557 --> 00:12:15.329
I want to get into a party,

00:12:15.353 --> 00:12:16.936
I hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.389
I show you a party invitation.

00:12:18.413 --> 00:12:20.464
You see what you want to see.

00:12:20.488 --> 00:12:23.679
So what I'm saying is we need
to make an electronic version of that,

00:12:23.703 --> 00:12:25.876
but with one tiny, tiny change,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.472
which is that it'll only show you
the British passport

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:29.688
if I've actually got one.

00:12:29.712 --> 00:12:30.907
It'll only show you the party invitation

00:12:30.931 --> 00:12:32.304
if I actually have one.

00:12:32.328 --> 00:12:35.328
It will only show you that I'm over 18
if I actually am over 18.

00:12:35.352 --> 00:12:37.652
But nothing else.

00:12:37.676 --> 00:12:42.427
So you're the bouncer at the pub,
you need to know that I'm over 18,

00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:44.451
instead of showing you my driving license,

00:12:44.475 --> 00:12:46.292
which shows you I know how to drive,

00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:48.888
what my name is, my address,
all these kind of things,

00:12:48.912 --> 00:12:50.467
I show you my psychic paper,

00:12:50.491 --> 00:12:53.633
and all it tells you is
am I over 18 or not.

00:12:53.657 --> 00:12:55.069
Right.

00:12:55.093 --> 00:12:56.407
Is that just a pipe dream?

00:12:56.431 --> 00:12:58.100
Of course not, otherwise
I wouldn't be here talking to you.

00:12:58.124 --> 00:13:01.184
So in order to build that
and make it work,

00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:03.955
I'm only going to name these things,
I'll not go into them,

00:13:03.979 --> 00:13:05.132
we need a plan,

00:13:05.156 --> 00:13:06.381
which is we're going to build this

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:08.405
as an infrastructure for everybody to use,

00:13:08.429 --> 00:13:10.259
to solve all of these problems.

00:13:10.283 --> 00:13:12.307
We're going to make a utility,

00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:13.855
the utility has to be universal,

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:14.738
you can use it everywhere,

00:13:14.762 --> 00:13:17.953
I'm just giving you little flashes
of the technology as we go along.

00:13:17.977 --> 00:13:19.336
That's a Japanese ATM,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.444
the fingerprint template
is stored inside the mobile phone.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:23.431
So when you want to draw money out,

00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:24.928
you put the mobile phone on the ATM,

00:13:24.952 --> 00:13:26.193
and touch your finger,

00:13:26.217 --> 00:13:28.265
your fingerprint goes through
to the phone,

00:13:28.289 --> 00:13:29.956
the phone says yes, that's whoever,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.160
and the ATM then gives you some money.

00:13:32.184 --> 00:13:35.197
It has to be a utility
that you can use everywhere.

00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:36.983
It has to be absolutely convenient,

00:13:37.007 --> 00:13:40.150
that's me going into the pub.

00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:42.943
All the device on the door
of the pub is allowed is,

00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:46.616
is this person over 18
and not barred from the pub?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.946
And so the idea is,
you touch your ID card to the door,

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.905
and if I am allowed in,
it shows my picture,

00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:53.366
if I'm not allowed in,
it shows a red cross.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.981
It doesn't disclose any other information.

00:13:55.005 --> 00:13:56.893
It has to have no special gadgets.

00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:58.528
That can only mean one thing,

00:13:58.552 --> 00:14:00.219
following on from Ross's statement,

00:14:00.243 --> 00:14:01.697
which I agree with completely.

00:14:01.721 --> 00:14:02.809
If it means no special gadgets,

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:04.183
it has to run on a mobile phone.

00:14:04.207 --> 00:14:05.286
That's the only choice we have,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.165
we have to make it work on mobile phones.

00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:08.099
There are 6.6 billion

00:14:08.123 --> 00:14:09.023
mobile phone subscriptions.

00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:11.059
My favorite statistic of all time,

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.036
only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.095
That means something,

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.352
I don't know what.

00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:15.730
(Laughter)

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:19.193
I rely on our futurologists to tell me.

00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:20.903
It has to be a utility
which is extensible.

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:22.188
So it has to be something

00:14:22.212 --> 00:14:23.778
that anybody could build on.

00:14:23.802 --> 00:14:25.666
Anybody should be able
to use this infrastructure,

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.120
you don't need permissions,
licenses, whatever,

00:14:28.144 --> 00:14:31.311
anyone should be able
to write some code to do this.

00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:34.417
You know what symmetry is,

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:36.764
so you don't need a picture of it.

00:14:36.788 --> 00:14:37.928
This is how we're going to do it.

00:14:37.952 --> 00:14:38.962
We're going to do it using phones,

00:14:38.986 --> 00:14:39.588
and we're going to do it

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:40.744
using mobile proximity.

00:14:40.768 --> 00:14:41.880
I'm going to suggest to you

00:14:41.904 --> 00:14:43.216
the technology to implement

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.502
Doctor Who's psychic paper

00:14:44.526 --> 00:14:46.146
is already here, and if any of you

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.625
have got one of the new
Barclay's debit cards

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:49.854
with the contactless interface on it,

00:14:49.878 --> 00:14:51.545
you've already got that technology.

00:14:51.569 --> 00:14:53.469
If you've ever been up to the big city,

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:54.970
and used an Oyster card at all,

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:57.065
does that ring any bells to anybody?

00:14:57.089 --> 00:14:57.811
The technology already exists.

00:14:57.835 --> 00:14:59.201
The first phones

00:14:59.225 --> 00:14:59.831
that have the technology built in,

00:14:59.855 --> 00:15:02.130
the Google Nexus, the S2,

00:15:02.154 --> 00:15:02.839
the Samsung Wifi 7.9,

00:15:02.863 --> 00:15:04.331
the first phones that have

00:15:04.355 --> 00:15:05.423
the technology built into them

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.257
are already in the shops.

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:07.969
So the idea that the gas man

00:15:07.993 --> 00:15:10.161
can turn up at my mom's door

00:15:10.185 --> 00:15:12.363
and he can show my mom his phone,

00:15:12.387 --> 00:15:13.698
and she can tap it with her phone,

00:15:13.722 --> 00:15:16.005
and it will come up with green
if he really is from British Gas

00:15:16.029 --> 00:15:17.217
and allowed in,

00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:18.887
and it'll come up with red if he isn't,

00:15:18.911 --> 00:15:19.497
end of story.

00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:21.347
We have the technology to do that.

00:15:21.371 --> 00:15:22.582
And what's more,

00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:24.727
although some of those things
sounded a bit counter-intuitive,

00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:27.515
like proving I'm over 18
without proving who I am,

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:29.740
the cryptography to do that
not only exists,

00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:31.969
it's extremely well-known
and well-understood.

00:15:31.993 --> 00:15:34.624
Digital signatures, the blinding
of public key certificates,

00:15:34.648 --> 00:15:36.368
these technologies have been around
for a while,

00:15:36.392 --> 00:15:38.440
we've just had no way
of packaging them up.

00:15:38.464 --> 00:15:41.157
So the technology already exists.

00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:44.845
We know it works,

00:15:44.869 --> 00:15:46.593
There are a few examples
of the technology being used

00:15:46.617 --> 00:15:48.263
in experimental places.

00:15:48.287 --> 00:15:49.591
That's London Fashion Week,

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.465
where we built a system with O2,

00:15:51.489 --> 00:15:54.232
that's for the Wireless Festival
in Hyde Park,

00:15:54.256 --> 00:15:55.355
you can see the persons

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:57.116
walking in with their VIP band,

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.600
it's just being checked

00:15:57.624 --> 00:15:58.700
by the Nokia phone
that's reading the band.

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:00.398
I'm only putting those up to show you

00:16:00.422 --> 00:16:01.627
these things are prosaic,

00:16:01.651 --> 00:16:03.509
this stuff works in these environments.

00:16:03.533 --> 00:16:04.962
They don't need to be special.

00:16:04.986 --> 00:16:10.881
So finally, I know that you can do this,

00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:14.669
because if you saw
the episode of Doctor Who,

00:16:14.693 --> 00:16:16.569
the Easter special of Doctor Who,

00:16:16.593 --> 00:16:19.945
where he went to Mars in a bus,

00:16:19.969 --> 00:16:21.507
I should say again
for our foreign students,

00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:23.180
that doesn't happen every episode.

00:16:23.204 --> 00:16:24.651
This was a very special case.

00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:27.892
So in the episode where
he goes to Mars in a London bus,

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:29.565
I can't show you the clip,

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:32.589
due to the outrageous restrictions
of Queen Anne-style copyright

00:16:32.613 --> 00:16:34.482
by the BBC,

00:16:34.506 --> 00:16:37.221
but in the episode
where he goes to Mars in a London bus,

00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:41.355
Doctor Who is clearly shown
getting on to the bus

00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:42.655
with the Oyster card reader

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:44.223
using his psychic paper.

00:16:44.247 --> 00:16:46.315
Which proves that psychic paper

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.030
has an MSE interface.

00:16:48.054 --> 00:16:50.064
Thank you very much.
