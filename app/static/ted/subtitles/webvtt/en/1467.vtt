WEBVTT

00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:02.418
All right. So, like all good stories,

00:00:02.418 --> 00:00:04.352
this starts a long, long time ago

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:06.501
when there was basically nothing.

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:08.901
So here is a complete picture of the universe

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:12.353
about 14-odd billion years ago.

00:00:12.353 --> 00:00:15.437
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.

00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:17.021
For some reason it explodes,

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:19.137
and you begin to get these things.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:22.003
So you're now about 14 billion years into this.

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:23.899
And these things expand and expand and expand

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.598
into these giant galaxies,

00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:26.917
and you get trillions of them.

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.065
And within these galaxies

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:31.184
you get these enormous dust clouds.

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:32.949
And I want you to pay particular attention

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.399
to the three little prongs

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.300
in the center of this picture.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.715
If you take a close-up of those,

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:39.368
they look like this.

00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:42.218
And what you're looking at is columns of dust

00:00:42.218 --> 00:00:44.265
where there's so much dust --

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:48.598
by the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles --

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:51.516
and what's happening is there's so much dust,

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:53.450
it comes together and it fuses

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.909
and ignites a thermonuclear reaction.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:57.751
And so what you're watching

00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:59.736
is the birth of stars.

00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:01.393
These are stars being born out of here.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:03.861
When enough stars come out,

00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:05.659
they create a galaxy.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.093
This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy,

00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:11.309
because you are here.

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:12.476
(Laughter)

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:14.127
And as you take a close-up of this galaxy,

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:16.192
you find a relatively normal,

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:18.560
not particularly interesting star.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.575
By the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story.

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:24.757
So this star doesn't even appear

00:01:24.757 --> 00:01:27.708
until about two-thirds of the way into this story.

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:28.786
And then what happens

00:01:28.786 --> 00:01:30.192
is there's enough dust left over

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:32.158
that it doesn't ignite into a star,

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.158
it becomes a planet.

00:01:34.158 --> 00:01:38.983
And this is about a little over four billion years ago.

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:40.416
And soon thereafter

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:42.333
there's enough material left over

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.896
that you get a primordial soup,

00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:48.660
and that creates life.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.541
And life starts to expand and expand and expand,

00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:54.292
until it goes kaput.

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:57.780
(Laughter)

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.210
Now the really strange thing

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.116
is life goes kaput, not once, not twice,

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:04.332
but five times.

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.434
So almost all life on Earth

00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:08.898
is wiped out about five times.

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:10.450
And as you're thinking about that,

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.882
what happens is you get more and more complexity,

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.116
more and more stuff

00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:18.234
to build new things with.

00:02:18.234 --> 00:02:19.504
And we don't appear

00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:25.152
until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story,

00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:29.082
just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:32.541
So within that context, there's two theories of the case

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.230
as to why we're all here.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.819
The first theory of the case

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.228
is that's all she wrote.

00:02:39.228 --> 00:02:40.587
Under that theory,

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:42.423
we are the be-all and end-all

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:44.156
of all creation.

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:47.040
And the reason for trillions of galaxies,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.053
sextillions of planets,

00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:53.763
is to create something that looks like that

00:02:53.763 --> 00:02:57.396
and something that looks like that.

00:02:57.396 --> 00:02:58.937
And that's the purpose of the universe;

00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:00.221
and then it flat-lines,

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.532
it doesn't get any better.

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:06.012
(Laughter)

00:03:06.012 --> 00:03:08.831
The only question you might want to ask yourself is,

00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:14.066
could that be just mildly arrogant?

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:15.807
And if it is --

00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:21.189
and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction.

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.556
There were only about 2,000 of our species left.

00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:26.639
A few more weeks without rain,

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.723
we would have never seen any of these.

00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:36.422
(Laughter)

00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:41.056
(Applause)

00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:44.022
So maybe you have to think about a second theory

00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:46.939
if the first one isn't good enough.

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.723
Second theory is: Could we upgrade?

00:03:48.723 --> 00:03:51.622
(Laughter)

00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:54.856
Well, why would one ask a question like that?

00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:57.321
Because there have been at least 29 upgrades so far

00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:59.357
of humanoids.

00:03:59.357 --> 00:04:02.207
So it turns out that we have upgraded.

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:04.122
We've upgraded time and again and again.

00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:07.038
And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.222
We found this one last year.

00:04:09.222 --> 00:04:11.839
We found another one last month.

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.038
And as you're thinking about this,

00:04:14.038 --> 00:04:16.141
you might also ask the question:

00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:19.238
So why a single human species?

00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:21.072
Wouldn't it be really odd

00:04:21.072 --> 00:04:24.856
if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica

00:04:24.856 --> 00:04:27.475
and found exactly the same bird --

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:31.267
particularly given that we co-existed at the same time

00:04:31.267 --> 00:04:34.053
with at least eight other versions of humanoid

00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:36.521
at the same time on this planet?

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.400
So the normal state of affairs

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.910
is not to have just a Homo sapiens;

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.931
the normal state of affairs

00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:45.760
is to have various versions of humans walking around.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.577
And if that is the normal state of affairs,

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:50.945
then you might ask yourself,

00:04:50.945 --> 00:04:53.010
all right, so if we want to create something else,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.878
how big does a mutation have to be?

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.510
Well Svante Paabo has the answer.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.310
The difference between humans and Neanderthal

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.609
is 0.004 percent of gene code.

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:06.309
That's how big the difference is

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.526
one species to another.

00:05:08.526 --> 00:05:12.926
This explains most contemporary political debates.

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:14.861
(Laughter)

00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:18.072
But as you're thinking about this,

00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:19.430
one of the interesting things

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.827
is how small these mutations are and where they take place.

00:05:22.827 --> 00:05:24.160
Difference human/Neanderthal

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.893
is sperm and testis,

00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:27.261
smell and skin.

00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:28.747
And those are the specific genes

00:05:28.747 --> 00:05:31.427
that differ from one to the other.

00:05:31.427 --> 00:05:34.528
So very small changes can have a big impact.

00:05:34.528 --> 00:05:36.160
And as you're thinking about this,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.676
we're continuing to mutate.

00:05:38.676 --> 00:05:41.577
So about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea,

00:05:41.577 --> 00:05:43.637
we had one mutation in one gene

00:05:43.637 --> 00:05:46.193
which led to blue eyes.

00:05:46.193 --> 00:05:50.077
And this is continuing and continuing and continuing.

00:05:50.077 --> 00:05:51.511
And as it continues,

00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:53.276
one of the things that's going to happen this year

00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:56.609
is we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:59.878
because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing.

00:05:59.878 --> 00:06:01.466
And when we find these,

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:03.960
we may find differences.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.036
And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for,

00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:10.412
because we have really misused the science in this.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:14.095
In the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people.

00:06:14.095 --> 00:06:17.893
That was partly based on Francis Galton's work.

00:06:17.893 --> 00:06:20.029
He was Darwin's cousin.

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:22.344
But the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,

00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:24.926
Stanford, American Neurological Association

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.794
took this really far.

00:06:26.794 --> 00:06:30.393
That got exported and was really misused.

00:06:30.393 --> 00:06:33.078
In fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:35.091
treatment of human beings.

00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:37.685
So since the 1940s, we've been saying there are no differences,

00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:39.005
we're all identical.

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:42.282
We're going to know at year end if that is true.

00:06:42.282 --> 00:06:44.014
And as we think about that,

00:06:44.014 --> 00:06:45.532
we're actually beginning to find things

00:06:45.532 --> 00:06:48.998
like, do you have an ACE gene?

00:06:48.998 --> 00:06:50.976
Why would that matter?

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:55.014
Because nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:57.764
that doesn't have an ACE gene.

00:06:57.764 --> 00:06:59.633
And if you want to get more specific,

00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:02.648
how about a 577R genotype?

00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:07.348
Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested

00:07:07.348 --> 00:07:10.598
carries at least one of these variants.

00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:12.252
If that is true,

00:07:12.252 --> 00:07:14.410
it leads to some very complicated questions

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.211
for the London Olympics.

00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:17.730
Three options:

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.562
Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase

00:07:20.562 --> 00:07:23.262
for really hardworking mutants?

00:07:23.262 --> 00:07:24.995
(Laughter)

00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:27.730
Option number two:

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.128
Why don't we play it like golf or sailing?

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:33.602
Because you have one and you don't have one,

00:07:33.602 --> 00:07:37.597
I'll give you a tenth of a second head start.

00:07:37.597 --> 00:07:38.668
Version number three:

00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:40.737
Because this is a naturally occurring gene

00:07:40.737 --> 00:07:43.519
and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents,

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:47.468
you get the right to upgrade.

00:07:47.468 --> 00:07:49.219
Three different options.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.841
If these differences are the difference

00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:54.219
between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal.

00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:57.053
And it turns out that as we discover these things,

00:07:57.053 --> 00:08:00.388
we human beings really like to change

00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:02.082
how we look, how we act,

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:03.676
what our bodies do.

00:08:03.676 --> 00:08:08.050
And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.367
except that with the technologies that are coming online today,

00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:14.068
today's corrections, deletions,

00:08:14.068 --> 00:08:15.987
augmentations and enhancements

00:08:15.987 --> 00:08:18.900
are going to seem like child's play.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.601
You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:26.168
but this ability to start filling

00:08:26.168 --> 00:08:29.101
things like inkjet cartridges with cells

00:08:29.101 --> 00:08:33.775
are allowing us to print skin, organs

00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:36.525
and a whole series of other body parts.

00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:38.409
And as these technologies go forward,

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.193
you keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things --

00:08:42.193 --> 00:08:44.967
2000, human genome sequence --

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:48.749
and it seems like nothing's happening,

00:08:48.749 --> 00:08:51.861
until it does.

00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:55.385
And we may just be in some of these weeks.

00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:56.984
And as you're thinking about

00:08:56.984 --> 00:09:00.435
these two guys sequencing a human genome in 2000

00:09:00.435 --> 00:09:03.988
and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in 2000,

00:09:03.988 --> 00:09:07.152
then you don't hear a lot,

00:09:07.152 --> 00:09:11.136
until you hear about an experiment last year in China,

00:09:11.136 --> 00:09:15.153
where they take skin cells from this mouse,

00:09:15.153 --> 00:09:16.886
put four chemicals on it,

00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:20.452
turn those skin cells into stem cells,

00:09:20.452 --> 00:09:21.917
let the stem cells grow

00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:25.004
and create a full copy of that mouse.

00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:28.251
That's a big deal.

00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:29.267
Because in essence

00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:31.415
what it means is you can take a cell,

00:09:31.415 --> 00:09:33.701
which is a pluripotent stem cell,

00:09:33.701 --> 00:09:36.385
which is like a skier at the top of a mountain,

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:40.202
and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,

00:09:40.202 --> 00:09:41.984
four, eight, 16,

00:09:41.984 --> 00:09:43.652
and then it gets so crowded

00:09:43.652 --> 00:09:45.452
after 16 divisions

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:47.954
that those cells have to differentiate.

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:49.387
So they go down one side of the mountain,

00:09:49.387 --> 00:09:50.620
they go down another.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.154
And as they pick that,

00:09:52.154 --> 00:09:54.404
these become bone,

00:09:54.404 --> 00:09:57.336
and then they pick another road and these become platelets,

00:09:57.336 --> 00:09:59.453
and these become macrophages,

00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:00.720
and these become T cells.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.672
But it's really hard, once you ski down,

00:10:02.672 --> 00:10:04.195
to get back up.

00:10:04.195 --> 00:10:09.607
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.

00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:12.056
And what those four chemicals do

00:10:12.056 --> 00:10:14.125
is they take any cell

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.057
and take it way back up the mountain

00:10:16.057 --> 00:10:18.090
so it can become any body part.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.818
And as you think of that,

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:21.798
what it means is potentially

00:10:21.798 --> 00:10:23.973
you can rebuild a full copy

00:10:23.973 --> 00:10:25.840
of any organism

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.426
out of any one of its cells.

00:10:28.426 --> 00:10:30.957
That turns out to be a big deal

00:10:30.957 --> 00:10:33.523
because now you can take, not just mouse cells,

00:10:33.523 --> 00:10:35.841
but you can human skin cells

00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:39.491
and turn them into human stem cells.

00:10:39.491 --> 00:10:42.689
And then what they did in October

00:10:42.689 --> 00:10:46.089
is they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:49.762
and began to turn them into liver cells.

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:50.806
So in theory,

00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:55.990
you could grow any organ from any one of your cells.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.708
Here's a second experiment:

00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:00.841
If you could photocopy your body,

00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:03.893
maybe you also want to take your mind.

00:11:03.893 --> 00:11:05.458
And one of the things you saw at TED

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:06.708
about a year and a half ago

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.143
was this guy.

00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:10.743
And he gave a wonderful technical talk.

00:11:10.743 --> 00:11:12.342
He's a professor at MIT.

00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:14.258
But in essence what he said

00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:15.958
is you can take retroviruses,

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.758
which get inside brain cells of mice.

00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:21.198
You can tag them with proteins

00:11:21.198 --> 00:11:23.292
that light up when you light them.

00:11:23.292 --> 00:11:27.008
And you can map the exact pathways

00:11:27.008 --> 00:11:30.491
when a mouse sees, feels, touches,

00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:32.674
remembers, loves.

00:11:32.674 --> 00:11:35.047
And then you can take a fiber optic cable

00:11:35.047 --> 00:11:38.866
and light up some of the same things.

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:40.698
And by the way, as you do this,

00:11:40.698 --> 00:11:42.715
you can image it in two colors,

00:11:42.715 --> 00:11:45.114
which means you can download this information

00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:49.854
as binary code directly into a computer.

00:11:49.854 --> 00:11:52.327
So what's the bottom line on that?

00:11:52.327 --> 00:11:54.527
Well it's not completely inconceivable

00:11:54.527 --> 00:11:59.022
that someday you'll be able to download your own memories,

00:11:59.022 --> 00:12:01.409
maybe into a new body.

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:06.494
And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well.

00:12:06.494 --> 00:12:09.008
And this might have just one or two

00:12:09.008 --> 00:12:12.528
small ethical, political, moral implications.

00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:14.059
(Laughter)

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:17.050
Just a thought.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.578
Here's the kind of questions

00:12:18.578 --> 00:12:20.558
that are becoming interesting questions

00:12:20.558 --> 00:12:23.042
for philosophers, for governing people,

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:26.408
for economists, for scientists.

00:12:26.408 --> 00:12:29.692
Because these technologies are moving really quickly.

00:12:29.692 --> 00:12:31.192
And as you think about it,

00:12:31.192 --> 00:12:34.274
let me close with an example of the brain.

00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:35.957
The first place where you would expect

00:12:35.957 --> 00:12:39.008
to see enormous evolutionary pressure today,

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.273
both because of the inputs,

00:12:41.273 --> 00:12:42.825
which are becoming massive,

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:44.607
and because of the plasticity of the organ,

00:12:44.607 --> 00:12:47.141
is the brain.

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:50.459
Do we have any evidence that that is happening?

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:55.190
Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.692
Here's what it looks like in 2000.

00:12:57.692 --> 00:12:59.774
Here's what it looks like in 2002,

00:12:59.774 --> 00:13:04.392
2006, 2008.

00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:08.474
Here's the increase in less than a decade.

00:13:08.474 --> 00:13:12.891
And we still don't know why this is happening.

00:13:12.891 --> 00:13:15.376
What we do know is, potentially,

00:13:15.376 --> 00:13:17.408
the brain is reacting in

00:13:17.408 --> 00:13:19.542
a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,

00:13:19.542 --> 00:13:22.492
and creating individuals that are like this.

00:13:22.492 --> 00:13:25.249
And this is only one of the conditions that's out there.

00:13:25.249 --> 00:13:28.789
You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,

00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:31.186
people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives,

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.571
people who've got synesthesia,

00:13:32.571 --> 00:13:33.902
people who've got schizophrenia.

00:13:33.902 --> 00:13:36.436
You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there,

00:13:36.436 --> 00:13:37.654
and we still don't understand

00:13:37.654 --> 00:13:39.887
how and why this is happening.

00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:42.569
But one question you might want to ask is,

00:13:42.569 --> 00:13:45.197
are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain

00:13:45.197 --> 00:13:47.022
and of how we process data?

00:13:47.022 --> 00:13:50.085
Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains,

00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:53.569
we're trying to take in as much data in a day

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:56.120
as people used to take in in a lifetime.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.752
And as you're thinking about this,

00:13:58.752 --> 00:14:01.094
there's four theories as to why this might be going on,

00:14:01.094 --> 00:14:02.421
plus a whole series of others.

00:14:02.421 --> 00:14:04.070
I don't have a good answer.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.686
There really needs to be more research on this.

00:14:07.686 --> 00:14:09.921
One option is the fast food fetish.

00:14:09.921 --> 00:14:12.370
There's beginning to be some evidence

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.621
that obesity and diet

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:16.252
have something to do

00:14:16.252 --> 00:14:18.020
with gene modifications,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.370
which may or may not have an impact

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.887
on how the brain of an infant works.

00:14:23.887 --> 00:14:27.842
A second option is the sexy geek option.

00:14:27.842 --> 00:14:32.085
These conditions are highly rare.

00:14:32.085 --> 00:14:35.123
(Laughter)

00:14:35.123 --> 00:14:40.423
(Applause)

00:14:40.423 --> 00:14:42.056
But what's beginning to happen

00:14:42.056 --> 00:14:44.590
is because these geeks are all getting together,

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.487
because they are highly qualified for computer programming

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:49.805
and it is highly remunerated,

00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:52.955
as well as other very detail-oriented tasks,

00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:55.404
that they are concentrating geographically

00:14:55.404 --> 00:14:58.371
and finding like-minded mates.

00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:01.939
So this is the assortative mating hypothesis

00:15:01.939 --> 00:15:04.639
of these genes reinforcing one another

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:06.756
in these structures.

00:15:06.756 --> 00:15:09.706
The third, is this too much information?

00:15:09.706 --> 00:15:11.203
We're trying to process so much stuff

00:15:11.203 --> 00:15:13.555
that some people get synesthetic

00:15:13.555 --> 00:15:16.155
and just have huge pipes that remember everything.

00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:18.824
Other people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information.

00:15:18.824 --> 00:15:22.806
Other people react with various psychological conditions

00:15:22.806 --> 00:15:24.438
or reactions to this information.

00:15:24.438 --> 00:15:27.140
Or maybe it's chemicals.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.905
But when you see an increase

00:15:28.905 --> 00:15:31.256
of that order of magnitude in a condition,

00:15:31.256 --> 00:15:32.821
either you're not measuring it right

00:15:32.821 --> 00:15:35.339
or there's something going on very quickly,

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:39.371
and it may be evolution in real time.

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:41.874
Here's the bottom line.

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:44.055
What I think we are doing

00:15:44.055 --> 00:15:45.771
is we're transitioning as a species.

00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:51.255
And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together.

00:15:51.255 --> 00:15:53.706
I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis

00:15:53.706 --> 00:15:55.105
that, for better or worse,

00:15:55.105 --> 00:15:59.287
is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment,

00:15:59.287 --> 00:16:02.506
it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately

00:16:02.506 --> 00:16:05.704
control the evolution of its own species,

00:16:05.704 --> 00:16:09.538
of bacteria, of plants, of animals.

00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:12.373
And I think that's such an order of magnitude change

00:16:12.373 --> 00:16:15.476
that your grandkids or your great-grandkids

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:18.521
may be a species very different from you.

00:16:18.521 --> 00:16:20.107
Thank you very much.

00:16:20.107 --> 00:16:25.438
(Applause)
