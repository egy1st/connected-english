00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.575
When I go to parties,

00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:03.359
it doesn't usually take very long

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:04.399
for people to find out

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:07.507
that I'm a scientist and I study sex.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:12.408
And then I get asked questions.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:15.575
And the questions usually have a very particular format.

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:16.807
They start with the phrase,

00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:18.708
"A friend told me,"

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.608
and then they end with the phrase,

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:22.525
"Is this true?"

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:23.911
And most of the time

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.030
I'm glad to say that I can answer them,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.877
but sometimes I have to say,

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:29.010
"I'm really sorry,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.194
but I don't know

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:33.278
because I'm not that kind of a doctor."

00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:35.194
That is, I'm not a clinician,

00:00:35.194 --> 00:00:38.385
I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:41.318
And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals

00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:44.635
and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.136
when everything's going right,

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:47.754
rather than trying to figure out

00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:49.337
how to fix things when they go wrong,

00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:50.538
like so many of you.

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:52.937
And what I do is I look for similarities and differences

00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:55.204
in the solutions that they've evolved

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:56.788
for fundamental biological problems.

00:00:56.788 --> 00:00:58.637
So today I'm here to argue

00:00:58.637 --> 00:01:02.503
that this is not at all

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:04.404
an esoteric Ivory Tower activity

00:01:04.404 --> 00:01:05.721
that we find at our universities,

00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:07.704
but that broad study

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:10.656
across species, tissue types and organ systems

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:12.291
can produce insights

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:15.675
that have direct implications for human health.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.173
And this is true both of my recent project

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:19.897
on sex differences in the brain,

00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:21.816
and my more mature work

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:24.650
on the anatomy and function of penises.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.280
And now you know why I'm fun at parties.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.248
(Laughter)

00:01:28.248 --> 00:01:30.531
So today I'm going to give you an example

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:32.248
drawn from my penis study

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:33.865
to show you how knowledge

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:35.632
drawn from studies of one organ system

00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:38.613
provided insights into a very different one.

00:01:38.613 --> 00:01:41.631
Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows --

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.147
I did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week --

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:48.898
penises are structures that transfer sperm

00:01:48.898 --> 00:01:50.198
from one individual to another.

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:51.698
And the slide behind me

00:01:51.698 --> 00:01:53.431
barely scratches the surface

00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:55.396
of how widespread they are in animals.

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.381
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.

00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:01.255
You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins,

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:05.101
as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder

00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:06.736
that we're all familiar with --

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:09.018
or at least half of you are.

00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:11.419
(Laughter)

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.157
And I think we see this tremendous variation

00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:17.308
because it's a really effective solution

00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:19.474
to a very basic biological problem,

00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:21.957
and that is getting sperm in a position

00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:24.509
to meet up with eggs and form zygotes.

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:28.458
Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion,

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:30.924
but when internal fertilization evolves,

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:32.924
penises often follow.

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:37.341
And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is,

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.257
"What made you interested in this subject?"

00:02:40.257 --> 00:02:44.207
And the answer is skeletons.

00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:46.774
You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises

00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:48.625
have very much to do with one another.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:50.757
And that's because we tend to think of skeletons

00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:52.407
as stiff lever systems

00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:54.090
that produce speed or power.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.657
And my first forays into biological research,

00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:00.475
doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate,

00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:02.026
were really squarely in that realm.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:05.143
But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics,

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.608
I really wanted to find a dissertation project

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:10.507
that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function.

00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:12.309
I tried a bunch of different stuff.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:13.957
A lot of it didn't pan out.

00:03:13.957 --> 00:03:15.791
But then one day I started thinking

00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.573
about the mammalian penis.

00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:21.591
And it's really an odd sort of structure.

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.408
Before it can be used for internal fertilization,

00:03:24.408 --> 00:03:25.891
its mechanical behavior has to change

00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:27.608
in a really dramatic fashion.

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:30.206
Most of the time it's a flexible organ.

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:31.490
It's easy to bend.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.484
But before it's brought into use

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:34.702
during copulation

00:03:34.702 --> 00:03:36.460
it has to become rigid,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.475
it has to become difficult to bend.

00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:40.492
And moreover, it has to work.

00:03:40.492 --> 00:03:43.242
A reproductive system that fails to function

00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:46.557
produces an individual that has no offspring,

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:49.728
and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.189
And so I thought, "Here's a problem

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.437
that just cries out for a skeletal system --

00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:58.649
not one like this one,

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.706
but one like this one --

00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:04.123
because, functionally,

00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:05.690
a skeleton is any system

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.722
that supports tissue and transmits forces.

00:04:08.722 --> 00:04:11.072
And I already knew that animals like this earthworm,

00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:12.518
indeed most animals,

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:13.811
don't support their tissues

00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:15.605
by draping them over bones.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.438
Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons.

00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:22.305
They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton.

00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:24.371
And a hydrostatic skeleton

00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:26.289
uses two elements.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.439
The skeletal support comes from an interaction

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.213
between a pressurized fluid

00:04:30.213 --> 00:04:31.819
and a surrounding wall of tissue

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.290
that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.538
And the interaction is crucial.

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:41.906
Without both elements you have no support.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.188
If you have fluid

00:04:43.188 --> 00:04:45.222
with no wall to surround it

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:46.656
and keep pressure up,

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.560
you have a puddle.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.660
And if you have just the wall

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.394
with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension,

00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:54.344
you've got a little wet rag.

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:56.976
When you look at a penis in cross section,

00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:59.409
it has a lot of the hallmarks

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.459
of a hydrostatic skeleton.

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:02.968
It has a central space

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:04.488
of spongy erectile tissue

00:05:04.488 --> 00:05:07.066
that fills with fluid -- in this case blood --

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:09.465
surrounded by a wall of tissue

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:13.316
that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.

00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:15.816
But at the time when I started this project,

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:19.017
the best explanation I could find for penal erection

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:23.301
was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues,

00:05:23.301 --> 00:05:25.000
and the spongy tissues filled with blood

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.268
and pressure rose and voila! it became erect.

00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:32.233
And that explained to me expansion --

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:35.800
made sense: more fluid, you get tissues that expand --

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.817
but it didn't actually explain erection.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:42.708
Because there was no mechanism in this explanation

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.675
for making this structure hard to bend.

00:05:45.675 --> 00:05:48.391
And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue.

00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.993
So I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.

00:05:50.993 --> 00:05:53.359
It has to be part of the explanation.

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:55.894
And this was the point

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:58.491
at which my graduate adviser said,

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.874
"Whoa! Hold on. Slow down."

00:06:01.874 --> 00:06:05.242
Because after about six months of me talking about this,

00:06:05.242 --> 00:06:06.558
I think he finally figured out

00:06:06.558 --> 00:06:09.607
that I was really serious about the penis thing.

00:06:09.607 --> 00:06:12.654
(Laughter)

00:06:12.654 --> 00:06:14.703
So he sat me down, and he warned me.

00:06:14.703 --> 00:06:16.879
He was like, "Be careful going down this path.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.646
I'm not sure this project's going to pan out."

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:22.178
Because he was afraid I was walking into a trap.

00:06:22.178 --> 00:06:26.995
I was taking on a socially embarrassing question

00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:29.330
with an answer that he thought

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.712
might not be particularly interesting.

00:06:31.712 --> 00:06:33.245
And that was because

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:34.763
every hydrostatic skeleton

00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:36.831
that we had found in nature up to that point

00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:38.628
had the same basic elements.

00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:39.845
It had the central fluid,

00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:41.645
it had the surrounding wall,

00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:44.781
and the reinforcing fibers in the wall

00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:47.199
were arranged in crossed helices

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.256
around the long axis of the skeleton.

00:06:49.256 --> 00:06:50.577
So the image behind me

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.206
shows a piece of tissue

00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:54.231
in one of these cross helical skeletons

00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:56.764
cut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall.

00:06:56.764 --> 00:06:58.482
The arrow shows you the long axis.

00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:00.332
And you can see two layers of fibers,

00:07:00.332 --> 00:07:02.033
one in blue and one in yellow,

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:04.831
arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.

00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:07.080
And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.781
those fibers would be going in helices

00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:11.531
around the long axis of the skeleton --

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.664
something like a Chinese finger trap,

00:07:13.664 --> 00:07:15.565
where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck.

00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:18.648
And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors,

00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:20.680
which I'm going to demonstrate in a film.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.831
It's a model skeleton

00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:24.014
that I made out of a piece of cloth

00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:26.567
that I wrapped around an inflated balloon.

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:28.265
The cloth's cut on the bias.

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:31.014
So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices,

00:07:31.014 --> 00:07:35.326
and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves,

00:07:35.326 --> 00:07:36.755
which means the skeleton's flexible.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:39.228
It lengthens, shortens and bends really easily

00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:42.775
in response to internal or external forces.

00:07:42.775 --> 00:07:44.071
Now my adviser's concern

00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.437
was what if the penile wall tissue

00:07:46.437 --> 00:07:48.111
is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.

00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:50.038
What are you going to contribute?

00:07:50.038 --> 00:07:51.505
What new thing are you contributing

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:53.153
to our knowledge of biology?

00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:56.571
And I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here."

00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:58.321
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it.

00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:00.455
And one thing kept bothering me,

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:02.905
and that's, when they're functioning,

00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:04.838
penises don't wiggle.

00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:07.177
(Laughter)

00:08:07.177 --> 00:08:10.078
So something interesting had to be going on.

00:08:10.078 --> 00:08:13.379
So I went ahead, collected wall tissue,

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:14.978
prepared it so it was erect,

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:17.177
sectioned it, put it on slides

00:08:17.177 --> 00:08:19.829
and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look,

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:24.865
fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.

00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:27.263
But instead I saw this.

00:08:27.263 --> 00:08:30.264
There's an outer layer and an inner layer.

00:08:30.264 --> 00:08:32.814
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.

00:08:32.814 --> 00:08:35.383
I was really surprised at this.

00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:36.328
Everyone I showed it

00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:37.528
was really surprised at this.

00:08:37.528 --> 00:08:39.065
Why was everyone surprised at this?

00:08:39.065 --> 00:08:42.049
That's because we knew theoretically

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.864
that there was another way

00:08:44.864 --> 00:08:47.898
of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton,

00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:50.169
and that was with fibers at zero degrees

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:54.035
and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure.

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:57.597
The thing is, no one had ever seen it before in nature.

00:08:57.597 --> 00:09:00.297
And now I was looking at one.

00:09:00.297 --> 00:09:03.031
Those fibers in that particular orientation

00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.246
give the skeleton a very, very different behavior.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:07.431
I'm going to show a model

00:09:07.431 --> 00:09:09.376
made out of exactly the same materials.

00:09:09.376 --> 00:09:11.434
So it'll be made of the same cotton cloth,

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:14.723
same balloon, same internal pressure.

00:09:14.723 --> 00:09:17.190
But the only difference

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.572
is that the fibers are arranged differently.

00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:22.223
And you'll see that, unlike the cross helical model,

00:09:22.223 --> 00:09:25.173
this model resists extension and contraction

00:09:25.173 --> 00:09:26.624
and resists bending.

00:09:26.624 --> 00:09:27.658
Now what that tells us

00:09:27.658 --> 00:09:29.754
is that wall tissues are doing so much more

00:09:29.754 --> 00:09:32.257
than just covering the vascular tissues.

00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:35.751
They're an integral part of the penile skeleton.

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:38.288
If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there,

00:09:38.288 --> 00:09:40.453
if it wasn't reinforced in this way,

00:09:40.453 --> 00:09:41.605
the shape would change,

00:09:41.605 --> 00:09:43.989
but the inflated penis would not resist bending,

00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:46.036
and erection simply wouldn't work.

00:09:46.036 --> 00:09:48.637
It's an observation with obvious medical applications

00:09:48.637 --> 00:09:50.419
in humans as well,

00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:53.354
but it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think,

00:09:53.354 --> 00:09:55.786
to the design of prosthetics, soft robots,

00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:56.853
basically anything

00:09:56.853 --> 00:10:00.171
where changes of shape and stiffness are important.

00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:01.919
So to sum up:

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:03.136
Twenty years ago,

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.886
I had a college adviser tell me,

00:10:04.886 --> 00:10:06.937
when I went to the college and said,

00:10:06.937 --> 00:10:08.086
"I'm kind of interested in anatomy,"

00:10:08.086 --> 00:10:09.970
they said, "Anatomy's a dead science."


00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.587
He couldn't have been more wrong.

00:10:12.587 --> 00:10:15.320
I really believe that we still have a lot to learn

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.453
about the normal structure and function of our bodies.

00:10:18.453 --> 00:10:21.267
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology,

00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:24.666
but up here in the meat end of the scale.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.101
We've got limits on our time.

00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:28.366
We often focus on one disease,

00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:29.550
one model, one problem,

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.124
but my experience suggests

00:10:31.124 --> 00:10:32.902
that we should take the time

00:10:32.902 --> 00:10:35.467
to apply ideas broadly between systems

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:37.341
and just see where it takes us.

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:40.941
After all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.407
can give us insights

00:10:42.407 --> 00:10:44.492
about mammalian reproductive systems,

00:10:44.492 --> 00:10:48.541
there could be lots of other wild and productive connections

00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.990
lurking out there just waiting to be found.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.842
Thank you.

00:10:52.842 --> 00:10:56.230
(Applause)
