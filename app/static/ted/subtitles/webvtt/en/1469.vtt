00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:04.212
I have the answer to a question that we've all asked.

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:05.329
The question is,

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:07.613
Why is it that the letter X

00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:09.611
represents the unknown?

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:12.578
Now I know we learned that in math class,

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.329
but now it's everywhere in the culture --

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.130
The X prize, the X-Files,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.053
Project X, TEDx.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:23.048
Where'd that come from?

00:00:23.048 --> 00:00:24.266
About six years ago

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.982
I decided that I would learn Arabic,

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:30.934
which turns out to be a supremely logical language.

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:33.251
To write a word or a phrase

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:34.932
or a sentence in Arabic

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:37.165
is like crafting an equation,

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:39.531
because every part is extremely precise

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.383
and carries a lot of information.

00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:43.733
That's one of the reasons

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.248
so much of what we've come to think of

00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:49.067
as Western science and mathematics and engineering

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:52.389
was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:55.705
by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:58.022
This includes the little system in Arabic

00:00:58.022 --> 00:00:59.738
called al-jebra.

00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:02.906
And al-jebr roughly translates to

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:06.605
"the system for reconciling disparate parts."

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:10.655
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra.

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:12.822
One example among many.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:16.788
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom

00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:18.571
finally made their way to Europe --

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:19.857
which is to say Spain --

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:22.322
in the 11th and 12th centuries.

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:23.472
And when they arrived

00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:25.355
there was tremendous interest

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:27.089
in translating this wisdom

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:28.738
into a European language.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:30.756
But there were problems.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.473
One problem

00:01:32.473 --> 00:01:35.106
is there are some sounds in Arabic

00:01:35.106 --> 00:01:38.105
that just don't make it through a European voice box

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:40.372
without lots of practice.

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:42.106
Trust me on that one.

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:44.323
Also, those very sounds

00:01:44.323 --> 00:01:46.237
tend not to be represented

00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:49.825
by the characters that are available in European languages.

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:51.639
Here's one of the culprits.

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.523
This is the letter sheen,

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:57.122
and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh."

00:01:57.122 --> 00:01:59.724
It's also the very first letter

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:02.156
of the word shayun,

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.950
which means "something"

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.798
just like the the English word "something" --

00:02:05.798 --> 00:02:09.084
some undefined, unknown thing.

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:10.249
Now in Arabic,

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.450
we can make this definite

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.598
by adding the definite article "al."

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:16.200
So this is al-shayun --

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.850
the unknown thing.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.153
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics,

00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:28.353
such as this 10th-century derivation of roots.

00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:30.863
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars

00:02:30.863 --> 00:02:33.431
who were tasked with translating this material

00:02:33.431 --> 00:02:37.913
is that the letter sheen and the word shayun

00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:39.863
can't be rendered into Spanish

00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:42.449
because Spanish doesn't have that SH,

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.746
that "sh" sound.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.328
So by convention,

00:02:45.328 --> 00:02:46.994
they created a rule in which

00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:51.212
they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound,

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.960
from the classical Greek

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.641
in the form of the letter Kai.

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.360
Later when this material was translated

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.708
into a common European language,

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:02.758
which is to say Latin,

00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:04.791
they simply replaced the Greek Kai

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:07.141
with the Latin X.

00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:08.410
And once that happened,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.875
once this material was in Latin,

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.458
it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:16.541
for almost 600 years.

00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.559
But now we have the answer to our question.

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.340
Why is it that X is the unknown?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.163
X is the unknown

00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:26.945
because you can't say "sh" in Spanish.

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:29.329
(Laughter)

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.646
And I thought that was worth sharing.

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:34.763
(Applause)
