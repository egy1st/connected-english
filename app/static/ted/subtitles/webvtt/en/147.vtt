WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a medical illustrator,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I come from a slightly different point of view.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've been watching, since I grew up,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and truth and beauty in the sciences.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
they both have very wonderful things going for them --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that a scientist would want to date.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
(Laughter)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
These are expressions of truth as awe-full things,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
by meaning they are things you can worship.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They are unique. They are useful --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
sometimes, often a long time after the fact.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
because I don't want to look at me on the screen.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Truth and beauty are things

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They are things that describe beauty in a way

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that is often only accessible if you understand the language

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and the syntax of the person

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If you look at the math, E=mc squared,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if you look at the cosmological constant,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
from the numbers that describe the universe --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
these are things that are really difficult to understand.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And what I've tried to do

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
since I had my training as a medical illustrator --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
since I was taught animation by my father,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I wanted to figure out a way to help people

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Students today are often immersed in an environment

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
are not always evident.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We don't want to do that to our students.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So we have an opportunity to really open up education.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
would be interested and willing to really change

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that would explore the truth and beauty inherent

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
in molecular and cellular biology

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
so that students could understand a larger picture

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that they could hang all of these facts on.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
They could have a mental image of the cell

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that's occupied by micro-machines.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
These micro-machines,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that are made out of strings of amino acids.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And these micro-machines power how a cell moves.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
They power our minds.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And so what we wanted to do was to figure out

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
how we could make this story into an animation

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
which is a website that Harvard has

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
for its molecular and cellular biology students

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that will -- in addition to all the textual information,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in addition to all the didactic stuff --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
put everything together visually, so that these students

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
would have an internalized view of what a cell really is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
so that their passions would be sparked

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and so that they would be able to go on

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and to be able to find out, really, how life works.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
that are streaming down a capillary,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and they're picking up information from cells

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
that there's an inflammation somewhere outside,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
where they can't see and sense.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But they get the information that causes them to stop,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
causes them to internalize that they need to make

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So these molecular motors -- we had to work

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
with the Harvard scientists and databank models

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
of the atomically accurate molecules

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And figure out how to do this in a way

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
would prevent the vista from happening.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that we produced. It's an ongoing project

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that's going to go another four or five years.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And I want you to look at this

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and see the paths that the cell manufactures --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
these little walking machines, they're called kinesins --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that take these huge loads

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that would challenge an ant in relative size.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Run the movie, please.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
But these machines that power the inside of the cells

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
because all of these machines interact with each other.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
They pass information to each other.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
They cause different things to happen inside the cell.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
on the fly, from information

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
would be possible without these little micro-machines.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
(Laughter)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:38.000
(Music)

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
This little guy is called the kinesin,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
to wherever it's needed in the cell --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
whether it's to build something or repair something.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
running around, right now,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So no matter how lazy you feel,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(Laughter)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So what I want you to do when you go home

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And think about some of the things

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that we're learning about cellular mechanics.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Once we figure out all that's going on --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
once we figure out what's going on,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
we're really going to be able to have a lot of control

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
over what we do with our health,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
with what we do with future generations,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and how long we're going to live.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And hopefully we'll be able to use this

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to discover more truth, and more beauty.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:01.000
(Music)

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And their working together helps our bodies --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
(Applause)
