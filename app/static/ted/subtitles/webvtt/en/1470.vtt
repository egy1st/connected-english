00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:02.450
I collaborate with bacteria.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.332
And I'm about to show you

00:00:03.332 --> 00:00:05.512
some stop-motion footage that I made recently

00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:07.746
where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals

00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:09.296
from their environment

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:11.230
over the period of an hour.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.595
So what you're seeing here

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.813
is the bacteria metabolizing,

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:16.012
and as they do so

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:17.618
they create an electrical charge.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.951
And this attracts metals

00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:22.118
from their local environment.

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:25.035
And these metals accumulate as minerals

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:26.952
on the surface of the bacteria.

00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:29.119
One of the most pervasive problems

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.868
in the world today for people

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:32.285
is inadequate access

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:34.036
to clean drinking water.

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.702
And the desalination process

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.486
is one where we take out salts.

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:40.001
We can use it for drinking and agriculture.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.086
Removing the salts from water --

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:43.347
particularly seawater --

00:00:43.347 --> 00:00:44.951
through reverse osmosis

00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:46.269
is a critical technique

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.501
for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:50.620
around the globe.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.084
So seawater reverse osmosis

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:54.251
is a membrane-filtration technology.

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:56.821
We take the water from the sea

00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.352
and we apply pressure.

00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:01.276
And this pressure forces the seawater

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:02.576
through a membrane.

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:04.011
This takes energy,

00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:06.543
producing clean water.

00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:10.244
But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine.

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:11.657
But the process is very expensive

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:14.291
and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:16.073
And also, the brine that's produced

00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:18.957
is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.

00:01:18.957 --> 00:01:21.505
And this is detrimental to the local ecology

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:23.940
of the sea area that it's pumped back out into.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.956
So I work in Singapore at the moment,

00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:28.723
and this is a place that's really a leading place

00:01:28.723 --> 00:01:30.724
for desalination technology.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:33.274
And Singapore proposes by 2060

00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:36.373
to produce [900] million liters per day

00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:38.206
of desalinated water.

00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:41.556
But this will produce an equally massive amount

00:01:41.556 --> 00:01:43.309
of desalination brine.

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:46.507
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:48.456
So what we're doing at the moment

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:51.122
is we're accumulating metals

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:53.106
like calcium, potassium and magnesium

00:01:53.106 --> 00:01:55.340
from out of desalination brine.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.622
And this, in terms of magnesium

00:01:57.622 --> 00:02:00.172
and the amount of water that I just mentioned,

00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:03.122
equates to a $4.5 billion

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.521
mining industry for Singapore --

00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:08.071
a place that doesn't have any natural resources.

00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:10.721
So I'd like you to image a mining industry

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:12.810
in a way that one hasn't existed before;

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.976
imagine a mining industry

00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:17.243
that doesn't mean defiling the Earth;

00:02:17.243 --> 00:02:19.354
imagine bacteria helping us do this

00:02:19.354 --> 00:02:22.826
by accumulating and precipitating

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:25.243
and sedimenting minerals

00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:27.092
out of desalination brine.

00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:28.510
And what you can see here

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.992
is the beginning of an industry in a test tube,

00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:34.342
a mining industry that is in harmony with nature.

00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:35.693
Thank you.

00:02:35.693 --> 00:02:39.325
