00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.671
Today I'm going to unpack for you

00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:05.401
three examples of iconic design,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:06.686
and it makes perfect sense

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:09.375
that I should be the one to do it

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.302
because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.

00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:14.648
(Laughter)

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.071
But I'm also a famous

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.132
minor television personality

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:20.202
and an avid collector of

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.778
Design Within Reach catalogs,

00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:24.085
so I pretty much know

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:25.605
everything there is.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:26.976
Now, I'm sure you

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:28.311
recognize this object;

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:30.005
many of you probably saw it

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:31.473
as you were landing your private zeppelins

00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:33.961
at Los Angeles International Airport

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:36.154
over the past couple of days.

00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:39.497
This is known as the Theme Building;

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.237
that is its name for reasons

00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:43.988
that are still very murky.

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.409
And it is perhaps

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.699
the best example we have in Los Angeles

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.717
of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.

00:00:53.717 --> 00:00:56.530
It was first excavated in 1961

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.420
as they were building LAX,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.069
although scientists believe that

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.656
it dates back to the year 2000

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:04.721
Before Common Era,

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.062
when it was used as

00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:08.437
a busy transdimensional space port

00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:10.485
by the ancient astronauts

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:12.567
who first colonized this planet

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.077
and raised our species

00:01:14.077 --> 00:01:15.793
from savagery by giving us

00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:17.487
the gift of written language

00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:19.285
and technology and

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:21.765
the gift of revolving restaurants.

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:24.818
It is thought to have been

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.440
a replacement for the older space ports

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.293
located, of course, at Stonehenge

00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:31.489
and considered to be

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:32.616
quite an improvement

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:34.693
due to the uncluttered design,

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:37.313
the lack of druids hanging around all the time

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:39.102
and obviously, the much better

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:40.822
access to parking.

00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:43.112
When it was uncovered,

00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:45.318
it ushered in a new era

00:01:45.318 --> 00:01:48.582
of streamlined, archaically futuristic design

00:01:48.582 --> 00:01:50.011
called Googie,

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.893
which came to be synonymous with

00:01:51.893 --> 00:01:54.092
the Jet Age, a misnomer.

00:01:54.092 --> 00:01:56.826
After all, the ancient astronauts who used it

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:58.664
did not travel by jet very often,

00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:01.952
preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:04.608
powered by crystal skulls.

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:06.890
(Applause)

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.476
(Music)

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:14.138
Ah yes, a table.

00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:15.598
We use these every day.

00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:17.344
And on top of it,

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:19.499
the juicy salif.

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:20.953
This is a design by Philippe Starck,

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.016
who I believe is in the audience at this very moment.

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.931
And you can tell it is a Starck design

00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:28.357
by its precision, its playfulness,

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:30.598
its innovation and

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:33.850
its promise of imminent violence.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.915
(Laughter)

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:38.873
It is a design that challenges your intuition --

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:41.222
it is not what you think it is when you first see it.

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:43.045
It is not a fork designed

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:46.419
to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time,

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.195
which would be useful out in the lobby,

00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:49.364
I would say.

00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:50.633
And despite its obvious

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:52.389
influence by the ancient astronauts

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.579
and its space agey-ness and tripodism,

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.021
it is not something

00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.152
designed to attach to your brain

00:03:00.158 --> 00:03:02.329
and suck out your thoughts.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.654
It is in fact a citrus juicer

00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:06.533
and when I say that,

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:09.325
you never see it as anything else again.

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:13.384
It is also not a monument to design,

00:03:13.384 --> 00:03:15.977
it is a monument to design's utility.

00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:18.049
You can take it home with you,

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.877
unlike the Theme Building,

00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:22.438
which will stay where it is forever.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:24.012
This is affordable

00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:25.621
and can come home with you

00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:27.681
and, as such, it can sit

00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.069
on your kitchen counter --

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.175
it can't go in your drawers;

00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.895
trust me, I found that out the hard way --

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:35.881
and make your kitchen counter into

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:37.454
a monument to design.

00:03:37.454 --> 00:03:38.725
One other thing about it,

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:40.271
if you do have one at home,

00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:42.490
let me tell you one of the features you may not know:

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.436
when you fall asleep,

00:03:44.436 --> 00:03:47.827
it comes alive

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.069
and it walks around your house

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.408
and goes through your mail

00:03:51.408 --> 00:03:53.658
and watches you as you sleep.

00:03:53.658 --> 00:03:57.840
(Applause)

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.444
Okay, what is this object?

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:07.932
I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is.

00:04:07.932 --> 00:04:09.734
It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate?

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:11.142
I don't get it.

00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:13.219
Does anyone know? Chi?

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.022
It's an ... iPhone. iPhone.

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:17.336
Oh yes, that's right, I remember those;

00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:19.317
I had my whole bathroom tiles

00:04:19.317 --> 00:04:22.586
redone with those back in the good old days.

00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:24.595
No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:26.311
Here is my well-loved iPhone.

00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:29.355
I do so many things on this little device.

00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:31.365
I like to read books on it.

00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:33.877
More than that, I like to buy books on it

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:35.808
that I never have to feel guilty about not reading

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.509
because they go in here and I never look at them again

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.455
and it's perfect.

00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:42.611
I use it every day to

00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.046
measure the weight of an ox,

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:46.807
for example.

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:48.394
Every now and then,

00:04:48.394 --> 00:04:49.847
I admit that I complete

00:04:49.847 --> 00:04:52.099
a phone call on it occasionally.

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.797
And yet I forget about it all the time.

00:04:55.797 --> 00:04:57.579
This is a design

00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:59.200
that once you saw it,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.442
you forgot about it.

00:05:00.442 --> 00:05:03.145
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement

00:05:03.145 --> 00:05:06.227
that occurred in 2007 when you first

00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:08.997
touched this thing because it became

00:05:08.997 --> 00:05:10.634
so quickly pervasive

00:05:10.634 --> 00:05:13.060
and because of how instantly

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.430
we adopted these gestures

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.425
and made it an extension of our life.

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:20.931
Unlike the Theme Building,

00:05:20.931 --> 00:05:22.954
this is not alien technology.

00:05:22.954 --> 00:05:24.716
Or I should say,

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:26.515
what it did was it took technology

00:05:26.515 --> 00:05:27.947
which, unlike people in this room,

00:05:27.947 --> 00:05:29.041
to many other people in the world,

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:30.272
still feels very alien,

00:05:30.272 --> 00:05:32.385
and made it immediately and instantly feel

00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:34.624
familiar and intimate.

00:05:34.624 --> 00:05:36.823
And unlike the juicy salif,

00:05:36.823 --> 00:05:38.455
it does not threaten

00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:40.647
to attach itself to your brain,

00:05:40.647 --> 00:05:42.615
rather, it simply

00:05:42.615 --> 00:05:44.458
attaches itself to your brain.

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:46.526
(Laughter)

00:05:46.526 --> 00:05:49.300
And you didn't even notice it happened.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.422
So there you go. My name is John Hodgman.

00:05:51.422 --> 00:05:54.647
I just explained design.

00:05:54.647 --> 00:05:56.458
Thank you very much.

00:05:56.458 --> 00:06:00.454
(Applause)
