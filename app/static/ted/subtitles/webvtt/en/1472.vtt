WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.341
I always wanted to become
a walking laboratory of social engagement:

00:00:06.313 --> 00:00:11.683
to resonate other people's feelings,
thoughts, intentions, motivations,

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:13.368
in the act of being with them.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.528
As a scientist, I always wanted
to measure that resonance,

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:23.394
that sense of the other
that happens so quickly,

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:24.725
in the blink of an eye.

00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:28.008
We intuit other people's feelings;

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:31.175
we know the meaning of their actions
even before they happen.

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:33.705
We're always in this stance

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:36.811
of being the object
of somebody else's subjectivity.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:39.575
We do that all the time.
We just can't shake it off.

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:43.724
It's so important that the very tools
we use to understand ourselves,

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:45.575
to understand the world around us,

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:47.205
are shaped by that stance.

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:50.277
We are social to the core.

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:54.023
So my journey in autism really started

00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:57.653
when I lived in a residential unit
for adults with autism.

00:00:58.068 --> 00:01:01.159
Most of those individuals
had spent most of their lives

00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:02.668
in long-stay hospitals.

00:01:02.692 --> 00:01:04.157
This is a long time ago.

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:08.548
And for them, autism was devastating.

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:12.038
They had profound
intellectual disabilities.

00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:13.792
They didn't talk.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.629
But most of all,

00:01:16.217 --> 00:01:21.146
they were extraordinarily isolated
from the world around them,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.007
from their environment

00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:24.904
and from the people.

00:01:25.392 --> 00:01:28.219
In fact, at the time,
if you walked into a school

00:01:28.243 --> 00:01:30.031
for individuals with autism,

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:32.368
you'd hear a lot of noise,

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:36.465
plenty of commotion, actions,
people doing things.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.215
But they're always doing
things by themselves.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.886
So they may be looking
at a light in the ceiling,

00:01:45.527 --> 00:01:48.309
or they may be isolated in the corner,

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:52.471
or they might be engaged
in these repetitive movements,

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:55.914
in self-stimulatory movements
that led them nowhere.

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:59.157
Extremely, extremely isolated.

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:06.205
Well, now we know that autism
is this disruption,

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.746
the disruption of this resonance
that I am telling you about.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.704
These are survival skills.

00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:13.855
These are survival skills
that we inherited

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:18.019
over many, many hundreds
of thousands of years of evolution.

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:23.513
You see, babies are born
in a state of utter fragility.

00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:26.161
Without the caregiver,
they wouldn't survive,

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:28.691
so it stands to reason
that nature would endow them

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.492
with these mechanisms of survival.

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.112
They orient to the caregiver.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:37.377
From the first days and weeks of life,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.674
babies prefer to hear human sounds,

00:02:40.698 --> 00:02:42.822
rather than just sounds
in the environment.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.323
They prefer to look at people
rather than at things,

00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:48.688
and even as they're looking at people,
they look at people's eyes,

00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:53.955
because the eye is the window
to the other person's experiences,

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.437
so much so that they even prefer
to look at people

00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:59.700
who are looking at them
rather than people who are looking away.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:03.107
Well, they orient to the caregiver.

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:04.764
The caregiver seeks the baby.

00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:08.520
And it's out of this mutually
reinforcing choreography

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:12.880
that a lot that is of importance
to the emergence of mind --

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:16.428
the social mind, the social
brain -- depends on.

00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:20.659
We always think about autism

00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:25.323
as something that happens
later on in life.

00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:28.752
It doesn't; it begins
with the beginning of life.

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:36.496
As babies engage with caregivers,
they soon realize that, well,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.642
there is something between the ears
that is very important --

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:44.081
it's invisible, you can't see it,
but it's really critical.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.776
And that thing is called attention.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.133
And they learn soon enough,

00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:50.745
even before they can utter one word,

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.652
that they can take that attention
and move somewhere

00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:56.071
in order to get things they want.

00:03:57.555 --> 00:04:00.655
They also learn to follow
other people's gazes,

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:04.664
because whatever people are looking at
is what they are thinking about.

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:10.350
And soon enough, they start to learn
about the meaning of things,

00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:12.747
because when somebody
is looking at something

00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:14.989
or somebody is pointing at something,

00:04:15.013 --> 00:04:17.186
they're not just getting
a directional cue.

00:04:17.752 --> 00:04:21.435
They are getting the other
person's meaning of that thing,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.669
the attitude.

00:04:22.693 --> 00:04:27.464
And soon enough, they start
building this body of meanings,

00:04:27.488 --> 00:04:31.340
but meanings that were acquired
within the realm of social interaction.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.025
Those are meanings that are acquired

00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:36.681
as part of their shared
experiences with others.

00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:43.902
Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl,

00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:47.159
and she has autism.

00:04:48.594 --> 00:04:54.382
And I am coming so close to her
that I am maybe two inches from her face,

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:56.241
and she's quite oblivious to me.

00:04:56.265 --> 00:04:59.693
Imagine if I did that to you,
came two inches from your face.

00:04:59.717 --> 00:05:01.922
You'd do probably
two things, wouldn't you?

00:05:01.946 --> 00:05:04.544
You would recoil.
You would call the police.

00:05:04.568 --> 00:05:05.742
(Laughter)

00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:06.919
You would do something,

00:05:06.943 --> 00:05:11.001
because it's literally impossible
to penetrate somebody's physical space

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:12.428
and not get that reaction.

00:05:12.452 --> 00:05:15.907
We do so, remember,
intuitively, effortlessly.

00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:17.096
This is our body wisdom;

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.318
it's not something mediated
by our language.

00:05:19.342 --> 00:05:21.773
Our body just knows that.

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:24.637
And we've known that for a long time.

00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:27.576
And this is not something
that happens to humans only.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.800
It happens to some
of our phyletic cousins,

00:05:30.824 --> 00:05:34.890
because if you're a monkey,
and you look at another monkey,

00:05:34.914 --> 00:05:38.908
and that monkey has a higher
hierarchy position than you,

00:05:38.932 --> 00:05:42.461
and that is considered
to be a signal or threat,

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.879
well, you are not going
to be alive for long.

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:50.197
So something that in other species
are survival mechanisms,

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:53.328
without which they
wouldn't basically live,

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:55.883
we bring into the context of human beings,

00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:59.624
and this is what we need
to simply act, socially.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.949
Now, she is oblivious to me
and I'm so close to her,

00:06:02.973 --> 00:06:04.947
and you think, maybe she can see you,

00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:06.482
maybe she can hear you.

00:06:06.506 --> 00:06:08.128
Well, a few minutes later,

00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:10.093
she goes to the corner of the room,

00:06:10.117 --> 00:06:13.867
and she finds a tiny little piece
of candy, an M&amp;M.

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:19.376
So I could not attract her attention,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.271
but something -- a thing -- did.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.447
Now, most of us make a big dichotomy

00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.351
between the world of things
and the world of people.

00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:33.373
Now, for this girl,
that division line is not so clear,

00:06:33.397 --> 00:06:36.503
and the world of people
is not attracting her

00:06:36.527 --> 00:06:37.986
as much as we would like.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.697
Now, remember that we learn a great deal
by sharing experiences.

00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:48.306
What she is doing right now
is that her path of learning is diverging,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.071
moment by moment,

00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:53.315
as she is isolating herself
further and further.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.855
So we feel sometimes
that the brain is deterministic,

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.056
the brain determines
who we're going to be.

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:02.217
But, in fact, the brain
also becomes who we are,

00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:06.230
and at the same time
that her behaviors are taking away

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:08.416
from the realm of social interaction,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.465
this is what's happening with her mind,

00:07:10.489 --> 00:07:12.905
and this is what's happening
with her brain.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:20.343
Well, autism is the most strongly
genetic condition

00:07:20.367 --> 00:07:22.239
of all developmental disorders.

00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:26.119
And it's a brain disorder.

00:07:26.695 --> 00:07:29.924
It's a disorder that begins
much prior to the time

00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:31.263
that the child is born.

00:07:32.217 --> 00:07:36.198
We now know that there is a very
broad spectrum of autism.

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:39.691
There are those individuals
who are profoundly intellectually disabled

00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:41.672
but there are those that are gifted.

00:07:41.696 --> 00:07:44.090
There are those individuals
who don't talk at all;

00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:46.502
there are those individuals
who talk too much.

00:07:46.526 --> 00:07:50.023
There are those individuals
that if you observe them in their school,

00:07:50.047 --> 00:07:53.717
you see them running the periphery fence
all the school day if you let them,

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:56.102
to those individuals
who cannot stop coming to you

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:58.979
and trying to engage you
repeatedly, relentlessly,

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:01.360
but often in an awkward fashion,

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.889
without that immediate resonance.

00:08:05.812 --> 00:08:09.558
Well, this is much more prevalent
than we thought at the time.

00:08:09.582 --> 00:08:10.993
When I started in this field,

00:08:11.017 --> 00:08:14.105
we thought there were four individuals
with autism per 10,000 --

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:15.400
a very rare condition.

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:19.515
Well, now we know it's more
like one in 100.

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:23.245
There are millions of individuals
with autism all around us.

00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:28.469
The societal cost
of this condition is huge,

00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:31.533
in the US alone,
maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.

00:08:31.557 --> 00:08:32.745
And you know what?

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:37.406
Most of those funds are associated
with adolescents and particularly adults

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.181
who are severely disabled,

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:41.366
individuals who need
wraparound services --

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.646
services that are very, very intensive.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.756
And those services can cost in excess
of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year.

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:51.760
Those are individuals who did not
benefit from early treatment,

00:08:52.474 --> 00:08:56.612
because now we know
that autism creates itself

00:08:56.636 --> 00:09:00.788
as individuals diverge in that pathway
of learning that I mentioned to you.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.773
Were we to be able
to identify this condition

00:09:03.797 --> 00:09:06.547
at an earlier point,
and intervene and treat --

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:11.866
I can tell you, this has been probably
something that has changed my life

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.186
in the past 10 years,

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.464
this notion that we can absolutely
attenuate this condition.

00:09:18.922 --> 00:09:21.277
Also, we have a window of opportunity,

00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:23.921
because the brain
is malleable for just so long,

00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:27.950
and that window of opportunity
happens in the first three years of life.

00:09:27.974 --> 00:09:30.685
It's not that that window
closes; it doesn't.

00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:34.134
But it diminishes considerably.

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:37.997
And yet, the median age
of diagnosis in this country

00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:39.933
is still about five years,

00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:42.052
and in disadvantaged populations,

00:09:42.076 --> 00:09:45.205
the populations that don't have
access to clinical services,

00:09:45.229 --> 00:09:47.642
rural populations, minorities,

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.047
the age of diagnosis is later still,

00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:53.096
which is almost as if I were to tell you

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.887
that we are condemning those communities
to have individuals with autism

00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:59.234
whose condition is going
to be more severe.

00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:02.706
So I feel that we have
a bioethical imperative.

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:04.897
The science is there.

00:10:06.025 --> 00:10:08.145
But no science is of relevance

00:10:08.169 --> 00:10:11.098
if it doesn't have an impact
on the community.

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:14.681
And we just can't afford
that missed opportunity,

00:10:14.705 --> 00:10:17.650
because children with autism
become adults with autism.

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:22.416
And we feel that those things we can do

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.818
for these children,
for those families, early on,

00:10:24.842 --> 00:10:27.019
will have lifetime consequences --

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:31.051
for the child, for the family,
and for the community at large.

00:10:31.075 --> 00:10:33.648
So this is our view of autism.

00:10:34.145 --> 00:10:37.467
There are over a hundred genes
that are associated with autism.

00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:39.450
In fact, we believe there are going to be

00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:43.279
something between 300 and 600
genes associated with autism,

00:10:43.303 --> 00:10:46.606
and genetic anomalies,
much more than just genes.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.779
And we actually have
a bit of a question here,

00:10:51.644 --> 00:10:54.929
because if there are so many
different causes of autism,

00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:59.221
how do you go from those liabilities
to the actual syndrome?

00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:00.796
Because people like myself,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.767
when we walk into a playroom,

00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:06.149
we recognize a child as having autism.

00:11:06.835 --> 00:11:09.063
So how do you go from multiple causes

00:11:09.087 --> 00:11:11.415
to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?

00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:15.182
And the answer is what lies in between,

00:11:15.753 --> 00:11:17.185
which is development.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.433
And in fact, we are very interested
in those first two years of life,

00:11:22.457 --> 00:11:26.245
because those liabilities
don't necessarily convert into autism.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.027
Autism creates itself.

00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:32.657
Were we to be able to intervene
during those years of life,

00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:38.985
we might attenuate for some, and God
knows, maybe even prevent for others.

00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:41.213
So how do we do that?

00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:44.729
How do we enter that feeling of resonance,

00:11:44.753 --> 00:11:47.547
how do we enter another person's being?

00:11:49.137 --> 00:11:52.252
I remember when I interacted
with that 15-month-old,

00:11:52.276 --> 00:11:54.414
the thing that came to my mind was,

00:11:54.438 --> 00:11:56.751
"How do you come into her world?

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.807
Is she thinking about me?
Is she thinking about others?"

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.760
Well, it's hard to do that,

00:12:04.784 --> 00:12:06.962
so we had to create the technologies.

00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:09.455
We had to basically step inside a body.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.073
We had to see the world through her eyes.

00:12:13.192 --> 00:12:15.504
And so in the past many years,

00:12:15.528 --> 00:12:17.924
we've been building these new technologies

00:12:17.948 --> 00:12:19.529
that are based on eye tracking.

00:12:19.553 --> 00:12:24.469
We can see, moment by moment,
what children are engaging with.

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.810
This is my colleague, Warren Jones,

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:31.128
with whom we've been building
these methods, these studies,

00:12:31.152 --> 00:12:32.481
for the past 12 years.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:36.035
And you see there a happy five-month-old,

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:41.856
a five-month little boy
who is going to watch things

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.792
that are brought from his world:

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:46.829
his mom, the caregiver,

00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:51.083
but also experiences that he would have
were he to be in his daycare.

00:12:51.884 --> 00:12:55.724
What we want is to embrace that world
and bring it into our laboratory,

00:12:55.748 --> 00:12:57.782
but in order for us to do that,

00:12:57.806 --> 00:13:02.061
we had to create
these very sophisticated measures,

00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:05.566
measures of how people, how little babies,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.104
how newborns, engage
with the world, moment by moment.

00:13:10.128 --> 00:13:12.413
What is important and what is not.

00:13:13.163 --> 00:13:15.774
Well, we created those measures,

00:13:15.798 --> 00:13:19.159
and here, what you see
is what we call a funnel of attention.

00:13:19.826 --> 00:13:21.191
You're watching a video --

00:13:21.739 --> 00:13:24.470
those frames are separated
by about a second --

00:13:24.494 --> 00:13:28.366
through the eyes of 35 typically
developing two-year-olds.

00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:31.134
And we freeze one frame,

00:13:31.908 --> 00:13:34.996
and this is what the typical
children are doing.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.437
In this scan pass, in green here,
are two-year-olds with autism.

00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:44.824
So on that frame, the children
who are typical are watching this,

00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:48.564
the emotion of expression
of that little boy

00:13:48.588 --> 00:13:51.314
as he's fighting a little bit
with the little girl.

00:13:51.338 --> 00:13:53.375
What are the children with autism doing?

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.494
They are focusing on the revolving door,

00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:58.725
opening and shutting.

00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:02.891
Well, I can tell you that this divergence
that you're seeing here

00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:05.727
doesn't happen only
in our five-minute experiment.

00:14:05.751 --> 00:14:08.685
It happens moment by moment
in their real lives,

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.053
and their minds are being formed
and their brains are being specialized

00:14:14.077 --> 00:14:18.100
in something other than what is happening
with their typical peers.

00:14:18.807 --> 00:14:25.326
Well, we took a construct
from our pediatrician friends,

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.869
the concept of growth charts --

00:14:26.893 --> 00:14:29.370
you know, when you take
a child to the pediatrician,

00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:32.476
and you have physical height and weight.

00:14:33.066 --> 00:14:36.000
Well, we decided we were going
to create growth charts

00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:37.325
of social engagement.

00:14:38.354 --> 00:14:41.122
We sought children
from the time they're born.

00:14:41.574 --> 00:14:44.949
What you see here on the x-axis

00:14:44.973 --> 00:14:49.158
is two, three, four, five,
six months and nine,

00:14:49.182 --> 00:14:50.945
until about the age of 24 months.

00:14:50.969 --> 00:14:53.740
This is the percent of their viewing time

00:14:53.764 --> 00:14:55.675
that they're focusing on people's eyes,

00:14:55.699 --> 00:14:57.628
and this is their growth chart.

00:14:58.144 --> 00:15:00.617
They start over here --
they love people's eyes --

00:15:00.641 --> 00:15:02.684
and it remains quite stable.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.613
It sort of goes up a little bit
in those initial months.

00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:11.056
Now, let's see what's happening
with babies who became autistic.

00:15:11.771 --> 00:15:13.263
It's something very different.

00:15:14.004 --> 00:15:16.934
It starts way up here,
but then it's a free fall.

00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:21.670
It's very much like they brought
into this world the reflex

00:15:21.694 --> 00:15:24.887
that orients them to people,
but it has no traction.

00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:27.945
It's almost as if that stimulus -- you --

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.530
you're not exerting
influence on what happens

00:15:31.554 --> 00:15:33.908
as they navigate their daily lives.

00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:41.996
Now, we thought those data
were so powerful, in a way,

00:15:42.686 --> 00:15:45.936
that we wanted to see what happened
in the first six months of life,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.168
because if you interact
with a two- and a three-month-old,

00:15:49.192 --> 00:15:52.442
you'd be surprised
by how social those babies are.

00:15:53.513 --> 00:15:56.370
And what we see
in the first six months of life

00:15:56.394 --> 00:16:01.271
is that those two groups
can be segregated very easily.

00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:05.276
And using these kinds
of measures and many others,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.953
what we found out
is that our science could, in fact,

00:16:08.977 --> 00:16:11.201
identify this condition early on.

00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:14.910
We didn't have to wait
for the behaviors of autism

00:16:14.934 --> 00:16:17.013
to emerge in the second year of life.

00:16:18.156 --> 00:16:22.683
If we measured things that are,
evolutionarily, highly conserved,

00:16:22.707 --> 00:16:25.030
and developmentally very early-emerging --

00:16:25.054 --> 00:16:27.731
things that are online
from the first weeks of life --

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.717
we could push the detection of autism

00:16:29.741 --> 00:16:32.269
all the way to those first months,

00:16:32.293 --> 00:16:34.277
and that's what we are doing now.

00:16:36.618 --> 00:16:39.775
Now, we can create
the very best technologies

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:42.805
and the very best methods
to identify the children,

00:16:43.591 --> 00:16:46.505
but this would be for naught
if we didn't have an impact

00:16:46.529 --> 00:16:49.209
on what happens in their reality
in the community.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.962
Now we want those devices, of course,

00:16:51.986 --> 00:16:54.815
to be deployed by those
who are in the trenches --

00:16:54.839 --> 00:16:59.377
our colleagues, the primary care
physicians, who see every child --

00:17:00.067 --> 00:17:02.430
and we need to transform
those technologies

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:05.456
into something that is going
to add value to their practice,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.666
because they have to see so many children.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.767
And we want to do that universally
so that we don't miss any child.

00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:13.402
But this would be immoral

00:17:14.529 --> 00:17:19.892
if we also did not have an infrastructure
for intervention, for treatment.

00:17:20.487 --> 00:17:24.379
We need to be able to work
with the families, support the families,

00:17:24.403 --> 00:17:27.416
to manage those first years with them.

00:17:28.384 --> 00:17:30.782
We need to be able to really go

00:17:30.806 --> 00:17:34.728
from universal screening
to universal access to treatment,

00:17:34.752 --> 00:17:37.741
because those treatments
are going to change

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:40.630
these children's
and those families' lives.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:48.888
Now, when we think about what we [can]
do in those first years,

00:17:48.912 --> 00:17:53.482
I can tell you, having been
in this field for so long,

00:17:54.077 --> 00:17:56.453
one feels really rejuvenated.

00:17:56.832 --> 00:18:01.554
There is a sense that the science
that one worked on

00:18:01.578 --> 00:18:04.347
can actually have an impact on realities,

00:18:04.371 --> 00:18:07.351
preventing, in fact, those experiences

00:18:07.972 --> 00:18:10.716
that I really started
in my journey in this field.

00:18:11.343 --> 00:18:14.753
I thought at the time
that this was an intractable condition.

00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:18.056
No longer. We can do
a great deal of things.

00:18:18.707 --> 00:18:21.116
And the idea is not to cure autism.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.640
That's not the idea.

00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:25.865
What we want is to make sure

00:18:25.889 --> 00:18:28.441
that those individuals
with autism can be free

00:18:28.465 --> 00:18:32.080
from the devastating consequences
that come with it at times,

00:18:32.876 --> 00:18:35.937
the profound intellectual disabilities,
the lack of language,

00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:38.448
the profound, profound isolation.

00:18:39.563 --> 00:18:41.809
We feel that individuals
with autism, in fact,

00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:44.299
have a very special
perspective on the world,

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:45.669
and we need diversity.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.066
And they can work extremely well
in some areas of strength:

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.469
predictable situations,
situations that can be defined.

00:18:53.493 --> 00:18:56.451
Because after all,
they learn about the world

00:18:56.475 --> 00:18:58.357
almost, like, about it,

00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:01.178
rather than learning
how to function in it.

00:19:01.202 --> 00:19:05.201
But this is a strength if you're working,
for example, in technology.

00:19:06.081 --> 00:19:09.912
And there are those individuals
who have incredible artistic abilities.

00:19:09.936 --> 00:19:12.269
We want them to be free to do that.

00:19:12.293 --> 00:19:15.412
We want that the next generations
of individuals with autism

00:19:15.436 --> 00:19:18.514
will be able not only
to express their strengths,

00:19:18.538 --> 00:19:20.437
but to fulfill their promise.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.699
Well, thank you for listening to me.

00:19:22.723 --> 00:19:24.501
(Applause)
