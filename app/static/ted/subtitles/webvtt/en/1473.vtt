00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:03.833
Like most journalists, I'm an idealist.

00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:08.158
I love unearthing good stories,
especially untold stories.

00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:11.559
I just didn't think that in 2011,

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:13.744
women would still be in that category.

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:18.515
I'm the President of the Journalism
and Women Symposium -- JAWS.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.691
That's Sharky.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:21.206
(Laughter)

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.034
I joined 10 years ago
because I wanted female role models,

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:28.257
and I was frustrated by the lagging status
of women in our profession

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:30.926
and what that meant
for our image in the media.

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:34.189
We make up half
the population of the world,

00:00:34.213 --> 00:00:36.800
but we're just 24 percent
of the news subjects

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:38.324
quoted in news stories.

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:42.065
And we're just 20 percent
of the experts quoted in stories.

00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:44.533
And now, with today's technology,

00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:47.739
it's possible to remove women
from the picture completely.

00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:52.460
This is a picture of President
Barack Obama and his advisors,

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:54.572
tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden.

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.730
You can see Hillary Clinton on the right.

00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:58.581
Let's see how the photo ran

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:01.453
in an Orthodox Jewish
newspaper based in Brooklyn.

00:01:02.327 --> 00:01:04.040
Hillary's completely gone.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.912
(Laughter)

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:09.985
The paper apologized,
but said it never runs photos of women;

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.941
they might be sexually provocative.

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:14.075
(Laughter)

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:16.147
This is an extreme case, yes.

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.338
But the fact is,

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:21.481
women are only 19 percent
of the sources in stories on politics,

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:24.517
and only 20 percent
in stories on the economy.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.091
The news continues to give us a picture

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:29.727
where men outnumber women

00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:32.465
in nearly all occupational
categories, except two:

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:34.977
students and homemakers.

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:36.258
(Laughter)

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:39.311
So we all get a very
distorted picture of reality.

00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:43.520
The problem is, of course,
there aren't enough women in newsrooms.

00:01:43.544 --> 00:01:47.449
They report at just 37 percent of stories
in print, TV and radio.

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.086
Even in stories on gender-based violence,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.713
men get an overwhelming majority
of print space and airtime.

00:01:54.737 --> 00:01:55.888
Case in point:

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.903
This March, the New York Times
ran a story by James McKinley

00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:01.581
about a gang rape of a young girl,

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:03.943
11 years old, in a small Texas town.

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:07.570
McKinley writes that
the community is wondering,

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.416
"How could their boys
have been drawn into this?"

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:12.540
"Drawn into this" --

00:02:12.564 --> 00:02:15.644
like they were seduced
into committing an act of violence.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.653
And the first person he quotes says,

00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:20.750
"These boys will have to live
with this the rest of their lives."

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:23.016
(Groans, laughter)

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:26.620
You don't hear much
about the 11-year-old victim,

00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:30.061
except that she wore clothes
that were a little old for her

00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:31.497
and she wore makeup.

00:02:32.223 --> 00:02:34.918
The Times was deluged with criticism.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.949
Initially, it defended itself,

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:38.694
and said, "These aren't our views.

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:40.646
This is what we found in our reporting."

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.952
Now, here's a secret
you probably know already:

00:02:43.492 --> 00:02:45.090
Your stories are constructed.

00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:48.135
As reporters, we research, we interview.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.067
We try to give a good picture of reality.

00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:53.836
We also have our own unconscious biases.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.383
But The Times makes it sound like anyone
would have reported this story

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:58.558
the same way.

00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:00.623
I disagree with that.

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.835
So three weeks later,

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.386
The Times revisits the story.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.159
This time, it adds another byline
to it with McKinley's:

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:09.659
Erica Goode.

00:03:09.683 --> 00:03:12.585
What emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.568
of a young girl and her family
trapped in poverty.

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:18.267
She was raped numerous times by many men.

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:21.093
She had been a bright, easygoing girl.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.679
She was maturing quickly, physically,

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.695
but her bed was still covered
with stuffed animals.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.282
It's a very different picture.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.327
Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode
is what made this story more complete.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.070
The Global Media Monitoring Project
has found that stories by female reporters

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:40.863
are more likely to challenge stereotypes
than those by male reporters.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.260
At KUNM here in Albuquerque,

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:44.419
Elaine Baumgartel
did some graduate research

00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:46.712
on the coverage of violence against women.

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:50.109
What she found was many of these
stories tend to blame victims

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:51.652
and devalue their lives.

00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:54.883
They tend to sensationalize,
and they lack context.

00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:56.638
So for her graduate work,

00:03:56.662 --> 00:03:59.559
she did a three-part series
on the murder of 11 women,

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.159
found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.

00:04:02.183 --> 00:04:05.547
She tried to challenge those patterns
and stereotypes in her work

00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:08.412
and she tried to show
the challenges that journalists face

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:11.956
from external sources,
their own internal biases

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.279
and cultural norms.

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:16.375
And she worked with an editor
at National Public Radio

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.932
to try to get a story aired nationally.

00:04:18.956 --> 00:04:22.901
She's not sure that would have happened
if the editor had not been a female.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.671
Stories in the news

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:28.932
are more than twice as likely
to present women as victims than men,

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:32.805
and women are more likely to be defined
by their body parts.

00:04:33.562 --> 00:04:35.750
Wired magazine, November 2010.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.550
Yes, the issue was about
breast-tissue engineering.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:43.443
Now I know you're all distracted,
so I'll take that off.

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:44.468
(Laughter)

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.646
Eyes up here.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.922
(Laughter)

00:04:48.946 --> 00:04:50.097
So --

00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:54.299
(Applause)

00:04:54.323 --> 00:04:55.483
Here's the thing:

00:04:55.507 --> 00:04:58.064
Wired almost never puts
women on its cover.

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:00.391
Oh, there have been some gimmicky ones --

00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:02.017
Pam from "The Office,"

00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:03.950
manga girls,

00:05:03.974 --> 00:05:06.595
a voluptuous model
covered in synthetic diamonds.

00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:11.431
Texas State University professor
Cindy Royal wondered in her blog

00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:15.446
how are young women like her students
supposed to feel about their roles

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.938
in technology, reading Wired.

00:05:16.962 --> 00:05:20.215
Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired,
defended his choice

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:22.628
and said there aren't enough women,
prominent women

00:05:22.652 --> 00:05:25.775
in technology to sell a cover,
to sell an issue.

00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:27.740
Part of that is true,

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:30.312
there aren't as many
prominent women in technology.

00:05:30.336 --> 00:05:32.334
Here's my problem with that argument:

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.429
Media tells us every day what's important,

00:05:35.453 --> 00:05:37.956
by the stories they choose
and where they place them;

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.445
it's called agenda setting.

00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:43.168
How many people knew
the founders of Facebook and Google

00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:45.360
before their faces
were on a magazine cover?

00:05:45.384 --> 00:05:47.846
Putting them there
made them more recognizable.

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:51.061
Now, Fast Company Magazine
embraces that idea.

00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:54.010
This is its cover from November 15, 2010.

00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:58.445
The issue is about the most prominent
and influential women in technology.

00:05:58.827 --> 00:06:01.366
Editor Robert Safian
told the Poynter Institute,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.237
"Silicon Valley is very white
and very male.

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:06.555
But that's not what Fast Company thinks

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.943
the business world
will look like in the future,

00:06:08.967 --> 00:06:12.643
so it tries to give a picture
of where the globalized world is moving."

00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:16.020
By the way, apparently,
Wired took all this to heart.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.008
This was its issue in April.

00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:19.910
(Laughter)

00:06:19.934 --> 00:06:22.751
That's Limor Fried, the founder
of Adafruit Industries,

00:06:22.775 --> 00:06:24.449
in the Rosie the Riveter pose.

00:06:25.704 --> 00:06:29.174
It would help to have more women
in positions of leadership in media.

00:06:29.198 --> 00:06:30.435
A recent global survey

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:33.325
found that 73 percent
of the top media-management jobs

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.993
are still held by men.

00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:37.968
But this is also about something
far more complex:

00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:40.960
our own unconscious
biases and blind spots.

00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:43.441
Shankar Vedantam is the author

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:46.513
of "The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious
Minds Elect Presidents,

00:06:46.537 --> 00:06:49.199
Control Markets, Wage Wars,
and Save Our Lives."

00:06:49.718 --> 00:06:52.845
He told the former ombudsman
at National Public Radio,

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:56.606
who was doing a report
on how women fare in NPR coverage,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.720
unconscious bias flows
throughout most of our lives.

00:06:59.744 --> 00:07:02.712
It's really difficult
to disentangle those strands.

00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:04.920
But he did have one suggestion.

00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:08.092
He used to work for two editors

00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:11.487
who said every story had to have
at least one female source.

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.592
He balked at first,

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:16.568
but said he eventually followed
the directive happily,

00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:18.033
because his stories got better

00:07:18.057 --> 00:07:19.533
and his job got easier.

00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:22.612
Now, I don't know if one
of the editors was a woman,

00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:25.013
but that can make the biggest difference.

00:07:25.037 --> 00:07:29.003
The Dallas Morning News
won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994

00:07:29.027 --> 00:07:31.630
for a series it did on women
around the world,

00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:33.361
but one of the reporters told me

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:35.734
she's convinced
it never would have happened

00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:39.169
if they had not had
a female assistant foreign editor,

00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:41.677
and they would not have gotten
some of those stories

00:07:41.701 --> 00:07:44.192
without female reporters
and editors on the ground,

00:07:44.216 --> 00:07:47.118
particularly one
on female genital mutilation --

00:07:47.142 --> 00:07:49.807
men would just not be allowed
into those situations.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.454
This is an important point to consider,

00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:55.734
because much of our foreign policy
now revolves around countries

00:07:55.758 --> 00:07:58.179
where the treatment of women is an issue,

00:07:58.203 --> 00:07:59.568
such as Afghanistan.

00:08:01.578 --> 00:08:05.702
What we're told in terms of arguments
against leaving this country

00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:08.590
is that the fate of the women is primary.

00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:13.415
Now, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul
can find women to interview.

00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:17.607
Not so sure about rural,
traditional areas,

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:20.310
where I'm guessing
women can't talk to strange men.

00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:24.443
It's important to keep talking about this,
in light of Lara Logan.

00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:27.033
She was the CBS News correspondent

00:08:27.057 --> 00:08:29.970
who was brutally sexually assaulted
in Egypt's Tahrir Square,

00:08:29.994 --> 00:08:31.760
right after this photo was taken.

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:34.902
Almost immediately, pundits weighed in,

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:38.165
blaming her and saying things like,

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:41.589
"You know, maybe women shouldn't
be sent to cover those stories."

00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:44.850
I never heard anyone say this
about Anderson Cooper and his crew,

00:08:44.874 --> 00:08:47.482
who were attacked covering the same story.

00:08:48.387 --> 00:08:50.438
One way to get more women into leadership

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.239
is to have other women mentor them.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.233
One of my board members is an editor
at a major global media company,

00:08:56.257 --> 00:08:58.893
but she never thought
about this as a career path,

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:01.425
until she met female role models at JAWS.

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:04.925
But this is not just a job
for super-journalists

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:06.128
or my organization.

00:09:06.152 --> 00:09:08.782
You all have a stake
in a strong, vibrant media.

00:09:09.743 --> 00:09:11.076
Analyze your news.

00:09:11.474 --> 00:09:14.031
And speak up when there are gaps
missing in coverage,

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:16.006
like people at The New York Times did.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.037
Suggest female sources
to reporters and editors.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.899
Remember -- a complete picture of reality
may depend upon it.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.195
And I'll leave you with a video clip

00:09:25.219 --> 00:09:28.749
that I first saw in [1987]
when I was a student in London.

00:09:29.137 --> 00:09:30.709
It's for The Guardian newspaper.

00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:34.082
It's actually long before I ever thought
about becoming a journalist,

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:37.288
but I was very interested
in how we learn to perceive our world.

00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:43.156
Narrator: An event seen from one
point of view gives one impression.

00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:50.331
Seen from another point of view,

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:52.720
it gives quite a different impression.

00:09:54.982 --> 00:09:57.360
But it's only when you get
the whole picture,

00:09:57.384 --> 00:10:00.050
you can fully understand what's going on.

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:05.801
[The Guardian]

00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:07.747
Megan Kamerick: I think you'll all agree

00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:10.531
that we'd be better off
if we all had the whole picture.
