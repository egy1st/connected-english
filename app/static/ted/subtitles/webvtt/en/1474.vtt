00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:04.707
I am no designer, nope, no way.

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:06.523
My dad was,

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.115
which is kind of an interesting way to grow up.

00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:13.290
I had to figure out what it is my dad did

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.090
and why it was important.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.251
Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up,

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:23.221
you know, "Bad design is just people not thinking, John," he would say

00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:25.684
whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:28.634
or, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.027
or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen.

00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:36.546
You know, "Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.154
It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.

00:00:39.154 --> 00:00:42.517
Every object should be about something, John.

00:00:42.517 --> 00:00:43.955
It should imagine a user.

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:48.922
It should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object.

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:54.163
Good design," my dad said, "is about supplying intent."

00:00:54.163 --> 00:00:56.818
That's what he said.

00:00:56.818 --> 00:01:00.739
Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.739
That was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.295
He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase; that was important.

00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:15.333
I knew design was important in my house because, for heaven's sake, it put food on our table, right?

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.705
And design was in everything my dad did.

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:20.862
He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up,

00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:23.558
and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes.

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:25.286
And I would ask him every once in a while,

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:28.197
"Dad, do you want it to sound like the record?"

00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:30.350
We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.647
And he said, "No, never, John, never.

00:01:32.647 --> 00:01:35.374
The song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it.

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:38.059
You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it.

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:42.056
Show everyone what you intend," is what he said.

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:46.345
"Doing that, acting by design, is what we all should be doing.

00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:48.454
It's where we all belong."

00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:51.879
All of us? Designers?

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:56.813
Oh, oh, Dad. Oh, Dad.

00:01:56.813 --> 00:01:58.478
The song is just a given.

00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:00.966
It's how you cover it that matters.

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:03.062
Well, let's hold on to that thought for just a minute.

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:05.965
It's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in, right?

00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:07.990
The original tune? It's a little scary.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.654
"Ooh, what happened to that dude?

00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:13.765
He can't walk. Anybody know the story?

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:15.671
Anybody?"

00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:20.958
I don't like to talk about this very much, but I'll tell you guys the story today.

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.808
All right, exactly 36 years ago this week, that's right,

00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:26.750
I was in a poorly designed automobile

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.671
that hit a poorly designed guardrail

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:33.254
on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania,

00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:38.047
and plummeted down a 200-foot embankment

00:02:38.047 --> 00:02:40.254
and killed two people in the car.

00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:44.733
But ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life.

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:49.869
My life, at the mercy of good design and bad design.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.272
Think about it. Now, in design terms,

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.270
a wheelchair is a very difficult object.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.438
It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune,

00:02:59.438 --> 00:03:02.229
and it projects that message, that story, so strongly

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.488
that it almost blots out anything else.

00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:07.966
I roll swiftly through an airport, right?

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:11.950
And moms grab their kids out of the way and say, "Don't stare!"

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.149
The poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face, God knows what they think.

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.318
And for decades, I'm going,

00:03:18.318 --> 00:03:22.798
why does this happen? What can I do about it? How can I change this? I mean there must be something.

00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:27.957
So I would roll, I'd make no eye contact -- just kinda frown, right?

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:33.389
Or I'd dress up really, really sharply or something.

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.266
Or I'd make eye contact with everyone --

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.758
that was really creepy; that didn't work at all.

00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:39.671
(Laughter)

00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:43.526
You know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week -- nothing worked.

00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:47.510
Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.850
my six-year-old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had, and they said,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.974
"Oh, Dad! Dad! Look, you gotta get these, these flashy wheels -- you gotta get 'em!"

00:03:56.974 --> 00:04:01.087
And I said, "Oh, girls, Dad is a very important journalist,

00:04:01.087 --> 00:04:03.653
that just wouldn't do at all."

00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:05.598
And of course, they immediately concluded,

00:04:05.598 --> 00:04:10.765
"Oh, what a bummer, Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels.

00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:15.243
I mean, how important could you be then?" they said.

00:04:15.243 --> 00:04:20.205
I went, "Wait a minute, all right, right -- I'll get the wheels." Purely out of protest,

00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:25.123
I got the flashy wheels, and I installed them and --

00:04:25.123 --> 00:04:28.651
check this out. Could I have my special light cue please?

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:30.173
(Laughter)

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:33.104
Look at that!

00:04:33.104 --> 00:04:35.569
Now ... look at, look at this! Look at this!

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.016
So what you are looking at here

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:42.103
has completely changed my life,

00:04:42.103 --> 00:04:45.080
I mean totally changed my life.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.952
Instead of blank stares and awkwardness,

00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:51.436
now it is pointing and smiling!

00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:55.504
People going, "Awesome wheels, dude! Those are awesome!

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:58.104
I mean, I want some of those wheels!" Little kids say,

00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:00.240
"Can I have a ride?"

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.115
(Laughter)

00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:04.632
And of course there's the occasional person --

00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:06.448
usually a middle-aged male who will say,

00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:08.089
"Oh, those wheels are great!

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.379
I guess they're for safety, right?"

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.728
(Laughter)

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:18.696
No! They're not for safety.

00:05:18.696 --> 00:05:20.576
No, no, no, no, no.

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:22.353
What's the difference here,

00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:24.160
the wheelchair with no lights

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.890
and the wheelchair with lights?

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.672
The difference is intent.

00:05:29.672 --> 00:05:33.329
That's right, that's right; I'm no longer a victim.

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:39.241
I chose to change the situation -- I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right?

00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:43.616
Intent changes the picture completely.

00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:45.433
I choose to enhance

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.376
this rolling experience

00:05:47.376 --> 00:05:51.080
with a simple design element.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.288
Acting with intent.

00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:55.504
It conveys authorship.

00:05:55.504 --> 00:05:58.584
It suggests that someone is driving.

00:05:58.584 --> 00:06:01.592
It's reassuring; people are drawn to it.

00:06:01.592 --> 00:06:05.104
Someone making the experience their own.

00:06:05.104 --> 00:06:07.344
Covering the tragic tune

00:06:07.344 --> 00:06:10.240
with something different,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.449
something radically different.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.496
People respond to that.

00:06:15.496 --> 00:06:18.288
Now it seems simple, but actually I think

00:06:18.288 --> 00:06:20.513
in our society and culture in general,

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.576
we have a huge problem with intent.

00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:25.936
Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is?

00:06:25.936 --> 00:06:29.952
It's Anders Breivik. Now, if he intended to kill

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:31.688
in Olso, Norway last year,

00:06:31.688 --> 00:06:34.048
dozens and dozens of young people --

00:06:34.048 --> 00:06:35.760
if he intended to do that,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.344
he's a vicious criminal. We punish him.

00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:41.713
Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway.

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:46.064
But, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy,

00:06:46.064 --> 00:06:51.048
if he was motivated by some random mental illness,

00:06:51.048 --> 00:06:53.494
he's in a completely different category.

00:06:53.494 --> 00:06:55.281
We may put him away for life, but

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.320
we watch him clinically.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.769
It's a completely different domain.

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.241
As an intentional murderer,

00:07:03.241 --> 00:07:06.280
Anders Breivik is merely evil.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.465
But as a dysfunctional,

00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:10.713
as a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic,

00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:12.672
he's something much more complicated.

00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:14.432
He's the breath of some 


00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:17.832
primitive, ancient chaos.

00:07:17.832 --> 00:07:19.816
He's the random state of nature

00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:21.346
we emerged from.

00:07:21.346 --> 00:07:23.616
He's something very, very different.

00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:27.353
It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity.

00:07:27.353 --> 00:07:29.672
It's what we're supposed to do somehow.

00:07:29.672 --> 00:07:32.400
We're supposed to act with intent.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.856
We're supposed to do things by design.

00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:39.696
Intent is a marker for civilization.

00:07:39.696 --> 00:07:42.288
Now here's an example a little closer to home:

00:07:42.288 --> 00:07:44.664
My family is all about intent.

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:47.872
You can probably tell there are two sets of twins,

00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:52.120
the result of IVF technology, in vitro fertilization technology,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.755
due to some physical limitations I won't go into.

00:07:54.755 --> 00:07:57.808
Anyway, in vitro technology, IVF,

00:07:57.808 --> 00:08:00.812
is about as intentional as agriculture.

00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:02.968
Let me tell you, some of you may have the experience.

00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:05.912
In fact, the whole technology of sperm extraction

00:08:05.912 --> 00:08:10.360
for spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.642
I met the dude. He's a great guy.

00:08:12.642 --> 00:08:17.584
He carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:19.880
all of the animals that he'd worked with,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.379
all the different animals.

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.511
Probes he designed,

00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:26.512
and in fact, he was really, really proud of these probes.

00:08:26.512 --> 00:08:30.282
He would say, "You're right between horse and squirrel, John."

00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:33.520
(Laughter)

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.192
But anyway, so when my wife and I decided

00:08:39.192 --> 00:08:42.241
to upgrade our early middle age -- we had four kids, after all --

00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:44.232
with a little different technology

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:47.112
that I won't explain in too much detail here --

00:08:47.112 --> 00:08:51.370
my urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.946
"No need for birth control, Doc, are you sure about that?"

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:57.506
"John, John, I looked at your chart.

00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:59.763
From your sperm tests we can

00:08:59.763 --> 00:09:01.771
confidently say that

00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:04.493
you're basically a form of birth control."

00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:07.771
Well!

00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:11.363
(Laughter)

00:09:11.363 --> 00:09:14.738
What a liberating thought! Yes!

00:09:14.738 --> 00:09:17.803
And after a couple very liberating weekends,

00:09:17.803 --> 00:09:19.243
my wife and I,

00:09:19.243 --> 00:09:23.131
utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology

00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.715
that is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday

00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:27.746
but I won't get into it now,

00:09:27.746 --> 00:09:32.498
we noticed some familiar, if unexpected, symptoms.

00:09:32.498 --> 00:09:36.158
I wasn't exactly a form of birth control.

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:39.738
Look at that font there. My wife was so pissed.

00:09:39.738 --> 00:09:41.283
I mean, did a designer come up with that?

00:09:41.283 --> 00:09:43.515
No, I don't think a designer did come up with that.

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:45.730
In fact, maybe that's the problem.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.411
And so, little Ajax was born.

00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:50.680
He's like our other children,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.458
but the experience is completely different.

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:56.698
It's something like my accident, right?

00:09:56.698 --> 00:09:57.973
He came out of nowhere.

00:09:57.973 --> 00:09:59.579
But we all had to change,

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:02.260
but not just react to the given;

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.819
we bend to this new experience with intent.

00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:10.891
We're five now. Five.

00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:14.803
Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design.

00:10:14.803 --> 00:10:19.035
Hey, the name Ajax -- you can't get much more intentional than that, right?

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:23.275
We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on.

00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:25.108
(Laughter)

00:10:25.108 --> 00:10:29.007
But I never became a designer. No, no, no, no. Never attempted. Never even close.

00:10:29.007 --> 00:10:33.645
I did love some great designs as I was growing up:

00:10:33.645 --> 00:10:38.012
The HP 35S calculator -- God, I loved that thing. Oh God, I wish I had one.

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:41.462
Man, I love that thing.

00:10:41.462 --> 00:10:42.685
I could afford that.

00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:47.324
Other designs I really couldn't afford, like the 1974 911 Targa.

00:10:47.324 --> 00:10:50.789
In school, I studied nothing close to design or engineering;

00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:53.108
I studied useless things like the Classics,

00:10:53.108 --> 00:10:54.925
but there were some lessons even there --

00:10:54.925 --> 00:10:58.189
this guy, Plato, it turns out he's a designer.

00:10:58.189 --> 00:11:01.612
He designed a state in "The Republic,"

00:11:01.612 --> 00:11:03.103
a design never implemented.

00:11:03.103 --> 00:11:04.788
Listen to one of the design features

00:11:04.788 --> 00:11:07.812
of Plato's Government 4.0:

00:11:07.812 --> 00:11:12.372
"The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern

00:11:12.372 --> 00:11:15.308
is always the best and most quietly governed,

00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:19.380
and the State in which they are most eager, the worst."

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.324
Well, got that wrong, didn't we?

00:11:22.324 --> 00:11:26.621
But look at that statement; it's all about intent. That's what I love about it.

00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:30.076
But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing?

00:11:30.076 --> 00:11:33.596
It's a grand idea of design -- a huge idea of design,

00:11:33.596 --> 00:11:37.313
common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy

00:11:37.313 --> 00:11:39.553
that emerged in the Classical period.

00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:40.986
What was going on then?

00:11:40.986 --> 00:11:43.122
They were trying to answer the question of

00:11:43.122 --> 00:11:48.088
what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive?

00:11:48.088 --> 00:11:52.529
As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos,

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:56.953
a confrontation with random, brutal nature,

00:11:56.953 --> 00:12:00.537
they suddenly had a moment to think -- and there was a lot to think about.

00:12:00.537 --> 00:12:04.664
All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent.

00:12:04.664 --> 00:12:07.379
Human life needed a reason.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:10.401
Reality itself needed a designer.

00:12:10.401 --> 00:12:12.793
The given was replaced

00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:15.417
by various aspects of intent,

00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:18.001
by various designs,

00:12:18.001 --> 00:12:20.281
by various gods.

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:24.225
Gods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah.

00:12:24.225 --> 00:12:27.385
Today we don't confront the chaos of nature.

00:12:27.385 --> 00:12:33.265
Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront.

00:12:33.265 --> 00:12:36.545
This young discipline called design, I think,

00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:39.812
is in fact the emerging ethos

00:12:39.812 --> 00:12:42.730
formulating and then answering a very new question:

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.329
What shall we do now

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:48.072
in the face of the chaos that we have created?

00:12:48.072 --> 00:12:49.976
What shall we do?

00:12:49.976 --> 00:12:52.442
How shall we inscribe intent

00:12:52.442 --> 00:12:54.745
on all the objects we create,

00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:56.721
on all the circumstances we create,

00:12:56.721 --> 00:12:59.328
on all the places we change?

00:12:59.328 --> 00:13:03.456
The consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting.

00:13:03.456 --> 00:13:07.825
That's the tune we're all covering today, all of us.

00:13:07.825 --> 00:13:10.361
And we can't just imitate the past. No.

00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:13.195
That won't do.

00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:14.970
That won't do at all.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.977
Here's my favorite design moment:

00:13:17.977 --> 00:13:21.385
In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s,

00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:23.673
I was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on

00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:27.817
the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire,

00:13:27.817 --> 00:13:29.817
who raped and pillaged that country.

00:13:29.817 --> 00:13:32.385
There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa.

00:13:32.385 --> 00:13:35.866
The place was falling apart; it was a horrible, horrible place,

00:13:35.866 --> 00:13:39.737
and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa

00:13:39.737 --> 00:13:41.760
to report on the rioting and the looting.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.546
People were carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings.

00:13:45.546 --> 00:13:50.241
Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests.

00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:53.755
In the middle of this chaos, I'm rolling around in a wheelchair,

00:13:53.755 --> 00:13:57.505
and I was completely invisible. Completely.

00:13:57.505 --> 00:14:00.275
I was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a looter.

00:14:00.275 --> 00:14:06.457
I was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a journalist, particularly, at least from their perspective.

00:14:06.457 --> 00:14:08.697
And I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure.

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:14.992
I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible.

00:14:14.992 --> 00:14:20.089
And all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me,

00:14:20.089 --> 00:14:23.809
in this metal and wood and leather

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:28.834
pedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device,

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.298
and he pedals up to me as fast as he can.

00:14:31.298 --> 00:14:33.073
He goes, "Hey, mister! Mister!"

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:35.370
And I looked at him --

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.954
he didn't know any other English than that, but we didn't need English, no, no, no, no, no.

00:14:38.954 --> 00:14:44.825
We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes.

00:14:44.825 --> 00:14:48.250
And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism;

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.490
he was full of pride over his design.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.339
I wish I could show you that contraption.

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:55.466
His smile, our glow

00:14:55.466 --> 00:14:57.977
as we talked a universal language

00:14:57.977 --> 00:15:00.689
of design,

00:15:00.689 --> 00:15:03.506
invisible to the chaos around us.

00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:07.562
His machine: homemade, bolted, rusty, comical.

00:15:07.562 --> 00:15:10.860
My machine: American-made, confident, sleek.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.082
He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat, really comfortable seat

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:16.998
he had made in his chariot

00:15:16.998 --> 00:15:21.425
and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge.

00:15:21.425 --> 00:15:25.409
Oh, I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him, man!

00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:28.154
He would have loved those! Oh yeah.

00:15:28.154 --> 00:15:29.746
He would have understood those;

00:15:29.746 --> 00:15:33.214
a chariot of pure intent -- think about it --

00:15:33.214 --> 00:15:35.826
in a city out of control.

00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:38.874
Design blew it all away for a moment.

00:15:38.874 --> 00:15:43.018
We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos.

00:15:43.018 --> 00:15:45.437
He went back to the streets of Kinshasa;

00:15:45.437 --> 00:15:51.419
I went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ...

00:15:51.419 --> 00:15:54.481
And I pose this question.

00:15:54.481 --> 00:15:58.034
An object imbued with intent --

00:15:58.034 --> 00:15:59.698
it has power,

00:15:59.698 --> 00:16:03.098
it's treasure, we're drawn to it.

00:16:03.098 --> 00:16:05.730
An object devoid of intent --

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.242
it's random, it's imitative,

00:16:08.242 --> 00:16:11.922
it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.

00:16:11.922 --> 00:16:16.673
This is what we must demand of our lives,

00:16:16.673 --> 00:16:20.498
of our objects, of our things, of our circumstances:

00:16:20.498 --> 00:16:23.594
living with intent.

00:16:23.594 --> 00:16:25.698
And I have to say

00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:30.729
that on that score, I have a very unfair advantage over all of you.

00:16:30.729 --> 00:16:36.434
And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day.

00:16:36.434 --> 00:16:41.369
Thirty-six years ago at nearly this moment,

00:16:41.369 --> 00:16:45.525
a 19-year-old boy awoke from a coma

00:16:45.525 --> 00:16:47.322
to ask a nurse a question,

00:16:47.322 --> 00:16:49.802
but the nurse was already there with an answer.

00:16:49.802 --> 00:16:53.505
"You've had a terrible accident, young man. You've broken your back.

00:16:53.505 --> 00:16:55.146
You'll never walk again."

00:16:55.146 --> 00:17:00.762
I said, "I know all that -- what day is it?"

00:17:00.762 --> 00:17:07.786
You see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February,

00:17:07.786 --> 00:17:11.435
and I knew that 1976 was a leap year.

00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:16.145
"Nurse! Is this the 28th or the 29th?"

00:17:16.145 --> 00:17:18.138
And she looked at me and said,

00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:20.713
"It's March 1st."

00:17:20.713 --> 00:17:23.194
And I went, "Oh my God.

00:17:23.194 --> 00:17:25.730
I've got some catching up to do!"

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.402
And from that moment, I knew

00:17:28.402 --> 00:17:31.650
the given was that accident;

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.338
I had no option but to make up

00:17:35.338 --> 00:17:38.394
this new life without walking.

00:17:38.394 --> 00:17:42.202
Intent -- a life with intent --

00:17:42.202 --> 00:17:44.026
lived by design,

00:17:44.026 --> 00:17:45.642
covering the original

00:17:45.642 --> 00:17:47.202
with something better.

00:17:47.202 --> 00:17:52.282
It's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times.

00:17:52.282 --> 00:17:55.624
To get back to this,

00:17:55.624 --> 00:17:57.760
to get back to design,

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.161
and as my daddy suggested a long time ago,

00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:04.448
"Make the song your own, John.

00:18:04.448 --> 00:18:09.538
Show everybody what you intend."

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.729
Daddy,

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:27.677
this one's for you.

00:18:27.677 --> 00:18:32.457
(Music)

00:18:32.457 --> 00:18:36.665
♫ Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner ♫

00:18:36.665 --> 00:18:38.985
♫ but he was another man. ♫

00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:45.170
♫ Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona to attend a California bash. ♫

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.113
♫ Get back, get back, ♫

00:18:48.113 --> 00:18:51.393
♫ get back to where you once belonged. ♫

00:18:51.393 --> 00:18:54.257
♫ Get back, get back, ♫

00:18:54.257 --> 00:19:03.720
♫ get back to where you once belonged. ♫

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:12.980
(Applause)
