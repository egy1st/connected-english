WEBVTT

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.944
So my freshman year of college

00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:04.694
I signed up for an internship in the housing unit

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:06.894
at Greater Boston Legal Services.

00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:08.547
Showed up the first day

00:00:08.547 --> 00:00:10.863
ready to make coffee and photocopies,

00:00:10.863 --> 00:00:15.445
but was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:16.914
named Jeff Purcell,

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.379
who thrust me onto the front lines

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.379
from the very first day.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:23.144
And over the course of nine months

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:24.157
I had the chance

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.929
to have dozens of conversations

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.713
with low-income families in Boston

00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:31.829
who would come in presenting with housing issues,

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.113
but always had an underlying health issue.

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:37.345
So I had a client who came in,

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:39.663
about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent.

00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:41.951
But he hasn't paid his rent, of course,

00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:44.445
because he's paying for his HIV medication

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:46.645
and just can't afford both.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:47.996
We had moms who would come in,

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:49.379
daughter has asthma,

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.264
wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning.

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:54.237
And one of our litigation strategies

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:57.012
was actually to send me into the home of these clients

00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:59.145
with these large glass bottles.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.145
And I would collect the cockroaches,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:04.163
hot glue-gun them to this poster board

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.195
that we'd bring to court for our cases.

00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:07.473
And we always won

00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:10.195
because the judges were just so grossed out.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.344
Far more effective, I have to say,

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:15.195
than anything I later learned in law school.

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.745
But over the course of these nine months,

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:19.596
I grew frustrated with feeling

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:22.562
like we were intervening too far downstream

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:25.079
in the lives of our clients --

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.611
that by the time they came to us,

00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:28.779
they were already in crisis.

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:31.595
And at the end of my freshman year of college,

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:33.279
I read an article about the work

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.061
that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.197
as Chair of Pediatrics

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.597
at Boston Medical Center.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:41.664
And his first hire was a legal services attorney

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:43.546
to represent the patients.

00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:45.061
So I called Barry,

00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.664
and with his blessing, in October 1995

00:01:47.664 --> 00:01:49.729
walked into the waiting room

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.595
of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:53.928
I'll never forget,

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:56.812
the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.

00:01:56.812 --> 00:01:59.746
And the exhaustion of mothers

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:03.278
who had taken two, three, sometimes four buses

00:02:03.278 --> 00:02:05.210
to bring their child to the doctor

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.094
was just palpable.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:08.342
The doctors, it seemed,

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:09.861
never really had enough time for all the patients,

00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:11.111
try as they might.

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:12.329
And over the course of six months,

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.010
I would corner them in the hallway

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.911
and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question:

00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:20.396
"If you had unlimited resources,

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:23.711
what's the one thing you would give your patients?"

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:26.411
And I heard the same story again and again,

00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:29.361
a story we've heard hundreds of times since then.

00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:32.926
They said, "Every day we have patients that come into the clinic --

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:34.627
child has an ear infection,

00:02:34.627 --> 00:02:36.560
I prescribe antibiotics.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.393
But the real issue is there's no food at home.

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:40.894
The real issue

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.128
is that child is living with 12 other people

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:44.626
in a two-bedroom apartment.

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:46.476
And I don't even ask about those issues

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:49.227
because there's nothing I can do.

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.065
I have 13 minutes with each patient.

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:53.634
Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room.

00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:56.319
I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.667
And I don't even have any help."

00:02:58.667 --> 00:02:59.867
In that clinic, even today,

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:01.553
there are two social workers

00:03:01.553 --> 00:03:04.284
for 24,000 pediatric patients,

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:07.136
which is better than a lot of the clinics out there.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.167
So Health Leads was born of these conversations --

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:11.351
a simple model

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.866
where doctors and nurses

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:15.084
can prescribe nutritious food,

00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:16.386
heat in the winter

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:18.968
and other basic resources for their patients

00:03:18.968 --> 00:03:21.519
the same way they prescribe medication.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.500
Patients then take their prescriptions

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.967
to our desk in the clinic waiting room

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.784
where we have a core of well-trained college student advocates

00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:32.236
who work side by side with these families

00:03:32.236 --> 00:03:33.535
to connect them out

00:03:33.535 --> 00:03:36.751
to the existing landscape of community resources.

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:40.300
So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room --

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.450
totally lemonade stand style.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.770
But today we have a thousand college student advocates

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.070
who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.271
with the resources that they need to be healthy.

00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:54.787
So 18 months ago

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:57.572
I got this email that changed my life.

00:03:57.572 --> 00:03:59.987
And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger,

00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:02.971
who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:04.270
and to share, as he said,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.906
a bit of historical context.

00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:09.856
In 1965 Dr. Geiger founded

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:12.870
one of the first two community health centers in this country,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.021
in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:18.537
And so many of his patients came in

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:20.687
presenting with malnutrition

00:04:20.687 --> 00:04:23.171
that be began prescribing food for them.

00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:26.422
And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket,

00:04:26.422 --> 00:04:27.520
which would fill them

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.338
and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:33.221
And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. --

00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:35.056
which was funding Geiger's clinic --

00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:36.255
found out about this,

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:37.455
they were furious.

00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:39.204
And they sent this bureaucrat down

00:04:39.204 --> 00:04:42.155
to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars

00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:43.621
for medical care --

00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:47.021
to which Geiger famously and logically responded,

00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:49.446
"The last time I checked my textbooks,

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:53.805
the specific therapy for malnutrition was food."

00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:55.089
(Laughter)

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:57.788
So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger,

00:04:57.788 --> 00:05:00.154
I knew I was supposed to be proud

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:01.821
to be part of this history.

00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:03.037
But the truth is

00:05:03.037 --> 00:05:05.029
I was devastated.

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.370
Here we are,

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.355
45 years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients,

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:12.370
and I have doctors telling me,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.437
"On those issues, we practice a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."

00:05:16.437 --> 00:05:18.870
Forty-five years after Geiger,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.421
Health Leads has to reinvent

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:23.256
the prescription for basic resources.

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:26.421
So I have spent hours upon hours

00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:29.755
trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.

00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.289
How is it that if for decades

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.058
we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients,

00:05:35.058 --> 00:05:37.655
and especially low-income patients, healthy,

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:39.556
that we didn't use it?

00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:42.655
If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system

00:05:42.655 --> 00:05:45.154
rather than a sick-care system,

00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:47.187
why don't we just do it?

00:05:47.187 --> 00:05:49.421
These questions, in my mind,

00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:52.487
are not hard because the answers are complicated,

00:05:52.487 --> 00:05:57.621
they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.

00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:00.721
My belief is that it's almost too painful

00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:03.950
to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.688
or even admit that we have any at all.

00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:07.855
Because if we did,

00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:09.471
they would be so removed

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.657
from our current reality.

00:06:11.657 --> 00:06:14.620
But that doesn't change my belief

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.538
that all of us, deep inside,

00:06:17.538 --> 00:06:21.105
here in this room and across this country,

00:06:21.105 --> 00:06:24.021
share a similar set of desires.

00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.154
That if we are honest with ourselves

00:06:26.154 --> 00:06:28.455
and listen quietly,

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:30.271
that we all harbor

00:06:30.271 --> 00:06:34.471
one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare:

00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:36.571
that it keep us healthy.

00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:39.888
This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy

00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:42.288
is an enormously powerful one.

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:44.905
And the way I think about this

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:47.089
is that healthcare is like any other system.

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:49.655
It's just a set of choices that people make.

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:51.456
What if we decided

00:06:51.456 --> 00:06:53.872
to make a different set of choices?

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.904
What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare

00:06:56.904 --> 00:06:58.706
that have drifted away from us

00:06:58.706 --> 00:07:01.172
and stand firm and say, "No.

00:07:01.172 --> 00:07:03.139
These things are ours.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:05.138
They will be used for our purposes.

00:07:05.138 --> 00:07:07.162
They will be used to realize

00:07:07.162 --> 00:07:09.093
our aspiration"?

00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:10.843
What if everything we needed

00:07:10.843 --> 00:07:12.988
to realize our aspiration for healthcare

00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:14.571
was right there in front of us

00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.455
just waiting to be claimed?

00:07:16.455 --> 00:07:18.505
So that's where Health Leads began.

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:20.189
We started with the prescription pad --

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.588
a very ordinary piece of paper --

00:07:22.588 --> 00:07:26.556
and we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy --

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:29.574
antibiotics, an inhaler, medication --

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:32.357
but what do patients need to be healthy,

00:07:32.357 --> 00:07:34.904
to not get sick in the first place?

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:36.755
And we chose to use the prescription

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.537
for that purpose.

00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:39.739
So just a few miles from here

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:41.523
at Children's National Medical Center,

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:43.789
when patients come into the doctor's office,

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:45.474
they're asked a few questions.

00:07:45.474 --> 00:07:48.138
They're asked, "Are you running out of food at the end of the month?

00:07:48.138 --> 00:07:49.704
Do you have safe housing?"

00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:51.773
And when the doctor begins the visit,

00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:54.606
she knows height, weight, is there food at home,

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:56.222
is the family living in a shelter.

00:07:56.222 --> 00:07:59.106
And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices,

00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:03.156
but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,

00:08:03.156 --> 00:08:06.822
using Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.

00:08:06.822 --> 00:08:09.055
The problem is,

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.254
once you get a taste of what it's like

00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:13.489
to realize your aspiration for healthcare,

00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:15.007
you want more.

00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:15.770
So we thought,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.371
if we can get individual doctors

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.588
to prescribe these basic resources for their patients,

00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:23.305
could we get an entire healthcare system

00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:26.057
to shift its presumption?

00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:27.304
And we gave it a shot.

00:08:27.304 --> 00:08:28.739
So now at Harlem Hospital Center

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:32.525
when patients come in with an elevated body mass index,

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.389
the electronic medical record

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:38.189
automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:39.655
And our volunteers can then work with them

00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:42.872
to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs

00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:44.304
in their communities.

00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:45.438
We've created a presumption

00:08:45.438 --> 00:08:47.005
that if you're a patient at that hospital

00:08:47.005 --> 00:08:48.555
with an elevated BMI,

00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:50.789
the four walls of the doctor's office

00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:52.641
probably aren't going to give you everything

00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:53.823
you need to be healthy.

00:08:53.823 --> 00:08:55.223
You need more.

00:08:55.223 --> 00:08:55.904
So on the one hand,

00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:57.601
this is just a basic recoding

00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.306
of the electronic medical record.

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.024
And on the other hand,

00:09:01.024 --> 00:09:02.673
it's a radical transformation

00:09:02.673 --> 00:09:04.841
of the electronic medical record

00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:08.723
from a static repository of diagnostic information

00:09:08.723 --> 00:09:11.557
to a health promotion tool.

00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:12.674
In the private sector,

00:09:12.674 --> 00:09:15.294
when you squeeze that kind of additional value

00:09:15.294 --> 00:09:17.041
out of a fixed-cost investment,

00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:19.641
it's called a billion-dollar company.

00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:21.022
But in my world,

00:09:21.022 --> 00:09:24.423
it's called reduced obesity and diabetes.

00:09:24.423 --> 00:09:26.306
It's called healthcare --

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:29.289
a system where doctors can prescribe solutions

00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:30.839
to improve health,

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:32.988
not just manage disease.

00:09:32.988 --> 00:09:34.522
Same thing in the clinic waiting room.

00:09:34.522 --> 00:09:36.139
So every day in this country

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:37.639
three million patients

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:42.133
pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.

00:09:42.144 --> 00:09:44.117
And what do they do when they're there?

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:47.567
They sit, they watch the goldfish in the fish tank,

00:09:47.567 --> 00:09:50.050
they read extremely old copies

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.333
of Good Housekeeping magazine.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:55.566
But mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.

00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:56.917
How did we get here

00:09:56.917 --> 00:10:00.266
where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.049
to waiting?

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:03.266
What if we had a waiting room

00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:05.367
where you don't just sit when you're sick,

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:07.233
but where you go to get healthy.

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:09.750
If airports can become shopping malls

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.716
and McDonald's can become playgrounds,

00:10:12.716 --> 00:10:16.149
surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:18.183
And that's what Health Leads has tried to do,

00:10:18.183 --> 00:10:20.466
to reclaim that real estate and that time

00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:21.898
and to use it as a gateway

00:10:21.898 --> 00:10:22.950
to connect patients

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.717
to the resources they need to be healthy.

00:10:25.717 --> 00:10:27.233
So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast,

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:29.700
your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off,

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.867
and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER,

00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:34.399
because the cold air triggered your child's asthma.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:37.316
But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously,

00:10:37.316 --> 00:10:39.516
the waiting room became the place

00:10:39.516 --> 00:10:42.000
where Health Leads turned your heat back on?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.618
And of course all of this requires

00:10:43.618 --> 00:10:45.566
a broader workforce.

00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:48.733
But if we're creative, we already have that too.

00:10:48.733 --> 00:10:51.119
We know that our doctors and nurses

00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:52.466
and even social workers

00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:53.934
aren't enough,

00:10:53.934 --> 00:10:55.583
that the ticking minutes of health care

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:57.001
are too constraining.

00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:59.050
Health just takes more time.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.849
It requires a non-clinical army

00:11:01.849 --> 00:11:04.533
of community health workers and case managers

00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:06.149
and many others.

00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:09.299
What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce

00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:13.000
were the 11 million college students in this country?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.766
Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities,

00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:18.368
unwilling to take no for an answer

00:11:18.368 --> 00:11:19.950
from those bureaucracies

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.883
that tend to crush patients,

00:11:21.883 --> 00:11:23.833
and with an unparalleled ability

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:25.285
for information retrieval

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.266
honed through years of using Google.

00:11:28.266 --> 00:11:30.799
Now lest you think it improbable

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:32.416
that a college volunteer

00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:34.199
can make this kind of commitment,

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:35.766
I have two words for you:

00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:38.117
March Madness.

00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:42.084
The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player

00:11:42.084 --> 00:11:45.349
dedicates 39 hours a week to his sport.

00:11:45.349 --> 00:11:47.501
Now we may think that's good or bad,

00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:50.183
but in either case it's real.

00:11:50.183 --> 00:11:52.368
And Health Leads is based on the presumption

00:11:52.368 --> 00:11:53.750
that for too long

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.300
we have asked too little of our college students

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.065
when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.

00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:01.418
College sports teams say,

00:12:01.418 --> 00:12:03.483
"We're going to take dozens of hours

00:12:03.483 --> 00:12:07.367
at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:10.183
and we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance,

00:12:10.183 --> 00:12:12.349
and if you don't measure up or you don't show up,

00:12:12.349 --> 00:12:13.799
we're going to cut you off the team.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.687
But we'll make huge investments

00:12:15.687 --> 00:12:16.899
in your training and development,

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:20.317
and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers."

00:12:20.317 --> 00:12:22.132
And people line up out the door

00:12:22.132 --> 00:12:24.917
just for the chance to be part of it.

00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:26.134
So our feeling is,

00:12:26.134 --> 00:12:27.617
if it's good enough for the rugby team,

00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:29.732
it's good enough for health and poverty.

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:33.000
Health Leads too recruits competitively,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.481
trains intensively,

00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:36.450
coaches professionally,

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.399
demands significant time,

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.766
builds a cohesive team

00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:41.250
and measures results --

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.933
a kind of Teach for America for healthcare.

00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:46.033
Now in the top 10 cities in the U.S.

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:48.352
with the largest number of Medicaid patients,

00:12:48.352 --> 00:12:51.566
each of those has at least 20,000 college students.

00:12:51.566 --> 00:12:54.767
New York alone has half a million college students.

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:57.816
And this isn't just a sort of short-term workforce

00:12:57.816 --> 00:13:00.066
to connect patients to basic resources,

00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:03.667
it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:06.117
who've spent two, three, four years

00:13:06.117 --> 00:13:07.618
in the clinic waiting room

00:13:07.618 --> 00:13:11.602
talking to patients about their most basic health needs.

00:13:11.602 --> 00:13:13.351
And they leave with the conviction,

00:13:13.351 --> 00:13:15.183
the ability and the efficacy

00:13:15.183 --> 00:13:18.966
to realize our most basic aspirations for health care.

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:21.984
And the thing is, there's thousands of these folks already out there.

00:13:21.984 --> 00:13:25.801
So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine

00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:27.216
at UCSF Medical Center,

00:13:27.216 --> 00:13:29.549
but for three years as an undergraduate

00:13:29.549 --> 00:13:31.182
she was a Health Leads volunteer

00:13:31.182 --> 00:13:34.184
in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center.

00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:37.899
Mia says, "When my classmates write a prescription,

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:39.917
they think their work is done.

00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:41.633
When I write a prescription,

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:43.900
I think, can the family read the prescription?

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.083
Do they have transportation to the pharmacy?

00:13:46.083 --> 00:13:48.533
Do they have food to take with the prescription?

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:50.783
Do they have insurance to fill the prescription?

00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:53.466
Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads,

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:55.216
not in medical school."

00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:57.200
Now none of these solutions --

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.170
the prescription pad, the electronic medical record,

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.317
the waiting room,

00:14:01.317 --> 00:14:02.485
the army of college students --

00:14:02.485 --> 00:14:03.668
are perfect.

00:14:03.668 --> 00:14:06.168
But they are ours for the taking --

00:14:06.168 --> 00:14:07.500
simple examples

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.001
of the vast under-utilized healthcare resources

00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:13.916
that, if we reclaimed and redeployed,

00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:17.333
could realize our most basic aspiration

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:19.117
of healthcare.

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:22.333
So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months

00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:25.066
when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind.

00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:28.000
And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell, my attorney,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.419
that I needed to leave.

00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:30.382
And I was so nervous,

00:14:30.382 --> 00:14:32.916
because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me

00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:35.966
for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea.

00:14:35.966 --> 00:14:37.950
And I sat down with him and I said,

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.833
"Jeff, I have this idea

00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:42.252
that we could mobilize college students

00:14:42.252 --> 00:14:45.186
to address patients' most basic health needs."

00:14:45.186 --> 00:14:46.767
And I'll be honest,

00:14:46.767 --> 00:14:50.066
all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me.

00:14:50.066 --> 00:14:51.533
But he said this,

00:14:51.533 --> 00:14:54.881
"Rebecca, when you have a vision,

00:14:54.881 --> 00:14:58.732
you have an obligation to realize that vision.

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:01.833
You must pursue that vision."

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:05.099
And I have to say, I was like "Whoa.

00:15:05.099 --> 00:15:07.116
That's a lot of pressure."

00:15:07.116 --> 00:15:08.515
I just wanted a blessing,

00:15:08.515 --> 00:15:10.066
I didn't want some kind of mandate.

00:15:10.066 --> 00:15:11.633
But the truth is

00:15:11.633 --> 00:15:14.416
I've spent every waking minute nearly since then

00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:16.200
chasing that vision.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.382
I believe that we all have a vision

00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:21.283
for healthcare in this country.

00:15:21.283 --> 00:15:23.482
I believe that at the end of the day

00:15:23.482 --> 00:15:25.316
when we measure our healthcare,

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:28.132
it will not be by the diseases cured,

00:15:28.132 --> 00:15:30.650
but by the diseases prevented.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.667
It will not be by the excellence of our technologies

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.167
or the sophistication of our specialists,

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:38.966
but by how rarely we needed them.

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:40.450
And most of all,

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.967
I believe that when we measure healthcare,

00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:45.650
it will be, not by what the system was,

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.416
but by what we chose it to be.

00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:49.483
Thank you.

00:15:49.483 --> 00:15:59.733
(Applause)

00:15:59.733 --> 00:16:01.000
Thank you.

00:16:01.008 --> 00:16:10.331
(Applause)
