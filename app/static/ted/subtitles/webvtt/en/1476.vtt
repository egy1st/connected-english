00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.336
Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:09.486
create their identity in some kind of narrative form.

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:12.227
From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant,

00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:15.291
teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:17.081
Whether in cave paintings

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.711
or the latest uses of the Internet,

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.542
human beings have always told their histories and truths

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.999
through parable and fable.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.476
We are inveterate storytellers.

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:33.859
But where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world,

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.957
do we offer communality of experience,

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:42.307
unmediated by our own furious consumerism?

00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:45.807
And what narrative, what history,

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:48.488
what identity, what moral code

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:51.840
are we imparting to our young?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.722
Cinema is arguably

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:57.307
the 20th century's most influential art form.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.357
Its artists told stories

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:00.639
across national boundaries,

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.507
in as many languages, genres and philosophies

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:04.757
as one can imagine.

00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:07.389
Indeed, it is hard to find a subject

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:09.406
that film has yet to tackle.

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:11.057
During the last decade

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:13.473
we've seen a vast integration of global media,

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.857
now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:19.273
We are increasingly offered a diet

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:22.757
in which sensation, not story, is king.

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:25.190
What was common to us all 40 years ago --

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.989
the telling of stories between generations --

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.074
is now rarified.

00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:32.322
As a filmmaker, it worried me.

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:36.189
As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.606
What future could the young build

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:39.973
with so little grasp

00:01:39.973 --> 00:01:41.757
of where they've come from

00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:44.815
and so few narratives of what's possible?

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:46.463
The irony is palpable;

00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:49.964
technical access has never been greater,

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:53.031
cultural access never weaker.

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:57.364
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB,

00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:01.399
an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.481
followed by discussions.

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.214
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film,

00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:09.282
maybe we could build a narrative

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:10.830
that would deliver meaning

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.913
to the fragmented and restless world of the young.

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:15.516
Given the access to technology,

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:19.247
even a school in a tiny rural hamlet

00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:22.948
could project a DVD onto a white board.

00:02:22.948 --> 00:02:24.782
In the first nine months

00:02:24.782 --> 00:02:27.130
we ran 25 clubs across the U.K.,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.198
with kids in age groups between five and 18

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:33.230
watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.114
The films were curated and contextualized.

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.865
But the choice was theirs,

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:39.681
and our audience quickly grew

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.914
to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.713
The outcome, immediate.

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:52.299
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.631
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three,

00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:58.347
these young people discovered new places,

00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:00.264
new thoughts, new perspectives.

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:02.398
By the time the pilot had finished,

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:05.231
we had the names of a thousand schools

00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:09.050
that wished to join.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.671
The film that changed my life

00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:15.638
is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."

00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:17.391
It's a remarkable comment

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:20.721
on slums, poverty and aspiration.

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:24.955
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:28.917
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema,

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.894
find and pay for the print and the projectionist.

00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:33.566
But for my father,

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:39.352
the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.983
that he chose to celebrate his half-century

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:45.848
with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends,

00:03:45.848 --> 00:03:47.200
"In order," he said,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.667
"to pass the baton of concern and hope

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.150
on to the next generation."

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.917
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan,"

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:59.867
slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:02.399
Sixty years after the film was made

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.600
and 30 years after I first saw it,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.150
I see young faces tilt up in awe,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.418
their incredulity matching mine.

00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:11.916
And the speed with which they associate it

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:15.540
with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.488
speaks to the enduring nature.

00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:21.605
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government,

00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:23.521
we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."

00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:29.940
Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.081
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.640
It shows how to do right,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.374
how to be heroically awkward.

00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:40.124
It is also an expression of faith

00:04:40.124 --> 00:04:43.649
in the political machine as a force of honor.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:47.132
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic,

00:04:47.132 --> 00:04:51.798
there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.

00:04:51.798 --> 00:04:53.082
And it was with great delight

00:04:53.082 --> 00:04:55.733
that we found young people up and down the country

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.566
explaining with authority

00:04:57.566 --> 00:04:59.582
what filibustering was

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:05.099
and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.233
After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:12.300
In choosing "Hotel Rwanda,"

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.583
they explored genocide of the most brutal kind.

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:19.116
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions

00:05:19.116 --> 00:05:20.916
about unarmed peace-keeping forces

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.599
and the double-dealing of a Western society

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.533
that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.

00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:31.599
And when "Schindler's List" demanded that they never forget,

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.716
one child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked,

00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:36.985
"We already forgot,

00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:40.999
otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:44.766
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:49.399
"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.266
"To Sir, with Love" ignited its teen audience.

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:55.915
They celebrated a change in attitude

00:05:55.915 --> 00:05:57.615
towards non-white Britons,

00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:01.035
but railed against our restless school system

00:06:01.035 --> 00:06:04.083
that does not value collective identity,

00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:10.150
unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.265
By now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:17.100
thought nothing of tackling films of all forms --

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.415
black and white, subtitled,

00:06:18.415 --> 00:06:21.149
documentary, non-narrative, fantasy --

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.848
and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews

00:06:23.848 --> 00:06:27.332
that competed to favor one film over another

00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:31.156
in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:34.322
Six thousand reviews each school week

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:38.840
vying for the honor of being review of the week.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.900
From 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.982
until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:49.398
in 7,000 clubs right across the country.

00:06:49.398 --> 00:06:52.282
And although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary,

00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:54.565
what became more extraordinary

00:06:54.565 --> 00:06:58.115
was how the experience of critical and curious questioning

00:06:58.115 --> 00:07:00.633
translated into life.

00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:03.500
Some of our kids started talking with their parents,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.266
others with their teachers,

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:06.249
or with their friends.

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:07.949
And those without friends

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:10.150
started making them.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.466
The films provided communality across all manner of divide.

00:07:15.466 --> 00:07:18.583
And the stories they held provided a shared experience.

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:23.000
"Persepolis" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.801
and "Jaws" became the way in which one young boy

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:30.366
was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.916
in flight from violence

00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:34.900
that killed first his father then his mother,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.782
the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.

00:07:39.782 --> 00:07:41.741
Who was right, who wrong?

00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:43.857
What would they do under the same conditions?

00:07:43.857 --> 00:07:45.406
Was the tale told well?

00:07:45.406 --> 00:07:47.007
Was there a hidden message?

00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:49.740
How has the world changed? How could it be different?

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.624
A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children

00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:56.374
who the world didn't think were interested.

00:07:56.374 --> 00:07:59.845
And they themselves had not known they cared.

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:01.757
And as they wrote and debated,

00:08:01.757 --> 00:08:04.723
rather than seeing the films as artifacts,

00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:09.789
they began to see themselves.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.954
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.

00:08:12.954 --> 00:08:15.108
In a moment she can invoke images

00:08:15.108 --> 00:08:19.073
of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.

00:08:19.073 --> 00:08:20.639
Quite recently she told me

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:24.038
that in 1948, two of her sisters and my father

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:26.686
traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:31.152
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions,

00:08:31.152 --> 00:08:34.886
it was these teenagers that fed the crew.

00:08:34.886 --> 00:08:37.036
I was past 40 when my father died.

00:08:37.036 --> 00:08:39.588
He never mentioned that journey.

00:08:39.588 --> 00:08:43.273
My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:46.670
without her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.501
and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.

00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:51.785
After two years in hiding,

00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:54.619
my grandfather appeared in London.

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:56.919
He was never right again.

00:08:56.919 --> 00:09:01.620
And his story was hushed as he assimilated.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.558
My story started in England

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:09.821
with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.

00:09:09.821 --> 00:09:11.972
I had "Anne Frank," "The Great Escape,"

00:09:11.972 --> 00:09:14.486
"Shoah," "Triumph of the Will."

00:09:14.486 --> 00:09:16.541
It was Leni Riefenstahl

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:19.324
in her elegant Nazi propaganda

00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:23.232
who gave context to what the family had to endure.

00:09:23.232 --> 00:09:28.882
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud,

00:09:28.882 --> 00:09:31.232
and they became more useful to me

00:09:31.232 --> 00:09:33.949
than the whispers of survivors

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:36.884
and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo

00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:39.732
on a maiden aunt's wrist.

00:09:39.732 --> 00:09:42.515
Purists may feel that fiction dissipates

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:45.516
the quest of real human understanding,

00:09:45.516 --> 00:09:47.015
that film is too crude

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:49.449
to tell a complex and detailed history,

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:53.699
or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.

00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:56.833
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning.

00:09:56.833 --> 00:10:00.100
As one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz,"

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.399
"Every person should watch this,

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:04.249
because unless you do

00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:08.916
you may not know that you too have a heart."

00:10:08.916 --> 00:10:13.315
We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?

00:10:13.315 --> 00:10:16.609
Consider "Citizen Kane" as valuable as Jane Austen.

00:10:16.609 --> 00:10:19.808
Agree that "Boyz n the Hood," like Tennyson,

00:10:19.808 --> 00:10:23.826
offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding

00:10:23.826 --> 00:10:25.575
that work together.

00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:27.109
Each a piece of memorable art,

00:10:27.109 --> 00:10:30.558
each a brick in the wall of who we are.

00:10:30.558 --> 00:10:33.425
And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.475
better than astronaut Jim Lovell

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:40.039
or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.595
And though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce

00:10:43.595 --> 00:10:46.292
are an opportunity to discover

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:48.708
what it is to be human,

00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:52.742
and no less helpful to understanding our life and times

00:10:52.742 --> 00:10:58.492
as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.

00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:00.060
We guessed that film,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.059
whose stories are a meeting place

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:04.288
of drama, music, literature and human experience,

00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:08.793
would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.325
What we could not have foreseen

00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:11.958
was the measurable improvements

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.676
in behavior, confidence and academic achievement.

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:19.958
Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers,

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.443
fight, not on the playground,

00:11:21.443 --> 00:11:23.576
but to choose next week's film --

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:27.162
young people who have found self-definition, ambition

00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:31.409
and an appetite for education and social engagement

00:11:31.409 --> 00:11:34.375
from the stories they have witnessed.

00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:37.758
Our members defy the binary description

00:11:37.758 --> 00:11:40.576
of how we so often describe our young.

00:11:40.576 --> 00:11:45.559
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:47.326
They are, like other young people,

00:11:47.326 --> 00:11:50.793
negotiating a world with infinite choice,

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:55.493
but little culture of how to find meaningful experience.

00:11:55.493 --> 00:11:58.127
We appeared surprised at the behaviors

00:11:58.127 --> 00:12:00.125
of those who define themselves

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:02.326
by the size of the tick on their shoes,

00:12:02.326 --> 00:12:06.575
yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.

00:12:06.575 --> 00:12:08.392
If we want different values

00:12:08.392 --> 00:12:11.859
we have to tell a different story,

00:12:11.859 --> 00:12:15.861
a story that understands that an individual narrative

00:12:15.861 --> 00:12:19.724
is an essential component of a person's identity,

00:12:19.724 --> 00:12:21.493
that a collective narrative

00:12:21.493 --> 00:12:25.474
is an essential component of a cultural identity,

00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:29.208
and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself

00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:30.609
as part of a group.

00:12:30.609 --> 00:12:33.665
Because when these people get home

00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:36.184
after a screening of "Rear Window"

00:12:36.184 --> 00:12:38.933
and raise their gaze to the building next door,

00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:42.598
they have the tools to wonder who, apart from them,

00:12:42.598 --> 00:12:44.165
is out there

00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:46.698
and what is their story.

00:12:46.698 --> 00:12:48.349
Thank you.

00:12:48.349 --> 00:12:51.031
(Applause)
