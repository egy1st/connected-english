00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.142
When I was a child growing up in Maine,

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.166
one of my favorite things to do

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.214
was to look for sand dollars
on the seashores of Maine,

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:10.944
because my parents told me
it would bring me luck.

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:13.646
But you know, these shells,
they're hard to find.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.166
They're covered in sand,
they're difficult to see.

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:20.173
However, over time,
I got used to looking for them.

00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:21.800
I started seeing shapes

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.546
and patterns that helped me
to collect them.

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:29.156
This grew into a passion
for finding things,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.220
a love for the past and archaeology.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.854
And eventually, when I started
studying Egyptology,

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:39.267
I realized that seeing
with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:42.140
Because all of the sudden, in Egypt,

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:45.759
my beach had grown
from a tiny beach in Maine

00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:47.870
to one eight hundred miles long,

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:49.044
next to the Nile.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.199
And my sand dollars had grown
to the size of cities.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:57.373
This is really what brought me
to using satellite imagery.

00:00:57.397 --> 00:01:01.427
For trying to map the past,
I knew that I had to see differently.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.238
So I want to show you an example
of how we see differently

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:06.506
using the infrared.

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:09.856
This is a site located
in the eastern Egyptian delta

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.077
called Mendes.

00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:14.077
And the site visibly appears brown,

00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:16.307
but when we use the infrared

00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.981
and we process it, all of the sudden,

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:20.521
using false color,

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:22.331
the site appears as bright pink.

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:24.076
What you are seeing

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.401
are the actual chemical changes
to the landscape

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.917
caused by the building
materials and activities

00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:32.306
of the ancient Egyptians.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.496
What I want to share with you today

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.321
is how we've used satellite data

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.800
to find an ancient Egyptian city,

00:01:40.824 --> 00:01:42.442
called Itjtawy,

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.197
missing for thousands of years.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:47.776
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.323
for over four hundred years,

00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:51.665
at a period of time
called the Middle Kingdom,

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.283
about four thousand years ago.

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:56.529
The site is located
in the Faiyum of Egypt,

00:01:56.553 --> 00:01:58.152
and the site is really important,

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.174
because in the Middle Kingdom
there was this great renaissance

00:02:01.198 --> 00:02:04.069
for ancient Egyptian art,
architecture and religion.

00:02:04.784 --> 00:02:07.537
Egyptologists have always known
the site of Itjtawy

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:11.991
was located somewhere near the pyramids
of the two kings who built it,

00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:14.529
indicated within the red circles here,

00:02:14.553 --> 00:02:16.847
but somewhere within
this massive flood plain.

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:18.155
This area is huge --

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.773
it's four miles by three miles in size.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.148
The Nile used to flow
right next to the city of Itjtawy,

00:02:24.172 --> 00:02:27.585
and as it shifted and changed
and moved over time to the east,

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.069
it covered over the city.

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:33.307
So, how do you find a buried city

00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.735
in a vast landscape?

00:02:35.473 --> 00:02:37.934
Finding it randomly
would be the equivalent

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.656
of locating a needle in a haystack,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.530
blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.

00:02:41.554 --> 00:02:42.782
(Laughter)

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:46.068
So what we did is
we used NASA topography data

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:48.853
to map out the landscape,
very subtle changes.

00:02:49.218 --> 00:02:52.242
We started to be able to see
where the Nile used to flow.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:55.718
But you can see in more detail,
and even more interesting,

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.789
this very slight raised area

00:02:57.813 --> 00:02:59.250
seen within the circle up here

00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:02.693
which we thought could possibly be
the location of the city of Itjtawy.

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:06.248
So we collaborated
with Egyptian scientists

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:08.398
to do coring work, which you see here.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:10.590
When I say coring, it's like ice coring,

00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:12.549
but instead of layers of climate change,

00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:14.905
you're looking for layers
of human occupation.

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.666
And, five meters down,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.817
underneath a thick layer of mud,

00:03:18.841 --> 00:03:22.269
we found a dense layer of pottery.

00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:25.167
What this shows is that
at this possible location of Itjtawy,

00:03:25.191 --> 00:03:26.428
five meters down,

00:03:26.452 --> 00:03:29.277
we have a layer of occupation
for several hundred years,

00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:30.698
dating to the Middle Kingdom,

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:33.681
dating to the exact period of time
we think Itjtawy is.

00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:36.714
We also found work stone --

00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:38.872
carnelian, quartz and agate

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:41.333
that shows that there was
a jeweler's workshop here.

00:03:41.357 --> 00:03:42.842
These might not look like much,

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.515
but when you think
about the most common stones

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.909
used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:50.718
these are the stones that were used.

00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:52.926
So, we have a dense layer of occupation

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.951
dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.

00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:57.776
We also have evidence
of an elite jeweler's workshop,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.530
showing that whatever was there
was a very important city.

00:04:01.554 --> 00:04:03.474
No Itjtawy was here yet,

00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:05.499
but we're going to be
returning to the site

00:04:05.523 --> 00:04:07.577
in the near future to map it out.

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.252
And even more importantly,

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:13.799
we have funding to train young Egyptians
in the use of satellite technology

00:04:13.823 --> 00:04:16.759
so they can be the ones
making great discoveries as well.

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:22.362
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote
from the Middle Kingdom --

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:24.927
it was probably written
at the city of Itjtawy

00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:26.623
four thousand years ago.

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.894
"Sharing knowledge
is the greatest of all callings.

00:04:29.918 --> 00:04:31.681
There's nothing like it in the land."

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:37.189
So as it turns out,
TED was not founded in 1984 AD.

00:04:37.213 --> 00:04:39.308
(Laughter)

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:45.863
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC

00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:49.141
at a not-lost-for-long city,
found from above.

00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:52.999
It certainly puts finding seashells
by the seashore in perspective.

00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:54.175
Thank you very much.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.629
(Applause)

00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:57.810
Thank you.

00:04:57.834 --> 00:04:59.873
(Applause)
