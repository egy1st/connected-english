00:00:00.744 --> 00:00:03.742
When I was about 16 years old

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:07.441
I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation,

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.971
looking for a movie to watch on HBO --

00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:12.484
and how many of you remember "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"?

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:17.485
Oh yeah, great movie, right? -- Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought,

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:20.197
"Sweet! Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this!"

00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:23.769
It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick,

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.886
I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris.

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:33.639
But you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time; you were doing gay things at the time.

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:36.967
He was in a movie called "Torch Song Trilogy."

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:43.713
And "Torch Song Trilogy" was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love.

00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:46.777
Love and respect -- that's what the whole film was about.

00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:51.933
And as I'm watching it, I'm realizing that they're talking about me.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:57.526
Not the drag queen part -- I am not shaving my hair for anyone -- but the gay part.

00:00:57.526 --> 00:01:02.739
The finding love and respect, the part about trying to find your place in the world.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.089
So as I'm watching this, I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears,

00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:12.289
and it stuck with me for the past 25 years.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.398
And there's this quote that the main character, Arnold, tells his mother

00:01:17.398 --> 00:01:22.557
as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.

00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:27.776
"There's one thing more -- there's just one more thing you better understand.

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:33.812
I've taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, build furniture,

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:36.669
I can even pat myself on the back when necessary,

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:41.168
all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:46.847
There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect,

00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:51.296
and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life."

00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:59.063
I remember that scene like it was yesterday; I was 16, I was in tears, I was in the closet,

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:04.424
and I'm looking at these two people, Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before,

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.722
fighting for love.

00:02:08.722 --> 00:02:12.851
When I finally got to a place in my life

00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:16.474
where I came out and accepted who I was, and was really quite happy, to tell you the truth,

00:02:16.474 --> 00:02:20.620
I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.949
I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was --

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.167
gay being happy, not gay being attracted to the same sex.

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:33.211
In fact, I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger

00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:35.821
and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear


00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:40.690
about who I was and the gay lifestyle.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.011
Now, I'm sitting here trying to figure out "the gay lifestyle," "the gay lifestyle,"

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:49.423
and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again: lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.

00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:54.053
I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat

00:02:54.053 --> 00:02:56.961
to civilization than terrorism.

00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:59.936
That's when I got scared.

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:07.058
Because I'm thinking, if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization,

00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:11.684
I need to figure out what this stuff is, and I need to stop doing it right now.

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:14.062
(Laughter)

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:18.985
So, I took a look at my life, a hard look at my life,

00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:23.205
and I saw some things very disturbing.

00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:27.041
(Laughter)

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.795
And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you,

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:33.092
starting with my mornings.

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:36.138
I drink coffee.

00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:42.031
Not only do I drink coffee, I know other gay people who drink coffee.

00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:45.673
I get stuck in traffic --

00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:49.151
evil, evil traffic.

00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:52.323
Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports.

00:03:52.323 --> 00:03:55.589
I look around, and I go, "My God, look at all these gay people!

00:03:55.589 --> 00:04:00.031
We're all trapped in these lines! These long lines trying to get on an airplane!

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:06.257
My God, this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil!"

00:04:06.257 --> 00:04:13.644
I clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room; his is messier.

00:04:13.644 --> 00:04:19.005
And because I have a 15-year-old, all I do is cook and cook and cook.

00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:23.962
Any parents out there of teenagers? All we do is cook for these people --

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:28.766
they eat two, three, four dinners a night -- it's ridiculous!

00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:31.338
This is the gay lifestyle.

00:04:31.414 --> 00:04:38.201
And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic,

00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:41.804
my partner and I, we get together

00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:47.959
and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:51.783
(Laughter)

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:55.135
We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on "American Idol."

00:04:55.135 --> 00:04:59.353
We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on

00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:04.439
because we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.809
This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle.

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.674
Run for your heterosexual lives, people.

00:05:12.674 --> 00:05:21.053
(Applause)

00:05:21.068 --> 00:05:25.722
When my partner, Steve, and I first started dating,

00:05:25.722 --> 00:05:29.316
he told me this story about penguins.

00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:32.767
And I didn't know where he was going with it at first.

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:36.703
He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me, but he told me that

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:41.056
when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with,

00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:44.657
they present them with a pebble -- the perfect pebble.

00:05:44.657 --> 00:05:51.273
And then he reaches into his pocket, and he brings this out to me.

00:05:51.273 --> 00:05:55.250
And I looked at it, and I was like, this is really cool.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.676
And he says, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you."

00:05:59.676 --> 00:06:05.215
So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous,

00:06:05.215 --> 00:06:08.804
like, I don't know, a TEDx talk.

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:12.790
I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.410
And sometimes I just wear it just because.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.328
How many people out there are in love? Anyone in love out there?

00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:24.504
You might be gay.

00:06:24.504 --> 00:06:25.930
(Laughter)

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.479
Because I, too, am in love, and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about.

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:38.744
(Applause)

00:06:38.744 --> 00:06:44.316
You may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well.

00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:48.218
How many of you are single? Any single people out there?

00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:53.384
You too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.

00:06:53.384 --> 00:07:00.129
It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.473
It goes and goes and engulfs!

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:06.329
It's really quite silly, isn't it?

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:11.718
That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say

00:07:11.718 --> 00:07:13.713

(Applause)

00:07:13.713 --> 00:07:15.775
that he supports --

00:07:15.775 --> 00:07:19.198
(Applause)

00:07:19.198 --> 00:07:22.560
that he supports marriage equality.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.130
It's a wonderful day in our country's history; it's a wonderful day in the globe's history

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.176
to be able to have an actual sitting president say, enough of this --

00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:35.890
first to himself, and then to the rest of the world.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.978
It's wonderful.

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:41.369
But there's something that's been disturbing me since he

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:45.106
made that remark just a short time ago.

00:07:45.106 --> 00:07:51.666
And that is, apparently, this is just another move by the gay activists

00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:55.147
that's on the gay agenda.

00:07:55.147 --> 00:08:00.860
And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.550
I've been to all of the functions, I've been to fundraisers,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.035
I've written about the topic, and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda.

00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:10.725
(Laughter)

00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:13.507
I've paid my dues on time,

00:08:13.507 --> 00:08:16.056
(Laughter)

00:08:16.056 --> 00:08:20.351
I've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine,

00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:23.692
and I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda.


00:08:23.692 --> 00:08:28.657
It's very, very frustrating, and I was feeling left out, like I wasn't quite gay enough.

00:08:28.657 --> 00:08:33.860
But then something wonderful happened: I was out shopping, as I tend to do,

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:42.283
and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda.

00:08:42.283 --> 00:08:47.687
And I said to myself, "LZ, for so long, you have been denied this.

00:08:47.687 --> 00:08:52.703
When you get in front of this crowd, you're gonna share the news.

00:08:52.703 --> 00:08:56.574
You're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder,

00:08:56.574 --> 00:09:00.095
what exactly is in the gay agenda?

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:03.575
What are these gays up to?

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:06.409
What do they want?"

00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:11.796
So, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen --

00:09:11.796 --> 00:09:16.030
now be careful, 'cause it's evil -- a copy,

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:21.463
the official copy, of the gay agenda.

00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:46.267
(Music)

00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:49.238
The gay agenda, people!

00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:53.175
(Applause)

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.227
There it is!

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:59.066
Did you soak it all in? The gay agenda.

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:02.317
Some of you may be calling it, what,

00:10:02.317 --> 00:10:05.461
the Constitution of the United States, is that what you call it too?

00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:10.661
The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda.

00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:15.566
These gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens

00:10:15.566 --> 00:10:19.471
and it's all written down in plain sight.

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:25.177
I was blown away when I saw it. I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?

00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:29.386
Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?

00:10:29.386 --> 00:10:33.074
I wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.

00:10:33.074 --> 00:10:37.782
But there it is. The gay agenda.

00:10:37.782 --> 00:10:43.586
Run for your heterosexual lives.

00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:50.318
Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that

00:10:50.318 --> 00:10:53.459
people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:55.551
can be kicked out of their apartments

00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:59.687
for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?

00:10:59.687 --> 00:11:04.855
That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed,

00:11:04.855 --> 00:11:10.697
because there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people.

00:11:10.697 --> 00:11:15.846
Did you know in the states where there's no shading that

00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:22.032
you can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?

00:11:22.032 --> 00:11:26.043
Not based upon the quality of your work,

00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:30.045
how long you've been there, if you stink,

00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:36.718
just if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered.

00:11:36.718 --> 00:11:42.048
All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda,

00:11:42.048 --> 00:11:45.763
also known as the U.S. Constitution.

00:11:45.763 --> 00:11:49.435
Specifically, this little amendment right here:

00:11:49.435 --> 00:11:54.686
"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities

00:11:54.686 --> 00:11:58.924
of citizens of the United States."

00:11:58.924 --> 00:12:01.965
I'm looking at you, North Carolina.

00:12:01.965 --> 00:12:06.562
But you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution.

00:12:06.562 --> 00:12:11.873
This is the gay agenda: equality. Not special rights,

00:12:11.873 --> 00:12:16.049
but the rights that were already written by these people --

00:12:16.049 --> 00:12:18.468
these elitists, if you will.

00:12:18.468 --> 00:12:22.499
Educated, well-dressed,

00:12:22.499 --> 00:12:25.187
(Laughter)

00:12:25.187 --> 00:12:27.928
some would dare say questionably dressed.

00:12:27.928 --> 00:12:30.707
(Laughter)

00:12:30.707 --> 00:12:34.489
Nonetheless, our forefathers, right?

00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:38.725
The people that, we say, knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution --

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:41.898
the gay agenda, if you will.

00:12:41.898 --> 00:12:47.221
All of that flies in the face of what they did.

00:12:47.221 --> 00:12:52.732
That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that

00:12:52.732 --> 00:12:58.074
I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda.

00:12:58.074 --> 00:13:03.052
Because I figured if I made it funny, you wouldn't be as threatened.

00:13:03.052 --> 00:13:07.611
I figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious.

00:13:07.611 --> 00:13:13.038
But when you see the map, and you see our state of Michigan --

00:13:13.038 --> 00:13:18.685
it's legal to fire someone

00:13:18.685 --> 00:13:22.579
for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,

00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:26.843
that it's legal to remove someone from their home

00:13:26.843 --> 00:13:31.453
because they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,

00:13:31.453 --> 00:13:35.441
then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality

00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:38.909
is not about stripping someone's rights away,

00:13:38.909 --> 00:13:43.489
it's about granting them the rights that [have] already been stated.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:47.950
And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated,

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.456
that we've already agreed upon.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:56.763
There are people living in fear

00:13:56.763 --> 00:14:00.380
of losing their jobs

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.470
so they don't show anyone who they really are

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.275
right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina;

00:14:10.275 --> 00:14:15.964
all those states that were clear, it's legal.

00:14:15.964 --> 00:14:19.188
If I could brag for a second,

00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:25.292
I have a 15-year-old son from my marriage.

00:14:25.292 --> 00:14:28.043
He has a 4.0.


00:14:28.043 --> 00:14:34.482
He is starting a new club at school, Policy Debate.

00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:38.709
He's a budding track star;

00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:45.170
he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.673
He volunteers.

00:14:47.673 --> 00:14:50.908
He prays before he eats.

00:14:50.908 --> 00:14:57.103
I would like to think, as his father -- and he lives with me primarily --

00:14:57.103 --> 00:15:01.020
that I had a little something to do with all of that.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.928
I would like to think that he's a good boy,

00:15:03.928 --> 00:15:08.295
a respectful young man. I would like to think that

00:15:08.295 --> 00:15:11.992
I've proven to be a capable father.

00:15:11.992 --> 00:15:15.745
But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today,

00:15:15.745 --> 00:15:20.677
and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage,

00:15:20.677 --> 00:15:24.276
I would be disqualified for only one reason:

00:15:24.276 --> 00:15:27.633
because I'm gay.

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:32.436
It doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart.

00:15:32.436 --> 00:15:36.044
It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am

00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:41.876
that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption.

00:15:41.876 --> 00:15:45.911
And that's not just about me,

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:50.814
that's about so many other Michiganders, U.S. citizens,

00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:55.973
who don't understand why what they are

00:15:55.973 --> 00:16:01.253
is so much more significant than who they are.

00:16:01.253 --> 00:16:06.630
This story just keeps playing over and over

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.121
and over again in our country's history.

00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:13.978
There was a time in which, I don't know,

00:16:13.978 --> 00:16:18.007
people who were black couldn't have the same rights.

00:16:18.007 --> 00:16:23.322
People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights, couldn't vote.

00:16:23.322 --> 00:16:28.112
There was a point in our history in which, if you were considered disabled,

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:32.849
that an employer could just fire you, before the Americans with Disabilities Act.

00:16:32.849 --> 00:16:36.203
We keep doing this over and over again.

00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:40.787
And so here we are, 2012,

00:16:40.787 --> 00:16:43.116
gay agenda,

00:16:43.116 --> 00:16:46.984
gay lifestyle, and I'm not a good dad

00:16:46.984 --> 00:16:50.494
and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families

00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:55.165
because of what they are, not who they are.

00:16:55.165 --> 00:17:01.809
So when you hear the words "gay lifestyle" and "gay agenda" in the future,

00:17:01.809 --> 00:17:05.214
I encourage you to do two things:

00:17:05.214 --> 00:17:11.499
One, remember the U.S. Constitution, and then two,

00:17:11.499 --> 00:17:16.622
if you wouldn't mind looking to your left, please.

00:17:16.622 --> 00:17:19.778
Look to your right.

00:17:19.778 --> 00:17:25.245
That person next to you is a brother, is a sister.

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:27.860
And they should be treated with love and respect.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.583
Thank you.
