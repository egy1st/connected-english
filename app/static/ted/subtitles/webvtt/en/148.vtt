00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The punch line?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
every single morning to milk my Labrador."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is a recent cover of New York Magazine.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And this is a song medley I put together --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(Music)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
some sort of meme or shorthand?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
(Laughter)

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
A time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
A time for plotting to whack the chief of police,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
like in this classic scene from "The Godfather."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It is four in the morning."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
(Laughter)

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
A time for even grimmer stuff than that,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"The House of the Spirits."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
After the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
They worked until four o'clock in the morning.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
A time for even grimmer stuff than that,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
like in last April's New Yorker magazine.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This short fiction piece by Martin Amis

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
starts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
at 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and Mohamed Atta's last day began."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
For a time that I find to be the most placid

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
an awful lot of bad press --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
(Laughter)

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
across a lot of different media from a lot of big names.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And it made me suspicious.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
like they invented it, right?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Could it be there is something more going on here?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Something deliberate, something secret,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I say this guy -- Alberto Giacometti, shown here

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
with some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
He did it with this famous piece

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
from the New York Museum of Modern Art.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Its title -- "The Palace at Four in the Morning --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Laughter)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
1932.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Not just the earliest cryptic reference

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to four in the morning I can find.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
may provide an incredible key to virtually

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
or your iPhones if you've got them.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It works a little something like -- this is a recent Google search

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
for four in the morning.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The top 10 results yield you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
four hits for Faron Young's song, "It's Four in the Morning,"

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
three hits for Judi Dench's film, "Four in the Morning,"

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, "Four in the Morning."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a country music hall of famer all have in common

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
besides this totally excellent Google ranking?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Well, let's start with Faron Young -- who was born incidentally

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in 1932.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
(Laughter)

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
In 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
(Laughter)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But he didn't die on Dench's birthday.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
On that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Faron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Ms. Four in the Morning -- or one of them anyway -- Wislawa Szymborska

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
was in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Coincidence? No, it's creepy.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
(Laughter)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
That's like me telling you,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
"Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but that does not mean there's not something going on

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
at the highest possible levels.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
In fact there are people in this room

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
(Laughter)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Video: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
your guy will fry them up?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Now do you need towels, laundry, maids?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
HS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- let me see if I got this straight.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
There's a rumble in my stomach.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Marge Simpson: Homer, please.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Rives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Let me see if I got this straight, Matt.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
(Laughter)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
When Homer Simpson needs to imagine

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the most remote possible moment of not just the clock,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
on the birthday of the Baby Jesus.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And no, I don't know how it works

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
into the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I know a coded message when I see one.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(Laughter)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I said, I know a coded message when I see one.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life"

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
from the bookstore here at TED.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to get to the golden ticket?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along:

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
"Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
with the inaugural address.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
because as we worked between one and four in the morning

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And then --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
(Laughter)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
three paragraphs later we get this little beauty:

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
"We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Well, how could it have?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
By his own writing, this man was either asleep,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
a nuclear missile out of a suitcase.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
What happened to William Jefferson Clinton?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
We might not ever know.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And I noticed, he's not exactly around here today

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to face any tough questions.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
(Laughter)

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It could get awkward, right?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
But if he were here --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
(Laughter)

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
he might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
a journey that saw him go on to become

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the first Democrat president elected

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to two consecutive terms in decades.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
In generations.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
who began his own unprecedented journey

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
way back at his own first election,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
(Laughter)

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
the year Alberto Giacometti

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
made "The Palace at Four in the Morning."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
first came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:46.000
(Music)

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Applause)
