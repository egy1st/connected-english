00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.536
Two weeks ago,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.936
I was sitting at the kitchen table
with my wife Katya,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.720
and we were talking about
what I was going to talk about today.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.696
We have an 11-year-old son;
his name is Lincoln.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.200
He was sitting at the same table,
doing his math homework.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.816
And during a pause
in my conversation with Katya,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.576
I looked over at Lincoln

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.560
and I was suddenly thunderstruck

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.474
by a recollection of a client of mine.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.856
My client was a guy named Will.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.329
He was from North Texas.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.656
He never knew his father very well,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.360
because his father left his mom
while she was pregnant with him.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.696
And so, he was destined
to be raised by a single mom,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.197
which might have been all right

00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:56.901
except that this particular single mom
was a paranoid schizophrenic,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.776
and when Will was five years old,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800
she tried to kill him
with a butcher knife.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.336
She was taken away by authorities
and placed in a psychiatric hospital,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.616
and so for the next several years
Will lived with his older brother,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.720
until he committed suicide
by shooting himself through the heart.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.896
And after that Will bounced around
from one family member to another,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.640
until, by the time he was nine years old,
he was essentially living on his own.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.576
That morning that I was sitting
with Katya and Lincoln,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.480
I looked at my son, and I realized
that when my client, Will, was his age,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.640
he'd been living by himself for two years.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.976
Will eventually joined a gang

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.376
and committed a number
of very serious crimes,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.680
including, most seriously of all,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.400
a horrible, tragic murder.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.760
And Will was ultimately executed
as punishment for that crime.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.455
But I don't want to talk today
about the morality of capital punishment.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.336
I certainly think that my client
shouldn't have been executed,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.256
but what I would like to do today instead

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.336
is talk about the death penalty
in a way I've never done before,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.360
in a way that is
entirely noncontroversial.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.256
I think that's possible,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.496
because there is a corner
of the death penalty debate --

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.816
maybe the most important corner --

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.576
where everybody agrees,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.856
where the most ardent
death penalty supporters

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.280
and the most vociferous abolitionists
are on exactly the same page.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.800
That's the corner I want to explore.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.136
Before I do that, though,
I want to spend a couple of minutes

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.736
telling you how
a death penalty case unfolds,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.936
and then I want to tell you two lessons

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.016
that I have learned over the last 20 years
as a death penalty lawyer

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.000
from watching well more
than a hundred cases unfold in this way.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.360
You can think of a death penalty case
as a story that has four chapters.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.462
The first chapter of every case
is exactly the same, and it is tragic.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.936
It begins with the murder
of an innocent human being,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.696
and it's followed by a trial

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.696
where the murderer
is convicted and sent to death row,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.360
and that death sentence is ultimately
upheld by the state appellate court.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.536
The second chapter consists
of a complicated legal proceeding

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.400
known as a state habeas corpus appeal.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.136
The third chapter is an even
more complicated legal proceeding

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.656
known as a federal
habeas corpus proceeding.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.496
And the fourth chapter is one
where a variety of things can happen.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.016
The lawyers might file
a clemency petition,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.536
they might initiate
even more complex litigation,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.016
or they might not do anything at all.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.880
But that fourth chapter
always ends with an execution.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.096
When I started representing
death row inmates more than 20 years ago,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.776
people on death row
did not have a right to a lawyer

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.456
in either the second
or the fourth chapter of this story.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.096
They were on their own.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.536
In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.440
that they acquired a right to a lawyer
during the third chapter of the story.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.976
So what all of these death row inmates
had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.720
to handle their legal proceedings.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.736
The problem is that there were
way more guys on death row

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.016
than there were lawyers

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.776
who had both the interest
and the expertise to work on these cases.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.460
And so inevitably,

00:04:40.484 --> 00:04:44.416
lawyers drifted to cases
that were already in chapter four --

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.816
that makes sense, of course.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.816
Those are the cases that are most urgent;

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.324
those are the guys
who are closest to being executed.

00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:52.165
Some of these lawyers were successful;

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.496
they managed to get
new trials for their clients.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.376
Others of them managed
to extend the lives of their clients,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.296
sometimes by years, sometimes by months.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.736
But the one thing that didn't happen

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.696
was that there was never
a serious and sustained decline

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.496
in the number of annual
executions in Texas.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.456
In fact, as you can see from this graph,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.856
from the time that the Texas
execution apparatus got efficient

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.936
in the mid- to late 1990s,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.770
there have only been a couple of years

00:05:18.794 --> 00:05:22.274
where the number of annual
executions dipped below 20.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.936
In a typical year in Texas,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.856
we're averaging about two people a month.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.056
In some years in Texas,
we've executed close to 40 people,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.096
and this number has never significantly
declined over the last 15 years.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.496
And yet, at the same time
that we continue to execute

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.776
about the same number
of people every year,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.656
the number of people who we're
sentencing to death on an annual basis

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.280
has dropped rather steeply.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.896
So we have this paradox,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.136
which is that the number
of annual executions has remained high

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.176
but the number of new
death sentences has gone down.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.576
Why is that?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.456
It can't be attributed
to a decline in the murder rate,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.056
because the murder
rate has not declined nearly so steeply

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.520
as the red line
on that graph has gone down.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.416
What has happened instead

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.736
is that juries have started to sentence
more and more people to prison

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.056
for the rest of their lives
without the possibility of parole,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.760
rather than sending them
to the execution chamber.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.536
Why has that happened?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.696
It hasn't happened
because of a dissolution

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.896
of popular support for the death penalty.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.776
Death penalty opponents
take great solace in the fact

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.256
that death penalty support in Texas
is at an all-time low.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.416
Do you know what all-time low
in Texas means?

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.656
It means that it's in the low 60 percent.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.456
Now, that's really good
compared to the mid-1980s,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.136
when it was in excess of 80 percent,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.056
but we can't explain
the decline in death sentences

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.296
and the affinity for life
without the possibility of parole

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.696
by an erosion of support
for the death penalty,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.936
because people still support
the death penalty.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.040
What's happened to cause this phenomenon?

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.976
What's happened is that lawyers
who represent death row inmates

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.576
have shifted their focus
to earlier and earlier chapters

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.000
of the death penalty story.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.896
So 25 years ago,
they focused on chapter four.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.256
And they went from
chapter four 25 years ago

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.256
to chapter three in the late 1980s.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.776
And they went from chapter three
in the late 1980s

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.216
to chapter two in the mid-1990s.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.296
And beginning in the mid- to late 1990s,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.296
they began to focus
on chapter one of the story.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.216
Now, you might think
that this decline in death sentences

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.496
and the increase
in the number of life sentences

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.016
is a good thing or a bad thing.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.536
I don't want to have a conversation
about that today.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.816
All that I want to tell you
is that the reason that this has happened

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.816
is because death penalty lawyers
have understood

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.603
that the earlier you intervene in a case,

00:07:50.627 --> 00:07:54.040
the greater the likelihood that
you're going to save your client's life.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.416
That's the first thing I've learned.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.536
Here's the second thing I learned:

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.440
My client Will was
not the exception to the rule;

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.240
he was the rule.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.776
I sometimes say, if you tell me
the name of a death row inmate --

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.456
doesn't matter what state he's in,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.616
doesn't matter
if I've ever met him before --

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.212
I'll write his biography for you.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.416
And eight out of 10 times,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.160
the details of that biography
will be more or less accurate.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.736
And the reason for that is that 80 percent
of the people on death row

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.976
are people who came from the same sort
of dysfunctional family that Will did.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.176
Eighty percent of the people on death row

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.760
are people who had exposure
to the juvenile justice system.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.440
That's the second lesson
that I've learned.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.256
Now we're right on the cusp of that corner

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.080
where everybody's going to agree.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.016
People in this room might disagree

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.696
about whether Will
should have been executed,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.056
but I think everybody would agree

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.696
that the best possible
version of his story

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.920
would be a story
where no murder ever occurs.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.680
How do we do that?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.256
When our son Lincoln was working
on that math problem two weeks ago,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.576
it was a big, gnarly problem.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.056
And he was learning how,
when you have a big old gnarly problem,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.016
sometimes the solution
is to slice it into smaller problems.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.896
That's what we do for most problems --

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.056
in math, in physics,
even in social policy --

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.960
we slice them into smaller,
more manageable problems.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.136
But every once in a while,
as Dwight Eisenhower said,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.720
the way you solve a problem
is to make it bigger.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.936
The way we solve this problem

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.080
is to make the issue
of the death penalty bigger.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.136
We have to say, all right.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.200
We have these four chapters
of a death penalty story,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.760
but what happens before that story begins?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.680
How can we intervene
in the life of a murderer

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.600
before he's a murderer?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.976
What options do we have
to nudge that person off of the path

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.376
that is going to lead
to a result that everybody --

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.176
death penalty supporters
and death penalty opponents --

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.336
still think is a bad result:

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.320
the murder of an innocent human being?

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.816
You know, sometimes people say
that something isn't rocket science.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.136
And by that, what they mean
is rocket science is really complicated

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.656
and this problem that we're
talking about now is really simple.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.096
Well that's rocket science;

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.160
that's the mathematical expression
for the thrust created by a rocket.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.840
What we're talking about today
is just as complicated.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.960
What we're talking about today
is also rocket science.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.960
My client Will and 80 percent
of the people on death row

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.776
had five chapters in their lives

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.016
that came before the four chapters
of the death penalty story.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.696
I think of these five chapters
as points of intervention,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.376
places in their lives

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.976
when our society
could've intervened in their lives

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.976
and nudged them off of the path
that they were on

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.616
that created a consequence that we all --

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.536
death penalty supporters
or death penalty opponents --

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.240
say was a bad result.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.496
Now, during each of these five chapters:

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.456
when his mother was pregnant with him;

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.536
in his early childhood years;

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.136
when he was in elementary school;

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.502
when he was in middle school
and then high school;

00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:36.818
and when he was
in the juvenile justice system --

00:11:36.842 --> 00:11:38.517
during each of those five chapters,

00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:41.596
there were a wide variety of things
that society could have done.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.216
In fact, if we just imagine

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.936
that there are five
different modes of intervention,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.176
the way that society could intervene
in each of those five chapters,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.456
and we could mix and match them
any way we want,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.496
there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 --
possible strategies

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.816
that we could embrace

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.960
in order to nudge kids like Will
off of the path that they're on.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.056
So I'm not standing here today
with the solution.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.560
But the fact that we
still have a lot to learn,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.016
that doesn't mean
that we don't know a lot already.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.816
We know from experience in other states

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.616
that there are a wide variety
of modes of intervention

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.256
that we could be using in Texas,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.056
and in every other state
that isn't using them,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.706
in order to prevent a consequence
that we all agree is bad.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.600
I'll just mention a few.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.936
I won't talk today
about reforming the legal system.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.216
That's probably a topic

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.696
that is best reserved
for a room full of lawyers and judges.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.696
Instead, let me talk
about a couple of modes of intervention

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.816
that we can all help accomplish,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.602
because they are modes of intervention
that will come about

00:12:50.626 --> 00:12:54.696
when legislators and policymakers,
when taxpayers and citizens,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.776
agree that that's
what we ought to be doing

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.136
and that's how we ought
to be spending our money.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.176
We could be providing early childhood care

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.360
for economically disadvantaged
and otherwise troubled kids,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.736
and we could be doing it for free.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.423
And we could be nudging kids like Will
off of the path that we're on.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.960
There are other states
that do that, but we don't.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.176
We could be providing special schools,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.976
at both the high school level
and the middle school level,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.136
but even in K-5,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.136
that target economically
and otherwise disadvantaged kids,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.616
and particularly kids who have had
exposure to the juvenile justice system.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.776
There are a handful
of states that do that;

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.000
Texas doesn't.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.936
There's one other thing we can be doing --
well, there are a bunch of other things --

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.296
there's one other thing
that I'm going to mention,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.606
and this is going to be the only
controversial thing that I say today.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.976
We could be intervening
much more aggressively

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.176
into dangerously dysfunctional homes,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.136
and getting kids out of them

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.560
before their moms pick up butcher knives
and threaten to kill them.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.680
If we're going to do that,
we need a place to put them.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.216
Even if we do all of those things,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.416
some kids are going
to fall through the cracks

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.696
and they're going to end up
in that last chapter

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.256
before the murder story begins,

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.896
they're going to end up
in the juvenile justice system.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.960
And even if that happens,
it's not yet too late.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.376
There's still time to nudge them,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.376
if we think about nudging them
rather than just punishing them.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.496
There are two professors
in the Northeast --

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.176
one at Yale and one at Maryland --

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.240
they set up a school
that is attached to a juvenile prison.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.216
And the kids are in prison,
but they go to school

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.816
from eight in the morning
until four in the afternoon.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.536
Now, it was logistically difficult.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.816
They had to recruit teachers
who wanted to teach inside a prison,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.698
they had to establish strict separation

00:14:45.722 --> 00:14:48.976
between the people who work at the school
and the prison authorities,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.336
and most dauntingly of all,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.256
they needed to invent a new curriculum
because you know what?

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.346
People don't come into and out of prison
on a semester basis.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.136
(Laughter)

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.320
But they did all those things.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.480
Now, what do all of these things
have in common?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.440
What all of these things have in common
is that they cost money.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.696
Some of the people in the room
might be old enough

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.136
to remember the guy
on the old oil filter commercial.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.600
He used to say, "Well, you can pay me now
or you can pay me later."

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.400
What we're doing
in the death penalty system

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.640
is we're paying later.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.776
But the thing is
that for every 15,000 dollars

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.976
that we spend intervening

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.736
in the lives of economically
and otherwise disadvantaged kids

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.056
in those earlier chapters,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.120
we save 80,000 dollars
in crime-related costs down the road.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.424
Even if you don't agree that
there's a moral imperative that we do it,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.920
it just makes economic sense.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.391
I want to tell you about the last
conversation that I had with Will.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.360
It was the day that
he was going to be executed,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.096
and we were just talking.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.520
There was nothing left to do in his case.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.040
And we were talking about his life.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.600
And he was talking first about his dad,
who he hardly knew, who had died,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.800
and then about his mom,
who he did know, who was still alive.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.080
And I said to him,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.800
"I know the story.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.800
I've read the records.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.200
I know that she tried to kill you."

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.536
I said, "But I've always wondered

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.536
whether you really
actually remember that."

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.576
I said, "I don't remember anything
from when I was five years old.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.760
Maybe you just remember
somebody telling you."

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.776
And he looked at me and he leaned forward,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.176
and he said, "Professor," --

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.896
he'd known me for 12 years,
he still called me Professor.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.936
He said, "Professor,
I don't mean any disrespect by this,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.416
but when your mama
picks up a butcher knife

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.816
that looks bigger than you are,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.616
and chases you through the house
screaming she's going to kill you,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.936
and you have to lock yourself
in the bathroom

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.216
and lean against the door

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.680
and holler for help
until the police get there,"

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.936
he looked at me and he said,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.119
"that's something you don't forget."

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.176
I hope there's one thing
you all won't forget:

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.536
In between the time
you arrived here this morning

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.136
and the time we break for lunch,

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.616
there are going to be
four homicides in the United States.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.816
We're going to devote
enormous social resources

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.096
to punishing the people
who commit those crimes,

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.336
and that's appropriate

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.736
because we should punish
people who do bad things.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.193
But three of those crimes are preventable.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.136
If we make the picture bigger

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.520
and devote our attention
to the earlier chapters,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.816
then we're never going
to write the first sentence

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.600
that begins the death penalty story.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.896
Thank you.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.341
(Applause)
