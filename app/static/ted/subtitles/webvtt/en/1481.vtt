00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:04.167
Those of you who have seen the film "Moneyball,"

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:06.151
or have read the book by Michael Lewis,

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.287
will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane.

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:13.975
Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer; all the scouts told him so.

00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:15.168
They told his parents that

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:17.207
they predicted that he was going to be a star.

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:22.159
But what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way, he didn't

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.583
want to sign that contract, he wanted to go to
college --

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:27.240
which is what my mother, who actually does
love me,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.104
said that I should do too, and I did --

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:33.178
well, he didn't do very well. He struggled
mightily.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:37.711
He got traded a couple of times, he ended up in the Minors for most of his career,

00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.799
and he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:42.448
Oakland A's.

00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:46.872
Now for many of you in this room, ending up in management, which is also what I've done,

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:48.568
is seen as a success.

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:51.770
I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.479
going into management ain't no success story. It's a failure.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.918
And what I want to talk to you about today, and share with you, is that our

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:05.358
healthcare system, our medical system, is
just as bad at predicting

00:01:05.358 --> 00:01:09.550
what happens to people in it -- patients,
others --

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.163
as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane.

00:01:14.163 --> 00:01:16.844
And yet, every day

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.805
thousands of people in this country

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:22.731
are diagnosed with preconditions.

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.971
We hear about pre-hypertension, we hear about pre-dementia,

00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:32.307
we hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with

00:01:32.307 --> 00:01:33.684
that in the green room.

00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:38.037
We also refer to subclinical conditions.

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:42.588
There's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries,

00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:46.123
obviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.

00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:49.556
One of my favorites is called
subclinical acne.

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:53.523
If you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did,

00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:57.652
which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.

00:01:57.652 --> 00:02:04.267
You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:07.923
Maybe that's because you don't actually
have acne.

00:02:07.923 --> 00:02:14.446
I have a name for all of these conditions, it's another precondition:

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.301
I call them preposterous.

00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:22.360
In baseball, the game follows the pre-game.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.765
Season follows the pre-season.

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:29.288
But with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the

00:02:29.288 --> 00:02:33.861
case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases.

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:35.679
We have pre-cancerous lesions,

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.172
which often don't turn into cancer.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:41.028
And yet,

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:44.954
if you take, for example, subclinical
osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease,

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:46.607
the precondition,

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:49.014
otherwise known as osteopenia,

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:52.684
you would have to treat 270
women for three years

00:02:52.684 --> 00:02:54.884
in order to prevent one broken bone.

00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:56.493
That's an awful lot of women

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:59.420
when you multiply by the number of women
who were diagnosed

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.309
with this osteopenia.

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.365
And so is it any wonder,

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:05.895
given all of the costs and the side effects

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:10.099
of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions, that every year

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.772
we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:17.059
100,000 people a year -- and that's a conservative estimate -- are dying

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.972
not because of the conditions they have,

00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:23.259
but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments?

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.071
We've medicalized everything

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.040
in this country.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.423
Women in the audience, I have
some

00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:32.422
pretty bad news that you already know,

00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:35.079
and that's that every aspect of your
life

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.487
has been medicalized.

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.911
Strike one is when you hit puberty.

00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:43.247
You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.

00:03:43.247 --> 00:03:44.063
It's a condition;

00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:45.623
it has to be treated. Strike two

00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:47.223
is if you get pregnant.

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:50.319
That's been medicalized as
well.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.239
You have to have a high-tech experience

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.967
of pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:58.574
Strike three is menopause.

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:02.911
We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy

00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:05.957
for menopausal symptoms

00:04:05.957 --> 00:04:10.387
for decades until all of a sudden we realized, because a study came out, a big one,

00:04:10.387 --> 00:04:11.395
NIH-funded.

00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:12.323
It said,

00:04:12.323 --> 00:04:16.908
actually, a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good

00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:18.692
for many of those women.

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:20.940
Just in case,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.572
I don't want to leave the men out --

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:24.188
I am one, after all --

00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:26.877
I have really bad news for all of you in
this room,

00:04:26.877 --> 00:04:27.837
and for everyone

00:04:27.837 --> 00:04:29.583
listening and watching elsewhere:

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:30.796
You all have

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:33.732
a universally fatal condition.

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:37.040
So, just take a moment.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.372
It's called pre-death.

00:04:38.372 --> 00:04:43.444
Every single one of you has it, because
you have the risk factor for it,

00:04:43.444 --> 00:04:45.188
which is being alive.

00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:48.246
But I have some good news for you,
because

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:52.276
I'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.

00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:56.205
And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which

00:04:56.205 --> 00:04:58.797
we'll see if that happens for everyone,

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:02.092
you will be a pre-vivor.

00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:06.908
I made up pre-death.

00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:11.020
If I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.605
I think I made it up.

00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:14.172
I didn't make up pre-vivor.

00:05:14.172 --> 00:05:19.644
Pre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who

00:05:19.644 --> 00:05:20.916
just has a risk factor,

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.438
but hasn't actually had that cancer,

00:05:23.438 --> 00:05:24.812
to call themselves.

00:05:24.812 --> 00:05:26.387
You are a pre-vivor.

00:05:26.387 --> 00:05:30.860
We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.365
audience, I'd like to suggest

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:36.572
a reality TV show called "Pre-vivor."

00:05:36.572 --> 00:05:40.073
If you develop a disease, you're off
the island.

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:45.208
But the problem is, we have a system

00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:47.080
that is completely --

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.007
basically promoted this.

00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:51.873
We've selected, at every point in this system,

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:55.860
to do what we do, and to give everyone a
precondition and then eventually

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.839
a condition, in some cases.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.332
Start with the doctor-patient
relationship. Doctors, most of them,

00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:07.358
are in a fee-for-service system. They are
basically incentivized to do more --

00:06:07.358 --> 00:06:09.015
procedures, tests,

00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:10.681
prescribe medications.

00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:12.046
Patients come to them,

00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:16.046
they want to do something. We're
Americans, we can't just stand

00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:18.927
there, we have to do something. And so
they want a drug.

00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:22.702
They want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how

00:06:22.702 --> 00:06:25.022
you treat it. If the doctor
doesn't give you that,

00:06:25.022 --> 00:06:26.846
you go somewhere else.

00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:28.726
That's not very good for doctors'
business.

00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:30.414
Or even worse,

00:06:30.414 --> 00:06:34.373
if you are diagnosed with something
eventually, and the doctor didn't order that test,

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:36.597
you get sued.

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:39.629
We have pharmaceutical companies that are
constantly trying to expand

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:44.973
the indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment,

00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:47.766
because that obviously helps their bottom line.
We have advocacy groups,

00:06:47.766 --> 00:06:50.021
like the one that's come up with
pre-vivor,

00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:54.261
who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk, or might have a condition,

00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:56.390
so that they can raise more funds

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.005
and raise visibility, et cetera.

00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:00.845
But this isn't actually,

00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:03.941
despite what journalists typically do,
this isn't actually about blaming

00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:05.229
particular players.

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:07.030
We are all responsible.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.472
I'm responsible.

00:07:08.472 --> 00:07:11.510
I actually root for the Yankees, I mean talk
about

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.702
rooting for the worst
possible

00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:17.312
offender when it comes to doing
everything you can do.

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:18.849
Thank you.

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.813
But everyone is responsible.

00:07:22.813 --> 00:07:25.718
I went to medical school,

00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:30.470
and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.133
or How Not to Order Tests.

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:34.784
We have this system

00:07:34.784 --> 00:07:37.301
where that's what you do.

00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:39.926
And it actually took being a journalist

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:43.829
to understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say,

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.048
there are no bad people,

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.925
there are just bad incentives.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.533
And that's actually true.

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:51.990
Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams, when it comes to medical technology.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.300
So when you put another MRI in
every corner, you put a robot

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.838
in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.

00:08:00.838 --> 00:08:04.654
Well, we've created a system where if you
build it, they will come.

00:08:04.654 --> 00:08:08.181
But you can actually perversely

00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:10.965
tell people to come, convince them

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:12.654
that they have to come.

00:08:12.654 --> 00:08:17.279
It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem,

00:08:17.462 --> 00:08:19.486
and how we all are part of this problem.

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:23.142
I was medicalizing every risk factor, I was writing stories, commissioning stories,

00:08:23.142 --> 00:08:26.535
every day, that were trying to,

00:08:26.535 --> 00:08:29.532
not necessarily make people worried, although that was what often happened.

00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:32.555
But, you know, there are ways out.

00:08:32.555 --> 00:08:34.427
I saw my own internist last week,

00:08:34.427 --> 00:08:36.959
and he said to me,

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:39.476
"You know," and he told me something that

00:08:39.476 --> 00:08:41.950
everyone in this audience could have
told me for free,

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.438
but I paid him for the privilege, which
is that

00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.107
I need to lose some weight.

00:08:46.107 --> 00:08:50.564
Well, he's right. I've had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure

00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:52.277
for a dozen years now, same

00:08:52.277 --> 00:08:54.051
age my father got it,

00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:57.838
and it's a real disease. It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual

00:08:57.838 --> 00:08:59.811
hypertension, high blood pressure.

00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:00.796
Well, he's right,

00:09:00.796 --> 00:09:03.876
but he didn't say to me,

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.563
well, you have pre-obesity or

00:09:05.563 --> 00:09:08.908
you have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say,

00:09:08.908 --> 00:09:12.284
better start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol.

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:15.443
No, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit,

00:09:15.443 --> 00:09:17.444
or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."

00:09:17.444 --> 00:09:19.484
So that's, to me,

00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:21.115
a way forward.

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:23.479
Billy Beane, by the way, learned the same
thing.

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.015
He learned,

00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:28.532
from watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him,

00:09:28.532 --> 00:09:33.407
that it wasn't swinging for the fences, it
wasn't swinging at every pitch

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:38.167
like the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to --

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:39.516
they like to pick up those guys.

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:44.105
This kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find

00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:45.344
the guys who like to walk,

00:09:45.344 --> 00:09:47.048
because getting on base by a walk

00:09:47.048 --> 00:09:49.816
is just as good, and in our healthcare
system

00:09:49.816 --> 00:09:51.256
we need to figure out,

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:52.832
is that really a good pitch

00:09:52.832 --> 00:09:55.750
or should we let it go by and not swing at everything?

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.525
Thanks.
