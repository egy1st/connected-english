00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.359
As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:11.718
And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the

00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:13.795
early part of the 20th century.

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:15.711
It used mirrors

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.509
to create the illusion of tiny people

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.549
performing on a miniature stage. Now, I won't use mirrors,

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:27.645
but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater.

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:34.108
So let the story begin.

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:39.046
On a dark and stormy night -- really! --

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:43.149
it was the 10th of July, 1856.

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.101
Lightning lit the sky,

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:47.188
and a baby was born.

00:00:47.188 --> 00:00:50.196
His name was Nikola,

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.840
Nikola Tesla.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.004
Let me show you.

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:04.552
Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:09.098
Nikola Tesla: The result is 118,236.

00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:13.671
Marco Tempest: Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:15.824
When a word was mentioned,

00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:16.887
an image of it

00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:20.088
instantly appeared in his mind.

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:25.800
Tree. Chair. Girl.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.983
They were hallucinations, which vanished

00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:30.832
the moment he touched them.

00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:34.400
Probably a form of synesthesia.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.824
But it was something

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:39.416
he later turned to his advantage.

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:43.403
Where other scientists would play in their laboratory,

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:47.522
Tesla created his inventions in his mind.

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:53.700
NT: To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.848
MT: And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.610
he would build them in his workshop.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.382
NT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments.

00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:08.139
I could picture them as real in my mind,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.669
and there I run it, test it and improve it.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.523
Only then do I construct it.

00:02:14.523 --> 00:02:15.620
MT: His great idea

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.771
was alternating current.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.275
But how could he convince the public that

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:25.309
the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.051
To sell his idea,

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:29.635
he became a showman.

00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:34.937
NT: We are at the dawn of a new age,

00:02:34.937 --> 00:02:37.164
the age of electricity.

00:02:37.164 --> 00:02:40.870
I have been able, through careful invention, to

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.330
transmit, with the mere flick of a switch,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.591
electricity across the ether.

00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:48.938
It is the magic of science.

00:02:48.953 --> 00:02:51.530
(Applause)

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.258
Tesla has over 700 patents to his name:

00:02:57.258 --> 00:03:03.106
radio, wireless telegraphy,

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:10.421
remote control, robotics.

00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:15.827
He even photographed the bones of the human body.

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:20.379
But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream:

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.651
harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls,

00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:30.147
and bringing light to the city.

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:37.331
But Tesla's success didn't last.

00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:39.804
NT: I had bigger ideas.

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:42.986
Illuminating the city was only the beginning.

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:47.730
A world telegraphy center -- imagine news,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.677
messages, sounds, images delivered to

00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:53.330
any point in the world

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.283
instantly and wirelessly.

00:03:57.283 --> 00:04:01.775
MT: It's a great idea; it was a huge project. Expensive, too.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:04.430
NT: They wouldn't give me the money.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.668
MT: Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets.

00:04:07.668 --> 00:04:11.891
NT: Yes, that was a big mistake.

00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.109
MT: Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered.

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.965
He became a recluse.

00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:19.765
Dodged by death,

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:21.509
he spent much of his time

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.437
in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:29.845
NT: Everything I did, I did for mankind,

00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:36.764
for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich,

00:04:36.764 --> 00:04:40.644
where products of intellect, science and art

00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:46.617
will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life.

00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:52.495
MT: Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of
January, 1943.

00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:54.646
His final resting place

00:04:54.646 --> 00:04:58.110
is a golden globe that contains his ashes

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.430
at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.943
His legacy is with us still.

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:09.155
Tesla became the man who lit the world,

00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:11.515
but this was only the beginning.

00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:14.899
Tesla's insight was profound.

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:19.818
NT: Tell me, what will man do when the forests disappear,

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:23.395
and the coal deposits are exhausted?

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:25.875
MT: Tesla thought he had the answer.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:33.086
We are still asking the question.

00:05:33.086 --> 00:05:35.300
Thank you.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.829
(Applause)
