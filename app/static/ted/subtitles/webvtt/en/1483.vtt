WEBVTT

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.474
Good evening.

00:00:02.474 --> 00:00:04.409
We are in this wonderful

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:06.289
open-air amphitheater

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:08.043
and we are enjoying ourselves

00:00:08.043 --> 00:00:09.745
in that mild evening

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:11.033
temperature tonight,

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:15.350
but when Qatar will host

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.892
the football World Cup

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:18.737
10 years from now,

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:20.209
2022,

00:00:20.209 --> 00:00:21.441
we already heard it will be

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.089
in the hot, very hot and sunny

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.433
summer months of June and July.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:29.746
And when Qatar has been assigned

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:31.377
to the World Cup all, many

00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:33.278
people around the world have been

00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:34.629
wondering, how would it be

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.852
possible that football players

00:00:36.852 --> 00:00:39.013
show spectacular football,

00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:40.218
run around in this desert

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:41.749
climate? How would it be

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:44.644
possible that spectators sit,

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.636
enjoy themselves in open-air

00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:50.845
stadia in this hot environment?

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:52.486
Together with the architects of

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.428
Albert Speer &amp; Partner, our engineers

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:56.284
from Transsolar have been

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:58.068
supporting, have been developing

00:00:58.068 --> 00:01:01.731
open-air stadia based on 100 percent

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:06.165
solar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.572
Let me tell you about that,

00:01:07.572 --> 00:01:09.236
but let me start with comfort.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.547
Let me start with the aspect

00:01:10.547 --> 00:01:12.253
of comfort, because many people

00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:15.275
are confusing

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.429
ambient temperature

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.157
with thermal comfort.

00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:20.685
We are used to looking at charts like

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.676
that, and you see this red line

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:24.028
showing the air temperature

00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:25.510
in June and July, and yes, that's right,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.781
it's picking up to 45 degrees C.

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:30.621
It's actually very hot.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:33.140
But air temperature is not

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.741
the full set of climatic

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:37.154
parameters which define comfort.

00:01:37.154 --> 00:01:39.045
Let me show you analysis

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:42.573
a colleague of mine did looking

00:01:42.573 --> 00:01:45.149
on different football, World Cups,

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.061
Olympic Games around the world,

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:48.357
looking on the comfort

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:49.788
and analyzing the comfort

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:52.588
people have perceived at these

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:54.292
different sport activities,

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:56.141
and let me start with Mexico.

00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:57.710
Mexico temperature has been, air

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.414
temperature has been something between

00:01:59.414 --> 00:02:02.461
15, up to 30 degrees C, and people

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:04.237
enjoyed themselves.

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:06.109
It was a very comfortable game

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.404
in Mexico City. Have a look.

00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:10.837
Orlando, same kind of stadium,

00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:13.398
open-air stadium. People have

00:02:13.398 --> 00:02:16.142
been sitting in the strong sun,

00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:17.989
in the very high humidity

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.104
in the afternoon, and they

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.910
did not enjoy. It was not comfortable.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.877
The air temperature was not too high, but it was not

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:25.725
comfortable during these games.

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:27.420
What about Seoul? Seoul, because

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.852
of broadcast rights, all the

00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:31.157
games have been in the late

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:32.684
afternoon. Sun has already been

00:02:32.684 --> 00:02:35.077
set, so the games have been

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.637
perceived as comfortable.

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:40.501
What about Athens? Mediterranean

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:42.790
climate, but in the sun it was

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.516
not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:47.157
And we know that from Spain,

00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:49.669
we know that "sol y sombra."

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.837
If you have a ticket, and you

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.549
get a ticket for the shade,

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.757
you pay more, because you're

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:59.518
in a more comfortable environment.

00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:00.797
What about Beijing?

00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:03.461
It's again, sun in the day

00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:05.189
and high humidity,

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.452
and it was not comfortable.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.732
So if I overlay, and if you

00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:09.421
overlay all these comfort

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:11.340
envelopes, what we see is,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.596
in all these places, air temperature has

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:17.430
been ranging something from 25

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.334
to 35, and if you go on

00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:22.093
the line, 30, of 30 degrees C

00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:23.542
ambient temperatures. If you

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:25.195
go along that line you see

00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:27.716
there has been all kind of

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:29.949
comfort, all kinds of perceived

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.758
outdoor comfort, ranging from

00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:32.943
very comfortable

00:03:32.943 --> 00:03:34.814
to very uncomfortable.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.663
So why is that?

00:03:37.663 --> 00:03:39.359
This is because there are

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.446
more parameters influencing

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:43.352
our thermal comfort, which is

00:03:43.352 --> 00:03:45.745
the sun, the direct sun,

00:03:45.745 --> 00:03:48.233
the diffuse sun, which is wind,

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:50.921
strong wind, mild wind, which is

00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.207
air humidity, which is

00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:55.436
the radiant temperature of the

00:03:55.436 --> 00:03:57.543
surroundings where we are in.

00:03:57.543 --> 00:03:59.224
And this is air temperature.

00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:00.203
All these parameters go into

00:04:00.203 --> 00:04:02.257
the comfort feeling of our

00:04:02.257 --> 00:04:03.890
human body, and scientists

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.243
have developed a parameter,

00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:07.746
which is the perceived

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:09.871
temperature, where all these

00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:12.127
parameters go in and help

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:15.034
designers to understand

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:17.168
which is the driving parameter

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:18.800
that I feel comfort or that

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.279
I don't feel comfort.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.912
Which is the driving parameter

00:04:21.912 --> 00:04:23.264
which gives me a perceived

00:04:23.264 --> 00:04:25.924
temperature? And these parameters,

00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:27.592
these climatic parameters are

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:31.752
related to the human metabolism.

00:04:31.752 --> 00:04:33.991
Because of our metabolism,

00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:35.944
we as human beings,

00:04:35.944 --> 00:04:37.584
we produce heat.

00:04:37.584 --> 00:04:39.099
I'm excited, I'm talking to you,

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.745
I'm probably producing

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:41.856
150 watts

00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:43.192
at the moment. You are sitting,

00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:44.880
you are relaxed, you're looking

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.227
at me. It's probably 100

00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:48.161
watts each person is producing,

00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:50.160
and we need to get rid of that

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.911
energy. I need, with my body,

00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:53.413
to get rid of the energy, and

00:04:53.413 --> 00:04:55.384
the harder it is for myself,

00:04:55.384 --> 00:04:57.464
for my body, to get rid of the

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.703
energy, the less comfort I feel.

00:04:59.703 --> 00:05:02.019
That's it. And if I don't

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:03.161
get rid of the energy,

00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:04.600
I will die.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.952
If we overlay what happens

00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:11.200
during the football World Cup,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.969
what will happen in June, July,

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:13.896
we will see, yes, air

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:15.776
temperature will be much higher,

00:05:15.776 --> 00:05:17.432
but because the games and

00:05:17.432 --> 00:05:19.952
the plays will be in the afternoon,

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:21.785
it's probably the same comfort

00:05:21.785 --> 00:05:23.432
rating we've found in other

00:05:23.432 --> 00:05:24.928
places which has perceived

00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:26.639
as non-comfortable.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.783
So we sat together with a team

00:05:28.783 --> 00:05:31.113
which prepared the Bid Book, or goal,

00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:33.888
that we said, let's aim

00:05:33.888 --> 00:05:35.847
for perceived temperature,

00:05:35.847 --> 00:05:38.490
for outdoor comfort in this range,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.161
which is perceived with a

00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:43.364
temperature of 32 degrees

00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:44.985
Celsius perceived temperature,

00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:47.145
which is extremely comfortable.

00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:49.738
People would feel really fine

00:05:49.738 --> 00:05:51.632
in an open outdoor environment.

00:05:51.632 --> 00:05:53.591
But what does it mean?

00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:55.640
If we just look on what happens,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.751
we see, temperature's too high.

00:05:57.751 --> 00:06:00.544
If we apply the best architectural design,

00:06:00.544 --> 00:06:02.008
climate engineering design,

00:06:02.008 --> 00:06:04.111
we won't get much better.

00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:06.832
So we need to do something active.

00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:08.702
We need, for instance, to bring

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.798
in radiant cooling technology,

00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:12.687
and we need to combine this

00:06:12.687 --> 00:06:14.904
with so-called soft conditioning.

00:06:14.904 --> 00:06:16.340
And how does it look like in a stadium?

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.668
So the stadium has a few

00:06:18.668 --> 00:06:20.413
elements which create that

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.655
outdoor comfort. First of all,

00:06:21.655 --> 00:06:23.891
it's shading. It needs

00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:26.205
to protect where the people

00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:27.869
are sitting against strong

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:29.068
and warm wind.

00:06:29.068 --> 00:06:30.707
But that's not all what we need

00:06:30.707 --> 00:06:33.718
to do. We need to use

00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:35.887
active systems.

00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:38.327
Instead of blowing a hurricane

00:06:38.327 --> 00:06:40.702
of chilled air through the stadium,

00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:42.450
we can use radiant

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.484
cooling technologies, like a

00:06:44.484 --> 00:06:46.684
floor heating system where water

00:06:46.684 --> 00:06:49.067
pipes are embedded in the floor.

00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:50.885
And just by using cold water

00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:52.213
going through the water pipes,

00:06:52.213 --> 00:06:53.869
you can release the heat

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:55.949
which is absorbed during the day

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.186
in the stadium, so you can

00:06:57.186 --> 00:06:59.069
create that comfort, and then by

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.629
adding dry air instead of

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.861
down-chilled air, the spectators

00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:05.743
and the football players can

00:07:05.743 --> 00:07:08.076
adjust to their individual

00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:09.853
comfort needs, to their

00:07:09.853 --> 00:07:11.509
individual energy balance.

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:13.486
They can adjust and find

00:07:13.486 --> 00:07:15.861
their comfort they need to find.

00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:20.317
There are 12 stadia probably

00:07:20.317 --> 00:07:22.277
to come, but there are

00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:24.596
32 training pitches where

00:07:24.596 --> 00:07:26.293
all the individual countries

00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:27.477
are going to train.

00:07:27.477 --> 00:07:29.374
We applied the same concept:

00:07:29.374 --> 00:07:31.604
shading of the training pitch,

00:07:31.604 --> 00:07:34.444
using a shelter against wind,

00:07:34.444 --> 00:07:36.333
then using the grass.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:38.853
Natural-watered lawn is a

00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:40.332
very good cooling source

00:07:40.332 --> 00:07:41.549
stabilizing temperature,

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:43.485
and using dehumidified air to

00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:44.564
create comfort.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:48.438
But even the best passive design

00:07:48.438 --> 00:07:49.184
wouldn't help.

00:07:49.184 --> 00:07:50.194
We need active system.

00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:51.244
And how do we do that?

00:07:51.244 --> 00:07:53.612
Our idea for the bid was

00:07:53.612 --> 00:07:55.349
100 percent solar cooling,

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:57.444
based on the idea that we use

00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:59.084
the roof of the stadia,

00:07:59.084 --> 00:08:01.027
we cover the roofs of the stadia

00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:02.619
with PV systems.

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:05.179
We don't borrow any energy

00:08:05.179 --> 00:08:06.603
from history.

00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:08.396
We are not using fossil energies.

00:08:08.396 --> 00:08:10.212
We are not borrowing energy

00:08:10.212 --> 00:08:11.268
from our neighbors.

00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:13.388
We're using energy we can harvest

00:08:13.388 --> 00:08:16.148
on our roofs, and also on the

00:08:16.148 --> 00:08:18.235
training pitches, which will be

00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:20.907
covered with large, flexible

00:08:20.907 --> 00:08:22.620
membranes, and we will see

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.324
in the next years an industry

00:08:24.324 --> 00:08:25.507
coming up with flexible

00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:27.132
photovoltaics, giving

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.909
the possibilities of shading

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.589
against strong sun and producing

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:33.084
electric energy in the same time.

00:08:33.084 --> 00:08:34.795
And this energy now is

00:08:34.795 --> 00:08:36.427
harvested throughout the year,

00:08:36.427 --> 00:08:37.995
sent into the grid,

00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:39.980
is replacing fossils

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.131
in the grid, and when I need it

00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:45.028
for the cooling, I take it

00:08:45.028 --> 00:08:46.845
back from the grid and I

00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:49.212
use the solar energy

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:51.284
which I have brought to the grid

00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:52.572
back when I need

00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:53.404
it for the solar cooling.

00:08:53.404 --> 00:08:54.827
And I can do that in the first

00:08:54.827 --> 00:08:55.875
year and I can balance that

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:57.179
in the next 10, and the next

00:08:57.179 --> 00:08:59.044
20 years, this energy,

00:08:59.044 --> 00:09:01.667
which is necessary to condition

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:03.366
a World Cup in Qatar,

00:09:03.366 --> 00:09:05.325
the next 20 years, this energy

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:07.906
goes into the grid of Qatar.

00:09:07.906 --> 00:09:09.119
So this -- (Applause)

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:10.223
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:12.904
This is not only useful

00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:14.879
for stadia. We can use that also

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:17.288
in open-air places and streets,

00:09:17.288 --> 00:09:18.471
and we've been working on

00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:19.840
the City of the Future

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.227
in Masdar, which is in the

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.487
United Emirates, Abu Dhabi.

00:09:22.487 --> 00:09:24.199
And I had the pleasure to work

00:09:24.199 --> 00:09:25.503
on the central plaza.

00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:27.638
And the same idea to use there,

00:09:27.638 --> 00:09:29.344
to create outdoor conditions

00:09:29.344 --> 00:09:30.495
which are perceived

00:09:30.495 --> 00:09:31.751
as comfortable. People enjoy

00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:33.951
going there instead of going

00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:35.720
into a shopping mall, which is

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.904
chilled down and which is

00:09:36.904 --> 00:09:38.983
cooled. We wanted to create

00:09:38.983 --> 00:09:40.520
an outdoor space

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.487
which is so comfortable that

00:09:42.487 --> 00:09:44.064
people can go there in the

00:09:44.064 --> 00:09:46.188
early afternoon, even in these

00:09:46.188 --> 00:09:48.180
sunny and hot summer months,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.526
and they can enjoy and meet there

00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:51.332
with their families. (Applause)

00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:52.679
And the same concept:

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:54.116
shade against the sun,

00:09:54.116 --> 00:09:55.387
shade against the wind,

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:59.211
and use, use and take advantage

00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:01.924
of the sun you can harvest

00:10:01.924 --> 00:10:03.019
on your footprint.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.028
And these beautiful umbrellas.

00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:09.316
So I'd like to encourage you

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:11.684
to pay attention to your

00:10:11.684 --> 00:10:13.348
thermal comfort, to your

00:10:13.348 --> 00:10:14.395
thermal environment,

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:17.084
tonight and tomorrow,

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:18.891
and if you'd like to learn more

00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:20.013
about that, I invite you

00:10:20.013 --> 00:10:21.292
to go to our website.

00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:23.436
We uploaded a very simple

00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:25.548
perceived temperature calculator

00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:26.540
where you can check out

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.955
about your outdoor comfort.

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:31.427
And I also hope that you

00:10:31.427 --> 00:10:32.749
share the idea that

00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:34.755
if engineers and designers

00:10:34.755 --> 00:10:36.267
can use all these different

00:10:36.267 --> 00:10:38.228
climatic parameters,

00:10:38.228 --> 00:10:41.235
it will be possible to create

00:10:41.235 --> 00:10:44.324
really good and comfortable

00:10:44.324 --> 00:10:45.604
outdoor conditions,

00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:48.733
to change our thermal perception

00:10:48.733 --> 00:10:50.611
that we feel comfortable

00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:52.699
in an outdoor environment,

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:55.091
and we can do that

00:10:55.091 --> 00:10:56.955
with the best passive design,

00:10:56.955 --> 00:11:00.131
but also using the energy source

00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:03.115
of the site in Qatar which is

00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:03.969
the sun.

00:11:03.969 --> 00:11:06.485
(Applause)

00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:08.010
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.714
Shukran. (Applause)
