00:00:01.086 --> 00:00:02.776
About 75 years ago,

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:05.335
my grandfather, a young man,

00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:07.246
walked into a tent

00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:08.743
that was converted into a

00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:10.454
movie theater like that,

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.654
and he fell hopelessly in love

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:13.983
with the woman he saw on the

00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:17.312
silver screen: none other than Mae West,

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:19.227
the heartthrob of the '30s,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.267
and he could never forget her.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.187
In fact, when he had his daughter

00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:25.379
many years later, he wanted to

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.795
name her after Mae West,

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:28.379
but can you imagine an Indian

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:29.915
child name Mae West?

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:31.601
The Indian family said, no way!

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.539
So when my twin brother Kaesava

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.049
was born, he decided to tinker

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:38.764
with the spelling of Keshava's name.

00:00:38.764 --> 00:00:42.475
He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E,

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:46.011
why can't Keshava be K-A-E?

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.251
So he changed Kaesava's spelling.

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:50.322
Now Kaesava had a baby boy

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:52.522
called Rehan a couple of weeks ago.

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:54.753
He decided to spell, or, rather,

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.833
misspell Raehan with an A-E.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.968
You know, my grandfather died

00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:00.328
many years ago when I was

00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:02.169
little, but his love for Mae

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:04.640
West lives on as a misspelling

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.416
in the DNA of his progeny.

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:09.560
That for me is successful legacy. (Laughs)

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.202
You know, as for me,

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:12.429
my wife and I have our own

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.037
crazy legacy project.

00:01:14.037 --> 00:01:16.229
We actually sit every few years,

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.602
argue, disagree, fight,

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:20.444
and actually come up with our

00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:22.460
very own 200-year plan.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.420
Our friends think we're mad.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.908
Our parents think we're cuckoo.

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:27.244
Because, you know, we both

00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:28.612
come from families that really

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:31.613
look up to humility and wisdom,

00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:33.244
but we both like to live

00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:34.581
larger than life.

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:36.091
I believe in the concept of

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.852
a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before

00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:40.165
you can become an ascetic.

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:41.660
This is me being a rock star,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.284
even if it's in my own house.

00:01:43.284 --> 00:01:44.548
You know?

00:01:44.548 --> 00:01:46.260
So when Netra and I sat down

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.716
to make our first plan

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:49.700
10 years ago, we said

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.804
we want the focus of this plan

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:53.620
to go way beyond ourselves.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.284
What do we mean by beyond ourselves?

00:01:56.284 --> 00:01:59.309
Well 200 years, we calculated,

00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:01.484
is at the end of our direct

00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:02.652
contact with the world.

00:02:02.652 --> 00:02:04.011
There's nobody I'll meet in

00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:06.324
my life will ever live beyond

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:08.228
200 years, so we thought

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.420
that's a perfect place where

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.332
we should situate our plan and

00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:13.060
let our imagination take flight.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.604
You know, I never really

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.292
believed in legacy. What am I

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:18.284
going to leave behind? I'm an artist.

00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:21.570
Until I made a cartoon about 9/11.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.218
It caused so much trouble for me.

00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:25.634
I was so upset.

00:02:25.634 --> 00:02:28.114
You know, a cartoon that was

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.778
meant to be a cartoon of the week

00:02:29.778 --> 00:02:33.010
ended up staying so much longer.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.164
Now I'm in the business of

00:02:35.164 --> 00:02:36.841
creating art that will

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.204
definitely even outlive me, and

00:02:39.204 --> 00:02:40.865
I think about what I want to

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:42.905
leave behind through those paintings.

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:44.897
You know, the 9/11 cartoon

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:48.193
upset me so much that I decided

00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:49.729
I'll never cartoon again.

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:50.945
I said, I'm never going to make any

00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:52.858
honest public commentary again.

00:02:52.858 --> 00:02:55.353
But of course I continued

00:02:55.353 --> 00:02:57.289
creating artwork that was honest

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.466
and raw, because I forgot about

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.684
how people reacted to my work.

00:03:01.684 --> 00:03:03.258
You know, sometimes forgetting

00:03:03.258 --> 00:03:06.249
is so important to remain idealistic.

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.986
Perhaps loss of memory is so

00:03:08.986 --> 00:03:10.929
crucial for our survival

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.298
as human beings.

00:03:12.298 --> 00:03:14.153
One of the most important things

00:03:14.153 --> 00:03:16.057
in my 200-year plan that Netra

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:18.443
and I write is what to forget

00:03:18.443 --> 00:03:19.756
about ourselves.

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:21.177
You know, we carry so much

00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:22.586
baggage, from our parents,

00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:24.594
from our society, from so many

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:28.338
people -- fears, insecurities -- and

00:03:28.338 --> 00:03:30.193
our 200-year plan really lists

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:33.245
all our childhood problems that we have to expire.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:34.746
We actually put an expiry date

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.220
on all our childhood problems.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.085
The latest date I put was,

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.846
I said, I am going to expire

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:44.389
my fear of my leftist, feminist

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.798
mother-in-law, and this

00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:49.920
today is the date! (Laughs)

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.511
She's watching. (Laughter)

00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:56.359
Anyway, you know, I really

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.359
make decisions all the time

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.944
about how I want to remember

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:03.216
myself, and that's the most important

00:04:03.216 --> 00:04:04.735
kind of decisions I make.

00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:06.607
And this directly translates

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:07.930
into my paintings.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.072
But like my friends, I can do

00:04:10.072 --> 00:04:11.648
that really well on Facebook,

00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:13.567
Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.000
Name it, I'm on it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.079
I've started outsourcing my

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.672
memory to the digital world,

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:20.112
you know? But that comes

00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:21.208
with a problem.

00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:22.839
It's so easy to think of

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.144
technology as a metaphor

00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:26.490
for memory, but our brains

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.437
are not perfect storage devices

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:29.236
like technology.

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:30.776
We only remember what we

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:32.031
want to. At least I do.

00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:34.534
And I rather think of our brains

00:04:34.534 --> 00:04:36.933
as biased curators of our

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:39.773
memory, you know? And if

00:04:39.773 --> 00:04:41.597
technology is not a metaphor for

00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:43.229
memory, what is it?

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.245
Netra and I use our technology

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.813
as a tool in our 200-year plan

00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:52.332
to really curate our digital legacy.

00:04:52.332 --> 00:04:55.349
That is a picture of my mother,

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.102
and she recently got a Facebook account.

00:04:58.102 --> 00:04:59.868
You know where this is going.

00:04:59.868 --> 00:05:01.702
And I've been very supportive

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:04.085
until this picture shows up

00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:05.652
on my Facebook page. (Laughter)

00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:08.909
And I actually untagged myself

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.373
first, then I picked up the

00:05:10.373 --> 00:05:11.732
phone. I said, "Mom, you will

00:05:11.732 --> 00:05:12.844
never put a picture of me

00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:14.133
in a bikini ever again."

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:17.061
And she said, "Why? You look

00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:19.180
so cute, darling." I said,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.973
"You just don't understand."

00:05:20.973 --> 00:05:22.956
Maybe we are among the first

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:24.277
generation that really understands

00:05:24.277 --> 00:05:26.468
this digital curating of ourselves.

00:05:26.468 --> 00:05:28.030
Maybe we are the first to even

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.268
actively record our lives.

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:31.820
You know, whether you

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.973
agree with, you know, legacy

00:05:33.973 --> 00:05:36.116
or not, we are actually leaving

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:38.469
behind digital traces all the time.

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.524
So Netra and I really wanted

00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:41.884
to use our 200-year plan

00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:44.061
to curate this digital legacy,

00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:45.900
and not only digital legacy

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.060
but we believe in curating

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.948
the legacy of my past

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.132
and future.

00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:51.965
How, you may ask?

00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:55.533
Well, when I think of the future,

00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.725
I never see myself moving forward

00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.757
in time. I actually see time

00:05:59.757 --> 00:06:01.829
moving backward towards me.

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:03.229
I can actually visualize

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.580
my future approaching.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.693
I can dodge what I don't want

00:06:06.693 --> 00:06:08.181
and pull in what I want.

00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:09.492
It's like a video game obstacle

00:06:09.492 --> 00:06:11.978
course. And I've gotten better and better

00:06:11.978 --> 00:06:13.811
at doing this. Even when I make

00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:15.844
a painting, I actually imagine

00:06:15.844 --> 00:06:17.875
I'm behind the painting,

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:19.058
it already exists, and

00:06:19.058 --> 00:06:20.274
someone's looking at it,

00:06:20.274 --> 00:06:21.364
and I see whether they're

00:06:21.364 --> 00:06:22.985
feeling it from their gut.

00:06:22.985 --> 00:06:24.218
Are they feeling it from their

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:26.884
heart, or is it just a cerebral thing?

00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:28.992
And it really informs my painting.

00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:30.183
Even when I do an art show,

00:06:30.183 --> 00:06:31.207
I really think about, what should

00:06:31.207 --> 00:06:32.759
people walk away with?

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.695
I remember when I was 19,

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:37.832
I did, I wanted to do my first

00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:41.032
art exhibition, and I wanted the

00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:42.439
whole world to know about it.

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:43.887
I didn't know TED then,

00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:45.888
but what I did was I closed

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:47.656
my eyes tight, and I started

00:06:47.656 --> 00:06:49.928
dreaming. I could imagine people

00:06:49.928 --> 00:06:51.471
coming in, dressed up, looking

00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:53.504
beautiful, my paintings with all

00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:56.215
the light, and in my visualization

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.071
I actually saw a very famous

00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:00.239
actress launching my show,

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:01.736
giving credibility to me.

00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:03.799
And I woke up from my

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.056
visualization and I said,

00:07:05.056 --> 00:07:06.792
who was that? I couldn't tell

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:09.031
if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha,

00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:11.240
two very famous Indian actresses,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.087
like the Meryl Streeps of India.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:15.447
As it turned out, next morning

00:07:15.447 --> 00:07:17.167
I wrote a letter to both of them,

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.120
and Shabana Azmi replied,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.887
and came and launched

00:07:20.887 --> 00:07:23.952
my very first show 12 years ago.

00:07:23.952 --> 00:07:26.184
And what a bang it started

00:07:26.184 --> 00:07:27.984
my career with! You know,

00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:30.400
when we think of time in this

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.719
way, we can curate not only the

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:36.236
future but also the past.

00:07:36.236 --> 00:07:38.440
This is a picture of my family,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.063
and that is Netra, my wife.

00:07:41.063 --> 00:07:42.695
She's the co-creator of my

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.176
200-year plan.

00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:46.215
Netra's a high school history

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:48.159
teacher. I love Netra,

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:49.976
but I hate history.

00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:51.888
I keep saying, "Nets, you live

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.535
in the past while I'll create

00:07:53.535 --> 00:07:55.536
the future, and when I'm done,

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:57.032
you can study about it."

00:07:57.032 --> 00:07:58.992
(Laughter)

00:07:58.992 --> 00:08:00.991
She gave me an indulgent smile,

00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:03.128
and as punishment, she said,

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:04.863
"Tomorrow I'm teaching a class

00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:07.024
on Indian history, and you are

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:08.472
sitting in it, and I'm grading you."

00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:10.815
I'm like, "Oh, God." I went.

00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:12.119
I actually went and sat in

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:14.312
on her class. She started by

00:08:14.312 --> 00:08:16.607
giving students primary source

00:08:16.607 --> 00:08:19.222
documents from India, Pakistan,

00:08:19.222 --> 00:08:21.471
from Britain, and I said,

00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:23.615
"Wow." Then she asked them to

00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:25.567
separate fact from bias.

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.359
I said, "Wow," again.

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:31.319
Then she said, "Choose your

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:34.623
facts and biases and create an

00:08:34.623 --> 00:08:36.902
image of your own story

00:08:36.902 --> 00:08:38.311
of dignity."

00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:41.566
History as an imaging tool?

00:08:41.566 --> 00:08:43.199
I was so inspired.

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:44.559
I went and created my own

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:46.136
version of Indian history.

00:08:46.136 --> 00:08:48.023
I actually included stories from

00:08:48.023 --> 00:08:49.045
my grandmother.

00:08:49.045 --> 00:08:50.204
She used to work for the

00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:51.772
telephone exchange, and she used

00:08:51.772 --> 00:08:52.899
to actually overhear conversations

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.068
between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:56.644
And she used to hear all

00:08:56.644 --> 00:08:57.779
kinds of things she shouldn't

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:00.285
have heard. But, you know,

00:09:00.285 --> 00:09:01.451
I include things like that.

00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:04.245
This is my version of Indian history.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:08.531
You know, if this

00:09:08.531 --> 00:09:10.645
is so, it occurred to me that

00:09:10.645 --> 00:09:12.868
maybe, just maybe, the primary

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:14.307
objective of our brains

00:09:14.307 --> 00:09:17.347
is to serve our dignity.

00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:19.355
Go tell Facebook to

00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:20.664
figure that out!

00:09:20.664 --> 00:09:23.284
Netra and I don't write our

00:09:23.284 --> 00:09:25.097
200-year plan for someone else

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.121
to come and execute it

00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:28.264
in 150 years. Imagine receiving

00:09:28.264 --> 00:09:30.161
a parcel saying, from the past,

00:09:30.161 --> 00:09:31.524
okay now you're supposed to

00:09:31.524 --> 00:09:32.489
spend the rest of your life

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.947
doing all of this. No.

00:09:33.947 --> 00:09:35.594
We actually write it only

00:09:35.594 --> 00:09:38.084
to set our attitudes right.

00:09:38.084 --> 00:09:41.924
You know, I used to believe

00:09:41.924 --> 00:09:43.324
that education is the most

00:09:43.324 --> 00:09:44.805
important tool to leave

00:09:44.805 --> 00:09:46.262
a meaningful legacy.

00:09:46.262 --> 00:09:47.786
Education is great.

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:49.435
It really teaches us who

00:09:49.435 --> 00:09:50.771
we are, and helps us

00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:52.090
contextualize ourselves

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.056
in the world, but it's really

00:09:54.056 --> 00:09:56.115
my creativity that's taught me

00:09:56.115 --> 00:09:57.892
that I can be much more

00:09:57.892 --> 00:10:00.083
than what my education told me I am.

00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:01.537
I'd like to make

00:10:01.537 --> 00:10:03.867
the argument that creativity is

00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:06.298
the most important tool we have.

00:10:06.298 --> 00:10:08.484
It lets us create who we are,

00:10:08.484 --> 00:10:10.395
and curate what is to come.

00:10:10.395 --> 00:10:13.635
I like to think -- Thank you.

00:10:13.635 --> 00:10:15.210
I like to think of myself

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.546
as a storyteller, where my past

00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:20.610
and my future are only stories,

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.899
my stories, waiting to be told

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:25.514
and retold. I hope all of you

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:27.458
one day get a chance to

00:10:27.458 --> 00:10:29.285
share and write your own

00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:30.650
200-year story.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.715
Thank you so much.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.898
Shukran! (Applause)
