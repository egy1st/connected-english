WEBVTT

00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.294
What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes,

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:08.110
and this is from a book I'm preparing called

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.535
"Letters to a Young Scientist."

00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:12.686
I'd thought it'd be appropriate to

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:17.775
present it, on the basis that I have had extensive experience

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.471
in teaching, counseling scientists across a broad array of fields.

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:26.870
And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.551
that teaching and counseling.

00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:31.449
So let me begin by urging you,

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.998
particularly you on the youngsters' side,

00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:35.974
on this path you've chosen,

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:37.878
to go as far as you can.

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:41.346
The world needs you, badly.

00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:45.864
Humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age.

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:48.343
There is going to be no turning back.

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:53.268
Although varying among disciplines -- say, astrophysics,

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:57.230
molecular genetics, the immunology, the microbiology, the public

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.424
health, to the new area of the human body as a symbiont,

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:05.905
to public health, environmental science.

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:09.021
Knowledge in medical science and science overall

00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.158
is doubling every 15 to 20 years.

00:01:12.158 --> 00:01:15.246
Technology is increasing at a comparable rate.

00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:18.230
Between them, the two already pervade,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.094
as most of you here seated realize,

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:23.479
every dimension of human life.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.535
So swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution,

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:33.262
so startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:37.710
its outcome even a decade from the present moment.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.407
There will come a time, of course,

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:43.158
when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge,

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:45.294
which actually began in the 1600s,

00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:48.110
has to peak and level off,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.358
but that's not going to matter to you.

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:50.672
The revolution is going to continue

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:53.630
for at least several more decades.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.374
It'll render the human condition

00:01:55.374 --> 00:01:57.720
radically different from what it is today.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.038
Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow

00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:08.863
and in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines.

00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:12.710
In time, all of science will come to be

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.166
a continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:21.366
That's why you need not just be training

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:25.806
in one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields,

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:29.494
related to and even distant from your own initial choice.

00:02:29.494 --> 00:02:33.439
Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning.

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.504
The search for knowledge is in our genes.

00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:40.016
It was put there by our distant ancestors

00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:41.639
who spread across the world,

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.334
and it's never going to be quenched.

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:46.527
To understand and use it sanely,

00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:50.486
as a part of the civilization yet to evolve

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:56.328
requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you.

00:02:56.328 --> 00:03:00.366
In education, medicine, law, diplomacy,

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:04.654
government, business and the media that exist today.

00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:09.614
Our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific

00:03:09.614 --> 00:03:12.710
literacy, which most badly lack today --

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.254
no applause, please.

00:03:14.254 --> 00:03:16.712
It will be better for all

00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:21.383
if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job.

00:03:21.383 --> 00:03:24.542
Therefore you will do well to act on the side,

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:27.247
no matter how far into the laboratory

00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:30.566
you may go, to serve as teachers

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:32.574
during the span of your career.

00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:34.649
I'll now proceed quickly,

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.838
and before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset

00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:41.270
and a potential barrier to a scientific career.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.750
If you are a bit short in mathematical skills,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.079
don't worry.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.590
Many of the most successful scientists

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.790
at work today are mathematically semi-literate.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.275
A metaphor will serve here:

00:03:55.275 --> 00:04:01.278
Where elite mathematicians and statisticians

00:04:01.278 --> 00:04:06.343
and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm

00:04:06.343 --> 00:04:10.046
of science, the remaining large majority of

00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:14.758
basic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be

00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:20.110
said to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.862
the frontiers, they cut the pathways,

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.598
they raise the buildings along the way.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.774
Some may have considered me foolhardy,

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:32.535
but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics

00:04:32.535 --> 00:04:34.598
when talking to candidate scientists.

00:04:34.598 --> 00:04:38.398
During 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard,

00:04:38.398 --> 00:04:42.515
I watched sadly as bright students turned away

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:45.439
from the possibility of a scientific career

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.167
or even from taking non-required courses in science

00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:50.998
because they were afraid of failure.

00:04:50.998 --> 00:04:54.358
These math-phobes deprive science and medicine

00:04:54.358 --> 00:04:57.607
of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent.

00:04:57.607 --> 00:05:01.558
Here's how to relax your anxieties, if you have them:

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:04.150
Understand that mathematics is a language

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.974
ruled like other verbal languages,

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.973
or like verbal language generally, by its own grammar

00:05:10.973 --> 00:05:12.878
and system of logic.

00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:15.736
Any person with average quantitative intelligence

00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:18.878
who learns to read and write mathematics

00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:25.630
at an elementary level will, as in verbal language, have little difficulty

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.694
picking up most of the fundamentals

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:33.031
if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science.

00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:36.814
The longer you wait to become at least semi-literate

00:05:36.814 --> 00:05:42.822
the harder the language of mathematics will be to master, just as again in any verbal

00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:45.799
language, but it can be done at any age.

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:47.510
I speak as an authority

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.361
on that subject, because I'm an extreme case.

00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:55.022
I didn't take algebra until my freshman year

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:57.053
at the University of Alabama.

00:05:57.053 --> 00:05:59.374
They didn't teach it before then.

00:05:59.374 --> 00:06:04.278
I finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at Harvard,

00:06:04.278 --> 00:06:08.904
where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students,

00:06:08.904 --> 00:06:11.334
little more than half my age.

00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:12.806
A couple of them were students

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:16.062
in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.

00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:21.318
I swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus.

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:24.414
I found out that in science and all its applications,

00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:28.376
what is crucial is not that technical ability,

00:06:28.376 --> 00:06:31.545
but it is imagination in all of its applications.

00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:35.879
The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.815
pictured by intuition.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:43.159
I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.191
from an ability to stand at a blackboard

00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:49.326
and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:51.182
and equations.

00:06:51.182 --> 00:06:56.614
They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work,

00:06:56.614 --> 00:07:01.174
during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.

00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:06.373
Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied

00:07:06.373 --> 00:07:07.790
for its own sake.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:13.431
Of foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge

00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:20.080
of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.520
you propose to enter.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.646
When something new is discovered,

00:07:23.646 --> 00:07:28.615
it's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.767
to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.

00:07:32.767 --> 00:07:35.319
If that step proves too difficult for

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:39.491
the person or team that made the discovery,

00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:44.790
a mathematician can then be added by them

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.087
as a collaborator.

00:07:47.087 --> 00:07:49.246
Consider the following principle,

00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:54.446
which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One:

00:07:54.446 --> 00:07:58.846
It is far easier for scientists

00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:03.415
including medical researchers, to require needed collaboration

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:05.533
in mathematics and statistics

00:08:05.533 --> 00:08:09.214
than it is for mathematicians and statisticians

00:08:09.214 --> 00:08:13.310
to find scientists able to make use of their equations.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.404
It is important in choosing the direction to take in science

00:08:17.404 --> 00:08:23.150
to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.790
and focus on that.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.486
Keep in mind, then, Wilson's Second Principle:

00:08:29.486 --> 00:08:34.022
For every scientist, whether researcher, technician,

00:08:34.022 --> 00:08:37.117
teacher, manager or businessman,

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:41.104
working at any level of mathematical competence,

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:44.558
there exists a discipline in science or medicine

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:48.494
for which that level is enough to achieve excellence.

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:51.054
Now I'm going to offer quickly

00:08:51.054 --> 00:08:53.462
several more principles that will be useful

00:08:53.462 --> 00:08:56.150
in organizing your education and career,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.535
or if you're teaching, how you might

00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:05.423
enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists.

00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:09.222
In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research,

00:09:09.222 --> 00:09:12.422
or to develop world-class expertise,

00:09:12.422 --> 00:09:17.750
take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.462
Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.998
are on hand.

00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:27.648
This is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement

00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:31.087
of broad training, or the value of apprenticing yourself

00:09:31.087 --> 00:09:35.550
in ongoing research to programs of high quality.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.278
It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:44.166
programs, and to make friends and colleagues of your age

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:46.022
for mutual support.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:48.710
But through it all, look for a way to break out,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.646
to find a field and subject not yet popular.

00:09:52.646 --> 00:09:56.423
We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine.

00:09:56.423 --> 00:10:01.534
There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur,

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:05.151
as measured in discoveries per investigator per year.

00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:06.758
You may have heard the

00:10:06.758 --> 00:10:10.518
military dictum for the gathering of armies:

00:10:10.518 --> 00:10:13.239
March to the sound of the guns.

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:19.749
In science, the exact opposite is the case: March away from the sound of the guns.

00:10:19.749 --> 00:10:22.454
So Wilson's Principle Number Three:

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:25.798
March away from the sound of the guns.

00:10:25.798 --> 00:10:27.662
Observe from a distance,

00:10:27.662 --> 00:10:29.759
but do not join the fray.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.127
Make a fray of your own.

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:36.382
Once you have settled on a specialty,

00:10:36.382 --> 00:10:41.662
and the profession you can love, and you've secured opportunity,

00:10:41.662 --> 00:10:46.943
your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it

00:10:46.943 --> 00:10:49.623
enough to become an expert.

00:10:49.623 --> 00:10:52.950
There are thousands of professionally delimited

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.426
subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry

00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:57.342
to biology and medicine.

00:10:57.342 --> 00:11:00.238
And on then into the social sciences,

00:11:00.238 --> 00:11:03.440
where it is possible in short time to acquire

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.014
the status of an authority.

00:11:06.014 --> 00:11:09.526
When the subject is still very thinly populated,

00:11:09.526 --> 00:11:12.147
you can with diligence and hard work become

00:11:12.147 --> 00:11:14.358
the world authority.

00:11:14.358 --> 00:11:18.319
The world needs this kind of expertise,

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:20.494
and it rewards the kind of people

00:11:20.494 --> 00:11:22.646
willing to acquire it.

00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:27.142
The existing information and what you self-discover

00:11:27.142 --> 00:11:31.253
may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect

00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:33.289
to other bodies of knowledge.

00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:35.158
Well, if that's the case,

00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:39.300
good. Why hard instead of easy?

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.155
The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four.

00:11:44.155 --> 00:11:47.574
In the attempt to make scientific discoveries,

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:49.567
every problem is an opportunity,

00:11:49.567 --> 00:11:51.062
and the more difficult the problem,

00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:53.822
the greater will be the importance of its solution.

00:11:53.822 --> 00:11:57.630
Now this brings me to a basic categorization

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.505
in the way scientific discoveries are made.

00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:03.869
Scientists, pure mathematicians among them,

00:12:03.869 --> 00:12:07.136
follow one or the other of two pathways:

00:12:07.136 --> 00:12:09.246
First through early discoveries,

00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:11.390
a problem is identified

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.222
and a solution is sought.

00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:15.751
The problem may be relatively small;

00:12:15.751 --> 00:12:21.172
for example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread?

00:12:21.172 --> 00:12:27.078
Or larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe?

00:12:27.078 --> 00:12:31.537
As the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered

00:12:31.537 --> 00:12:33.182
and other questions are asked.

00:12:33.182 --> 00:12:36.198
This first of the two strategies is like a hunter,

00:12:36.198 --> 00:12:40.447
exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry,

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:43.366
who finds other quarries along the way.

00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:46.198
The second strategy of research

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.990
is to study a subject broadly

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:52.766
searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena

00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:56.567
like a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance,"

00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:00.230
the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.614
any quarry worth taking.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.967
The search is not for the solution of the problem,

00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:07.174
but for problems themselves worth solving.

00:13:07.174 --> 00:13:09.166
The two strategies of research,

00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:12.351
original research, can be stated as follows,

00:13:12.351 --> 00:13:16.639
in the final principle I'm going to offer you:

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:20.903
For every problem in a given discipline of science,

00:13:20.903 --> 00:13:24.478
there exists a species or entity or phenomenon

00:13:24.478 --> 00:13:26.424
ideal for its solution.

00:13:26.424 --> 00:13:31.822
And conversely, for every species or other entity

00:13:31.822 --> 00:13:34.758
or phenomenon, there exist important problems

00:13:34.758 --> 00:13:42.335
for the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited.

00:13:42.335 --> 00:13:44.272
Find out what they are.

00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:47.407
You'll find your own way to discover,

00:13:47.407 --> 00:13:49.590
to learn, to teach.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.023
The decades ahead will see dramatic advances

00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:57.590
in disease prevention, general health, the quality of life.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:03.615
All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science

00:14:03.615 --> 00:14:05.198
behind it you will master.

00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:08.662
You have chosen a calling that will come in steps

00:14:08.662 --> 00:14:14.073
to give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived.

00:14:14.073 --> 00:14:16.686
And I thank you for having me here tonight.

00:14:16.686 --> 00:14:22.054
(Applause)

00:14:22.054 --> 00:14:23.326
Oh, thank you.

00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:30.482
Thank you very much.

00:14:30.482 --> 00:14:35.014
I salute you.
