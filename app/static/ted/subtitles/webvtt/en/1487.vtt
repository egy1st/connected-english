WEBVTT

00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:03.111
Everyone is both a learner

00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:04.623
and a teacher.

00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:07.079
This is me being inspired

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:08.270
by my first tutor,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.215
my mom,

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:11.838
and this is me teaching

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:13.791
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:15.031
to 200 students

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:16.303
at Stanford University.

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:17.759
Now the students and I

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:18.935
enjoyed the class,

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.351
but it occurred to me

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:22.062
that while the subject matter

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:23.351
of the class is advanced

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.039
and modern,

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.358
the teaching technology isn't.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.694
In fact, I use basically

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.064
the same technology as

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.694
this 14th-century classroom.

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:36.494
Note the textbook,

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.438
the sage on the stage,

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:41.337
and the sleeping guy

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:42.238
in the back. (Laughter)

00:00:42.238 --> 00:00:45.175
Just like today.

00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:48.286
So my co-teacher,

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:49.926
Sebastian Thrun, and I thought,

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:51.700
there must be a better way.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.354
We challenged ourselves

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:54.645
to create an online class

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:56.276
that would be equal or better

00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:58.612
in quality to our Stanford class,

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:00.822
but to bring it to anyone

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:02.452
in the world for free.

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:05.020
We announced the class on July 29th,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.229
and within two weeks, 50,000 people

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.636
had signed up for it.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.741
And that grew to 160,000 students

00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:14.805
from 209 countries.

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:16.613
We were thrilled to have

00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:17.734
that kind of audience,

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:20.373
and just a bit terrified that we

00:01:20.373 --> 00:01:22.684
hadn't finished preparing the class yet. (Laughter)

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:24.296
So we got to work.

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:25.932
We studied what others had done,

00:01:25.932 --> 00:01:28.255
what we could copy and what we could change.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.916
Benjamin Bloom had showed

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:32.725
that one-on-one tutoring works best,

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.853
so that's what we tried to emulate,

00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:36.293
like with me and my mom,

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:37.798
even though we knew

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:39.716
it would be one-on-thousands.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:41.917
Here, an overhead video camera

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:43.749
is recording me as I'm talking

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:45.428
and drawing on a piece of paper.

00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:47.837
A student said, "This class felt

00:01:47.837 --> 00:01:48.989
like sitting in a bar

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:50.468
with a really smart friend

00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:51.672
who's explaining something

00:01:51.672 --> 00:01:53.973
you haven't grasped, but are about to."

00:01:53.973 --> 00:01:56.089
And that's exactly what we were aiming for.

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:58.877
Now, from Khan Academy, we saw

00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:00.701
that short 10-minute videos

00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:02.477
worked much better than trying

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:04.548
to record an hour-long lecture

00:02:04.548 --> 00:02:06.965
and put it on the small-format screen.

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:09.157
We decided to go even shorter

00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:10.805
and more interactive.

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:13.052
Our typical video is two minutes,

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:14.804
sometimes shorter, never more

00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:17.493
than six, and then we pause for

00:02:17.493 --> 00:02:18.860
a quiz question, to make it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.738
feel like one-on-one tutoring.

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:23.140
Here, I'm explaining how a computer uses

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.388
the grammar of English

00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:26.565
to parse sentences, and here,

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:28.629
there's a pause and the student

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.866
has to reflect, understand what's going on

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:32.506
and check the right boxes

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:33.923
before they can continue.

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:36.371
Students learn best when

00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:37.619
they're actively practicing.

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.915
We wanted to engage them, to have them grapple

00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:42.883
with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize

00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:44.548
the key ideas themselves.

00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:46.260
We mostly avoid questions

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.971
like, "Here's a formula, now

00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:49.046
tell me the value of Y

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:50.258
when X is equal to two."

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:52.075
We preferred open-ended questions.

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:55.253
One student wrote, "Now I'm seeing

00:02:55.253 --> 00:02:57.115
Bayes networks and examples of

00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:58.683
game theory everywhere I look."

00:02:58.683 --> 00:03:00.421
And I like that kind of response.

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:02.227
That's just what we were going for.

00:03:02.227 --> 00:03:04.421
We didn't want students to memorize the formulas;

00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:05.611
we wanted to change the way

00:03:05.611 --> 00:03:06.701
they looked at the world.

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.027
And we succeeded.

00:03:08.027 --> 00:03:10.427
Or, I should say, the students succeeded.

00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:12.346
And it's a little bit ironic

00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:15.259
that we set about to disrupt traditional education,

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.275
and in doing so, we ended up

00:03:17.275 --> 00:03:18.859
making our online class

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.186
much more like a traditional college class

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:23.027
than other online classes.

00:03:23.027 --> 00:03:26.242
Most online classes, the videos are always available.

00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:28.059
You can watch them any time you want.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.346
But if you can do it any time,

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:31.851
that means you can do it tomorrow,

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:33.259
and if you can do it tomorrow,

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:35.421
well, you may not ever

00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.179
get around to it. (Laughter)

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:39.371
So we brought back the innovation

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:41.458
of having due dates. (Laughter)

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:42.770
You could watch the videos

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.682
any time you wanted during the week,

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:45.837
but at the end of the week,

00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:47.554
you had to get the homework done.

00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:49.467
This motivated the students to keep going, and it also

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:52.323
meant that everybody was working

00:03:52.323 --> 00:03:53.841
on the same thing at the same time,

00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:55.338
so if you went into a discussion forum,

00:03:55.338 --> 00:03:58.042
you could get an answer from a peer within minutes.

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:00.981
Now, I'll show you some of the forums, most of which

00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:03.747
were self-organized by the students themselves.

00:04:03.747 --> 00:04:06.971
From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, we learned

00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:08.967
the concept of "flipping" the classroom.

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:10.262
Students watched the videos

00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:11.850
on their own, and then they

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.560
come together to discuss them.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.717
From Eric Mazur, I learned about peer instruction,

00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:19.341
that peers can be the best teachers,

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:20.773
because they're the ones

00:04:20.773 --> 00:04:23.621
that remember what it's like to not understand.

00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:26.302
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that.

00:04:26.302 --> 00:04:28.701
Of course, we couldn't have

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.333
a classroom discussion with

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:31.879
tens of thousands of students,

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.365
so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums.

00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:38.413
And finally, from Teach For America,

00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:39.894
I learned that a class is not

00:04:39.894 --> 00:04:41.390
primarily about information.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.221
More important is motivation and determination.

00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:46.061
It was crucial that the students see

00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.861
that we're working hard for them and

00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.270
they're all supporting each other.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.238
Now, the class ran 10 weeks,

00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:56.149
and in the end, about half of the 160,000 students watched

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:57.712
at least one video each week,

00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:00.405
and over 20,000 finished all the homework,

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:02.069
putting in 50 to 100 hours.

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.622
They got this statement of accomplishment.

00:05:03.622 --> 00:05:05.741
So what have we learned?

00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:08.557
Well, we tried some old ideas

00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:10.214
and some new and put them together,

00:05:10.214 --> 00:05:12.296
but there are more ideas to try.

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:14.110
Sebastian's teaching another class now.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.478
I'll do one in the fall.

00:05:15.478 --> 00:05:19.238
Stanford Coursera, Udacity, MITx

00:05:19.238 --> 00:05:21.509
and others have more classes coming.

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:22.997
It's a really exciting time.

00:05:22.997 --> 00:05:24.469
But to me, the most exciting

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.445
part of it is the data that we're gathering.

00:05:27.445 --> 00:05:30.141
We're gathering thousands

00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:31.797
of interactions per student per class,

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:34.005
billions of interactions altogether,

00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.509
and now we can start analyzing that,

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:37.973
and when we learn from that,

00:05:37.973 --> 00:05:39.214
do experimentations,

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.454
that's when the real revolution will come.

00:05:41.454 --> 00:05:44.230
And you'll be able to see the results from

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.493
a new generation of amazing students.

00:05:46.493 --> 00:05:48.746
(Applause)
