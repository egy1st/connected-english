00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:05.051
As a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.

00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:07.592
I would watch Nova on PBS.

00:00:07.592 --> 00:00:10.545
Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:14.670
When I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.520
he gave me a book for my birthday.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.689
It was an astronomy book,

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.641
and I poured over that thing for hours on end,

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.241
and it was a combination of all these things

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:26.909
that inspired me to pursue space exploration

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.377
as my own personal dream, and part of that dream was,

00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:33.986
I always wanted to just fly around the solar system

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:37.383
and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:42.077
Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:44.259
and I found myself at NASA,

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.363
working for the jet propulsion laboratory,

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:49.058
and there our team was challenged

00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:53.447
to create a 3D visualization of the solar system,

00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:57.321
and today I want to show you what we've done so far.

00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.707
Now, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:04.513
you can do at home, because we built this

00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:07.323
for the public for you guys to use.

00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:09.244
So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.

00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:11.215
You can see the United States and California

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:13.994
and San Diego, and you can use the mouse

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:16.049
or the keyboard to spin things around.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.488
Now, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:22.499
has seen this before, but one thing we like to say

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.312
in our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:30.361
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.894
We go from this view out to the stars.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:36.821
So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show

00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:38.687
are the spacecraft,

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:41.432
so I'm going to bring the interface back up,

00:01:41.432 --> 00:01:44.154
and now you're looking at a number of satellites

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:45.091
orbiting the Earth.

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:48.373
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.

00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:50.691
We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites

00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:52.704
and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:55.203
If we did, it would be a complete mess,

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:57.259
because there's a lot of stuff out there.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.064
And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:04.329
for a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.355
any of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:10.591
So I'm going to find the International Space Station,

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:15.598
double-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.

00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:18.207
And now you're riding along with the ISS

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:21.402
where it is right now.

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:23.194
And the other cool thing is, not only can we

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:26.469
move the camera around, we can also control time,

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.582
so I can slide this jog dial here

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.877
to shuttle time forward, and now

00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:35.310
we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.763
and they get one every 90 minutes. (Laughter)

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:43.346
All right, so what about the rest of it?

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:45.987
Well, I can click on this home button over here,

00:02:45.987 --> 00:02:48.954
and that will take us up to the inner solar system,

00:02:48.954 --> 00:02:51.081
and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.

00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:53.624
You can see, there's Saturn, there's Jupiter,

00:02:53.624 --> 00:02:56.740
and while we're here, I want to point out something.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.297
It's actually pretty busy.

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:01.386
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:03.929
on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.911
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.

00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:09.873
We have Dawn orbiting Vesta,

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:11.883
and we have over here New Horizons

00:03:11.883 --> 00:03:14.341
on a straight shot to Pluto.

00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:16.296
And I mention this because

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:19.101
there's this strange public perception that

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:21.894
NASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying

00:03:21.894 --> 00:03:24.478
and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.

00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:29.057
Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration,

00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:31.656
and we have a lot of spacecraft out there.

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:33.929
Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment,

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:36.736
well at least with our own launch vehicles,

00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:38.980
but NASA is far from dead,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.310
and one of the reasons why we write a program like this

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.797
is so that people realize that there's so many other things

00:03:44.797 --> 00:03:46.488
that we're doing.

00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:48.210
Anyway, while we're here, again,

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.140
if you want to visit anything,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.057
all you need to do is double-click.

00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:54.627
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta,

00:03:54.627 --> 00:03:58.721
and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta,

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:00.911
and this is happening right now.

00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:05.118
I'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see

00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:08.426
Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons.

00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:12.218
You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:16.178
And just being able to visit different places

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:17.464
and go through different times,

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:20.559
we have data from 1950 to 2050.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.776
Granted, we don't have everything in between,

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:24.542
because some of the data is hard to get.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:28.457
Just being able to visit places in different times,

00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:32.125
you can explore this for hours,

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:34.081
literally hours on end,

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.959
but I want to show you one thing in particular,

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.344
so I'm going to open up the destination tab,

00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:42.731
spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1,

00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.731
and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.

00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:48.521
So now we've gone back in time.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.458
We're now riding along with Voyager 1.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.855
The date here is November 11, 1980.

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:57.184
Now, there's a funny thing going on here.

00:04:57.184 --> 00:04:59.377
It doesn't look like anything's going on.

00:04:59.377 --> 00:05:01.477
It looks like I've paused the program.

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:03.503
It's actually running at real rate right now,

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.503
one second per second, and in fact,

00:05:05.503 --> 00:05:09.061
Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at

00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:13.171
I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.

00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:15.874
It only looks like nothing's moving because, well,

00:05:15.874 --> 00:05:18.680
Saturn here is 700,000 miles away,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.522
and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.

00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:25.607
It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening.

00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:27.485
But to make it more interesting,

00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:30.331
I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch

00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:32.986
as Voyager 1 flies by Titan,

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:35.201
which is a hazy moon of Saturn.

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.505
It actually has a very thick atmosphere.

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:40.766
And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:44.655
I'm going to pull out, and I want to show you

00:05:44.655 --> 00:05:47.885
Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:50.135
There's a point to be made here.

00:05:50.135 --> 00:05:52.777
With a 3D visualization like this,

00:05:52.777 --> 00:05:56.558
we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.

00:05:56.558 --> 00:05:58.180
There's a whole story to tell here.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.036
And even better, because it's an interactive application,

00:06:01.036 --> 00:06:03.016
you can tell the story for yourself.

00:06:03.016 --> 00:06:05.221
If you want to pause it, you can pause it.

00:06:05.221 --> 00:06:06.708
If you want to keep going, if you want to change

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:09.032
the camera angle, you can do that,

00:06:09.032 --> 00:06:11.555
and because of that, I can show you

00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:14.376
that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:18.355
It actually flies underneath Saturn.

00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:21.725
Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn,

00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:24.636
Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.926
and out of the solar system,

00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:29.964
so if I just keep letting this go,

00:06:29.964 --> 00:06:34.621
you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.

00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:36.753
And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.

00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:39.661
I'm going to go back to today, now,

00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:43.307
and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:47.910
Right there, above, way above the solar system,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.450
way beyond our solar system.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.037
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:54.665
Now you know why, and to me,

00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:56.453
that's the point of this program.

00:06:56.453 --> 00:06:59.726
You can manipulate it yourself.

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:03.022
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:06.513
You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp."

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:07.935
Well, we're trying to give you

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:09.532
the solar system in your grasp — (Laughter) —

00:07:09.532 --> 00:07:11.081
and we hope once it's there,

00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:13.334
you'll be able to learn for yourself

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:15.528
what we've done out there, and what we're about to do.

00:07:15.528 --> 00:07:19.027
And my personal dream is for kids to take this

00:07:19.027 --> 00:07:21.712
and explore and see the wonders out there

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:24.721
and be inspired, as I was as a kid,

00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:26.279
to pursue STEM education

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.029
and to pursue a dream in space exploration.

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.251
Thank you. (Applause)
