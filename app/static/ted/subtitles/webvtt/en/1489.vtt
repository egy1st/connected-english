00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.013
Over the last two decades, India has become

00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:06.052
a global hub for software development

00:00:06.052 --> 00:00:10.079
and offshoring of back office services, as we call it,

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:15.099
and what we were interested in finding out was that

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.039
because of this huge industry that has started

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.050
over the last two decades in India,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.041
offshoring software development and back office services,

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:26.064
there's been a flight of white collar jobs

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:30.015
from the developed world to India.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:33.071
When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:37.001
to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.089
amongst the Western populations.

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.051
In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining

00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:48.087
trend for support for free trade in the West.

00:00:48.087 --> 00:00:51.086
Now, the Western elites, however, have said

00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:53.086
this fear is misplaced.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:56.008
For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:59.040
have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.074
called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book

00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:06.093
that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong

00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:09.067
because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:13.051
that everything that can be invented has been invented.

00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.037
In fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the West

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:18.010
ahead of the developing world,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.052
with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done

00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:24.025
in the developed world, and the less sophisticated,

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:25.083
shall we say, drudge work being done

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:28.099
in the developing world.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.031
Now, what we were trying to understand was,

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:35.007
is this true?

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.086
Could India become a source, or a global hub,

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:42.003
of innovation, just like it's become a global hub

00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:45.090
for back office services and software development?

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.072
And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam

00:01:49.072 --> 00:01:53.002
and I spent investigating this topic.

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.002
Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,

00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.043
in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:01.069
the Western innovative model, say,

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.027
"Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,

00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:08.053
if the Indians are so bloody smart?" (Laughter)

00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:10.088
So initially, when we started our research, we went

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.098
and met several executives, and we asked them,

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:15.027
"What do you think? Will India go from being a favored

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:18.027
destination for software services and back office services

00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:21.037
to a destination for innovation?"

00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:23.023
They laughed. They dismissed us.

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:26.030
They said, "You know what? Indians don't do innovation."

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.060
The more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.067
make good software programmers and accountants,

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:34.017
but they can't do the creative stuff."

00:02:34.017 --> 00:02:38.083
Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:41.033
and people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians.

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:44.094
It's really the rule-based, regimented education system

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:49.032
in India that is responsible for killing all creativity."

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.086
They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,

00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:53.085
go to Silicon Valley, and look at companies

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:56.051
like Google, Microsoft, Intel.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.005
So we started examining the R&amp;amp;D and innovation labs

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:01.057
of Silicon Valley.

00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:03.071
Well, interestingly, what you find there is,

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.064
usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:08.061
or the R&amp;amp;D center as they may call it,

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:12.024
and more often than not, it's an Indian. (Laughter)

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:15.027
So I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have been

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.062
educated in India, right?

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.018
You must have gotten your education here."

00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:22.004
It turned out, in every single case,

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:26.026
they came out of the Indian educational system.

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:28.075
So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:31.062
and the right question is, really, can Indians

00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:35.042
based out of India do innovative work?

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:37.070
So off we went to India. We made, I think,

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.092
about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,

00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:43.011
Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine

00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:48.036
what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.

00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:50.094
And what we found was, as we progressed in our research,

00:03:50.094 --> 00:03:53.090
was, that we were asking really the wrong question.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.065
When you ask, "Where are the Indian Googles,

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:59.099
iPods and Viagras?" you are taking a particular perspective

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.015
on innovation, which is innovation for end users,

00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:05.078
visible innovation.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:09.047
Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of you

00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:11.048
may have read the famous economist Schumpeter,

00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:13.055
he said, "Innovation is novelty

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:17.031
in how value is created and distributed."

00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:19.044
It could be new products and services,

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:21.077
but it could also be new ways of producing products.

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:24.091
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.

00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:28.077
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation,

00:04:28.077 --> 00:04:32.077
the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.

00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:35.038
When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,

00:04:35.038 --> 00:04:38.072
what we found was, India is well represented

00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:42.006
in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:45.026
is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:47.091
we called it "invisible innovation."

00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:50.078
And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation

00:04:50.078 --> 00:04:52.098
that are coming out of India.

00:04:52.098 --> 00:04:55.068
The first type of invisible innovation out of India

00:04:55.068 --> 00:04:58.057
is what we call innovation for business customers,

00:04:58.057 --> 00:05:01.042
which is led by the multinational corporations,

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:04.035
which have -- in the last two decades, there have been

00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:10.064
750 R&amp;amp;D centers set up in India by multinational companies

00:05:10.064 --> 00:05:14.086
employing more than 400,000 professionals.

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:19.012
Now, when you consider the fact that, historically,

00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:22.029
the R&amp;amp;D center of a multinational company

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:26.098
was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin

00:05:26.098 --> 00:05:30.088
of that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;amp;D centers

00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:33.025
of multinational corporations in India

00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:35.082
is truly a remarkable figure.

00:05:35.082 --> 00:05:38.005
When we went and talked to the people in those innovation

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:40.066
centers and asked them what are they working on,

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:42.076
they said, "We are working on global products."

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:45.039
They were not working on localizing global products

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.011
for India, which is the usual role of a local R&amp;amp;D.

00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:51.061
They were working on truly global products,

00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:55.037
and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,

00:05:55.037 --> 00:05:58.024
General Electric, Philips, have already answered

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:01.072
in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore

00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:05.067
and Hyderabad R&amp;amp;D centers they are able to produce

00:06:05.067 --> 00:06:08.069
products and services for the world.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.036
But of course, as an end user, you don't see that,

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:12.087
because you only see the name of the company,

00:06:12.087 --> 00:06:16.064
not where it was developed.

00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:19.048
The other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know,

00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:21.072
the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;amp;D center

00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:23.075
cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out

00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:26.010
of the U.S. R&amp;amp;D centers."

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.071
So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be

00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:30.008
one of the smartest people I know, said

00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:31.053
he's going to do a study.

00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:34.019
What he did was he looked at those companies

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.090
that had an R&amp;amp;D center in USA and in India,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.047
and then he looked at a patent that was filed

00:06:40.047 --> 00:06:43.018
out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same

00:06:43.018 --> 00:06:45.068
company's subsidiary in India,

00:06:45.068 --> 00:06:48.076
so he's now comparing the patents of R&amp;amp;D centers

00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:52.077
in the U.S. with R&amp;amp;D centers in India of the same company

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:55.007
to find out what is the quality of the patents filed

00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:56.094
out of the Indian centers and how do they compare

00:06:56.094 --> 00:06:59.073
with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?

00:06:59.073 --> 00:07:01.094
Interestingly, what he finds is

00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:04.065
— and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:07.055
is what we call forward citations: How many times

00:07:07.055 --> 00:07:11.072
does a future patent reference the older patent? —

00:07:11.072 --> 00:07:14.023
he finds something very interesting.

00:07:14.023 --> 00:07:16.091
What we find is that the data says

00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:20.010
that the number of forward citations of a patent filed

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.051
out of a U.S. R&amp;amp;D subsidiary is identical to the number

00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:27.023
of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary

00:07:27.023 --> 00:07:29.044
of the same company within that company.

00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:32.035
So within the company, there's no difference in the forward

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:34.086
citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.096
their U.S. subsidiaries.

00:07:35.096 --> 00:07:39.078
So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.

00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:42.033
The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:46.003
is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,

00:07:46.003 --> 00:07:49.005
where many companies today are contracting

00:07:49.005 --> 00:07:52.097
Indian companies to do a major part of their product

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:57.038
development work for their global products

00:07:57.038 --> 00:07:59.069
which are going to be sold to the entire world.

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:01.091
For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules

00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:04.051
are being developed, but you see a major part of that work

00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:07.006
is being sent to India.

00:08:07.006 --> 00:08:10.007
For example, XCL Technologies,

00:08:10.007 --> 00:08:12.099
they developed two of the mission critical systems

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:16.019
for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.091
one to avoid collisions in the sky,

00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:22.015
and another to allow landing in zero visibility.

00:08:22.015 --> 00:08:24.078
But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,

00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:27.016
you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation

00:08:27.016 --> 00:08:28.043
out of India.

00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:31.044
The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:34.043
is what we call process innovations, because of an injection

00:08:34.043 --> 00:08:37.016
of intelligence by Indian firms.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:41.042
Process innovation is different from product innovation.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:44.063
It's about how do you create a new product or develop

00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:46.063
a new product or manufacture a new product,

00:08:46.063 --> 00:08:48.067
but not a new product itself?

00:08:48.067 --> 00:08:53.077
Only in India do millions of young people dream

00:08:53.077 --> 00:08:57.096
of working in a call center.

00:08:57.096 --> 00:09:00.098
What happens — You know, it's a dead end job in the West,

00:09:00.098 --> 00:09:03.031
what high school dropouts do.

00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.043
What happens when you put hundreds of thousands

00:09:06.043 --> 00:09:09.059
of smart, young, ambitious kids

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:11.089
on a call center job?

00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:16.079
Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:20.009
and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:23.030
out of this process innovation comes product innovations,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.003
which are then marketed around the world.

00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:27.042
For example, 24/7 Customer,

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:29.071
traditional call center company, used to be a traditional

00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:31.055
call center company. Today they're developing

00:09:31.055 --> 00:09:35.000
analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.005
you pick up the phone, you can guess

00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:44.078
or predict what this phone call is about.

00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:47.028
It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process

00:09:47.028 --> 00:09:50.010
which was considered dead for a long time in the West.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.041
And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation

00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:56.002
coming out of India is what we call management innovation.

00:09:56.002 --> 00:09:57.075
It's not a new product or a new process

00:09:57.075 --> 00:10:00.010
but a new way to organize work,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.059
and the most significant management innovation to come

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:06.015
out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry

00:10:06.015 --> 00:10:08.080
is what we call the global delivery model.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.009
What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:14.059
to take previously geographically core-located tasks,

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:17.060
break them up into parts, send them around the world

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.061
where the expertise and the cost structure exists,

00:10:19.061 --> 00:10:22.044
and then specify the means for reintegrating them.

00:10:22.044 --> 00:10:24.057
Without that, you could not have any of the other

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.085
invisible innovations today.

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:29.049
So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding

00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:34.012
in our research is, that if products for end users

00:10:34.012 --> 00:10:37.041
is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,

00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:41.033
India is well represented in the invisible, large,

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:46.057
submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.

00:10:46.057 --> 00:10:51.053
Now, this has, of course, some implications,

00:10:51.053 --> 00:10:55.077
and so we developed three implications of this research.

00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:59.001
The first is what we called sinking skill ladder,

00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:01.073
and now I'm going to go back to where I started my

00:11:01.073 --> 00:11:04.095
conversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.

00:11:04.095 --> 00:11:08.008
Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,

00:11:08.008 --> 00:11:10.090
decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;amp;D,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.034
what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the

00:11:14.034 --> 00:11:17.042
bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:20.063
just like Tom Friedman would predict.

00:11:20.063 --> 00:11:23.035
Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung

00:11:23.035 --> 00:11:28.017
of the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;amp;D work,

00:11:28.017 --> 00:11:31.040
at some stage in the very near future you are going to have

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.054
to confront a problem,

00:11:33.054 --> 00:11:35.043
which is where does the next step

00:11:35.043 --> 00:11:38.069
of the ladder people come from within your company?

00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:41.059
So you have two choices then:

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:43.077
Either you bring the people from India into

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:46.068
the developed world to take positions in the next step

00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:49.042
of the ladder — immigration —

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.086
or you say, there's so many people in the bottom step

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:54.050
of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.073
why don't we move the next step to India?

00:11:58.073 --> 00:12:00.068
What we are trying to say is

00:12:00.068 --> 00:12:05.091
that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you --

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:08.061
it's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.034
and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that

00:12:11.034 --> 00:12:13.049
you can't be an investment banker

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:15.048
without having been an analyst once.

00:12:15.048 --> 00:12:17.075
You can't be a professor without having been a student.

00:12:17.075 --> 00:12:20.061
You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate.

00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:23.020
So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.047
at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.032
The second thing we bring up is what we call

00:12:29.032 --> 00:12:32.068
the browning of the TMT, the top management teams.

00:12:32.068 --> 00:12:35.032
If the R&amp;amp;D talent is going to be based out of India

00:12:35.032 --> 00:12:37.056
and China, and the largest growth markets

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:39.080
are going to be based out of India and China,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.053
you have to confront the problem that

00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:43.013
your top management of the future

00:12:43.015 --> 00:12:46.016
is going to have to come out of India and China,

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.099
because that's where the product leadership is,

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:50.015
that's where the important market leadership is.

00:12:50.015 --> 00:12:52.093
Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide,

00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:56.036
which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.

00:12:56.036 --> 00:13:00.042
India has the youngest growing population in the world.

00:13:00.042 --> 00:13:04.072
This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,

00:13:04.072 --> 00:13:07.011
there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.

00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:10.004
Indian institutes and educational system,

00:13:10.004 --> 00:13:12.097
with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students

00:13:12.097 --> 00:13:15.047
in the quantity and quality needed

00:13:15.047 --> 00:13:18.001
to keep this innovation engine going,

00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:21.022
so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,

00:13:21.022 --> 00:13:23.082
but in the end it does not absolve the government

00:13:23.082 --> 00:13:28.029
of the responsibility for creating this educational structure.

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:31.062
So finally, I want to conclude

00:13:31.062 --> 00:13:34.094
by showing you the profile of one company, IBM.

00:13:34.094 --> 00:13:37.031
As many of you know, IBM has always been considered

00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:39.029
for the last hundred years to be one of the most

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:40.056
innovative companies.

00:13:40.056 --> 00:13:43.031
In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.071
I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies

00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:49.041
in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.

00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:51.091
Here is the profile of employees of

00:13:51.091 --> 00:13:55.084
IBM over the last decade.

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:58.059
In 2003, they had 300,000 employees,

00:13:58.059 --> 00:14:02.068
or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000

00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:06.027
were in America, 9,000 were in India.

00:14:06.027 --> 00:14:11.030
In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.087
the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,

00:14:13.087 --> 00:14:17.014
whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.

00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:20.016
Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal

00:14:20.016 --> 00:14:22.048
this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates

00:14:22.048 --> 00:14:23.088
based on various sources.

00:14:23.088 --> 00:14:26.052
Here are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying

00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:27.098
this is the exact number, it's my best guess.

00:14:27.098 --> 00:14:29.060
It gives you a sense of the trend.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.023
There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which

00:14:34.023 --> 00:14:36.083
98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:40.039
and 150,000 are in India.

00:14:40.039 --> 00:14:43.051
So you tell me, is IBM an American company,

00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:47.057
or an Indian company? (Laughter)

00:14:47.057 --> 00:14:52.020
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)
