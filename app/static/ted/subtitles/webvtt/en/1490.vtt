00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:03.997
So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced

00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:05.746
that it is going out of print

00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:09.571
after 244 years, which made me nostalgic,

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:15.218
because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:16.467
back when I was a kid,

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:17.810
maybe 12 years old.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.450
And I wondered if I could update that game,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.466
not just for modern methods,

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.170
but for the modern me.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.306
So I tried.

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:26.613
I went to an online encyclopedia,

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:29.371
Wikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth."

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.037
You can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:34.515
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:36.006
You just have to read the article

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.594
until you find something you don't know,

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:41.699
and preferably something your dad doesn't even know.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.578
And in this case, I quickly found this:

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.874
The furthest point from the center of the Earth

00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:49.347
is not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought,

00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:52.643
it's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.

00:00:52.643 --> 00:00:56.163
The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun,

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:58.147
so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle,

00:00:58.147 --> 00:00:59.274
like some Earthlings.

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:04.164
And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes,

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.835
it's one degree away from the equator,

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:08.835
it's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:12.235
is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth.

00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:15.187
And it is really fun to say.

00:01:15.187 --> 00:01:16.130
So I immediately decided,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.027
this is going to be the name of the game,

00:01:18.027 --> 00:01:19.514
or my new exclamation.

00:01:19.514 --> 00:01:20.484
You can use it at TED.

00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:21.813
Chimborazo, right?

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:23.515
It's like "eureka" and "bingo" had a baby.

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.244
I didn't know that;

00:01:25.244 --> 00:01:26.874
that's pretty cool.

00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:28.539
Chimborazo!

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.164
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.

00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:35.051
You just have to find another term and look that up.

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.216
Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume

00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:38.851
and browsing through it alphabetically,

00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:39.890
maybe getting sidetracked,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.595
that was fun.

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:43.226
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:45.178
I can go literally anywhere in the world,

00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:46.907
I think since I was already in Ecuador,

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:49.618
I just decided to click on the word "tropical."

00:01:49.618 --> 00:01:54.859
That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.044
that encircles the Earth.

00:01:56.044 --> 00:01:58.505
Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:00.018
and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south,

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:00.826
that much I knew,

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:03.027
but I was surprised to learn this little fact:

00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:05.293
Those are not cartographers' lines,

00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:08.898
like latitude or the borders between nations,

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:11.629
they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt,

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.234
and they change.

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:15.884
They move; they go up, they go down.

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:19.083
In fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:21.723
have been steadily drifting towards the equator

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:24.220
at the rate of about 15 meters per year,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.386
and nobody told me that.

00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:26.210
I didn't know it.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.628
Chimborazo!

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:33.404
So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.

00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:37.203
Since I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest."

00:02:37.203 --> 00:02:39.486
Famous for its diversity, human diversity.

00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:45.012
There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet.

00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:49.490
They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.467
This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended."

00:02:54.467 --> 00:03:03.332
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.

00:03:03.332 --> 00:03:10.092
It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then

00:03:10.092 --> 00:03:12.027
coleoptera,

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:15.266
which turn out to be beetles.

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:17.490
Now I clicked on this on purpose,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.044
but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake,

00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:21.141
it does remind me, for the band, see "The Beatles,"

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:22.747
for the car see "Volkswagon Beetle,"

00:03:22.747 --> 00:03:25.484
but I am here for beetle beetles.

00:03:25.484 --> 00:03:29.354
This is the most successful order on the planet by far.

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:33.604
Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet,

00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:35.410
including plants, are beetles.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.593
That means the next time you are in the grocery store,

00:03:37.593 --> 00:03:39.795
take a look at the four people ahead of you in line.

00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:42.812
Statistically, one of you is a beetle.

00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:48.410
And if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.443
There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums.

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:56.524
There are predator beetles, that attack other insects

00:03:56.524 --> 00:03:58.307
and still look pretty cute to us.

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:01.811
There are beetles that roll little balls of dung

00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:05.106
great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings.

00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:08.890
This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri,

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.204
who renews the ball of the sun every morning,

00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:14.227
which is how that dung-rolling scarab

00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:19.595
became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:25.523
Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.

00:04:25.523 --> 00:04:28.106
Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles.

00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:33.418
Fireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well.

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:34.794
Like my next link:

00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:37.733
The chemical language of pheromones.

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:43.786
Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:47.466
Yeah.

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:50.554
(Laughter)

00:04:50.554 --> 00:04:52.626
And the link to aphrodisiac.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.290
Now that's something that increases sexual desire,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.491
possibly chocolate.

00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:59.994
There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine

00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:01.364
that might be an aphrodisiac.

00:05:01.364 --> 00:05:03.619
But as the article mentions,

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:04.834
because of enzyme breakdown,

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:09.004
it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.

00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:12.114
So those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment.

00:05:12.114 --> 00:05:15.924
The link I clicked on here,

00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:21.123
"sympathetic magic," mostly because I understand what both of those words mean.

00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:23.275
But not when they're together like that.

00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:26.266
I do like sympathy. I do like magic.

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:27.611
So when I click on "sympathetic magic,"

00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:32.416
I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:34.564
This is the boy in me getting lucky again.

00:05:34.564 --> 00:05:37.083
Sympathetic magic is imitation.

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:39.490
If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.924
That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.

00:05:43.924 --> 00:05:49.004
The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind.

00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:51.011
I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves.

00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:54.507
We've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork.

00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:59.506
Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands,

00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:01.827
usually the left hand.

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:06.290
We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.626
so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand

00:06:11.626 --> 00:06:13.612
or blow pigment on it from a tube,

00:06:13.612 --> 00:06:16.204
I can easily picture how he did it.

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:20.706
And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar

00:06:20.706 --> 00:06:24.038
right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand,"

00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:30.330
go to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.364
I've found in a long time. It's simply this:

00:06:32.364 --> 00:06:36.546
The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:40.219
Now that's embarrassing, because up until now,

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.419
every time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand,"

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.778
I've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that,

00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:48.364
I just don't know it's freaking name, right?"

00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:52.018
And the link I clicked on here,

00:06:52.018 --> 00:06:56.170
well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.420
I click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.411
Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller."

00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:05.915
He doesn't.

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:07.739
He lives in rainforests and savannas.

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:10.946
It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us,

00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:14.010
evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us,

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.684
and in some cases, he gets places before us.

00:07:17.684 --> 00:07:22.906
Like my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp.

00:07:22.906 --> 00:07:27.084
I click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact.

00:07:27.084 --> 00:07:28.284
He's born in Cameroon,

00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:32.044
which is smack in the middle of my tropics map,

00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:38.266
and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:41.219
In between those two landmarks in Ham's life,

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:43.755
he flew into space.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.992
He experienced weightlessness and re-entry

00:07:46.992 --> 00:07:49.563
months before the first human being to do it,

00:07:49.563 --> 00:07:52.427
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

00:07:52.427 --> 00:07:54.579
When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page,

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:57.498
I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature,

00:07:57.498 --> 00:07:59.035
huge in heroism.

00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:03.378
Top estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters,

00:08:03.378 --> 00:08:06.379
that is less than five and a half feet tall max,

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:09.185
possibly because he was malnourished as a child.

00:08:09.185 --> 00:08:11.730
Germans occupied Russia.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.827
A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household,

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.631
and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:21.178
Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hut

00:08:21.178 --> 00:08:24.684
would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule

00:08:24.684 --> 00:08:26.298
on the tip of a rocket

00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:29.786
who volunteered to be launched into outer space,

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:34.138
the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:35.486
And he didn't just leave it,

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:38.011
he circled it once.

00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:40.237
Fifty years later, as a tribute,

00:08:40.237 --> 00:08:44.164
the International Space Station, which is still up there tonight,

00:08:44.164 --> 00:08:48.244
synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit,

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:49.410
at the exact same time of day,

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.970
and filmed it,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.554
so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes

00:08:54.554 --> 00:08:58.063
of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride,

00:08:58.063 --> 00:08:59.204
possibly a lonely one,

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:01.484
the first person to ever see such a thing.

00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:02.907
And then when you've had your fill of that,

00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:05.524
you can click on one more link.

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:06.866
You can come back to Earth.

00:09:06.866 --> 00:09:09.027
You return to where you started.

00:09:09.027 --> 00:09:11.244
You can finish your game.

00:09:11.244 --> 00:09:14.834
You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know.

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:17.314
And for me, I quickly landed on this one:

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:22.330
The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.299
which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.731
This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy.

00:09:28.731 --> 00:09:29.978
I found it myself.

00:09:29.978 --> 00:09:32.253
It's got some math that I can do.

00:09:32.253 --> 00:09:34.378
I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it.

00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:39.867
What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball,

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:45.884
if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:50.560
and rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.084
fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea,

00:09:56.084 --> 00:09:59.285
you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball,

00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:03.178
it would be as smooth as a billiard ball,

00:10:03.178 --> 00:10:07.795
presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.

00:10:07.795 --> 00:10:10.586
That's pretty cool.

00:10:10.586 --> 00:10:12.530
I didn't know that.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.755
Chimborazo!

00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:15.644
Thank you.

00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:16.293
(Applause)
