00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.722
So a few weeks ago, a friend

00:00:02.722 --> 00:00:04.976
of mine gave this toy car to his

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:06.587
8-year-old son.

00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:09.408
But instead of going into a store and buying one,

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.203
like we do normally, he went to this

00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:14.118
website and he downloaded

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.287
a file, and then he printed it

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:18.142
on this printer.

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:20.121
So this idea that you can

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.068
manufacture objects

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:23.631
digitally using these machines

00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:25.309
is something that The Economist magazine

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.939
defined as the Third Industrial Revolution.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.782
Actually, I argue that there is another revolution

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.380
going on, and it's the one that has to do with

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.908
open-source hardware and the maker's movement,

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:40.667
because the printer that my friend used

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.284
to print the toy is actually open-source.

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:46.777
So you go to the same website, you can download all the files

00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:50.534
that you need in order to make that printer:

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:54.046
the construction files, the hardware, the software,

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:56.855
all the instruction is there.

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:58.975
And also this is part of a large

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.575
community where there are thousands of people

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:03.535
around the world that are actually

00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:05.078
making these kinds of printers,

00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:06.550
and there's a lot of innovation

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.464
happening because it's all open-source.

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:12.352
You don't need anybody's permission to create something great.

00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:14.713
And that space is like

00:01:14.713 --> 00:01:17.509
the personal computer in 1976,

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.866
like the Apples with the other companies are fighting,

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:22.248
and we will see in a few years,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.375
there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.

00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:29.184
Well, there's also another interesting thing.

00:01:29.184 --> 00:01:31.148
I said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:34.129
of this printer there is something I'm really attached to:

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:37.080
these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.287
powers this printer, is a project

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:41.710
I've been working on for the past seven years.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.271
It's an open-source project.

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:46.292
I worked with these friends of mine that I have here.

00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:48.946
So the five of us, two Americans, two Italians

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:51.927
and a Spaniard, we — (Laughter)

00:01:51.927 --> 00:01:55.002
You know, it's a worldwide project. (Laughter)

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:56.871
So we came together in this

00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:59.494
design institute called the Interaction Design Institute

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.643
Ivrea, which was teaching

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:03.941
interaction design, this idea that you can take

00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:06.492
design from the simple shape

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:08.269
of an object and you can move it

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.313
forward to design the way you interact with things.

00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.213
Well, when you design an object that's supposed to interact

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:15.021
with a human being, if you make a foam model

00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:17.844
of a mobile phone, it doesn't make any sense.

00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:19.350
You have to have something that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.857
actually interacts with people.

00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:24.976
So, we worked on Arduino and

00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:26.792
a lot of other projects there to

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:28.693
create platforms that would be

00:02:28.693 --> 00:02:30.877
simple for our students to use,

00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:33.338
so that our students could just build things that worked,

00:02:33.338 --> 00:02:37.396
but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month.

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:40.051
So how do I make something that even a kid can use?

00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:42.952
And actually, with Arduino,

00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:45.375
we have kids like Sylvia that you see here,

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.247
that actually make projects with Arduino.

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:49.855
I have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:52.674
stuff they built for Arduino that's really

00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:54.415
scary to see the capabilities

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:56.838
that kids have when you give them the tools.

00:02:56.838 --> 00:02:59.818
So let's look at what happens when you make a tool

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:02.662
that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly,

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.533
so one of the examples that I like to sort of

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:06.447
kick off this discussion is this

00:03:06.447 --> 00:03:08.177
example of this cat feeder.

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:10.744
The gentleman who made this project had two cats.

00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:12.478
One was sick and the other one

00:03:12.478 --> 00:03:14.856
was healthy, so he had to make

00:03:14.856 --> 00:03:16.544
sure they ate the proper food.

00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:18.703
So he made this thing that recognizes the cat

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:20.840
from a chip mounted inside

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.560
on the collar of the cat, and opens the door

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.304
and the cat can eat the food.

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:27.094
This is made by recycling an old CD player

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:29.301
that you can get from an old computer,

00:03:29.307 --> 00:03:32.763
some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs,

00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:35.551
and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something

00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:37.488
that you cannot find on the market.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:40.252
And I like this phrase: "Scratch your own itch."

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.847
If you have an idea, you just go and you make it.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.796
This is the equivalent of sketching on paper

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:47.368
done with electronics.

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:49.116
So one of the features that I

00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:50.944
think is important about our work

00:03:50.944 --> 00:03:53.716
is that our hardware, on top of

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:55.906
being made with love in Italy —

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:57.659
as you can see from the

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.688
back of the circuit — (Laughter)

00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:01.528
is that it's open,

00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:03.496
so we publish all the design

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:05.224
files for the circuit online,

00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:07.207
so you can download it and

00:04:07.207 --> 00:04:09.047
you can actually use it to

00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:11.680
make something, or to modify, to learn.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.949
You know, when I was learning about programming,

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.826
I learned by looking at other people's code,

00:04:14.826 --> 00:04:18.255
or looking at other people's circuits in magazines.

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:20.471
And this is a good way to learn,

00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.712
by looking at other people's work.

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:25.304
So the different elements of the project are all open,

00:04:25.304 --> 00:04:27.007
so the hardware is released

00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:29.071
with a Creative Commons license.

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:31.097
So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes

00:04:31.097 --> 00:04:33.236
like a piece of culture that you share

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:35.195
and you build upon, like it was

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:38.832
a song or a poem with Creative Commons.

00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:41.508
Or, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well.

00:04:41.508 --> 00:04:44.935
The documentation and the hands-on teaching

00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:48.518
methodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons.

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:50.521
Just the name is protected so

00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:53.267
that we can make sure that we can tell people

00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:55.907
what is Arduino and what isn't.

00:04:55.907 --> 00:04:57.579
Now, Arduino itself is made of

00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:59.819
a lot of different open-source components

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.570
that maybe individually are hard to use for

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.677
a 12-year-old kid, so Arduino

00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:06.530
wraps everything together into

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.796
a mashup of open-source technologies

00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:10.668
where we try to give them the

00:05:10.668 --> 00:05:12.875
best user experience to get something done quickly.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.746
So you have situations like this,

00:05:15.746 --> 00:05:17.684
where some people in Chile

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:20.476
decided to make their own boards instead of buying them,

00:05:20.482 --> 00:05:22.407
to organize a workshop and

00:05:22.407 --> 00:05:25.507
to save money. Or there are

00:05:25.507 --> 00:05:27.452
companies that make their own

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.221
variations of Arduino that fit

00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:30.972
in a certain market, and there's

00:05:30.972 --> 00:05:33.685
probably, maybe like a 150 of them

00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:35.477
or something at the moment.

00:05:35.477 --> 00:05:37.365
This one is made by a company

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:39.309
called Adafruit, which is run by

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:41.621
this woman called Limor Fried,

00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:43.228
also known as Ladyada, who is

00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:45.949
one of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.483
and the maker movement.

00:05:47.483 --> 00:05:50.437
So, this idea that you have a new, sort of

00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:53.221
turbo-charged DIY community

00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:54.901
that believes in open-source,

00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:57.101
in collaboration, collaborates

00:05:57.101 --> 00:05:59.542
online, collaborates in different spaces.

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:02.664
There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered

00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:04.204
all these people and sort of put them together

00:06:04.204 --> 00:06:06.636
as a community, and you see

00:06:06.636 --> 00:06:08.664
a very technical project explained in a

00:06:08.664 --> 00:06:11.521
very simple language, beautifully typeset.

00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:13.089
Or you have websites,

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.350
like this one, like Instructables,

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.354
where people actually teach each other about anything.

00:06:17.354 --> 00:06:19.099
So this one is about Arduino projects,

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.660
the page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.238
learn how to make a cake and everything else.

00:06:25.238 --> 00:06:28.038
So let's look at some projects.

00:06:28.038 --> 00:06:29.654
So this one is a quadcopter.

00:06:29.654 --> 00:06:31.369
It's a small model helicopter.

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:33.639
In a way, it's a toy, no?

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.932
And so this one was military technology

00:06:35.932 --> 00:06:37.853
a few years ago, and now it's

00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:40.495
open-source, easy to use, you can buy it online.

00:06:40.495 --> 00:06:44.413
DIY Drones is the community; they do this thing called ArduCopter.

00:06:44.413 --> 00:06:47.424
But then somebody actually launched this start-up called

00:06:47.426 --> 00:06:49.619
Matternet, where they figured out that you could

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:51.917
use this to actually transport

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:54.350
things from one village to another in Africa,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.918
and the fact that this was easy to find,

00:06:55.918 --> 00:06:58.530
open-source, easy to hack, enabled them

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.668
to prototype their company really quickly.

00:07:00.668 --> 00:07:03.357
Or, other projects. Matt Richardson: I'm getting a little sick

00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:06.613
of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over

00:07:06.613 --> 00:07:09.823
again, so I decided to do something about it.

00:07:09.823 --> 00:07:11.237
This Arduino project,

00:07:11.237 --> 00:07:14.599
which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime

00:07:14.612 --> 00:07:16.587
any of these over-exposed

00:07:16.587 --> 00:07:17.819
personalities is mentioned. (Laughter)

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:22.667
I'll show you how I made it. (Applause)

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:24.491
MB: Check this out.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:26.448
MR: Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier

00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:29.351
today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her —

00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:30.742
MB: Eh? (Laughter)

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.644
MR: It should do a pretty good

00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:34.311
job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details

00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:36.107
of Kim Kardashian's wedding.

00:07:36.107 --> 00:07:40.664
MB: Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here

00:07:40.664 --> 00:07:43.634
is that Matt found this module

00:07:43.634 --> 00:07:45.866
that lets Arduino process

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:47.755
TV signals, he found some code

00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:50.584
written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV,

00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:52.934
put it together and then created this great project.

00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:54.986
It's also used, Arduino's used,

00:07:54.986 --> 00:07:57.873
in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider.

00:07:57.886 --> 00:08:00.595
There's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of

00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:02.395
measuring some parameters.

00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:04.714
Or it's used for —

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:15.426
(Music)

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:17.867
So this is a musical interface

00:08:17.867 --> 00:08:19.986
built by a student from Italy,

00:08:19.986 --> 00:08:22.106
and he's now turning this into

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:23.964
a product. Because it was a

00:08:23.964 --> 00:08:26.195
student project becoming a product.

00:08:26.195 --> 00:08:28.139
Or it can be used to make an assistive device.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:30.129
This is a glove that understands

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:32.276
the sign language and transforms

00:08:32.276 --> 00:08:34.475
the gestures you make into sounds

00:08:34.475 --> 00:08:37.791
and writes the words that you're signing on a display

00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:39.137
And again, this is made of all different parts you can find

00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:42.086
on all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts,

00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.170
and you assemble it into a project.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.491
Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU,

00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:49.218
where they met with this boy

00:08:49.218 --> 00:08:52.235
who has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3,

00:08:52.236 --> 00:08:54.179
so they built this device that

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.626
allows the kid to play baseball

00:08:56.626 --> 00:08:58.523
although he has limited

00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:00.899
movement capability.

00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:03.049
Or you can find it in arts projects.

00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:05.364
So this is the txtBomber.

00:09:05.364 --> 00:09:07.001
So you put a message into this device

00:09:07.001 --> 00:09:09.844
and then you roll it on the wall, and it basically

00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:11.746
has all these solenoids

00:09:11.746 --> 00:09:13.538
pressing the buttons on spray cans,

00:09:13.538 --> 00:09:15.174
so you just pull it over a wall

00:09:15.174 --> 00:09:16.901
and it just writes on the wall

00:09:16.901 --> 00:09:19.363
all the political messages.

00:09:19.363 --> 00:09:21.994
So, yeah. (Applause)

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.034
Then we have this plant here.

00:09:24.034 --> 00:09:25.924
This is called Botanicalls,

00:09:25.924 --> 00:09:29.119
because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module

00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:31.720
in the plant, and it's measuring

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.235
the well-being of the plant,

00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:35.225
and it's creating a Twitter account

00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:38.754
where you can actually interact with the plant. (Laughter)

00:09:38.754 --> 00:09:40.684
So, you know, this plant

00:09:40.684 --> 00:09:43.163
will start to say, "This is really hot," or

00:09:43.163 --> 00:09:47.234
there's a lot of, you know, "I need water right now." (Laughter)

00:09:47.234 --> 00:09:50.657
So it just gives a personality to your plant.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:53.324
Or this is something that twitters when the

00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:55.290
baby inside the belly of a

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.898
pregnant woman kicks. (Laughter)

00:09:57.898 --> 00:09:59.489
Or this is a 14-year-old kid in

00:09:59.489 --> 00:10:01.609
Chile who made a system that

00:10:01.609 --> 00:10:03.933
detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter.

00:10:03.933 --> 00:10:06.421
He has 280,000 followers.

00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:08.565
He's 14 and he anticipated

00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:12.204
a governmental project by one year. (Applause)

00:10:12.204 --> 00:10:15.945
Or again, another project where,

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:17.691
by analyzing the Twitter feed

00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:19.627
of a family, you can basically

00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:22.369
point where they are, like in the "Harry Potter" movie.

00:10:22.369 --> 00:10:25.185
So you can find out everything about this project on the website.

00:10:25.185 --> 00:10:29.866
Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts. (Laughter)

00:10:29.866 --> 00:10:32.949
It's interesting how, in 2009,

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:35.331
Gizmodo basically defined,

00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:38.094
said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter,

00:10:38.094 --> 00:10:41.355
so it was — a lot changed in between. (Laughter)

00:10:41.355 --> 00:10:42.799
So very serious project.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:45.006
When the Fukushima disaster happened,

00:10:45.006 --> 00:10:48.008
a bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information

00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:50.563
that the government was giving wasn't really open

00:10:50.563 --> 00:10:52.313
and really reliable, so they built

00:10:52.313 --> 00:10:55.089
this Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network

00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:57.021
interface. They made 100

00:10:57.021 --> 00:11:00.586
of them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:02.859
the data that they gathered gets published on this website

00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:05.008
called Cosm, another website

00:11:05.008 --> 00:11:08.649
they built, so you can actually get reliable real-time

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:10.474
information from the field,

00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:14.081
and you can get unbiased information.

00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:15.964
Or this machine here, it's from

00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:18.404
the DIY bio movement,

00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:20.728
and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA,

00:11:20.728 --> 00:11:24.106
and again, it's completely open-source from the ground up.

00:11:24.106 --> 00:11:27.498
Or you have students in developing countries making

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.489
replicas of scientific instruments that cost

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:32.400
a lot of money to make.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.990
Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.223
using Arduino and a few parts.

00:11:36.223 --> 00:11:38.119
This is a pH probe.

00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:41.517
Or you get kids, like these kids, they're from Spain.

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:44.375
They learned how to program and to make robots when they

00:11:44.381 --> 00:11:47.050
were probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.043
to make these robots that play football. They became

00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:51.885
world champions by making an Arduino-based robot.

00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:53.761
And so when we had to make

00:11:53.761 --> 00:11:56.571
our own educational robot, we just went to them and said,

00:11:56.573 --> 00:11:58.921
you know, "You design it, because you know exactly

00:11:58.921 --> 00:12:02.651
what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids."

00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:04.327
Not me. I'm an old guy.

00:12:04.327 --> 00:12:06.863
What am I supposed to excite, huh? (Laughter)

00:12:06.863 --> 00:12:10.798
But as I — in terms of educational assets. (Laughter)

00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:12.696
There's also companies like Google

00:12:12.696 --> 00:12:14.647
that are using the technology

00:12:14.647 --> 00:12:17.521
to create interfaces between

00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:20.914
mobile phones, tablets and the real world.

00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:21.934
So the Accessory Development Kit

00:12:21.934 --> 00:12:23.986
from Google is open-source

00:12:23.986 --> 00:12:25.368
and based on Arduino, as opposed

00:12:25.368 --> 00:12:27.025
to the one from Apple which is

00:12:27.025 --> 00:12:29.529
closed-source, NDA, sign your

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:32.094
life to Apple. Here you are.

00:12:32.094 --> 00:12:34.674
There's a giant maze, and Joey's sitting there, and the

00:12:34.674 --> 00:12:38.858
maze is moving when you tilt the tablet.

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:41.829
Also, I come from Italy, and the design is important

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.177
in Italy, and yet very conservative.

00:12:44.177 --> 00:12:45.594
So we worked with a design

00:12:45.594 --> 00:12:47.760
studio called Habits, in Milan,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.448
to make this mirror, which is completely open-source.

00:12:50.448 --> 00:12:53.633
This doubles also as an iPod speaker.

00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:57.270
So the idea is that the hardware, the software,

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.738
the design of the object, the fabrication,

00:12:58.738 --> 00:13:01.223
everything about this project is open-source

00:13:01.223 --> 00:13:03.093
and you can make it yourself.

00:13:03.093 --> 00:13:05.447
So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how

00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:08.058
to make great devices, to learn

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:09.736
how to make interactive products

00:13:09.736 --> 00:13:12.505
by starting from something real.

00:13:12.505 --> 00:13:14.906
But when you have this idea,

00:13:14.906 --> 00:13:16.819
you know, what happens to all these ideas?

00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:18.697
There's, like, thousands of ideas that I —

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:20.857
You know, it would take seven hours for me to do

00:13:20.857 --> 00:13:22.737
all the presentations.

00:13:22.737 --> 00:13:25.785
I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you.

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:27.801
But let's start from this example:

00:13:27.801 --> 00:13:29.729
So, the group of people

00:13:29.729 --> 00:13:32.140
that started this company called Pebble, they prototyped

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.832
a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone,

00:13:35.832 --> 00:13:37.368
and you can display information

00:13:37.368 --> 00:13:39.640
on it. And they prototyped with

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.585
an old LCD screen from a Nokia

00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:43.993
mobile phone and an Arduino.

00:13:43.993 --> 00:13:45.826
And then, when they had a final

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:48.234
project, they actually went to Kickstarter

00:13:48.234 --> 00:13:50.853
and they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make

00:13:50.853 --> 00:13:52.708
a few of them to sell.

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:54.779
They got 10 million dollars.

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:56.314
They got a completely

00:13:56.314 --> 00:13:59.009
fully funded start-up, and they don't have to,

00:13:59.027 --> 00:14:00.879
you know, get VCs involved or anything,

00:14:00.879 --> 00:14:03.712
just excite the people with their great project.

00:14:03.747 --> 00:14:06.031
The last project I want to show you is this:

00:14:06.031 --> 00:14:09.769
It's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter,

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:12.076
so if you want to contribute, please do it.

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:14.886
It's a satellite that goes into space, which is probably

00:14:14.886 --> 00:14:16.808
the least open-source thing you can imagine,

00:14:16.808 --> 00:14:18.859
and it contains an Arduino

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:21.969
connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino,

00:14:21.969 --> 00:14:24.425
you can actually upload your experiments

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:26.616
into this satellite and run them.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:29.252
So imagine, if you as a high school can have the satellite

00:14:29.252 --> 00:14:31.601
for a week and do satellite

00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:34.253
space experiments like that.

00:14:34.253 --> 00:14:37.009
So, as I said, there's

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.568
lots of examples, and I'm going to stop here. And I just

00:14:38.568 --> 00:14:41.084
want to thank the Arduino community

00:14:41.084 --> 00:14:42.754
for being the best, and just

00:14:42.754 --> 00:14:44.946
every day making lots of projects.

00:14:44.946 --> 00:14:48.410
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.737
(Applause)

00:14:50.737 --> 00:14:53.224
And thanks to the community.

00:14:53.224 --> 00:14:55.197
Chris Anderson: Massimo,

00:14:55.197 --> 00:14:57.802
you told me earlier today that you had no idea, of course,

00:14:57.802 --> 00:14:59.274
that it would take off like this.

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:00.063
MB: No.

00:15:00.063 --> 00:15:01.859
CA: I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.360
see what you've unlocked?

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.176
MB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community

00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:08.973
are enabling people to make

00:15:08.973 --> 00:15:11.457
great stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed.

00:15:11.475 --> 00:15:13.644
It's just, it's difficult to describe this.

00:15:13.644 --> 00:15:15.658
Every morning, I wake up and I look at all the stuff that

00:15:15.658 --> 00:15:17.844
Google Alerts sends me, and it's

00:15:17.844 --> 00:15:19.379
just amazing. It's just

00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:22.052
going into every field that you can imagine.

00:15:22.052 --> 00:15:24.044
CA: Thank you so much. (Applause)

00:15:24.044 --> 00:15:27.306
(Applause)
