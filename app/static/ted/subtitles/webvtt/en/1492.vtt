WEBVTT

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.805
Openness. It's a word that

00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:06.884
denotes opportunity and possibilities.

00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:08.924
Open-ended, open hearth,

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:12.277
open source, open door policy,

00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:15.813
open bar. (Laughter)

00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:18.333
And everywhere the world is opening up,

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.833
and it's a good thing.

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:21.609
Why is this happening?

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.573
The technology revolution is opening the world.

00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:27.118
Yesterday's Internet was a platform

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:29.710
for the presentation of content.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.965
The Internet of today is a platform for computation.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.572
The Internet is becoming a giant

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:37.173
global computer, and every time you go on it,

00:00:37.173 --> 00:00:39.830
you upload a video, you do a Google search,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.484
you remix something,

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:44.031
you're programming this big global computer

00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:45.271
that we all share.

00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:48.505
Humanity is building a machine,

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:51.579
and this enables us to collaborate in new ways.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.895
Collaboration can occur on

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.869
an astronomical basis.

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.277
Now a new generation is opening up the world as well.

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:01.966
I started studying kids about 15 years ago,

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.925
-- so actually 20 years ago now --

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:05.520
and I noticed how my own children were

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.037
effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology,

00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:10.254
and at first I thought,

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:13.219
"My children are prodigies!" (Laughter)

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.345
But then I noticed all their friends were like them,

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:17.289
so that was a bad theory.

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.284
So I've started working with a few hundred kids,

00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:21.879
and I came to the conclusion

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:23.937
that this is the first generation to come of age

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:25.071
in the digital age,

00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:26.692
to be bathed in bits.

00:01:26.692 --> 00:01:29.028
I call them the Net Generation.

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:30.378
I said, these kids are different.

00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:33.256
They have no fear of technology, because it's not there.

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:34.717
It's like the air.

00:01:34.717 --> 00:01:38.540
It's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.070
And — (Laughter)

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.908
And there's no more powerful force to change

00:01:42.908 --> 00:01:47.616
every institution than the first generation of digital natives.

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:48.970
I'm a digital immigrant.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.911
I had to learn the language.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:55.180
The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.210
Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.579
everything from old models of the corporation,

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.060
government, media, Wall Street,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.636
are in various stages of being stalled or frozen

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:09.562
or in atrophy or even failing,

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:12.572
and this is now creating a burning platform in the world.

00:02:12.572 --> 00:02:14.401
I mean, think about Wall Street.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.612
The core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:20.110
global capitalism.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.673
Now, you know the idea of a burning platform,

00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:25.843
that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are

00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:29.044
become greater than the costs of moving to something different,

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:32.217
perhaps something radically different.

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:33.945
And we need to change

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.038
and open up all of our institutions.

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:37.720
So this technology push,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.612
a demographic kick from a new generation

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:43.480
and a demand pull from a new

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.907
economic global environment

00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:47.600
is causing the world to open up.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.720
Now, I think, in fact,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.923
we're at a turning point in human history,

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:55.868
where we can finally now rebuild

00:02:55.868 --> 00:02:58.306
many of the institutions of the Industrial Age

00:02:58.306 --> 00:02:59.863
around a new set of principles.

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:02.227
Now, what is openness?

00:03:02.227 --> 00:03:03.802
Well, as it turns out, openness

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:06.044
has a number of different meanings,

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:08.947
and for each there's a corresponding principle

00:03:08.947 --> 00:03:10.616
for the transformation of

00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:12.640
civilization.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.915
The first is collaboration.

00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:18.730
Now, this is openness in the sense of the boundaries

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.689
of organizations becoming more porous and fluid

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.553
and open.

00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:25.089
The guy in the picture here,

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.218
I'll tell you his story.

00:03:26.218 --> 00:03:28.123
His name is Rob McEwen.

00:03:28.123 --> 00:03:30.705
I'd like to say, "I have this think tank, we scour the world

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:32.359
for amazing case studies."

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.017
The reason I know this story

00:03:34.017 --> 00:03:38.178
is because he's my neighbor. (Laughter)

00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:39.945
He actually moved across the street from us,

00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:41.224
and he held a cocktail party

00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:43.669
to meet the neighbors, and he says, "You're Don Tapscott.

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:44.578
I've read some of your books."

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:45.678
I said, "Great. What do you do?"

00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:46.995
And he says, "Well I used to be a banker

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:48.443
and now I'm a gold miner."

00:03:48.443 --> 00:03:51.433
And he tells me this amazing story.

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:53.924
He takes over this gold mine, and his geologists

00:03:53.924 --> 00:03:55.211
can't tell him where the gold is.

00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.938
He gives them more money for geological data,

00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:58.567
they come back, they can't tell

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:00.429
him where to go into production.

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:04.409
After a few years, he's so frustrated he's ready

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.786
to give up, but he has an epiphany one day.

00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:09.560
He wonders, "If my geologists don't know where the gold is,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.930
maybe somebody else does."

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.933
So he does a "radical" thing.

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:15.440
He takes his geological data,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.203
he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet

00:04:18.203 --> 00:04:19.694
called the Goldcorp Challenge.

00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:23.274
It's basically half a million dollars in prize money

00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:25.986
for anybody who can tell me, do I have any gold,

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:29.922
and if so, where is it? (Laughter)

00:04:29.922 --> 00:04:32.069
He gets submissions from all around the world.

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.326
They use techniques that he's never heard of,

00:04:34.326 --> 00:04:36.494
and for his half a million dollars in prize money,

00:04:36.494 --> 00:04:40.679
Rob McEwen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold.

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:42.452
The market value of his company

00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:44.770
goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.462
and I can tell you, because he's my neighbor,

00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:50.952
he's a happy camper. (Laughter)

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:54.640
You know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right?

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.751
Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night.

00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:00.256
He viewed talent differently.

00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:02.552
He wondered, who are their peers?

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:06.621
He should have fired his geology department, but he didn't.

00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:08.952
You know, some of the best submissions

00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:11.183
didn't come from geologists.

00:05:11.183 --> 00:05:13.679
They came from computer scientists, engineers.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:14.930
The winner was a computer graphics company

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.746
that built a three dimensional model of the mine

00:05:16.746 --> 00:05:18.569
where you can helicopter underground

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.239
and see where the gold is.

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:24.342
He helped us understand that social media's becoming

00:05:24.342 --> 00:05:26.415
social production.

00:05:26.415 --> 00:05:28.159
It's not about hooking up online.

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.234
This is a new means of production in the making.

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:35.231
And this Ideagora that he created, an open market, agora,

00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:38.230
for uniquely qualified minds,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.965
was part of a change, a profound change in the deep structure

00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:45.423
and architecture of our organizations,

00:05:45.423 --> 00:05:49.025
and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate,

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:50.725
to create goods and services,

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.848
to engage with the rest of the world,

00:05:51.848 --> 00:05:56.253
in terms of government, how we create public value.

00:05:56.253 --> 00:05:58.239
Openness is about collaboration.

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:00.605
Now secondly, openness is about transparency.

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.795
This is different. Here, we're talking about the communication

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:06.630
of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations:

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.547
employees, customers, business partners, shareholders,

00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:11.309
and so on.

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.582
And everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked.

00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:18.069
People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks,

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.525
but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:23.230
You see, people at their fingertips now, everybody,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.455
not just Julian Assange,

00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:28.046
have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on,

00:06:28.046 --> 00:06:29.503
scrutinizing, informing others,

00:06:29.503 --> 00:06:33.093
and even organizing collective responses.

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:35.383
Institutions are becoming naked,

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:37.190
and if you're going to be naked,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.905
well, there's some corollaries that flow from that.

00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:40.768
I mean, one is,

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:43.549
fitness is no longer optional. (Laughter)

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:47.870
You know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.335
Now, by buff I mean, you need to have good value,

00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:53.315
because value is evidenced like never before.

00:06:53.315 --> 00:06:54.279
You say you have good products.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:55.320
They'd better be good.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.271
But you also need to have values.

00:06:57.271 --> 00:07:00.214
You need to have integrity as part of your bones

00:07:00.214 --> 00:07:02.622
and your DNA as an organization,

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:05.095
because if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust,

00:07:05.095 --> 00:07:09.084
and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world.

00:07:09.084 --> 00:07:12.355
So this is good. It's not bad.

00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:15.050
Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.033
And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world.

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:22.029
Now, the third meaning and corresponding principle

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:24.159
of openness is about sharing.

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:25.880
Now this is different than transparency.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.623
Transparency is about the communication of information.

00:07:28.623 --> 00:07:33.041
Sharing is about giving up assets, intellectual property.

00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:35.311
And there are all kinds of famous stories about this.

00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:38.248
IBM gave away 400 million dollars of software

00:07:38.248 --> 00:07:40.349
to the Linux movement, and that gave them

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:43.360
a multi-billion dollar payoff.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.320
Now, conventional wisdom says,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.055
"Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us,

00:07:48.055 --> 00:07:50.358
and if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get out

00:07:50.358 --> 00:07:52.706
our lawyers and we're going to sue them."

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:56.119
Well, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it?

00:07:56.119 --> 00:08:01.223
I mean, they took — They had a technology disruption,

00:08:01.223 --> 00:08:03.912
and rather than taking a business model innovation

00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:07.864
to correspond to that, they took and sought a legal solution

00:08:07.864 --> 00:08:10.177
and the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles

00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:12.209
is now suing children

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:16.376
and is in danger of collapse.

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:19.217
So we need to think differently about intellectual property.

00:08:19.217 --> 00:08:20.246
I'll give you an example.

00:08:20.246 --> 00:08:23.128
The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.733
First of all, there aren't a lot of big inventions

00:08:25.733 --> 00:08:28.087
in the pipeline, and this is a big problem for human health,

00:08:28.087 --> 00:08:33.248
and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem,

00:08:33.248 --> 00:08:35.171
that they're about to fall off something

00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:36.692
called the patent cliff.

00:08:36.692 --> 00:08:37.460
Do you know about this?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.464
They're going to lose 20 to 35 percent of their revenue

00:08:40.464 --> 00:08:42.091
in the next 12 months.

00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:43.422
And what are you going to do,

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:46.532
like, cut back on paper clips or something? No.

00:08:46.532 --> 00:08:51.245
We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research.

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:54.709
The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets

00:08:54.709 --> 00:08:58.644
in a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research.

00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:00.987
They need to start sharing

00:09:00.987 --> 00:09:02.445
clinical trial data,

00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:06.716
and in doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats,

00:09:06.716 --> 00:09:08.658
not just for the industry but

00:09:08.658 --> 00:09:11.449
for humanity.

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:13.854
Now, the fourth meaning

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:16.000
of openness,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.999
and corresponding principle, is about empowerment.

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:20.215
And I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here.

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:23.689
Knowledge and intelligence is power,

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:26.528
and as it becomes more distributed, there's a

00:09:26.528 --> 00:09:29.073
concomitant distribution

00:09:29.073 --> 00:09:32.704
and decentralization and disaggregation of power

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:34.633
that's underway in the world today.

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:37.723
The open world is bringing freedom.

00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:40.072
Now, take the Arab Spring.

00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:41.984
The debate about the role of social media

00:09:41.984 --> 00:09:43.978
and social change has been settled.

00:09:43.978 --> 00:09:47.216
You know, one word: Tunisia.

00:09:47.216 --> 00:09:49.562
And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too.

00:09:49.562 --> 00:09:51.904
But in the Tunisian revolution,

00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:54.031
the new media didn't cause the revolution;

00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:55.811
it was caused by injustice.

00:09:55.811 --> 00:10:00.048
Social media didn't create the revolution;

00:10:00.048 --> 00:10:02.369
it was created by a new generation of young people

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:04.177
who wanted jobs and hope and

00:10:04.177 --> 00:10:08.203
who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.

00:10:08.203 --> 00:10:11.268
But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration

00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:13.636
costs in business and government,

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:16.393
it also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion,

00:10:16.393 --> 00:10:18.222
and even insurrection

00:10:18.222 --> 00:10:20.314
in ways that people didn't understand.

00:10:20.314 --> 00:10:22.137
You know, during the Tunisian revolution,

00:10:22.137 --> 00:10:24.831
snipers associated with the regime were killing

00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:26.575
unarmed students in the street.

00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:29.596
So the students would take their mobile devices,

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:32.249
take a picture, triangulate the location,

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:34.450
send that picture to friendly military units,

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.859
who'd come in and take out the snipers.

00:10:36.859 --> 00:10:39.393
You think that social media is about hooking up online?

00:10:39.393 --> 00:10:42.420
For these kids, it was a military tool

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.546
to defend unarmed people from murderers.

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:47.679
It was a tool of self-defense.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:50.034
You know, as we speak today, young people

00:10:50.034 --> 00:10:52.044
are being killed in Syria,

00:10:52.044 --> 00:10:53.854
and up until three months ago,

00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:56.053
if you were injured on the street,

00:10:56.053 --> 00:10:57.505
an ambulance would pick you up,

00:10:57.505 --> 00:11:00.405
take you to the hospital, you'd go in, say, with a broken leg,

00:11:00.405 --> 00:11:02.884
and you'd come out with a bullet in your head.

00:11:02.884 --> 00:11:05.795
So these 20-somethings created

00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:08.089
an alternative health care system,

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:10.479
where what they did is they used Twitter and basic

00:11:10.479 --> 00:11:13.724
publicly available tools that when someone's injured,

00:11:13.724 --> 00:11:16.404
a car would show up, it would pick them up,

00:11:16.404 --> 00:11:18.963
take them to a makeshift medical clinic, where you'd get

00:11:18.963 --> 00:11:22.505
medical treatment, as opposed to being executed.

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:25.690
So this is a time of great change.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.324
Now, it's not without its problems.

00:11:28.324 --> 00:11:30.970
Up until two years ago,

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.123
all revolutions in human history had a leadership,

00:11:34.123 --> 00:11:36.915
and when the old regime fell, the leadership

00:11:36.915 --> 00:11:37.893
and the organization would take power.

00:11:37.893 --> 00:11:40.418
Well, these wiki revolutions happen so fast

00:11:40.418 --> 00:11:41.916
they create a vacuum, and

00:11:41.916 --> 00:11:43.651
politics abhors a vacuum,

00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:45.723
and unsavory forces can fill that,

00:11:45.723 --> 00:11:48.849
typically the old regime,

00:11:48.849 --> 00:11:51.195
or extremists, or fundamentalist forces.

00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:53.930
You can see this playing out today in Egypt.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.593
But that doesn't matter,

00:11:55.593 --> 00:11:57.730
because this is moving forward.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.706
The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag.

00:12:00.706 --> 00:12:04.084
The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay?

00:12:04.084 --> 00:12:06.226
(Laughter) The toothpaste is out of the tube.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.449
I mean, we're not putting this one back.

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:12.182
The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom.

00:12:12.182 --> 00:12:14.966
I think, at the end of these four days,

00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:17.732
that you'll come to conclude that the arc of history

00:12:17.732 --> 00:12:21.228
is a positive one, and it's towards openness.

00:12:21.228 --> 00:12:23.709
If you go back a few hundred years,

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:26.093
all around the world it was a very closed society.

00:12:26.093 --> 00:12:27.662
It was agrarian, and the means of production

00:12:27.662 --> 00:12:30.377
and political system was called feudalism, and knowledge

00:12:30.377 --> 00:12:34.315
was concentrated in the church and the nobility.

00:12:34.315 --> 00:12:35.922
People didn't know about things.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.397
There was no concept of progress.

00:12:38.397 --> 00:12:40.300
You were born, you lived your life and you died.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.896
But then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention,

00:12:44.896 --> 00:12:48.448
and, over time, the society opened up.

00:12:48.448 --> 00:12:50.489
People started to learn about things, and when they did,

00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:51.874
the institutions of feudal society appeared

00:12:51.874 --> 00:12:55.577
to be stalled, or frozen, or failing.

00:12:55.577 --> 00:12:58.353
It didn't make sense for the church to be responsible

00:12:58.353 --> 00:13:00.635
for medicine when people had knowledge.

00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:02.582
So we saw the Protestant Reformation.

00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:04.452
Martin Luther called the printing press

00:13:04.452 --> 00:13:06.849
"God's highest act of grace."

00:13:06.849 --> 00:13:10.360
The creation of a corporation, science, the university,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.047
eventually the Industrial Revolution,

00:13:12.047 --> 00:13:14.221
and it was all good.

00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:16.368
But it came with a cost.

00:13:16.368 --> 00:13:19.080
And now, once again, the technology genie

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.400
is out of the bottle, but this time it's different.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.265
The printing press gave us access to the written word.

00:13:25.265 --> 00:13:28.724
The Internet enables each of us to be a producer.

00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:31.538
The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge.

00:13:31.538 --> 00:13:33.448
The Internet gives us access,

00:13:33.448 --> 00:13:35.097
not just to information and knowledge, but

00:13:35.097 --> 00:13:38.473
to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people

00:13:38.473 --> 00:13:40.010
on a global basis.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.249
To me, this is not an information age,

00:13:43.249 --> 00:13:46.123
it's an age of networked intelligence.

00:13:46.123 --> 00:13:49.995
It's an age of vast promise,

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:53.123
an age of collaboration,

00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:57.302
where the boundaries of our organizations are changing,

00:13:57.302 --> 00:14:00.017
of transparency, where sunlight

00:14:00.017 --> 00:14:03.240
is disinfecting civilization,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.796
an age of sharing and understanding

00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:08.502
the new power of the commons,

00:14:08.502 --> 00:14:11.145
and it's an age of empowerment

00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:14.036
and of freedom.

00:14:14.036 --> 00:14:17.572
Now, what I'd like to do is,

00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:20.220
to close, to share with you

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.829
some research that I've been doing.

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:25.340
I've tried to study all kinds of organizations

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.477
to understand what the future might look like,

00:14:28.477 --> 00:14:31.502
but I've been studying nature recently.

00:14:31.502 --> 00:14:35.132
You know, bees come in swarms

00:14:35.132 --> 00:14:37.843
and fish come in schools.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.656
Starlings, in the area around Edinburgh,

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:42.139
in the moors of England,

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:44.233
come in something called a murmuration,

00:14:44.233 --> 00:14:47.005
and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings

00:14:47.005 --> 00:14:48.918
of the birds, and throughout the day the starlings

00:14:48.918 --> 00:14:50.783
are out over a 20-mile radius

00:14:50.783 --> 00:14:52.824
sort of doing their starling thing.

00:14:52.824 --> 00:14:54.588
And at night they come together

00:14:54.588 --> 00:14:56.710
and they create one of the most spectacular things

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.305
in all of nature,

00:14:58.305 --> 00:15:00.359
and it's called a murmuration.

00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:03.276
And scientists that have studied this have said

00:15:03.276 --> 00:15:05.022
they've never seen an accident.

00:15:05.022 --> 00:15:06.972
Now, this thing has a function.

00:15:06.972 --> 00:15:08.834
It protects the birds.

00:15:08.834 --> 00:15:10.434
You can see on the right here,

00:15:10.434 --> 00:15:14.939
there's a predator being chased away by the collective power

00:15:14.939 --> 00:15:17.929
of the birds, and apparently this is a frightening thing

00:15:17.929 --> 00:15:21.393
if you're a predator of starlings.

00:15:21.393 --> 00:15:23.841
And there's leadership,

00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:25.979
but there's no one leader.

00:15:25.979 --> 00:15:28.080
Now, is this some kind of fanciful analogy,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.526
or could we actually learn something from this?

00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:33.582
Well, the murmuration functions to record

00:15:33.582 --> 00:15:34.945
a number of principles,

00:15:34.945 --> 00:15:36.464
and they're basically the principles that

00:15:36.464 --> 00:15:38.378
I have described to you today.

00:15:38.378 --> 00:15:41.184
This is a huge collaboration.

00:15:41.184 --> 00:15:42.963
It's an openness, it's a sharing

00:15:42.963 --> 00:15:45.478
of all kinds of information, not just about location

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:50.493
and trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources.

00:15:50.493 --> 00:15:54.630
And there's a real sense of interdependence,

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:58.317
that the individual birds somehow understand

00:15:58.317 --> 00:16:01.276
that their interests are in the interest of the collective.

00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:03.525
Perhaps like we should understand

00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:07.693
that business can't succeed

00:16:07.693 --> 00:16:09.853
in a world that's failing.

00:16:09.853 --> 00:16:11.410
Well, I look at this thing,

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.097
and I get a lot of hope.

00:16:14.097 --> 00:16:19.149
Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring, and

00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:22.005
you see something like this that's underway.

00:16:22.005 --> 00:16:26.145
And imagine, just consider this idea, if you would:

00:16:26.145 --> 00:16:30.090
What if we could connect ourselves in this world

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.935
through a vast network of air and glass?

00:16:33.935 --> 00:16:36.767
Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge?

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:39.276
Could we start to share our intelligence?

00:16:39.276 --> 00:16:41.718
Could we create some kind of

00:16:41.718 --> 00:16:43.439
collective intelligence

00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:47.359
that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team

00:16:47.359 --> 00:16:51.507
to create, perhaps, some kind of consciousness

00:16:51.507 --> 00:16:52.732
on a global basis?

00:16:52.732 --> 00:16:56.405
Well, if we could do this, we could attack some big problems in the world.

00:16:56.405 --> 00:16:58.276
And I look at this thing,

00:16:58.276 --> 00:17:01.191
and, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe this

00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:04.987
smaller, networked, open world

00:17:04.987 --> 00:17:08.091
that our kids inherit might be a better one, and that

00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:11.404
this new age of networked intelligence could be

00:17:11.404 --> 00:17:14.028
an age of promise fulfilled

00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:17.058
and of peril unrequited.

00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:20.404
Let's do this. Thank you.

00:17:20.404 --> 00:17:30.030
(Applause)
