00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:02.770
So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.579
I've spent hundreds of days

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:06.066
in psychiatric hospitals.

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.871
I might have ended up spending

00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.698
most of my life on the back ward of a hospital,

00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:11.898
but that isn't how my life turned out.

00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:15.346
In fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:16.835
for almost three decades,

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:18.778
perhaps my proudest accomplishment.

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:20.972
That's not to say that I've remained clear

00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:22.579
of all psychiatric struggles.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.004
After I graduated from the Yale Law School and

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.010
got my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.595
announced to me that he was going to close his practice

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.475
in three months, several years

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.172
before I had planned to leave New Haven.

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:36.941
White had been enormously helpful to me,

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:37.998
and the thought of his leaving

00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:39.884
shattered me.

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:41.354
My best friend Steve,

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:43.106
sensing that something was terribly wrong,

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:44.938
flew out to New Haven to be with me.

00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:47.026
Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings:

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.541
"I opened the door to my studio apartment.

00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:51.714
Steve would later tell me that,

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:54.450
for all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.451
could have prepared him for what he saw that day.

00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:59.124
For a week or more, I had barely eaten.

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:01.684
I was gaunt. I walked

00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:03.298
as though my legs were wooden.

00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:06.325
My face looked and felt like a mask.

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:09.169
I had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.124
in the middle of the day

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:12.138
the apartment was in near total darkness.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.890
The air was fetid, the room a shambles.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.206
Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:21.339
many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:24.027
he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:27.106
'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch,

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:29.230
where I sat in silence for several moments.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.075
'Thank you for coming, Steve.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:35.126
Crumbling world, word, voice.

00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:36.995
Tell the clocks to stop.

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:38.786
Time is. Time has come.'

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:42.027
'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:45.458
'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:47.085
'Gravity is pulling me down.

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:49.218
I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'"

00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:52.930
As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.434
on three different occasions for lengthy periods.

00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:58.226
My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.821
and gave me a prognosis of "grave."

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:04.251
That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,

00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:05.955
and work at menial jobs.

00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:07.955
Fortunately, I did not actually

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:09.730
enact that grave prognosis.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.571
Instead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:15.196
and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:16.826
I have many close friends

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:20.011
and I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.

00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:24.538
(Applause) Thank you.

00:02:26.554 --> 00:02:29.812
He's definitely the star of my show.

00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:32.610
I'd like to share with you how that happened, and also

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.379
describe my experience of being psychotic.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.859
I hasten to add that it's my experience,

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.515
because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.

00:02:40.515 --> 00:02:43.576
Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia.

00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:45.797
Schizophrenia is a brain disease.

00:02:45.797 --> 00:02:48.222
Its defining feature is psychosis, or being

00:02:48.222 --> 00:02:49.814
out of touch with reality.

00:02:49.814 --> 00:02:51.636
Delusions and hallucinations

00:02:51.636 --> 00:02:53.190
are hallmarks of the illness.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.942
Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:59.758
to evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:02.108
For example, when I'm psychotic I often have

00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:04.359
the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.936
of people with my thoughts.

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:07.641
I sometimes have the idea that

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.136
nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:12.472
Occasionally, I have hallucinations,

00:03:12.472 --> 00:03:14.240
like one time I turned around and saw a man

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.817
with a raised knife.

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:18.609
Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake.

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.819
Often, speech and thinking become disorganized

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.365
to the point of incoherence.

00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:26.244
Loose associations involves putting together words

00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:29.027
that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense,

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:31.417
and if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called "word salad."

00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:35.855
Contrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:39.270
the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.821
The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.400
Everyone has seen a street person,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.423
unkempt, probably ill-fed,

00:03:47.423 --> 00:03:50.000
standing outside of an office building muttering

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.813
to himself or shouting.

00:03:51.813 --> 00:03:54.410
This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.741
But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array

00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.565
of socioeconomic status, and there are people

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:02.095
with the illness who are full-time professionals

00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:04.447
with major responsibilities.

00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:05.658
Several years ago, I decided

00:04:05.658 --> 00:04:09.093
to write down my experiences and my personal journey,

00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:11.391
and I want to share some more of that story with you today

00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:13.054
to convey the inside view.

00:04:13.054 --> 00:04:15.839
So the following episode happened the seventh week

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.702
of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.

00:04:18.702 --> 00:04:20.907
Quoting from my writings:

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:24.376
"My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:27.337
to meet in the law school library on Friday night

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:29.621
to work on our memo assignment together.

00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:31.423
But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways

00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:32.946
that made no sense.

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:36.010
'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.530
'They make certain points. The point is on your head.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.985
Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?'

00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:43.001
Rebel and Val looked at me

00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:44.672
as if they or I had been

00:04:44.672 --> 00:04:46.252
splashed in the face with cold water.

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:47.808
'What are you talking about, Elyn?'

00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:50.817
'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who,

00:04:50.817 --> 00:04:53.072
heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.

00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:54.648
It's a flat surface. It's safe.'

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.232
Rebel and Val followed

00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:57.681
and they asked what had gotten into me.

00:04:57.681 --> 00:04:59.544
'This is the real me,' I announced,

00:04:59.544 --> 00:05:01.089
waving my arms above my head.

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.864
And then, late on a Friday night, on the roof

00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:05.021
of the Yale Law School,

00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.313
I began to sing, and not quietly either.

00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:10.417
'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:11.728
Do you want to dance?'

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.203
'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?'

00:05:14.203 --> 00:05:16.659
'High? Me? No way, no drugs.

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.226
Come to the Florida sunshine bush,

00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:22.499
where there are lemons, where they make demons.'

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:25.193
'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val

00:05:25.193 --> 00:05:26.972
headed back into the library.

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:29.089
I shrugged and followed them.

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:32.456
Back inside, I asked my classmates if they were

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:34.673
having the same experience of words jumping around

00:05:34.673 --> 00:05:36.017
our cases as I was.

00:05:36.017 --> 00:05:40.040
'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.544
'We've got to case the joint.

00:05:41.544 --> 00:05:43.127
I don't believe in joints, but

00:05:43.127 --> 00:05:44.592
they do hold your body together.'" --

00:05:44.592 --> 00:05:46.961
It's an example of loose associations. --

00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:49.345
"Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room,

00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:51.704
and once there, I couldn't settle down.

00:05:51.704 --> 00:05:53.529
My head was too full of noise,

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:57.216
too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write

00:05:57.216 --> 00:05:59.848
and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.

00:05:59.848 --> 00:06:03.193
Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,

00:06:03.193 --> 00:06:05.225
moaning in fear and isolation."

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:08.352
This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:10.592
I had two earlier in England.

00:06:10.592 --> 00:06:12.153
Continuing with the writings:

00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:14.617
"The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask

00:06:14.617 --> 00:06:16.194
for an extension on the memo assignment,

00:06:16.194 --> 00:06:18.351
and I began gibbering unintelligably

00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:19.697
as I had the night before,

00:06:19.697 --> 00:06:21.370
and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.171
Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor'

00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:27.138
and his whole team of goons swooped down,

00:06:27.138 --> 00:06:28.547
lifted me high into the air,

00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:30.220
and slammed me down on a metal bed

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.572
with such force that I saw stars.

00:06:32.572 --> 00:06:35.130
Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.797
with thick leather straps.

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:40.143
A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before:

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:42.171
half groan, half scream,

00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:45.515
barely human and pure terror.

00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:47.186
Then the sound came again,

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:49.110
forced from somewhere deep inside my belly

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.707
and scraping my throat raw."

00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:54.986
This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.

00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:58.527
One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me

00:06:58.527 --> 00:06:59.812
against my will was that I was

00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:01.219
"gravely disabled."

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:04.315
To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:06.107
to do my Yale Law School homework.

00:07:06.107 --> 00:07:09.148
I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.

00:07:09.148 --> 00:07:10.754
(Laughter)

00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:13.443
During the next year, I would

00:07:13.443 --> 00:07:15.595
spend five months in a psychiatric hospital.

00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:19.074
At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,

00:07:19.074 --> 00:07:22.564
arms tied, arms and legs tied down,

00:07:22.564 --> 00:07:25.083
arms and legs tied down with a net tied

00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:26.891
tightly across my chest.

00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:28.938
I never struck anyone.

00:07:28.938 --> 00:07:31.844
I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.

00:07:31.844 --> 00:07:34.618
If you've never been restrained yourself, you may have

00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:37.315
a benign image of the experience.

00:07:37.315 --> 00:07:39.290
There's nothing benign about it.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.075
Every week in the United States,

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:43.995
it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.

00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:46.611
They strangle, they aspirate their vomit,

00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:48.764
they suffocate, they have a heart attack.

00:07:48.764 --> 00:07:51.290
It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.810
is actually saving lives or costing lives.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.604
While I was preparing to write my student note

00:07:56.604 --> 00:07:58.804
for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,

00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:01.156
I consulted an eminent law professor who was also

00:08:01.156 --> 00:08:02.241
a psychiatrist,

00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:03.954
and said surely he would agree

00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:06.250
that restraints must be degrading,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.786
painful and frightening.

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:09.897
He looked at me in a knowing way, and said,

00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:12.226
"Elyn, you don't really understand:

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:13.964
These people are psychotic.

00:08:13.964 --> 00:08:15.485
They're different from me and you.

00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:18.249
They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:21.083
I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that,

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:23.084
no, we're not that different from him.

00:08:23.084 --> 00:08:25.442
We don't like to be strapped down to a bed

00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:27.772
and left to suffer for hours any more than he would.

00:08:27.772 --> 00:08:29.924
In fact, until very recently,

00:08:29.924 --> 00:08:31.906
and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,

00:08:31.906 --> 00:08:34.938
that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.

00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:37.370
I've never met a psychiatric patient

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.764
who agreed with that view.

00:08:38.764 --> 00:08:41.475
Today, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry

00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:42.978
but very anti-force.

00:08:42.978 --> 00:08:45.969
I don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think

00:08:45.969 --> 00:08:48.706
using force is a terrible thing to do to another person

00:08:48.706 --> 00:08:50.065
with a terrible illness.

00:08:50.065 --> 00:08:52.786
Eventually, I came to Los Angeles

00:08:52.786 --> 00:08:55.284
to teach at the University of Southern California Law School.

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:57.604
For years, I had resisted medication,

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:59.594
making many, many efforts to get off.

00:08:59.594 --> 00:09:02.269
I felt that if I could manage without medication,

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:04.307
I could prove that, after all,

00:09:04.307 --> 00:09:07.057
I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.

00:09:07.057 --> 00:09:10.364
My motto was the less medicine, the less defective.

00:09:10.364 --> 00:09:13.452
My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.952
just to stay on medication and get on with my life,

00:09:15.952 --> 00:09:19.427
but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.

00:09:19.427 --> 00:09:20.859
Quoting from the text:

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:24.499
"I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time

00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:26.611
I began feeling the effects.

00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:29.452
After returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into

00:09:29.452 --> 00:09:32.829
Kaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:35.062
covered my face, and began shaking.

00:09:35.062 --> 00:09:38.217
All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.

00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:40.385
They'd slice me up in thin slices

00:09:40.385 --> 00:09:42.027
or make me swallow hot coals.

00:09:42.027 --> 00:09:45.404
Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.'

00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:48.489
Even in this state, what he accurately described as

00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:50.180
acutely and forwardly psychotic,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.193
I refused to take more medication.

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.993
The mission is not yet complete.

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:57.611
Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan,

00:09:57.611 --> 00:09:59.909
I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert

00:09:59.909 --> 00:10:02.217
who was following me for medication side effects.

00:10:02.217 --> 00:10:05.238
He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:08.666
Once in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over,

00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:10.305
and began muttering.

00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:12.535
'Head explosions and people trying to kill.

00:10:12.535 --> 00:10:15.000
Is it okay if I totally trash your office?'

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.632
'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,'

00:10:17.632 --> 00:10:18.615
said Marder.

00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:21.767
'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.

00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:23.415
Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.992
Hundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.'

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:27.727
'Elyn, do you feel like you're

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:29.224
dangerous to yourself or others?

00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:31.639
I think you need to be in the hospital.

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:33.496
I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing

00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:34.631
could be very discrete.'

00:10:34.631 --> 00:10:36.312
'Ha, ha, ha.

00:10:36.312 --> 00:10:38.649
You're offering to put me in hospitals?

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:41.592
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.

00:10:41.592 --> 00:10:45.256
One must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'"

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:46.839
At that point in the text,

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:48.744
where I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband

00:10:48.744 --> 00:10:49.769
made a marginal note.

00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:51.376
He said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"

00:10:51.376 --> 00:10:53.607
(Laughter)

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:57.359
"'I give life and I take it away.

00:10:57.359 --> 00:10:59.056
Forgive me, for I know not what I do.'

00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:02.370
Eventually, I broke down in front of friends, and

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.878
everybody convinced me to take more medication.

00:11:04.878 --> 00:11:06.824
I could no longer deny the truth,

00:11:06.824 --> 00:11:08.346
and I could not change it.

00:11:08.346 --> 00:11:10.995
The wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks,

00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:14.108
separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past,

00:11:14.108 --> 00:11:16.219
lay smashed and in ruins."

00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:18.892
Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here,

00:11:18.892 --> 00:11:21.766
but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons:

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:24.158
First, I've had excellent treatment.

00:11:24.158 --> 00:11:27.104
Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy

00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:30.088
for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:34.132
Second, I have many close family members and friends who know me

00:11:34.132 --> 00:11:35.386
and know my illness.

00:11:35.386 --> 00:11:37.710
These relationships have given my life a meaning

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.877
and a depth, and they also helped me navigate

00:11:39.877 --> 00:11:41.845
my life in the face of symptoms.

00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:45.013
Third, I work at an enormously supportive workplace

00:11:45.013 --> 00:11:46.598
at USC Law School.

00:11:46.598 --> 00:11:49.623
This is a place that not only accommodates my needs

00:11:49.623 --> 00:11:51.014
but actually embraces them.

00:11:51.014 --> 00:11:54.045
It's also a very intellectually stimulating place,

00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:56.637
and occupying my mind with complex problems

00:11:56.637 --> 00:12:00.070
has been my best and most powerful and most reliable

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.790
defense against my mental illness.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.093
Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family and

00:12:05.093 --> 00:12:07.009
friends, supportive work environment —

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:09.342
I did not make my illness public

00:12:09.342 --> 00:12:10.775
until relatively late in life,

00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:13.294
and that's because the stigma against mental illness

00:12:13.294 --> 00:12:15.902
is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.318
If you hear nothing else today,

00:12:18.318 --> 00:12:21.752
please hear this: There are not "schizophrenics."

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:24.903
There are people with schizophrenia, and these people

00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:26.998
may be your spouse, they may be your child,

00:12:26.998 --> 00:12:29.422
they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,

00:12:29.422 --> 00:12:30.846
they may be your coworker.

00:12:30.846 --> 00:12:33.702
So let me share some final thoughts.

00:12:33.702 --> 00:12:37.134
We need to invest more resources into research and treatment

00:12:37.134 --> 00:12:38.374
of mental illness.

00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:40.430
The better we understand these illnesses, the better

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.638
the treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments

00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:45.078
we can provide, the more we can offer people care,

00:12:45.078 --> 00:12:46.526
and not have to use force.

00:12:46.526 --> 00:12:49.478
Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.

00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:53.526
It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail

00:12:53.526 --> 00:12:56.168
is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.

00:12:56.168 --> 00:13:00.084
American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer

00:13:00.084 --> 00:13:02.568
from severe mental illness, and many of them are there


00:13:02.568 --> 00:13:04.545
because they never received adequate treatment.

00:13:04.545 --> 00:13:07.974
I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.

00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:11.198
A message to the entertainment industry and to the press:

00:13:11.198 --> 00:13:15.262
On the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:17.078
and prejudice of many kinds.

00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:20.078
Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies,

00:13:20.078 --> 00:13:22.206
your plays, your columns,

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:24.030
who suffer with severe mental illness.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.790
Portray them sympathetically,

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.429
and portray them in all the richness and depth

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:31.956
of their experience as people and not as diagnoses.

00:13:31.956 --> 00:13:34.232
Recently, a friend posed a question:

00:13:34.232 --> 00:13:36.007
If there were a pill I could take

00:13:36.007 --> 00:13:37.818
that would instantly cure me, would I take it?

00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:40.511
The poet Rainer Maria Rilke

00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:41.983
was offered psychoanalysis.

00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:44.295
He declined, saying, "Don't take my devils away,

00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:46.054
because my angels may flee too."

00:13:46.054 --> 00:13:48.247
My psychosis, on the other hand,

00:13:48.247 --> 00:13:50.919
is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:52.855
that all my angels have already fled.

00:13:52.855 --> 00:13:56.759
So would I take the pill? In an instant.

00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:59.440
That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.833
the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill,

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.115
nor am I asking anyone for their pity.

00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:07.246
What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share

00:14:07.261 --> 00:14:09.879
is more important than the mental illness we may not.

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:12.337
What those of us who suffer with mental illness want

00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:13.791
is what everybody wants:

00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:16.325
in the words of Sigmund Freud, "to work and to love."

00:14:16.325 --> 00:14:19.348
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:19.348 --> 00:14:20.025
(Applause)

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:24.818
Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind. (Applause)

00:14:24.818 --> 00:14:31.425
Thank you. (Applause)
