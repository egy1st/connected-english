00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:14.070
The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.459
is called quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:24.348
And the object that was levitating here

00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:26.349
is called a superconductor.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.941
Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter,

00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:36.198
and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:38.544
Now, it's quite an old phenomenon;

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:40.310
it was discovered 100 years ago.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.436
However, only recently,

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:44.798
due to several technological advancements,

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:47.470
we are now able to demonstrate to you

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.216
quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:57.061
So, a superconductor is defined by two properties.

00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.517
The first is zero electrical resistance,

00:01:00.517 --> 00:01:07.406
and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:10.301
That sounds complicated, right?

00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:13.173
But what is electrical resistance?

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:19.422
So, electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material.

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:22.771
And these electrons, while flowing,

00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:25.459
they collide with the atoms, and in these collisions

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.675
they lose a certain amount of energy.

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:33.276
And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect.

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:39.195
However, inside a superconductor there are no collisions,

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:43.887
so there is no energy dissipation.

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:46.868
It's quite remarkable. Think about it.

00:01:46.868 --> 00:01:51.947
In classical physics, there is always some friction, some energy loss.

00:01:51.947 --> 00:01:55.985
But not here, because it is a quantum effect.

00:01:56.016 --> 00:02:04.702
But that's not all, because superconductors don't like magnetic fields.

00:02:04.702 --> 00:02:09.019
So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside,

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:15.142
and it has the means to do that by circulating currents.

00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:18.132
Now, the combination of both effects --

00:02:18.132 --> 00:02:24.132
the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance --

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:27.300
is exactly a superconductor.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.516
But the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know,

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:38.901
and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor.

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:42.555
Now, under proper conditions, which we have here,

00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:47.645
these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor.

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:53.902
And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor,

00:02:53.902 --> 00:02:56.747
they come in discrete quantities.

00:02:56.747 --> 00:03:00.393
Why? Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics.

00:03:00.393 --> 00:03:04.243
And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles.

00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:09.822
In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:13.715
This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles,

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:18.010
but they behave like particles.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.204
So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:28.267
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?

00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:32.852
Well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside,

00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:36.972
but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around,

00:03:36.972 --> 00:03:40.420
because their movements dissipate energy,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.366
which breaks the superconductivity state.

00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:47.724
So what it actually does, it locks these strands,

00:03:47.724 --> 00:03:53.476
which are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place.

00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:59.764
And by doing that, what it actually does is locking itself in place.

00:03:59.764 --> 00:04:08.980
Why? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.787
will change their configuration.

00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:16.084
So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works.

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:21.844
I have here a superconductor, which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough.

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:26.308
And when I place it on top of a regular magnet,

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:30.180
it just stays locked in midair.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.245
(Applause)

00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:38.291
Now, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion.

00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:43.412
I can rearrange the fluxons, and it will be locked in this new configuration.

00:04:43.412 --> 00:04:47.436
Like this, or move it slightly to the right or to the left.

00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:55.187
So, this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.

00:04:55.187 --> 00:04:57.347
Of course, I can turn it upside down,

00:04:57.347 --> 00:05:00.253
and it will remain locked.

00:05:00.253 --> 00:05:09.475
Now, now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking,

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:13.789
Yeah, we understand that.

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.051
You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet,

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:22.019
in which the magnetic field is the same all around,

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:27.955
the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:33.979
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:40.005
You see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:46.667
We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:55.947
So, we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet.

00:05:55.947 --> 00:06:02.443
But how many fluxons, how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this?

00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:05.324
Well, we can calculate it, and it turns out, quite a lot.

00:06:05.324 --> 00:06:12.692
One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk.

00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:16.796
But that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something I haven't told you yet.

00:06:16.796 --> 00:06:22.412
And, yeah, the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here

00:06:22.412 --> 00:06:29.937
is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin.

00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:39.499
And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:45.332
It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong.

00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:48.909
Now, I can extend this circular magnet,

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:53.690
and make whatever track I want.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.619
For example, I can make a large circular rail here.

00:06:57.619 --> 00:07:04.502
And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail,

00:07:04.502 --> 00:07:08.611
it moves freely.

00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:17.992
(Applause)

00:07:17.992 --> 00:07:22.733
And again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate,

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:29.174
and it freely moves in this new position.

00:07:29.174 --> 00:07:33.612
And I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.

00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:39.556
I can take this disk and put it here,

00:07:39.556 --> 00:07:42.540
and while it stays here -- don't move --

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:49.098
I will try to rotate the track,

00:07:49.098 --> 00:07:51.397
and hopefully, if I did it correctly,

00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:53.540
it stays suspended.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:08:02.989
(Applause)

00:08:02.989 --> 00:08:09.830
You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.965
Now, while I'll let it circulate for a little more,

00:08:13.965 --> 00:08:17.668
let me tell you a little bit about superconductors.

00:08:17.668 --> 00:08:23.214
Now -- (Laughter) --

00:08:23.214 --> 00:08:30.237
So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors,

00:08:30.237 --> 00:08:35.460
so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.646
such as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators and so on.

00:08:40.646 --> 00:08:45.206
But we can also store energy using superconductors,

00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:47.095
because we have no dissipation.

00:08:47.095 --> 00:08:54.277
And we could also produce power cables, to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations.

00:08:54.277 --> 00:09:03.283
Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable.

00:09:03.283 --> 00:09:07.759
But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking?

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:14.898
Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.

00:09:14.898 --> 00:09:21.311
Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand,

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:25.190
three-inch diameter, with a single difference.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.375
The superconducting layer, instead of being half a micron thin,

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:33.463
being two millimeters thin, quite thin.

00:09:33.463 --> 00:09:44.198
This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand.

00:09:44.198 --> 00:09:47.494
Amazing. Thank you.

00:09:47.494 --> 00:10:02.574
(Applause)
