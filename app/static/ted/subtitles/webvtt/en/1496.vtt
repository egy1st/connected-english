WEBVTT

00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:03.102
I study the future

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:07.387
of crime and terrorism,

00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:09.747
and frankly, I'm afraid.

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:11.709
I'm afraid by what I see.

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.854
I sincerely want to believe

00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:16.646
that technology can bring us

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:19.703
the techno-utopia that we've been promised,

00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:21.439
but, you see,

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.552
I've spent a career in law enforcement,

00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:27.325
and that's informed my perspective on things.

00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:28.958
I've been a street police officer,

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.029
an undercover investigator,

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.037
a counter-terrorism strategist,

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:35.262
and I've worked in more than 70 countries

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:36.728
around the world.

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:38.384
I've had to see more than my fair share

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.629
of violence and the darker underbelly of society,

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.090
and that's informed my opinions.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.677
My work with criminals and terrorists

00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:49.797
has actually been highly educational.

00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:52.506
They have taught me a lot, and I'd like to be able

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:56.405
to share some of these observations with you.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.724
Today I'm going to show you the flip side

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:02.739
of all those technologies that we marvel at,

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.602
the ones that we love.

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:06.468
In the hands of the TED community,

00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:09.381
these are awesome tools which will bring about

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:12.840
great change for our world,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.566
but in the hands of suicide bombers,

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:19.002
the future can look quite different.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.155
I started observing

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:23.051
technology and how criminals were using it

00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:25.042
as a young patrol officer.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:29.498
In those days, this was the height of technology.

00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:31.067
Laugh though you will,

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:32.362
all the drug dealers and gang members

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:34.563
with whom I dealt had one of these

00:01:34.563 --> 00:01:38.854
long before any police officer I knew did.

00:01:38.854 --> 00:01:41.714
Twenty years later, criminals are still using

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:45.597
mobile phones, but they're also building

00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:47.946
their own mobile phone networks,

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:50.178
like this one, which has been deployed

00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:53.978
in all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos.

00:01:53.978 --> 00:01:56.114
They have a national encrypted

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:59.323
radio communications system.

00:01:59.323 --> 00:02:01.433
Think about that.

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:04.815
Think about the innovation that went into that.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:07.712
Think about the infrastructure to build it.

00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:09.117
And then think about this:

00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:13.167
Why can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco? (Laughter)

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:18.254
How is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense. (Applause)

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:19.612
We consistently underestimate

00:02:19.612 --> 00:02:22.916
what criminals and terrorists can do.

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:24.524
Technology has made our world

00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:26.604
increasingly open, and for the most part,

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.957
that's great, but all of this openness

00:02:28.957 --> 00:02:31.002
may have unintended consequences.

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:35.718
Consider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:38.876
The men that carried that attack out were armed

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:42.346
with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades.

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:44.178
They threw these hand grenades

00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:47.378
at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes

00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:52.231
and waited to catch trains on their way home from work.

00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:55.584
But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations.

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:57.988
Guns and bombs are nothing new.

00:02:57.988 --> 00:02:59.224
What was different this time

00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:01.912
is the way that the terrorists used

00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:04.648
modern information communications technologies

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:10.004
to locate additional victims and slaughter them.

00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:12.217
They were armed with mobile phones.

00:03:12.217 --> 00:03:13.816
They had BlackBerries.

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:16.053
They had access to satellite imagery.

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:21.018
They had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles.

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:24.005
But perhaps their greatest innovation was this.

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:26.093
We've all seen pictures like this

00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:29.449
on television and in the news. This is an operations center.

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.876
And the terrorists built their very own op center

00:03:31.876 --> 00:03:35.307
across the border in Pakistan,

00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:36.588
where they monitored the BBC,

00:03:36.588 --> 00:03:41.178
al Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations.

00:03:41.178 --> 00:03:46.206
They also monitored the Internet and social media

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:48.328
to monitor the progress of their attacks

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.698
and how many people they had killed.

00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:53.766
They did all of this in real time.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:57.104
The innovation of the terrorist operations center

00:03:57.104 --> 00:04:01.078
gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:03.304
and tactical advantage over the police

00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:05.947
and over the government.

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:07.212
What did they do with this?

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:09.188
They used it to great effect.

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:11.237
At one point during the 60-hour siege,

00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:12.900
the terrorists were going room to room

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.961
trying to find additional victims.

00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:17.612
They came upon a suite on the top floor

00:04:17.612 --> 00:04:19.517
of the hotel, and they kicked down the door

00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:22.404
and they found a man hiding by his bed.

00:04:22.404 --> 00:04:24.431
And they said to him, "Who are you,

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.820
and what are you doing here?"

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.540
And the man replied,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.214
"I'm just an innocent schoolteacher."

00:04:31.214 --> 00:04:33.378
Of course, the terrorists knew

00:04:33.378 --> 00:04:37.223
that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj.

00:04:37.223 --> 00:04:38.815
They picked up his identification,

00:04:38.815 --> 00:04:42.338
and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room,

00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:45.162
where the terrorist war room Googled him,

00:04:45.162 --> 00:04:47.803
and found a picture and called their operatives

00:04:47.803 --> 00:04:48.996
on the ground and said,

00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:53.675
"Your hostage, is he heavyset?

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:58.153
Is he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?"

00:04:58.153 --> 00:05:02.759
"Yes, yes, yes," came the answers.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.746
The op center had found him and they had a match.

00:05:04.746 --> 00:05:06.113
He was not a schoolteacher.

00:05:06.113 --> 00:05:09.987
He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India,

00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:11.632
and after discovering this information,

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:14.687
the terrorist war room gave the order

00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:17.313
to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai.

00:05:17.313 --> 00:05:20.439
("Kill him.")

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.880
We all worry about our privacy settings

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.616
on Facebook,

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:28.041
but the fact of the matter is,

00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:31.503
our openness can be used against us.

00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:33.409
Terrorists are doing this.

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.915
A search engine can determine

00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:40.870
who shall live and who shall die.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.899
This is the world that we live in.

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.468
During the Mumbai siege,

00:05:45.468 --> 00:05:48.094
terrorists were so dependent on technology

00:05:48.094 --> 00:05:50.340
that several witnesses reported that

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.219
as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand,

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.595
they were checking their mobile phone messages

00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:58.050
in the very other hand.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.200
In the end, 300 people were gravely wounded

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.105
and over 172 men, women and children

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:09.456
lost their lives that day.

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:11.221
Think about what happened.

00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:14.232
During this 60-hour siege on Mumbai,

00:06:14.232 --> 00:06:18.647
10 men armed not just with weapons,

00:06:18.647 --> 00:06:20.541
but with technology,

00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:24.071
were able to bring a city of 20 million people

00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:26.233
to a standstill.

00:06:26.233 --> 00:06:28.203
Ten people brought 20 million people

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:32.397
to a standstill, and this traveled around the world.

00:06:32.397 --> 00:06:38.707
This is what radicals can do with openness.

00:06:38.707 --> 00:06:41.225
This was done nearly four years ago.

00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:42.766
What could terrorists do today

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:45.679
with the technologies available that we have?

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:49.014
What will they do tomorrow?

00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:51.393
The ability of one to affect many

00:06:51.393 --> 00:06:53.809
is scaling exponentially,

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:58.090
and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.344
It's not just about terrorism, though.

00:07:00.344 --> 00:07:02.654
There's also been a big paradigm shift in crime.

00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:06.947
You see, you can now commit more crime as well.

00:07:06.947 --> 00:07:09.227
In the old days, it was a knife and a gun.

00:07:09.227 --> 00:07:11.619
Then criminals moved to robbing trains.

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:15.246
You could rob 200 people on a train, a great innovation.

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:16.960
Moving forward, the Internet

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.128
allowed things to scale even more.

00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:20.680
In fact, many of you will remember

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.416
the recent Sony PlayStation hack.

00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:28.913
In that incident, over 100 million people were robbed.

00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:30.639
Think about that.

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.105
When in the history of humanity

00:07:32.105 --> 00:07:34.307
has it ever been possible for one person

00:07:34.307 --> 00:07:39.706
to rob 100 million?

00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:41.505
Of course, it's not just about stealing things.

00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:43.792
There are other avenues of technology

00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:45.237
that criminals can exploit.

00:07:45.237 --> 00:07:48.529
Many of you will remember this super cute video

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:50.921
from the last TED,

00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:55.991
but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute.

00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:58.138
They don't all have drumsticks.

00:07:58.138 --> 00:07:59.996
Some can be armed with HD cameras

00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:02.499
and do countersurveillance on protesters,

00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:05.395
or, as in this little bit of movie magic,

00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:09.098
quadcopters can be loaded with firearms

00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:12.656
and automatic weapons.

00:08:12.656 --> 00:08:15.369
Little robots are cute when they play music to you.

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:18.137
When they swarm and chase you down the block

00:08:18.137 --> 00:08:21.769
to shoot you, a little bit less so.

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:23.818
Of course, criminals and terrorists weren't the first

00:08:23.818 --> 00:08:26.656
to give guns to robots. We know where that started.

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:27.992
But they're adapting quickly.

00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:29.972
Recently, the FBI arrested

00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:31.779
an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States,

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:33.700
who was planning on using these remote-controlled

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.627
drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives

00:08:36.627 --> 00:08:39.236
into government buildings in the United States.

00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:44.623
By the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour.

00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:46.997
Every time a new technology is being introduced,

00:08:46.997 --> 00:08:49.638
criminals are there to exploit it.

00:08:49.638 --> 00:08:51.085
We've all seen 3D printers.

00:08:51.085 --> 00:08:52.517
We know with them that you can print

00:08:52.517 --> 00:08:55.349
in many materials ranging from plastic

00:08:55.349 --> 00:08:59.714
to chocolate to metal and even concrete.

00:08:59.714 --> 00:09:01.100
With great precision

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.159
I actually was able to make this

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.708
just the other day, a very cute little ducky.

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.927
But I wonder to myself,

00:09:11.927 --> 00:09:18.840
for those people that strap bombs to their chests

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.921
and blow themselves up,

00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:23.678
how might they use 3D printers?

00:09:23.678 --> 00:09:27.791
Perhaps like this.

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:29.984
You see, if you can print in metal,

00:09:29.984 --> 00:09:33.331
you can print one of these,

00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:35.798
and in fact

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.733
you can also print one of these too.

00:09:45.533 --> 00:09:50.084
The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws.

00:09:50.084 --> 00:09:52.205
You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore.

00:09:52.205 --> 00:09:53.860
You just bring the 3D printer

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.695
and print the gun while you're here,

00:09:56.695 --> 00:09:59.800
and, of course, the magazines for your bullets.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.336
But as these get bigger in the future,

00:10:01.336 --> 00:10:03.481
what other items will you be able to print?

00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:06.769
The technologies are allowing bigger printers.

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:08.117
As we move forward,

00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:10.809
we'll see new technologies also, like the Internet of Things.

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:12.840
Every day we're connecting more and more of our lives

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.433
to the Internet, which means

00:10:15.433 --> 00:10:19.659
that the Internet of Things will soon be

00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:21.423
the Internet of Things To Be Hacked.

00:10:21.423 --> 00:10:23.446
All of the physical objects in our space

00:10:23.446 --> 00:10:26.310
are being transformed into information technologies,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.865
and that has a radical implication for our security,

00:10:29.865 --> 00:10:32.875
because more connections to more devices

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:35.454
means more vulnerabilities.

00:10:35.454 --> 00:10:37.202
Criminals understand this.

00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:39.081
Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this.

00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:42.244
If you control the code, you control the world.

00:10:42.244 --> 00:10:46.915
This is the future that awaits us.

00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:49.752
There has not yet been an operating system

00:10:49.752 --> 00:10:52.352
or a technology that hasn't been hacked.

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:55.090
That's troubling, since the human body itself

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.188
is now becoming an information technology.

00:10:58.188 --> 00:11:01.755
As we've seen here, we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs.

00:11:01.755 --> 00:11:04.307
Every year, thousands of cochlear implants,

00:11:04.307 --> 00:11:06.525
diabetic pumps, pacemakers

00:11:06.525 --> 00:11:08.740
and defibrillators are being implanted in people.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.388
In the United States, there are 60,000 people

00:11:11.388 --> 00:11:14.350
who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.714
The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance

00:11:17.714 --> 00:11:19.504
to give a shock to a heart

00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.854
in case a patient needs it.

00:11:21.854 --> 00:11:23.945
But if you don't need it,

00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:25.721
and somebody else gives you the shock,

00:11:25.721 --> 00:11:29.112
it's not a good thing.

00:11:29.112 --> 00:11:32.734
Of course, we're going to go even deeper than the human body.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.984
We're going down to the cellular level these days.

00:11:34.984 --> 00:11:37.127
Up until this point, all the technologies

00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:40.915
I've been talking about have been silicon-based, ones and zeroes,

00:11:40.922 --> 00:11:43.613
but there's another operating system out there:

00:11:43.613 --> 00:11:48.309
the original operating system, DNA.

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:52.749
And to hackers, DNA is just another operating system

00:11:52.749 --> 00:11:54.748
waiting to be hacked.

00:11:54.748 --> 00:11:56.244
It's a great challenge for them.

00:11:56.244 --> 00:11:57.645
There are people already working on hacking the software of life,

00:11:59.544 --> 00:12:02.501
and while most of them are doing this to great good

00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:03.902
and to help us all,

00:12:03.902 --> 00:12:07.438
some won't be.

00:12:07.438 --> 00:12:09.100
So how will criminals abuse this?

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.383
Well, with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things.

00:12:11.383 --> 00:12:14.579
For example, I predict that we will move away

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:17.690
from a plant-based narcotics world

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.749
to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore?

00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:23.866
You can just take the DNA code from marijuana

00:12:23.866 --> 00:12:28.658
or poppies or coca leaves

00:12:28.658 --> 00:12:30.978
and cut and past that gene

00:12:30.978 --> 00:12:33.655
and put it into yeast,

00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:35.057
and you can take those yeast

00:12:35.057 --> 00:12:38.329
and make them make the cocaine for you,

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:42.113
or the marijuana, or any other drug.

00:12:42.113 --> 00:12:43.897
So how we use yeast in the future

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:45.787
is going to be really interesting.

00:12:45.787 --> 00:12:48.131
In fact, we may have some really interesting bread and beer

00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:51.954
as we go into this next century.

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:55.952
The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously.

00:12:55.952 --> 00:12:58.340
It was proceeding at Moore's Law pace,

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.306
but then in 2008, something changed.

00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:01.978
The technologies got better,

00:13:01.978 --> 00:13:05.824
and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace

00:13:05.824 --> 00:13:08.942
five times that of Moore's Law.

00:13:08.942 --> 00:13:12.766
That has significant implications for us.

00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:15.509
It took us 30 years to get from

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:17.665
the introduction of the personal computer

00:13:17.665 --> 00:13:19.894
to the level of cybercrime we have today,

00:13:19.894 --> 00:13:23.521
but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly,

00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:25.185
and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do,

00:13:25.185 --> 00:13:28.054
we may get there a lot faster

00:13:28.054 --> 00:13:29.923
with biocrime in the future.

00:13:29.923 --> 00:13:31.962
It will be easy for anybody to go ahead

00:13:31.962 --> 00:13:33.842
and print their own bio-virus,

00:13:33.842 --> 00:13:36.604
enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax,

00:13:36.604 --> 00:13:38.362
weaponized flu.

00:13:38.362 --> 00:13:41.151
We recently saw a case where some researchers

00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:46.177
made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.

00:13:46.177 --> 00:13:49.643
It already has a 70 percent mortality rate

00:13:49.643 --> 00:13:51.233
if you get it, but it's hard to get.

00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:54.041
Engineers, by moving around a small number

00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:55.697
of genetic changes,

00:13:55.697 --> 00:13:57.396
were able to weaponize it

00:13:57.396 --> 00:14:00.658
and make it much more easy for human beings to catch,

00:14:00.658 --> 00:14:02.841
so that not thousands of people would die,

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.554
but tens of millions.

00:14:04.554 --> 00:14:07.044
You see, you can go ahead and create

00:14:07.044 --> 00:14:09.025
new pandemics, and the researchers who did this

00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:10.537
were so proud of their accomplishments,

00:14:10.537 --> 00:14:12.426
they wanted to publish it openly

00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:14.529
so that everybody could see this

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:18.673
and get access to this information.

00:14:18.673 --> 00:14:20.468
But it goes deeper than that.

00:14:20.468 --> 00:14:22.410
DNA researcher Andrew Hessel

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.807
has pointed out quite rightly

00:14:23.807 --> 00:14:26.090
that if you can use cancer treatments,

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.218
modern cancer treatments,

00:14:27.218 --> 00:14:30.167
to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells

00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:31.823
around it intact,

00:14:31.823 --> 00:14:35.967
then you can also go after any one person's cell.

00:14:35.967 --> 00:14:37.945
Personalized cancer treatments

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:40.559
are the flip side of personalized bioweapons,

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:43.945
which means you can attack any one individual,

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:48.128
including all the people in this picture.

00:14:48.128 --> 00:14:52.256
How will we protect them in the future?

00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:55.066
What to do? What to do about all this?

00:14:55.066 --> 00:14:57.561
That's what I get asked all the time.

00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:59.148
For those of you who follow me on Twitter,

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:03.678
I will be tweeting out the answer later on today. (Laughter)

00:15:03.678 --> 00:15:06.313
Actually, it's a bit more complex than that,

00:15:06.313 --> 00:15:08.392
and there are no magic bullets.

00:15:08.392 --> 00:15:10.104
I don't have all the answers,

00:15:10.104 --> 00:15:11.768
but I know a few things.

00:15:11.768 --> 00:15:14.465
In the wake of 9/11,

00:15:14.465 --> 00:15:17.255
the best security minds

00:15:17.255 --> 00:15:19.239
put together all their innovation

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:23.378
and this is what they created for security.

00:15:23.378 --> 00:15:27.399
If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:31.115
from the coming robopocalypse — (Laughter)

00:15:31.115 --> 00:15:34.067
— uh, you may want to have a backup plan. (Laughter)

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:40.266
Just saying. Just think about that. (Applause)

00:15:40.266 --> 00:15:43.185
Law enforcement is currently a closed system.

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:45.987
It's nation-based, while the threat is international.

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:49.935
Policing doesn't scale globally. At least, it hasn't,

00:15:49.935 --> 00:15:54.218
and our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences

00:15:54.218 --> 00:15:57.329
are outdated in the new world into which we're moving.

00:15:57.329 --> 00:15:59.605
So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats,

00:15:59.605 --> 00:16:02.028
like attacking a president or a prime minister?

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:04.165
This would be the natural government response,

00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:06.442
to hide away all our government leaders

00:16:06.442 --> 00:16:08.253
in hermetically sealed bubbles.

00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:10.085
But this is not going to work.

00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:13.221
The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial.

00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:16.466
Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future.

00:16:16.466 --> 00:16:19.919
So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this.

00:16:19.923 --> 00:16:21.851
What happens if we were to take

00:16:21.851 --> 00:16:25.051
the President's DNA, or a king or queen's,

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:27.387
and put it out to a group of a few hundred

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:29.283
trusted researchers so they could

00:16:29.283 --> 00:16:32.219
study that DNA and do penetration testing against it

00:16:32.219 --> 00:16:34.427
as a means of helping our leaders?

00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:36.684
Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand?

00:16:36.684 --> 00:16:39.346
Or, controversially, and not without its risks,

00:16:39.346 --> 00:16:42.205
what happens if we just gave it to the whole public?

00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:45.770
Then we could all be engaged in helping.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.386
We've already seen examples of this working well.

00:16:48.386 --> 00:16:51.314
The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project

00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:52.986
is staffed by journalists and citizens

00:16:52.986 --> 00:16:54.722
where they are crowd-sourcing

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:57.335
what dictators and terrorists are doing

00:16:57.335 --> 00:16:59.017
with public funds around the world,

00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:00.684
and, in a more dramatic case,

00:17:00.684 --> 00:17:02.988
we've seen in Mexico,

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.612
a country that has been racked

00:17:04.612 --> 00:17:08.625
by 50,000 narcotics-related murders

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.391
in the past six years.

00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:11.766
They're killing so many people

00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:14.046
they can't even afford to bury them all

00:17:14.046 --> 00:17:15.815
in anything but these unmarked graves

00:17:15.815 --> 00:17:19.220
like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.328
What can we do about this? The government has proven ineffective.

00:17:22.328 --> 00:17:25.465
So in Mexico, citizens, at great risk to themselves,

00:17:25.465 --> 00:17:29.544
are fighting back to build an effective solution.

00:17:29.544 --> 00:17:33.728
They're crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers.

00:17:33.728 --> 00:17:35.520
Whether or not you realize it,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.205
we are at the dawn of a technological arms race,

00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:40.983
an arms race between people

00:17:40.983 --> 00:17:42.745
who are using technology for good

00:17:42.745 --> 00:17:44.953
and those who are using it for ill.

00:17:44.953 --> 00:17:49.314
The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now.

00:17:49.314 --> 00:17:52.747
I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are.

00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:54.850
My personal belief is that,

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.795
rather than having a small, elite force

00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:58.835
of highly trained government agents

00:17:58.835 --> 00:18:00.556
here to protect us all,

00:18:00.556 --> 00:18:02.259
we're much better off

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:04.338
having average and ordinary citizens

00:18:04.338 --> 00:18:06.762
approaching this problem as a group

00:18:06.762 --> 00:18:08.075
and seeing what we can do.

00:18:08.075 --> 00:18:09.324
If we all do our part,

00:18:09.324 --> 00:18:11.651
I think we'll be in a much better space.

00:18:11.651 --> 00:18:13.118
The tools to change the world

00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:14.811
are in everybody's hands.

00:18:14.811 --> 00:18:17.650
How we use them is not just up to me,

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.132
it's up to all of us.

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.765
This was a technology I would frequently deploy

00:18:22.765 --> 00:18:24.686
as a police officer.

00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:28.461
This technology has become outdated in our current world.

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:31.186
It doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally,

00:18:31.186 --> 00:18:33.258
and it surely doesn't work virtually.

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:36.526
We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism.

00:18:36.526 --> 00:18:40.873
They call for a shift to a more open form

00:18:40.873 --> 00:18:45.770
and a more participatory form of law enforcement.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.409
So I invite you to join me.

00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:53.597
After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals.
