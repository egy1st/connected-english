00:00:00.908 --> 00:00:02.500
I'd like to talk about my dad.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.076
My dad has Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:08.636
He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago,

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:12.023
and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.

00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:16.348
Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating,

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:20.236
he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:24.100
or when it is, and it's been really, really hard.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.612
My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life,

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:31.140
and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.277
My dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia,

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:43.926
and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:46.076
That's a lot of people.

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:52.692
Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia,

00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:56.540
the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.285
And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things:

00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:05.740
We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me."

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.373
Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia,

00:01:09.373 --> 00:01:14.189
and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.940
I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.500
Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.820
I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.724
that's what the research says you should do.

00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:38.212
But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you.

00:01:38.212 --> 00:01:41.724
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:44.164
That's what happened with my dad.

00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:50.012
My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.

00:01:50.012 --> 00:01:53.987
(Laughter)

00:01:54.018 --> 00:01:56.136
He got dementia anyway.

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:58.573
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.

00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:04.333
Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:08.082
So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:10.036
Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father,

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:15.284
and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation:

00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:21.276
I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength,

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:28.075
and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person.

00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:33.764
Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.

00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:37.900
You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.188
It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening.

00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:44.812
And reading is just about impossible.

00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:48.268
When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training,

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:53.772
they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:58.284
With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.

00:02:58.284 --> 00:03:03.789
He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like.

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:08.444
He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes,

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:10.819
he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.812
But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?

00:03:14.812 --> 00:03:20.308
I'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot.

00:03:20.308 --> 00:03:24.564
Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:27.668
Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color?

00:03:27.668 --> 00:03:31.868
So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.

00:03:31.868 --> 00:03:37.174
I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.

00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:42.796
I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box.

00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:44.943
(Laughter)

00:03:44.943 --> 00:03:52.025
And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob.

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:56.668
But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it.

00:03:56.668 --> 00:04:00.157
Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do,

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:05.150
the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.760
They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.652
easier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease.

00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:17.164
That all seems like win to me.

00:04:17.164 --> 00:04:20.187
I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:24.708
A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms,

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:28.982
as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance,

00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:34.539
you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.124
They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move.

00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:40.564
So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.

00:04:40.564 --> 00:04:45.225
I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it,

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:47.207
I'll still be able to be mobile.

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:51.149
I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:55.278
so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around.

00:04:55.278 --> 00:05:00.879
Finally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.646
My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:10.526
I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills,

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:15.006
but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons,

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:18.717
he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:23.422
And that love makes us want to be around him, even now.

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:24.806
even when it's so hard.

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:28.109
When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world,

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:30.398
his naked heart still shines.

00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:34.317
I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.

00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:37.365
And what I need now is to learn to be like that.

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:42.838
I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive.

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:45.357
I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.

00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:49.221
What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me.

00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:52.671
But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.

00:05:52.671 --> 00:05:54.421
Thank you.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:06:03.341
(Applause)
