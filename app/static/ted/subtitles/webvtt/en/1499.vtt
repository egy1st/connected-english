WEBVTT

00:00:00.508 --> 00:00:01.540
In the ocean,

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.380
what is the common point

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.148
between oil, plastic and radioactivity?

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:14.365
On the top line, this is the BP oil spill:

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:16.388
billions of barrels of oil gushing

00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:17.757
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:19.932
The middle line is millions of tons of

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:22.336
plastic debris accumulating in our ocean,

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:25.056
and the third line is radioactive material

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:27.352
leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:28.690
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.273
Well, the three big problems have in common

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:36.088
that they are man-made problems

00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:38.144
but they are controlled by natural forces.

00:00:38.144 --> 00:00:42.552
This should make us feel very, terribly awful

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:44.879
as much as it should make us feel hopeful,

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.688
because if we have the power to create these problems,

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:49.368
we may as well have the power

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:50.800
to remediate these problems.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.744
But what about natural forces?

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:55.727
Well, that's exactly what I want to talk about today,

00:00:55.727 --> 00:00:58.032
is how we can use these natural forces

00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:03.255
to remediate these man-made problems.

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:04.481
When the BP oil spill happened,

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.246
I was working at MIT, and I was in charge

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:09.643
of developing an oil spill-cleaning technology.

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:13.056
And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:15.393
and meet some fishermen and see

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:17.184
the terrible conditions in which they were working.

00:01:17.184 --> 00:01:20.265
More than 700 of these boats,

00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:22.572
which are fishermen boats repurposed

00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:25.033
with oil absorbent in white

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.428
and oil containment in orange, were used,

00:01:27.428 --> 00:01:30.687
but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface,

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:32.399
and the health of the cleaners

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.312
were very deeply affected.

00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:38.306
I was working on a very interesting technology

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.615
at MIT, but it was a very long-term view

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:42.049
of how to develop technology,

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.567
and it was going to be a very expensive technology,

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:47.015
and also it would be patented.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.647
So I wanted to develop something that we could

00:01:49.647 --> 00:01:53.047
develop very fast, that would be cheap,

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:55.487
and that would be open-source, so, because

00:01:55.487 --> 00:01:57.655
oil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.271
and that would be using renewable energy.

00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:02.671
So I quit my dream job,

00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:04.287
and I moved to New Orleans,

00:02:04.287 --> 00:02:07.231
and I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.303
Currently, what they were doing is

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:10.949
that they were using these small fishing boats,

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.109
and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt.

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.822
If you're using the exact same amount of surface

00:02:17.822 --> 00:02:19.975
of oil absorbent, but you're just paying attention

00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:22.308
to natural patterns, and if you're going up the winds,

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.076
you can collect a lot more material.

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:26.197
If you're multiplying the rig,

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:28.772
so you multiply how many layers of absorbent

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:30.674
you're using, you can collect a lot more.

00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:33.275
But it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:36.907
against the winds, the surface currents and the waves.

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.371
These are enormous forces.

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:41.394
So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:43.647
of sailing and tacking of the wind

00:02:43.647 --> 00:02:46.265
to capture or intercept the oil

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:47.607
that is drifting down the wind.

00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:51.104
So this didn't require any invention.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.807
We just took a simple sailing boat

00:02:52.807 --> 00:02:54.704
and we tried to pull something long and heavy,

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:57.016
but as we tacked back and forth,

00:02:57.016 --> 00:02:58.687
what we lost was two things:

00:02:58.687 --> 00:03:02.064
we were losing pulling power and direction.

00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:05.896
And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder

00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:07.408
from the back of the boat to the front,

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:09.151
would we have better control?

00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:11.367
So I built this small sailing robot

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:12.615
with the rudder at the front,

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:15.080
and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.287
so that's a four-meter-long object just to pull,

00:03:18.287 --> 00:03:21.199
and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder,

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.551
I could control four meters of absorbent.

00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:27.367
Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot,

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.831
and so you see the robot has

00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:31.503
a front rudder here.

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.719
Normally it's at the back.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.334
And, playing, I realized that the maneuverability

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:37.614
of this was really amazing,

00:03:37.614 --> 00:03:39.542
and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second,

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.214
more maneuverable than a normal boat.

00:03:41.214 --> 00:03:44.078
Then I started publishing online, and

00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:46.990
some friends from Korea, they started being

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.719
interested in this, and we made a boat

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.527
which has a front rudder and a back rudder,

00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:52.585
so we started interacting with this,

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:54.704
and it was slightly better,

00:03:54.704 --> 00:03:56.628
although it was very small and a bit off balance,

00:03:56.628 --> 00:03:57.708
but then we thought,

00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:59.596
what if we have more than two points of control?

00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:01.588
What if the entire boat becomes a point of control?

00:04:01.588 --> 00:04:03.708
What if the entire boat changes shape?

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:06.148
So â€” (Applause)

00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:08.044
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:04:08.044 --> 00:04:10.629
And so that's the beginning of Protei,

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.268
and that's the first boat in history

00:04:12.268 --> 00:04:13.892
that completely changed the shape of the hull

00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:15.062
in order to control it,

00:04:15.062 --> 00:04:17.948
and the properties of sailing that we get

00:04:17.948 --> 00:04:20.846
are very superior compared to a normal boat.

00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:23.500
When we're turning, we have the feeling of surfing,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.616
and the way it's going up-wind, it's very efficient.

00:04:27.616 --> 00:04:30.316
This is low speed, low wind speed,

00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:32.389
and the maneuverability is very increased,

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.700
and here I'm going to do a small jibe,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.796
and look at the position of the sail.

00:04:36.796 --> 00:04:40.396
What's happening is that, because the boat changes shape,

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:42.736
the position of the front sail and the main sail

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:43.913
are different to the wind.

00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:45.796
We're catching wind from both sides.

00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:48.055
And this is exactly what we're looking [for]

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:49.839
if we want to pull something long and heavy.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:52.228
We don't want to lose pulling power, nor direction.

00:04:52.228 --> 00:04:55.068
So, I wanted to know if this was possible

00:04:55.068 --> 00:04:56.539
to put this at an industrial level,

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.051
so we made a large boat with a large sail,

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:01.747
and with a very light hull, inflatable,

00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:03.252
very small footprint,

00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:06.076
so we have a very big size and power ratio.

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:09.307
After this, we wanted to see if we could

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:11.604
implement this and automate the system,

00:05:11.604 --> 00:05:13.276
so we used the same system but we added

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:15.646
a structure to it so we could activate the machine.

00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:18.860
So, we used the same bladder-inflated system,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.844
and we took it for testing.

00:05:20.844 --> 00:05:23.155
So this is happening in the Netherlands.

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:25.686
We tried in the water without any skin or ballast

00:05:25.686 --> 00:05:28.257
just to see how it works.

00:05:28.257 --> 00:05:30.942
And then we mounted a camera for controlling it,

00:05:30.942 --> 00:05:33.844
but quickly we saw that we would need

00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:35.993
a lot more weight at the bottom,

00:05:35.993 --> 00:05:37.530
so we had to take it back to the lab,

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.618
and then we built a skin around it,

00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:42.905
we put batteries, remote controllers, and then

00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:44.353
we put it in the water and then we

00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:47.514
let it go in the water and see how well it would work,

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.938
so let some rope out, and hope it's going to work,

00:05:50.938 --> 00:05:54.161
and it worked okay, but we still have a long way.

00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.597
Our small prototype has given us good insight

00:05:56.597 --> 00:05:57.943
that it's working very well,

00:05:57.943 --> 00:06:00.628
but we still need to work a lot more on this.

00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:04.497
So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:05.945
of sailing technology.

00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:07.872
We went from a back rudder to a front rudder

00:06:07.872 --> 00:06:09.883
to two rudders to multiple rudders

00:06:09.883 --> 00:06:11.554
to the whole boat changing shape,

00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:13.410
and the more we are moving forward,

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.457
and the more the design looks simple and cute. (Laughter)

00:06:19.457 --> 00:06:21.834
But I wanted to show you a fish because --

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:24.904
In fact, it's very different from a fish.

00:06:24.904 --> 00:06:29.304
A fish will move because -- by changing like this,

00:06:29.304 --> 00:06:32.403
but our boat is propelled by the wind still,

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:34.810
and the hull controls the trajectory.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.464
So I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.849
Protei Number Eight. It's not the last one,

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.098
but it's a good one for making demos.

00:06:43.098 --> 00:06:45.374
So the first thing as I show you in the video is

00:06:45.374 --> 00:06:49.361
that we may be able to control the trajectory

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:50.825
of a sailing boat better,

00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:53.886
or we may be able to never be in irons,

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:55.186
so never facing the wind,

00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:57.301
we always can catch the wind from both sides.

00:06:57.301 --> 00:06:59.861
But new properties of a sailing boat.

00:06:59.861 --> 00:07:04.117
So if you're looking at the boat from this side,

00:07:04.117 --> 00:07:06.325
this might remind you of an airplane profile.

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:08.738
An airplane, when you're moving in this direction,

00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:11.003
starts to lift, and that's how it takes off.

00:07:11.003 --> 00:07:13.178
Now, if you're taking the same system,

00:07:13.178 --> 00:07:15.546
and you're putting vertical, you're bending,

00:07:15.546 --> 00:07:17.546
and if you're moving this way forward,

00:07:17.546 --> 00:07:20.673
your instinct will tell you that you might go this way,

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:22.480
but if you're moving fast enough,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.499
you might create what we call lateral lift,

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:27.424
so we could get further or closer to the wind.

00:07:27.424 --> 00:07:30.368
Other property is this:

00:07:30.368 --> 00:07:33.529
A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:35.521
and a rudder at the back,

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.071
and these two things are what creates most

00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:40.725
resistance and turbulence behind the boat,

00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:42.996
but because this doesn't have either

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:44.532
a centerboard or a rudder,

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:47.404
we hope that if we keep working on this hull design

00:07:47.404 --> 00:07:49.596
we can improve and have less resistance.

00:07:49.596 --> 00:07:52.251
The other thing is, most boats, when they reach

00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.475
a certain speed, and they are going on waves,

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:56.914
they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water,

00:07:56.914 --> 00:08:00.211
and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.

00:08:00.211 --> 00:08:02.299
But if we're going with the flow,

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:04.435
if we pay attention to natural patterns

00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.046
instead of trying to be strong,

00:08:06.046 --> 00:08:08.445
but if you're going with the flow, we may absorb

00:08:08.445 --> 00:08:11.642
a lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy,

00:08:11.642 --> 00:08:14.799
to actually save some energy to move forward.

00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:18.950
So we may have developed the technology

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.617
which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy,

00:08:21.617 --> 00:08:25.834
but the idea is, what is the purpose of technology

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:27.780
if it doesn't reach the right hands?

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.726
Normal technology or innovation happens like this:

00:08:30.726 --> 00:08:33.156
Somebody has an interesting idea,

00:08:33.156 --> 00:08:35.118
some other scientist or engineer,

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:37.622
they take it to the next level, they make a theory about it

00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:38.878
and maybe they patent it,

00:08:38.878 --> 00:08:41.414
and then some industry will make a contract

00:08:41.414 --> 00:08:44.558
of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it,

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:46.654
and then, eventually, a buyer will buy it,

00:08:46.654 --> 00:08:49.422
and we hope that they are going to use [it] for a good purpose.

00:08:49.422 --> 00:08:53.118
What we really want is that this innovation happens

00:08:53.118 --> 00:08:55.454
continuously. The inventor and engineers

00:08:55.454 --> 00:08:57.190
and also the manufacturers and everybody

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.574
works at the same time, but this would be sterile

00:08:59.574 --> 00:09:03.206
if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process.

00:09:03.206 --> 00:09:05.246
What you really want is not a sequential,

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:06.638
not parallel development.

00:09:06.638 --> 00:09:08.247
You want to have a network of innovation.

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:10.326
You want everybody, like we're doing now,

00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:13.495
to work at the same time, and that can only happen

00:09:13.495 --> 00:09:16.886
if these people all together decide to share the information,

00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:19.826
and that's exactly what open hardware is about.

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:23.495
It's to replace competition by collaboration.

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:27.646
It's to transform any new product into a new market.

00:09:27.646 --> 00:09:30.087
So what is open hardware?

00:09:30.087 --> 00:09:31.870
Essentially, open hardware is a license.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.942
It's just an intellectual property setup.

00:09:33.942 --> 00:09:36.966
It means that everybody is free to use,

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:40.119
modify and distribute, and in exchange

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:41.397
we only ask for two things:

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:43.492
The name is credited -- the name of the project --

00:09:43.492 --> 00:09:46.228
and also the people who make improvement,

00:09:46.228 --> 00:09:47.556
they share back with the community.

00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:48.892
So it's a very simple condition.

00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:52.916
And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans,

00:09:52.916 --> 00:09:55.092
but quickly after I wanted to publish and share

00:09:55.092 --> 00:09:56.836
this information, so I made a Kickstarter,

00:09:56.836 --> 00:09:59.076
which is a crowd-fundraising platform,

00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:01.508
and in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars.

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:04.820
With this money, I hired a team of young engineers

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.348
from all over the world, and we rented a factory

00:10:07.348 --> 00:10:08.868
in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

00:10:08.868 --> 00:10:12.029
We were peer-learning, we were engineering,

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:15.212
we were making things, prototyping,

00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:17.437
but most importantly we were trying our prototypes

00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:19.132
in the water as often as possible,

00:10:19.132 --> 00:10:22.284
to fail as quickly as possible, to learn from.

00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:24.796
This is a proud member of Protei from Korea,

00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:27.256
and on the right side, this is a multiple-masts

00:10:27.256 --> 00:10:29.189
design proposed by a team in Mexico.

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:32.374
This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine

00:10:32.374 --> 00:10:34.969
in New York, and so she decided to prototype

00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:37.499
this idea that she saw, and she documented

00:10:37.499 --> 00:10:38.928
every step of the process,

00:10:38.928 --> 00:10:41.177
and she published it on Instructables,

00:10:41.177 --> 00:10:43.409
which is a website for sharing inventions.

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:45.304
Less than one week after,

00:10:45.304 --> 00:10:49.314
this is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:51.644
They made it, but they eventually published

00:10:51.644 --> 00:10:52.768
a simplified design.

00:10:52.768 --> 00:10:54.697
They also made it into an Instructable,

00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:56.432
and in less than one week, they had

00:10:56.432 --> 00:10:59.192
almost 10,000 views, and they got many new friends.

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:02.096
We're working on also simpler technology,

00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:04.047
not that complex, with younger people

00:11:04.047 --> 00:11:05.616
and also older people,

00:11:05.616 --> 00:11:08.767
like this dinosaur is from Mexico. (Laughter)

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:11.584
So Protei is now an international network

00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:14.432
of innovation for selling technology

00:11:14.432 --> 00:11:16.224
using this shape-shifting hull.

00:11:16.224 --> 00:11:20.259
And what puts us together is that we have a common,

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:23.048
at least, global understanding

00:11:23.048 --> 00:11:26.120
of what the word "business" is, or what it should be.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.353
This is how most work today.

00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:30.727
Business as usual is saying, what's most important

00:11:30.727 --> 00:11:32.966
is to make lots of profit, and you'll be using

00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:35.791
technology for that, and people will be your work force,

00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:37.039
instrumentalized,

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:39.711
and environment is usually the last priority.

00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:43.589
It will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:45.820
and, say, increase your price tag.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.349
What we're trying to do, or what we believe,

00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:50.765
because this is how we believe the world really works,

00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:52.935
is that without the environment you have nothing.

00:11:52.935 --> 00:11:55.820
We have the people so we need to protect each other, yes,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.484
and we're a technology company,

00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:02.669
and profit is necessary to make this happen. (Applause)

00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:06.274
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:12:06.274 --> 00:12:10.355
If we have the courage to understand or accept

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.275
that this actually how the world really works,

00:12:12.275 --> 00:12:15.292
and this is the order of priority that we need to choose,

00:12:15.292 --> 00:12:17.433
then it makes obvious why we need

00:12:17.433 --> 00:12:19.772
to choose open hardware for developing environmental

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.652
technology, because we need to share information.

00:12:21.652 --> 00:12:23.732
What's next for us?

00:12:23.732 --> 00:12:26.267
So, this small machine that you've seen,

00:12:26.267 --> 00:12:28.411
we're hoping to make small toys like

00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:31.904
one-meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade --

00:12:31.904 --> 00:12:34.890
so replace the remote control parts by Androids,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.669
so the mobile phone, and Arduino micro-controller,

00:12:38.669 --> 00:12:39.892
so you could be controlling this

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:41.380
from your mobile phone, your tablet.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.946
Then what we want to do is create six-meter versions

00:12:44.946 --> 00:12:47.274
so we can test the maximum performance of these machines,

00:12:47.274 --> 00:12:48.838
so we can go at very, very high speed.

00:12:48.838 --> 00:12:50.101
So imagine yourself.

00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:53.286
You are laying down in a flexible torpedo,

00:12:53.286 --> 00:12:54.780
sailing at high speed,

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.625
controlling the shape of the hull with your legs

00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:59.287
and controlling the sail with your arms.

00:12:59.287 --> 00:13:03.612
So that's what we're looking for developing. (Applause)

00:13:03.612 --> 00:13:05.826
And we replace the human being --

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:07.970
to go, for example, for measuring radioactivity,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.149
you don't want a human to be sailing those robots --

00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:13.484
with batteries, motors, micro-controllers and sensors.

00:13:13.484 --> 00:13:17.418
This is what our teammates, we dream of at night.

00:13:17.418 --> 00:13:20.070
We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills,

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.047
or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean,

00:13:24.047 --> 00:13:27.481
or we can have swarms of our machines

00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:30.663
controlled by multi-player video game engines

00:13:30.663 --> 00:13:32.614
to control many of these machines,

00:13:32.614 --> 00:13:34.365
to monitor coral reefs

00:13:34.365 --> 00:13:36.504
or to monitor fisheries.

00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:40.994
Our hope is that we can use open hardware technology

00:13:40.994 --> 00:13:44.525
to better understand and protect our oceans.

00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:48.237
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:13:48.237 --> 00:14:07.499
(Applause)
