(Applause)

00:11:05.953 --> 00:11:07.520
Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.272
That's amazing.

00:11:09.272 --> 00:11:12.810
(Applause)

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.440
You just don't hear that every day.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.391
(Laughter)

00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:18.792
Usman, the official story is that

00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:20.272
you learned to play the guitar

00:11:20.272 --> 00:11:22.255
by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.

00:11:22.255 --> 00:11:25.427
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I --

00:11:25.427 --> 00:11:27.723
That was the first thing I learned,

00:11:27.723 --> 00:11:30.354
and then I started progressing to other things.

00:11:30.354 --> 00:11:33.393
And I started watching Kaki King a lot,

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:37.146
and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,

00:11:37.146 --> 00:11:39.290
so then I started watching his videos,

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.534
and it's very surreal right now to be --

00:11:42.534 --> 00:11:44.695
(Laughter)

00:11:44.695 --> 00:11:49.395
(Applause)

00:11:49.395 --> 00:11:51.167
CA: Was that piece just now,

00:11:51.167 --> 00:11:54.357
that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?

00:11:54.357 --> 00:11:55.453
UR: I'd never learned it before,

00:11:55.453 --> 00:11:58.470
but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.861
so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.

00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:05.549
And it finally happened, so ...

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:07.001
(Laughter)

00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:08.453
CA: Preston, from your point of view,

00:12:08.453 --> 00:12:10.317
I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?

00:12:10.317 --> 00:12:13.165
How does it feel to see someone like this

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:17.865
come along taking your art and doing so much with it?

00:12:17.865 --> 00:12:20.214
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing,

00:12:20.214 --> 00:12:23.509
and I feel really proud, really honored.

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:29.013
And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.

00:12:29.013 --> 00:12:31.933
(Laughter)

00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:37.245
CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?

00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:39.677
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?

00:12:39.677 --> 00:12:42.459
PR: We haven't prepared anything.

00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:46.773
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.

00:12:46.773 --> 00:12:50.334
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds,

00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:51.757
and you have another 30 or 40 seconds,

00:12:51.757 --> 00:12:53.285
and we just see that, I just think --

00:12:53.285 --> 00:12:56.101
I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.

00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:58.013
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.

00:12:58.013 --> 00:13:01.445
(Applause)

00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:09.445
(Laughter)

00:13:15.329 --> 00:16:01.860
(Music)

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:16.557
(Applause)
