WEBVTT

00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:02.092
I'm going to start with a little story.

00:00:02.092 --> 00:00:05.204
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:09.755
I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:13.716
over four months, slowly wasting away until

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:15.604
I was basically a famine victim

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:17.628
with an unquenchable thirst.

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:21.237
I had basically digested away my body.

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:25.531
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.576
my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain

00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:31.560
in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.816
of water and drinking like a dog.

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:38.328
That night, I was taken into the emergency room

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:42.209
and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:48.144
And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:53.600
insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.111
And something festered inside me after this happened.

00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:02.624
What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:04.477
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease

00:01:04.477 --> 00:01:07.852
where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:10.893
that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen

00:01:10.893 --> 00:01:15.365
had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:17.423
and then kill the cells that make insulin.

00:01:17.423 --> 00:01:19.733
And this is what I thought for a long period of time,

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:23.781
and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit,

00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:26.703
the microbes that do bad things.

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:29.771
And that's where I need my assistant here now.

00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:32.209
You may recognize her.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.889
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks,

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.130
and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.577
and they sell toys, giant microbes.

00:01:45.577 --> 00:01:48.962
And here we go!

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:53.717
So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:58.145
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.

00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:01.852
(Laughter)

00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:08.233
So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.576
they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:14.545
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us,

00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:16.192
and that's what I was focusing on.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:20.753
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes,

00:02:20.753 --> 00:02:25.273
and those microbes actually do us good much of the time,

00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:26.393
rather than killing us.

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:29.584
And so, we've known about this for some period of time.

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:33.161
People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us,

00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:34.953
I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...

00:02:34.953 --> 00:02:37.051
(Laughter)

00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.993
The microbes that cover us.

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:42.153
And if you look at them in the microscope,

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:45.557
you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells

00:02:45.557 --> 00:02:49.025
of microbes on us as we have human cells.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:53.776
There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.

00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:58.097
We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.

00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:02.697
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms,

00:03:02.697 --> 00:03:04.977
just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.

00:03:04.977 --> 00:03:07.557
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.

00:03:07.557 --> 00:03:10.085
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.621
and to understand them is to look at their DNA.

00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:14.763
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years,

00:03:14.763 --> 00:03:18.645
using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places,

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:21.549
including the human body, reading the DNA sequence

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.169
and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.335
the microbes that are in a particular place.

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:29.198
And what's amazing, when you use this technology,

00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:32.358
for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:33.494
in a sea of microbes.

00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:38.605
There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.

00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:43.958
We have millions of genes of microbes in our human

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.605
microbiome covering us.

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:49.110
And so this microbial diversity differs between people,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.246
and what people have been thinking about in the last 10,

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:55.366
maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes,

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:57.414
this microbial cloud in and on us,

00:03:57.414 --> 00:04:01.294
and the variation between us, may be responsible

00:04:01.294 --> 00:04:04.864
for some of the health and illness differences between us.

00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:07.987
And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.

00:04:07.987 --> 00:04:11.393
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:13.774
for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen,

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:18.165
but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes

00:04:18.165 --> 00:04:19.662
that live in and on you.

00:04:19.662 --> 00:04:22.366
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:26.399
in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.638
of immune response and led to me killing the cells

00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:30.859
that make insulin in my body.

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:33.955
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is,

00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:37.747
what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques

00:04:37.747 --> 00:04:41.406
in particular, to study the microbial cloud

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.980
that lives in and on us.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.444
And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.

00:04:45.444 --> 00:04:48.238
My first personal experience with studying the microbes

00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:52.388
on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave,

00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:54.188
right around the corner from here at Georgetown.

00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:57.205
I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be

00:04:57.205 --> 00:04:59.748
the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk,

00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:02.238
and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing

00:05:02.238 --> 00:05:05.588
a study of ileal transplants in people.

00:05:05.588 --> 00:05:09.564
And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.

00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:12.628
And so I started a collaboration with this person,

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:15.901
Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes

00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:20.374
that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:23.516
And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:25.766
that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story

00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:28.990
is something really striking that they did at the beginning

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.013
of this project.

00:05:30.013 --> 00:05:34.378
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor

00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:36.661
and they have a recipient who might have a problem

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:39.286
with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease,

00:05:39.286 --> 00:05:42.846
and they sterilized the donor ileum.

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:47.141
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.

00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:49.805
They did this because this was common practice

00:05:49.805 --> 00:05:52.934
in medicine, even though it was obvious

00:05:52.934 --> 00:05:55.072
that this was not a good idea.

00:05:55.072 --> 00:05:58.077
And fortunately, in the course of this project,

00:05:58.077 --> 00:06:00.640
the transplant surgeons and the other people

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.061
decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.

00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:09.206
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:13.206
community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor,

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.782
and theoretically that might help the people who are

00:06:16.782 --> 00:06:18.871
receiving this ileal transplant.

00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:22.173
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.478
In the last few years there's been a great expansion

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:28.656
in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.

00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:30.464
There's something called the Human Microbiome Project

00:06:30.464 --> 00:06:32.320
that's going on in the United States,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.854
and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:38.043
And when people have done a variety of studies,

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:41.675
they have learned things such as, when a baby is

00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:44.659
born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:45.851
microbes from your mother.

00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:48.907
There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections,

00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:52.938
some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization

00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:55.330
when you carve a baby out of its mother

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.155
rather than being delivered through the birth canal.

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:01.604
And a variety of other studies have shown that the

00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:03.411
microbial community that lives in and on us

00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:05.674
helps in development of the immune system,

00:07:05.674 --> 00:07:10.619
helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism,

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:13.699
and determining our metabolic rate, probably

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.874
determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:18.810
in a variety of ways.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.866
And so, these studies have documented or suggested

00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:26.153
out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community,

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:30.690
this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.274
And one area that I think is very interesting,

00:07:34.274 --> 00:07:36.940
which many of you may have now that we've thrown

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.870
microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.829
So people are really into cleanliness, right?

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.808
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters,

00:07:45.808 --> 00:07:48.904
people are washing every part of them all of the time,

00:07:48.904 --> 00:07:53.930
we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.371
we take antibiotics excessively.

00:07:56.371 --> 00:08:00.210
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick,

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.474
but we should understand that when we pump chemicals

00:08:03.474 --> 00:08:06.371
and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing

00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:08.666
the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:11.666
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children,

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:14.895
has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:19.151
for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety

00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.055
of problems that are probably due to disruption

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:24.159
of the microbial community.

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:27.511
So the microbial community can go wrong

00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:29.223
whether we want it to or not,

00:08:29.223 --> 00:08:31.471
or we can kill it with antibiotics,

00:08:31.471 --> 00:08:33.567
but what can we do to restore it?

00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:36.679
I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.687
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:42.111
the microbial community that is in and on you.

00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:45.583
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.

00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:48.680
There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.575
probiotics to try and treat, prevent,

00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:54.087
necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.

00:08:54.087 --> 00:08:57.495
Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:00.015
And it may be that probiotics can help prevent

00:09:00.015 --> 00:09:03.151
the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.816
in these premature infants.

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:08.807
But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.

00:09:08.807 --> 00:09:12.162
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat

00:09:12.162 --> 00:09:16.949
have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them,

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:20.615
and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.

00:09:20.615 --> 00:09:24.543
So what can we do to restore our microbial community

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:27.742
when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?

00:09:27.742 --> 00:09:30.448
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is,

00:09:30.448 --> 00:09:34.462
they eat poo -- coprophagia.

00:09:34.462 --> 00:09:39.071
And it turns out that many veterinarians,

00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:41.080
old school veterinarians in particular,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.796
have been doing something called "poo tea,"

00:09:43.796 --> 00:09:49.601
not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other

00:09:49.601 --> 00:09:53.224
ailments in horses and cows and things like that,

00:09:53.224 --> 00:09:57.172
where you make tea from the poo from a healthy

00:09:57.172 --> 00:10:00.321
individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.

00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:04.761
Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side,

00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:07.300
and you can put your hand into its rumen,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.708
it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes

00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:13.637
directly into the mouth and through the entire

00:10:13.637 --> 00:10:17.285
top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system,

00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:21.405
so you may have heard in people they are now doing

00:10:21.405 --> 00:10:26.055
fecal transplants, where rather than delivering

00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:28.487
a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth,

00:10:28.487 --> 00:10:31.940
they are delivering a community of probiotics,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.420
a community of microbes from a healthy donor,

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.557
through the other end.

00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:39.887
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting

00:10:39.887 --> 00:10:42.253
certain intransigent infectious diseases

00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:46.092
like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay

00:10:46.092 --> 00:10:48.189
with people for years and years and years.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:53.052
Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces,

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:55.917
from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure

00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.778
systemic C. dif infections in some people.

00:10:58.778 --> 00:11:04.620
Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.079
the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people

00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:10.823
have come up with this same idea, is that

00:11:10.823 --> 00:11:14.711
the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.

00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:19.718
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.

00:11:19.718 --> 00:11:23.709
We should treat it carefully and with respect,

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:27.689
and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:32.597
or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness,

00:11:32.597 --> 00:11:35.814
without some real good justification.

00:11:35.814 --> 00:11:39.454
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now

00:11:39.454 --> 00:11:46.406
is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:48.941
and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:52.774
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little,

00:11:52.774 --> 00:11:55.198
and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.

00:11:55.198 --> 00:11:59.278
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes

00:11:59.278 --> 00:12:02.581
and their genes and see if there are differences.

00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:05.983
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not

00:12:05.983 --> 00:12:08.607
just correlative differences, but causative.

00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:12.077
Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals

00:12:12.077 --> 00:12:15.286
are also helping do this, but people are now using

00:12:15.286 --> 00:12:17.590
these technologies because they've gotten very cheap,

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.504
to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.

00:12:21.504 --> 00:12:26.094
So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is,

00:12:26.094 --> 00:12:29.301
I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.

00:12:29.301 --> 00:12:32.065
It turns out that my father was an M.D.,

00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:36.537
actually studied hormones. I told him many times

00:12:36.537 --> 00:12:41.327
that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:44.206
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought

00:12:44.206 --> 00:12:47.485
I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical

00:12:47.485 --> 00:12:50.104
M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."

00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:53.325
We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology

00:12:53.325 --> 00:12:55.455
meeting as family in Quebec.

00:12:55.455 --> 00:13:00.949
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee,

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:03.384
and drinking everybody's water at the table,

00:13:03.384 --> 00:13:06.318
and I think they all thought I was a druggie.

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:08.038
(Laughter)

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.014
But the reason I'm telling you this is that

00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:13.014
the medical community, my father as an example,

00:13:13.014 --> 00:13:16.581
sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.

00:13:16.581 --> 00:13:20.566
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:23.366
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:24.837
They're microbes. They're tiny.

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:27.789
But we can see them through their DNA,

00:13:27.789 --> 00:13:31.038
we can see them through the effects that they have on people.

00:13:31.038 --> 00:13:32.656
And what we need now

00:13:32.656 --> 00:13:36.325
is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context

00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:38.838
of everything in human medicine.

00:13:38.838 --> 00:13:41.905
It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us,

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.304
but it might.

00:13:43.304 --> 00:13:47.229
What we need is a full field guide to the microbes

00:13:47.229 --> 00:13:50.622
that live in and on people, so that we can understand

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.894
what they're doing to our lives.

00:13:53.894 --> 00:13:56.965
We are them. They are us.

00:13:56.965 --> 00:13:58.293
Thank you.

00:13:58.293 --> 00:14:00.278
(Applause)
