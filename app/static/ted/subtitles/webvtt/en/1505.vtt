00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:01.482
My passions

00:00:01.482 --> 00:00:05.171
are music, technology and making things.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.354
And it's the combination of these things

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:11.050
that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.128
and, on occasion, has led me to play with fire.

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:17.505
This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years,

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:19.251
and I have one here tonight.

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:20.776
It's about an 8-foot-long tube of metal,

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:22.111
it's got a hundred or so holes on top,

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:23.864
on that side is the speaker, and here

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:26.040
is some lab tubing, and it's connected to this tank

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.641
of propane.

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:32.456
So, let's fire it up and see what it does.

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:39.778
So let's play a 550-herz frequency

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:41.293
and watch what happens.

00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:49.825
(Frequency)

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.538
Thank you. (Applause)

00:00:52.538 --> 00:00:54.526
It's okay to applaud the laws of physics,

00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:55.982
but essentially what's happening here

00:00:55.982 --> 00:00:57.742
-- (Laughter) --

00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:01.750
is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.254
is influencing the combustion properties of propane,

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:06.158
creating a visible waveform,

00:01:06.158 --> 00:01:08.478
and we can see the alternating regions of compression

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:10.518
and rarefaction that we call frequency,

00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:12.262
and the height is showing us amplitude.

00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:14.590
So let's change the frequency of the sound,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.015
and watch what happens to the fire.

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:26.145
(Higher frequency)

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:29.495
So every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:31.195
and that emergent sine curve of fire.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:32.773
So let's turn that off. We're indoors.

00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:38.364
Thank you. (Applause)

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.711
I also have with me a flame table.

00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.276
It's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:44.397
for visualizing the physical properties of sound,

00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:46.365
such as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:48.615
and see what it does.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:56.760
Ooh. (Laughter)

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.734
Okay. Now, while the table comes up to pressure,

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.406
let me note here that the sound is not traveling

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:04.152
in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions,

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:07.261
and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.257
with a line, and the flame table's a little like

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:11.111
bisecting those waves with a plane,

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:15.111
and it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:17.464
I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar.

00:02:17.464 --> 00:02:59.745
(Music)

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.510
All right, so it's a delicate dance.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.055
If you watch closely â€” (Applause)

00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:06.822
If you watch closely, you may have seen

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:09.294
some of the eigenmodes, but also you may have seen

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:13.911
that jazz music is better with fire.

00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:15.921
Actually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world,

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:18.353
but the fire's just a foundation.

00:03:18.353 --> 00:03:19.501
It shows very well that eyes can hear,

00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:20.896
and this is interesting to me because

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:23.750
technology allows us to present sound to the eyes

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.613
in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:29.310
for seeing sound, such as the removal of time.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.694
So here, I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint

00:03:32.694 --> 00:03:35.157
the frequencies of the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit"

00:03:35.157 --> 00:03:37.197
in a way that the eyes can take them in

00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:39.441
as a single visual impression, and the technique

00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:41.414
will also show the strengths of the visual cortex

00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:43.030
for pattern recognition.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.909
So if I show you another song off this album,

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.390
and another, your eyes will easily pick out

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.318
the use of repetition by the band Nirvana,

00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:53.175
and in the frequency distribution, the colors,

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:56.223
you can see the clean-dirty-clean sound

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:57.430
that they are famous for,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.430
and here is the entire album as a single visual impression,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.310
and I think this impression is pretty powerful.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.024
At least, it's powerful enough that

00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:06.366
if I show you these four songs,

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:08.807
and I remind you that this is "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"

00:04:08.807 --> 00:04:11.126
you can probably correctly guess, without listening

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.560
to any music at all, that the song

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.854
a die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song,

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.110
"I'll Stick Around" by the Foo Fighters,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.110
whose lead singer is Dave Grohl,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.888
who was the drummer in Nirvana.

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:24.188
The songs are a little similar, but mostly

00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:25.814
I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe

00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:30.226
we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks.

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:31.326
All right, now for some more sound data.

00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:33.978
This is data from a skate park,

00:04:33.978 --> 00:04:36.010
and this is Mabel Davis skate park

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.152
in Austin, Texas. (Skateboard sounds)

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:39.526
And the sounds you're hearing came from eight

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:41.742
microphones attached to obstacles around the park,

00:04:41.742 --> 00:04:43.926
and it sounds like chaos, but actually

00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:47.273
all the tricks start with a very distinct slap,

00:04:47.273 --> 00:04:48.877
but successful tricks end with a pop,

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:50.670
whereas unsuccessful tricks

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.526
more of a scratch and a tumble,

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:56.536
and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong, and

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:59.326
voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park.

00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:01.264
So if we were to render these sounds visually,

00:05:01.264 --> 00:05:02.671
we might end up with something like this.

00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:05.127
This is all 40 minutes of the recording,

00:05:05.127 --> 00:05:07.287
and right away the algorithm tells us

00:05:07.287 --> 00:05:09.360
a lot more tricks are missed than are made,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.695
and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely

00:05:11.695 --> 00:05:14.567
to produce a cheer, and if you look really closely,

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.300
we can tease out traffic patterns.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.387
You see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier.

00:05:22.387 --> 00:05:24.092
And in the middle of the recording, the mics pick this up,

00:05:24.092 --> 00:05:26.896
but later in the recording, this kid shows up,

00:05:26.896 --> 00:05:29.824
and he starts using a line at the top of the park

00:05:29.824 --> 00:05:31.626
to do some very advanced tricks on something

00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:32.729
called the tall rail.

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.601
And it's fascinating. At this moment in time,

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.104
all the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.882
to stay out of his way.

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:42.425
You see, there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park,

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.025
and it's led by key influencers,

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:47.273
and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks,

00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:49.703
or wear red pants, and on this day the mics picked that up.

00:05:49.703 --> 00:05:53.604
All right, from skate physics to theoretical physics.

00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:55.220
I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.556
and I wanted to use all eight hours

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.143
of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.

00:05:59.143 --> 00:06:02.207
Now, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer,

00:06:02.207 --> 00:06:05.311
which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences

00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:08.737
fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm.

00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:10.697
It listens to the lecture, and then it uses

00:06:10.697 --> 00:06:13.384
the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis,

00:06:13.384 --> 00:06:16.017
and it uses the inflection of sentences

00:06:16.017 --> 00:06:18.171
to move a same point up and down on the y-axis.

00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.945
And these trend lines, you can see, there's more questions

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:22.815
than answers in the laws of physics,

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.848
and when we reach the end of a sentence,

00:06:24.848 --> 00:06:27.183
we place a star at that location.

00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:29.983
So there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars,

00:06:29.983 --> 00:06:32.339
and after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get.

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.268
This is Stephen Hawking's universe.

00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:42.205
(Applause)

00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:44.692
It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series

00:06:44.692 --> 00:06:46.540
taken in as a single visual impression,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.297
and I really like this image,

00:06:48.297 --> 00:06:50.105
but a lot of people think it's fake.

00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:52.449
So I made a more interactive version,

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.905
and the way I did that is I used their position in time

00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.272
in the lecture to place these stars into 3D space,

00:07:00.272 --> 00:07:02.673
and with some custom software and a Kinect,

00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:05.336
I can walk right into the lecture.

00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:07.136
I'm going to wave through the Kinect here

00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:08.968
and take control, and now I'm going to reach out

00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:12.207
and I'm going to touch a star, and when I do,

00:07:12.207 --> 00:07:14.151
it will play the sentence

00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:15.616
that generated that star.

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:19.432
Stephen Hawking: There is one, and only one, arrangement

00:07:19.432 --> 00:07:22.231
in which the pieces make a complete picture.

00:07:22.231 --> 00:07:26.379
Jared Ficklin: Thank you. (Applause)

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.552
There are 1,400 stars.

00:07:29.552 --> 00:07:31.216
It's a really fun way to explore the lecture,

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:32.683
and, I hope, a fitting homage.

00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:38.155
All right. Let me close with a work in progress.

00:07:38.155 --> 00:07:41.138
I think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists

00:07:41.138 --> 00:07:43.242
to create an enhanced version of closed captioning.

00:07:43.242 --> 00:07:45.361
Now, we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online,

00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:48.288
so let's watch one now with the sound turned off

00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:52.210
and the closed captioning turned on.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.356
There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song,

00:07:54.356 --> 00:07:56.469
and we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these,

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:57.838
you hear it in your mind's ear,

00:07:57.838 --> 00:08:00.821
and then applause starts.

00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:03.011
It usually begins here, and it grows and then it falls.

00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:04.988
Sometimes you get a little star applause,

00:08:04.988 --> 00:08:07.474
and then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath,

00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:09.164
and the talk begins.

00:08:09.164 --> 00:08:14.862
All right, so let's watch this clip again.

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:16.118
This time, I'm not going to talk at all.

00:08:16.118 --> 00:08:17.485
There's still going to be no audio,

00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:19.389
but what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:23.705
visually in real time at the bottom of the screen.

00:08:23.705 --> 00:08:26.496
So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.760
This is fairly amazing to me.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.093
Even on the first view, your eyes will successfully

00:08:53.093 --> 00:08:56.181
pick out patterns, but on repeated views,

00:08:56.181 --> 00:08:57.870
your brain actually gets better

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.526
at turning these patterns into information.

00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:01.117
You can get the tone and the timbre

00:09:01.117 --> 00:09:02.340
and the pace of the speech,

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.404
things that you can't get out of closed captioning.

00:09:04.404 --> 00:09:06.588
That famous scene in horror movies

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.236
where someone is walking up from behind

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:11.196
is something you can see,

00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:13.900
and I believe this information would be something

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.703
that is useful at times when the audio is turned off

00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:19.644
or not heard at all, and I speculate that deaf audiences

00:09:19.644 --> 00:09:20.821
might actually even be better

00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.602
at seeing sound than hearing audiences.

00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:24.100
I don't know. It's a theory right now.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.621
Actually, it's all just an idea.

00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:29.812
And let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions,

00:09:29.812 --> 00:09:31.789
and so do ideas.

00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:34.901
Thank you. (Applause)
