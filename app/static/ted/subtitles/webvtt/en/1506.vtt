00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:01.913
So, how many of you have ever

00:00:01.913 --> 00:00:03.568
gotten behind the wheel of a car

00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:09.255
when you really shouldn't have been driving?

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:11.160
Maybe you're out on the road for a long day,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.650
and you just wanted to get home.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.297
You were tired, but you felt you could drive a few more miles.

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:16.496
Maybe you thought,

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:18.513
I've had less to drink than everybody else,

00:00:18.513 --> 00:00:20.249
I should be the one to go home.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.840
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.294
Does this sound familiar to you?

00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:29.192
Now, in those situations, wouldn't it be great

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:30.785
if there was a button on your dashboard

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:37.128
that you could push, and the car would get you home safely?

00:00:37.128 --> 00:00:39.421
Now, that's been the promise of the self-driving car,

00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.048
the autonomous vehicle, and it's been the dream

00:00:42.048 --> 00:00:45.297
since at least 1939, when General Motors showcased

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:48.599
this idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair.

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:50.542
Now, it's been one of those dreams

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:54.756
that's always seemed about 20 years in the future.

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:57.439
Now, two weeks ago, that dream took a step forward,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:00.704
when the state of Nevada granted Google's self-driving car

00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:04.304
the very first license for an autonomous vehicle,

00:01:04.304 --> 00:01:06.549
clearly establishing that it's legal for them

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.359
to test it on the roads in Nevada.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.086
Now, California's considering similar legislation,

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:14.494
and this would make sure that the autonomous car

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:17.471
is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas.

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:19.567
(Laughter)

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:23.351
Now, in my lab at Stanford, we've been working on

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:26.838
autonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin

00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:31.086
on things. You see, we've been developing robotic race cars,

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:35.206
cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits

00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:37.446
of physical performance.

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:40.059
Now, why would we want to do such a thing?

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:42.159
Well, there's two really good reasons for this.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.118
First, we believe that before people turn over control

00:01:46.118 --> 00:01:48.952
to an autonomous car, that autonomous car should be

00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:52.206
at least as good as the very best human drivers.

00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:55.511
Now, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.704
who know that we are above-average drivers,

00:01:57.704 --> 00:02:00.879
you understand that's a very high bar.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:03.271
There's another reason as well.

00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:06.847
Just like race car drivers can use all of the friction

00:02:06.847 --> 00:02:08.127
between the tire and the road,

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.304
all of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible,

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:14.649
we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.237
any accident we can.

00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:18.287
Now, you may push the car to the limits

00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:20.254
not because you're driving too fast,

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:22.414
but because you've hit an icy patch of road,

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:24.118
conditions have changed.

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:26.879
In those situations, we want a car

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.599
that is capable enough to avoid any accident

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.277
that can physically be avoided.

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:37.544
I must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well.

00:02:37.544 --> 00:02:39.800
You see, I have a passion for racing.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.564
In the past, I've been a race car owner,

00:02:42.564 --> 00:02:45.119
a crew chief and a driving coach,

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.974
although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting.

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:51.678
One of the things that we've developed in the lab --

00:02:51.678 --> 00:02:53.382
we've developed several vehicles --

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.617
is what we believe is the world's first

00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:57.982
autonomously drifting car.

00:02:57.982 --> 00:03:00.495
It's another one of those categories

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:02.918
where maybe there's not a lot of competition.

00:03:02.918 --> 00:03:04.326
(Laughter)

00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:08.148
But this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle,

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:10.226
which through using its rear-wheel drive

00:03:10.226 --> 00:03:11.791
and front-wheel steer-by-wire

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.858
can drift around corners.

00:03:13.858 --> 00:03:16.058
It can get sideways like a rally car driver,

00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:17.773
always able to take the tightest curve,

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:21.077
even on slippery, changing surfaces,

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:22.693
never spinning out.

00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:25.061
We've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle,

00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.485
on Shelley, an autonomous race car that has raced

00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:31.555
at 150 miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats,

00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:36.026
gone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun,

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:38.665
the wind and the rain,

00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:43.683
and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles

00:03:43.683 --> 00:03:45.245
of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:48.718
in Colorado with nobody at the wheel.

00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:50.166
(Laughter)

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:55.732
(Applause)

00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:59.011
I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun

00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:00.315
doing this.

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:03.972
But in fact, there's something else that we've developed

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:07.027
in the process of developing these autonomous cars.

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:10.898
We have developed a tremendous appreciation

00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:14.715
for the capabilities of human race car drivers.

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:19.060
As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.339
we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts.

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:28.019
And we discovered their human counterparts are amazing.

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:32.042
Now, we can take a map of a race track,

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.412
we can take a mathematical model of a car,

00:04:34.412 --> 00:04:37.315
and with some iteration, we can actually find

00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:38.940
the fastest way around that track.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.473
We line that up with data that we record

00:04:41.473 --> 00:04:42.906
from a professional driver,

00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:47.013
and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable.

00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:50.225
Yes, there are subtle differences here,

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:53.352
but the human race car driver is able to go out

00:04:53.352 --> 00:04:55.687
and drive an amazingly fast line,

00:04:55.687 --> 00:04:58.017
without the benefit of an algorithm that compares

00:04:58.017 --> 00:05:00.625
the trade-off between going as fast as possible

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:02.662
in this corner, and shaving a little bit of time

00:05:02.662 --> 00:05:04.564
off of the straight over here.

00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:08.021
Not only that, they're able to do it lap

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:10.396
after lap after lap.

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:13.308
They're able to go out and consistently do this,

00:05:13.308 --> 00:05:17.436
pushing the car to the limits every single time.

00:05:17.436 --> 00:05:20.605
It's extraordinary to watch.

00:05:20.605 --> 00:05:22.671
You put them in a new car,

00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:26.573
and after a few laps, they've found the fastest line in that car,

00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:30.450
and they're off to the races.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.596
It really makes you think,

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:36.467
we'd love to know what's going on inside their brain.

00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:41.008
So as researchers, that's what we decided to find out.

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.820
We decided to instrument not only the car,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.315
but also the race car driver,

00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:48.084
to try to get a glimpse into what was going on

00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:50.270
in their head as they were doing this.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.220
Now, this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.452
to the head of John Morton.

00:05:55.452 --> 00:05:58.441
John Morton is a former Can-Am and IMSA driver,

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.241
who's also a class champion at Le Mans.

00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:03.737
Fantastic driver, and very willing to put up with graduate students

00:06:03.737 --> 00:06:05.592
and this sort of research.

00:06:05.592 --> 00:06:08.264
She's putting electrodes on his head

00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:10.376
so that we can monitor the electrical activity

00:06:10.376 --> 00:06:13.208
in John's brain as he races around the track.

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:16.403
Now, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head

00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:19.673
and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.

00:06:19.673 --> 00:06:23.080
However, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.841
that let us tease out some very important aspects of this.

00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:28.688
For instance, the resting brain

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:30.843
tends to generate a lot of alpha waves.

00:06:30.843 --> 00:06:34.595
In contrast, theta waves are associated with

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:37.779
a lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing,

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.827
things where the driver is thinking quite a bit.

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:42.490
Now, we can measure this,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.475
and we can look at the relative power

00:06:44.475 --> 00:06:46.675
between the theta waves and the alpha waves.

00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:49.117
This gives us a measure of mental workload,

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.684
how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively

00:06:52.684 --> 00:06:54.470
at any point along the track.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.412
Now, we wanted to see if we could actually record this

00:06:57.412 --> 00:07:00.450
on the track, so we headed down south to Laguna Seca.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.466
Laguna Seca is a legendary raceway

00:07:02.466 --> 00:07:04.767
about halfway between Salinas and Monterey.

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:06.854
It has a curve there called the Corkscrew.

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:09.571
Now, the Corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick

00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:12.317
right-handed turn as the road drops three stories.

00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:16.083
Now, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was,

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:18.105
you aim for the bush in the distance,

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:21.130
and as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.434
All right, so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford,

00:07:24.434 --> 00:07:25.907
we were able to take John there

00:07:25.907 --> 00:07:26.871
and put him behind the wheel

00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:29.310
of a 1960 Porsche Abarth Carrera.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.008
Life is way too short for boring cars.

00:07:33.008 --> 00:07:34.767
So, here you see John on the track,

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:36.951
he's going up the hill -- Oh! Somebody liked that --

00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:39.416
and you can see, actually, his mental workload

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:41.569
-- measuring here in the red bar --

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:43.912
you can see his actions as he approaches.

00:07:43.912 --> 00:07:47.142
Now watch, he has to downshift.

00:07:47.142 --> 00:07:47.903
And then he has to turn left.

00:07:47.903 --> 00:07:51.896
Look for the tree, and down.

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:54.734
Not surprisingly, you can see this is a pretty challenging task.

00:07:54.734 --> 00:07:57.710
You can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this,

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.774
as you would expect with something that requires

00:07:59.774 --> 00:08:02.583
this level of complexity.

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:05.999
But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:08.845
where his mental workload doesn't increase.

00:08:08.845 --> 00:08:10.340
I'm going to take you around now

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.429
to the other side of the track.

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:13.765
Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner

00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:16.316
and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out.

00:08:16.316 --> 00:08:18.333
He's going to have to correct for that with steering.

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:20.564
So watch as John does this here.

00:08:20.564 --> 00:08:22.886
Watch the mental workload, and watch the steering.

00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:26.558
The car begins to slide out, dramatic maneuver to correct it,

00:08:26.558 --> 00:08:30.081
and no change whatsoever in the mental workload.

00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:32.913
Not a challenging task.

00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:36.113
In fact, entirely reflexive.

00:08:36.113 --> 00:08:39.756
Now, our data processing on this is still preliminary,

00:08:39.756 --> 00:08:42.428
but it really seems that these phenomenal feats

00:08:42.428 --> 00:08:44.038
that the race car drivers are performing

00:08:44.038 --> 00:08:45.948
are instinctive.

00:08:45.948 --> 00:08:49.338
They are things that they have simply learned to do.

00:08:49.338 --> 00:08:51.620
It requires very little mental workload

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.444
for them to perform these amazing feats.

00:08:54.444 --> 00:08:57.579
And their actions are fantastic.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.190
This is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.527
to catch the car in this situation.

00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:06.972
Now, this has given us tremendous insight

00:09:06.972 --> 00:09:10.094
and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles.

00:09:10.094 --> 00:09:12.022
We've started to ask the question:

00:09:12.022 --> 00:09:14.275
Can we make them a little less algorithmic

00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:16.724
and a little more intuitive?

00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:19.005
Can we take this reflexive action

00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:21.292
that we see from the very best race car drivers,

00:09:21.292 --> 00:09:22.941
introduce it to our cars,

00:09:22.941 --> 00:09:24.925
and maybe even into a system that could

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:26.893
get onto your car in the future?

00:09:26.893 --> 00:09:28.504
That would take us a long step

00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:31.013
along the road to autonomous vehicles

00:09:31.013 --> 00:09:32.925
that drive as well as the best humans.

00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:36.365
But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well.

00:09:36.365 --> 00:09:39.333
Do we want something more from our car

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:41.173
than to simply be a chauffeur?

00:09:41.173 --> 00:09:45.408
Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach,

00:09:45.408 --> 00:09:48.495
someone that can use their understanding of the situation

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:52.751
to help us reach our potential?

00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:55.024
Can, in fact, the technology not simply replace humans,

00:09:55.024 --> 00:09:59.599
but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:03.024
that we're all capable of?

00:10:03.024 --> 00:10:04.947
So, as we move forward into this technological future,

00:10:04.947 --> 00:10:07.768
I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment.

00:10:07.768 --> 00:10:11.543
What is the ideal balance of human and machine?

00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:13.252
And as we think about that,

00:10:13.252 --> 00:10:14.983
let's take inspiration

00:10:14.983 --> 00:10:18.312
from the absolutely amazing capabilities

00:10:18.312 --> 00:10:21.128
of the human body and the human mind.

00:10:21.128 --> 00:10:22.864
Thank you.

00:10:22.864 --> 00:10:27.468
(Applause)
