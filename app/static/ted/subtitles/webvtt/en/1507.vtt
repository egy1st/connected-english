00:00:01.527 --> 00:00:04.315
Something happened in the early morning hours

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:07.900
of May 2nd, 2000, that had a profound effect

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.206
on the way our society operates.

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:13.484
Ironically, hardly anyone noticed at the time.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:16.144
The change was silent, imperceptible,

00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:18.989
unless you knew exactly what to look for.

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.340
On that morning, U.S. President Bill Clinton

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.612
ordered that a special switch be thrown

00:00:23.612 --> 00:00:27.045
in the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:30.909
Instantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.471
around the globe went from errors the size of a football field

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:39.406
to errors the size of a small room.

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:46.105
It's hard to overstate the effect that this change

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:48.657
in accuracy has had on us.

00:00:48.657 --> 00:00:50.904
Before this switch was thrown, we didn't have

00:00:50.904 --> 00:00:53.163
in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:55.755
directions, because back then, GPS couldn't tell you

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.449
what block you were on, let alone what street.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.697
For geolocation, accuracy matters,

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:04.955
and things have only improved over the last 10 years.

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:07.074
With more base stations, more ground stations,

00:01:07.074 --> 00:01:10.043
better receivers and better algorithms,

00:01:10.043 --> 00:01:13.106
GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on,

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:17.608
but what part of the street.

00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:19.854
This level of accuracy

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:22.780
has unleashed a firestorm of innovation.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.451
In fact, many of you navigated here today

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:29.044
with the help of your TomTom or your smartphone.

00:01:29.044 --> 00:01:32.269
Paper maps are becoming obsolete.

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:36.408
But we now stand on the verge of another revolution

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:38.403
in geolocation accuracy.

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:41.136
What if I told you that the two-meter positioning

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:44.567
that our current cell phones and our TomToms give us

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:48.464
is pathetic compared to what we could be getting?

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:51.297
For some time now, it's been known that if you pay attention

00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:53.832
to the carrier phase of the GPS signal,

00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:56.313
and if you have an Internet connection,

00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:59.129
then you can go from meter level to centimeter level,

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:02.096
even millimeter-level positioning.

00:02:02.096 --> 00:02:05.376
So why don't we have this capability on our phones?

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:09.746
Only, I believe, for a lack of imagination.

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:12.913
Manufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique

00:02:12.913 --> 00:02:15.019
into their cheap GPS chips

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.173
because they're not sure what the general public would do

00:02:17.173 --> 00:02:20.749
with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:24.587
the wrinkles in the palm of your hand.

00:02:24.587 --> 00:02:26.974
But you and I and other innovators,

00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:31.014
we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy.

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:33.726
Imagine, for example, an augmented reality app

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:37.263
that overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision

00:02:37.263 --> 00:02:39.271
on top of the physical world.

00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:42.158
I could build for you a structure up here in 3D,

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:44.526
millimeter accurate, that only you could see,

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:47.419
or my friends at home.

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.934
So this level of positioning, this is what we're looking for,

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:55.858
and I believe that, within the next few years, I predict,

00:02:55.858 --> 00:03:00.841
that this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:04.065
will become cheap and ubiquitous,

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:06.610
and the consequences will be fantastic.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.266
The Holy Grail, of course, is the GPS dot.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.946
Do you remember the movie "The Da Vinci Code?"

00:03:13.946 --> 00:03:17.394
Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot,

00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:20.771
which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device

00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:23.832
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe,

00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:26.738
but we know that in the world of nonfiction,

00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:29.602
the GPS dot is impossible, right?

00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:32.226
For one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors,

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:35.410
and for another, they don't make devices quite this small,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.738
especially when those devices have to relay

00:03:37.738 --> 00:03:40.713
their measurements back over a network.

00:03:40.713 --> 00:03:43.051
Well, these objections were perfectly reasonable

00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:46.065
a few years ago, but things have changed.

00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:48.921
There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization,

00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:52.640
better sensitivity, so much so that, a few years ago,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.344
a GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box

00:03:55.344 --> 00:03:57.520
to the left of the keys.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.171
Compare that with the device released just months ago

00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:03.963
that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob,

00:04:03.963 --> 00:04:06.516
and if you take a look at the state of the art

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:09.262
for a complete GPS receiver, which is only a centimeter

00:04:09.262 --> 00:04:11.349
on a side and more sensitive than ever,

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.858
you realize that the GPS dot will soon move

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:19.257
from fiction to nonfiction.

00:04:19.257 --> 00:04:23.499
Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots.

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.405
It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:30.976
anymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland.

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:34.757
You'll buy GPS dots in bulk, and you'll stick them on

00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:38.724
everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars.

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:41.196
I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning,

00:04:41.196 --> 00:04:44.564
and, as usual, had to ask my wife if she had seen them.

00:04:44.564 --> 00:04:48.356
But I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality.

00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:50.967
I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are.

00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:53.106
(Laughter)

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:56.614
Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail,

00:04:56.614 --> 00:04:59.492
remember how refreshing it was to go from

00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:03.636
organizing all of your email to simply searching it.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:08.138
The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions.

00:05:08.138 --> 00:05:12.824
Now, of course, there is a flip side to the GPS dot.

00:05:12.824 --> 00:05:15.213
I was in my office some months back

00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:17.756
and got a telephone call.

00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:21.377
The woman on the other end of the line, we'll call her Carol,

00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:23.456
was panicked.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.249
Apparently, an ex-boyfriend of Carol's from California

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.564
had found her in Texas and was following her around.

00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:33.401
So you might ask at this point why she's calling you.

00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.800
Well, so did I.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.791
But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.

00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:41.525
Every time her ex-boyfriend would show up,

00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:45.875
at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations,

00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:48.571
he was carrying an open laptop,

00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:51.414
and over time Carol realized that he had planted

00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:53.962
a GPS tracking device on her car,

00:05:53.962 --> 00:05:56.871
so she was calling me for help to disable it.

00:05:56.871 --> 00:05:58.859
"Well, you should go to a good mechanic

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:02.143
and have him look at your car," I said.

00:06:02.143 --> 00:06:04.847
"I already have," she told me.

00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:06.991
"He didn't see anything obvious,

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:10.528
and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece."

00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:13.849
"Well then, you'd better go to the police," I said.

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.953
"I already have," she replied.

00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:19.399
"They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment,

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:23.152
and they're not set up technically to find the device."

00:06:23.152 --> 00:06:24.658
"Okay, what about the FBI?"

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:28.821
"I've talked to them too, and same story."

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.491
We then talked about her coming to my lab

00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:33.039
and us performing a radio sweep of her car,

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.538
but I wasn't even sure that would work,

00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:37.589
given that some of these devices are configured

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:39.823
to only transmit when they're inside safe zones

00:06:39.823 --> 00:06:43.127
or when the car is moving.

00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:44.621
So, there we were.

00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:47.590
Carol isn't the first, and certainly won't be the last,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.525
to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment,

00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:58.410
worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.213
In fact, as I looked into her case,

00:07:00.213 --> 00:07:03.675
I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal

00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:08.108
for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car.

00:07:08.108 --> 00:07:11.988
The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman

00:07:11.988 --> 00:07:16.320
has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.836
but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another,

00:07:19.836 --> 00:07:22.466
so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about,

00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:25.737
but Big Neighbor. (Laughter)

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:30.385
There is one alternative that Carol could have taken,

00:07:30.385 --> 00:07:36.088
very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble.

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:39.023
It's an open-source GPS jammer,

00:07:39.023 --> 00:07:41.578
developed by Limor Fried,

00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:45.371
a graduate student at MIT, and Limor calls it

00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:49.256
"a tool for reclaiming our personal space."

00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:51.521
With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you

00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:53.768
within which GPS signals can't reside.

00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:56.124
They get drowned out by the bubble.

00:07:56.124 --> 00:07:59.771
And Limor designed this, in part, because, like Carol,

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.417
she felt threatened by GPS tracking.

00:08:02.417 --> 00:08:04.993
Then she posted her design to the web,

00:08:04.993 --> 00:08:08.735
and if you don't have time to build your own,

00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:09.509
you can buy one.

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:11.567
Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands

00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:15.340
of nearly identical devices on the Internet.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.492
So you might be thinking, the Wave Bubble sounds great.

00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:23.145
I should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car.

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:26.927
But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal

00:08:26.927 --> 00:08:28.726
in the United States.

00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:29.473
And why is that?

00:08:29.473 --> 00:08:32.566
Well, because it's not a bubble at all.

00:08:32.566 --> 00:08:34.965
Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge

00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:37.437
of your personal space or at the edge of your car.

00:08:37.437 --> 00:08:43.673
They go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you. (Laughter)

00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:46.424
Now, if you're Carol or Limor,

00:08:46.424 --> 00:08:49.049
or someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking,

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:52.824
it might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble,

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:56.804
but in fact, the results can be disastrous.

00:08:56.804 --> 00:08:59.524
Imagine, for example, you're the captain of a cruise ship

00:08:59.524 --> 00:09:02.043
trying to make your way through a thick fog

00:09:02.043 --> 00:09:05.883
and some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble.

00:09:05.883 --> 00:09:08.598
All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank,

00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:11.884
and now it's just you and the fog

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.484
and whatever you can pull off the radar system

00:09:14.484 --> 00:09:17.608
if you remember how to work it.

00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:23.544
They -- in fact, they don't update or upkeep lighthouses

00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:28.197
anymore, and LORAN, the only backup to GPS,

00:09:28.197 --> 00:09:30.617
was discontinued last year.

00:09:30.617 --> 00:09:35.530
Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.800
We're almost blindly reliant on it.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.451
It's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure.

00:09:41.451 --> 00:09:45.079
Some call it "the invisible utility."

00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:48.801
So, turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience.

00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:53.171
It might be deadly.

00:09:53.171 --> 00:09:57.379
But as it turns out, for purposes of protecting your privacy

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:00.868
at the expense of general GPS reliability,

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.028
there's something even more potent

00:10:03.028 --> 00:10:06.820
and more subversive than a Wave Bubble,

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.209
and that is a GPS spoofer.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:13.034
The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple.

00:10:13.034 --> 00:10:17.011
Instead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them.

00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:20.129
You imitate them, and if you do it right, the device

00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:23.296
you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed.

00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:24.928
So let me show you how this works.

00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:27.653
In any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside

00:10:27.653 --> 00:10:30.288
that corresponds to the authentic signals.

00:10:30.288 --> 00:10:33.103
These three red dots represent the tracking points

00:10:33.103 --> 00:10:35.982
that try to keep themselves centered on that peak.

00:10:35.982 --> 00:10:39.047
But if you send in a fake GPS signal,

00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:43.513
another peak pops up, and if you can get these two peaks

00:10:43.513 --> 00:10:48.231
perfectly aligned, the tracking points can't tell the difference,

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:51.542
and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal,

00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:55.502
with the authentic peak getting forced off.

00:10:55.502 --> 00:10:57.669
At this point, the game is over.

00:10:57.669 --> 00:11:01.406
The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver.

00:11:01.406 --> 00:11:02.901
So is this really possible?

00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:04.624
Can someone really manipulate

00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:06.606
the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver

00:11:06.606 --> 00:11:09.485
just like that, with a spoofer?

00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:11.500
Well, the short answer is yes.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.304
The key is that civil GPS signals

00:11:14.304 --> 00:11:15.406
are completely open.

00:11:15.406 --> 00:11:19.397
They have no encryption. They have no authentication.

00:11:19.397 --> 00:11:22.892
They're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack.

00:11:22.892 --> 00:11:25.467
Even so, up until very recently,

00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:27.859
nobody worried about GPS spoofers.

00:11:27.859 --> 00:11:29.837
People figured that it would be too complex

00:11:29.837 --> 00:11:32.652
or too expensive for some hacker to build one.

00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:36.604
But I, and a friend of mine from graduate school,

00:11:36.604 --> 00:11:38.756
we didn't see it that way.

00:11:38.756 --> 00:11:41.229
We knew it wasn't going to be so hard,

00:11:41.229 --> 00:11:43.157
and we wanted to be the first to build one

00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:45.237
so we could get out in front of the problem

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:49.343
and help protect against GPS spoofing.

00:11:49.343 --> 00:11:52.688
I remember vividly the week it all came together.

00:11:52.688 --> 00:11:56.137
We built it at my home, which means that

00:11:56.137 --> 00:12:00.526
I got a little extra help from my three-year-old son Ramon.

00:12:00.526 --> 00:12:02.944
Here's Ramon — (Laughter) —

00:12:02.944 --> 00:12:06.629
looking for a little attention from Dad that week.

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:08.899
At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:11.781
and computers, though we eventually got it packaged

00:12:11.781 --> 00:12:13.453
into a small box.

00:12:13.453 --> 00:12:16.262
Now, the Dr. Frankenstein moment,

00:12:16.262 --> 00:12:18.989
when the spoofer finally came alive

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:21.590
and I glimpsed its awful potential,

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.326
came late one night when I tested the spoofer

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:26.412
against my iPhone.

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.029
Let me show you some actual footage from that

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:29.965
very first experiment.

00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:33.559
I had come to completely trust this little blue dot

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:35.194
and its reassuring blue halo.

00:12:35.194 --> 00:12:36.269
They seemed to speak to me.

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:40.929
They'd say, "Here you are. Here you are." (Laughter)

00:12:40.929 --> 00:12:43.799
And "you can trust us."

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:48.917
So something felt very wrong about the world.

00:12:48.917 --> 00:12:51.500
It was a sense, almost, of betrayal,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.691
when this little blue dot started at my house,

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:57.303
and went running off toward the north

00:12:57.303 --> 00:13:01.198
leaving me behind. I wasn't moving.

00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:05.431
What I then saw in this little moving blue dot

00:13:05.431 --> 00:13:08.149
was the potential for chaos.

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:12.291
I saw airplanes and ships veering off course, with the captain

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:16.565
learning only too late that something was wrong.

00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:19.065
I saw the GPS-derived timing

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:20.796
of the New York Stock Exchange

00:13:20.796 --> 00:13:22.746
being manipulated by hackers.

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:25.714
You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc

00:13:25.714 --> 00:13:28.364
you could cause if you knew what you were doing

00:13:28.364 --> 00:13:31.717
with a GPS spoofer.

00:13:31.717 --> 00:13:36.861
There is, though, one redeeming feature

00:13:36.861 --> 00:13:39.317
of the GPS spoofer.

00:13:39.317 --> 00:13:43.918
It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots.

00:13:43.918 --> 00:13:47.005
Imagine, for example, you're being tracked.

00:13:47.005 --> 00:13:49.529
Well, you can play the tracker for a fool,

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:52.490
pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.205
Or, if you're Carol, you could lure your ex-boyfriend

00:13:55.205 --> 00:13:56.522
into some empty parking lot

00:13:56.522 --> 00:13:58.823
where the police are waiting for him.

00:13:58.823 --> 00:14:04.026
So I'm fascinated by this conflict, a looming conflict,

00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:06.691
between privacy on the one hand

00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:10.890
and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.935
We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers,

00:14:13.935 --> 00:14:17.671
and yet, given the lack of effective legal means

00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:21.770
for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot,

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.642
can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on,

00:14:23.642 --> 00:14:26.058
for wanting to use them?

00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:29.111
I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile

00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:32.297
this conflict with some sort of,

00:14:32.297 --> 00:14:37.727
some yet uninvented technology.

00:14:37.727 --> 00:14:40.853
But meanwhile, grab some popcorn,

00:14:40.853 --> 00:14:42.980
because things are going to get interesting.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.320
Within the next few years,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.574
many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot.

00:14:48.574 --> 00:14:50.922
Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them.

00:14:50.922 --> 00:14:54.374
You'll never lose track of your things again.

00:14:54.374 --> 00:14:58.403
The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life.

00:14:58.403 --> 00:15:01.085
But will you be able to resist the temptation

00:15:01.085 --> 00:15:04.077
to track your fellow man?

00:15:04.077 --> 00:15:05.909
Or will you be able to resist the temptation

00:15:05.909 --> 00:15:09.204
to turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble

00:15:09.204 --> 00:15:11.972
to protect your own privacy?

00:15:11.972 --> 00:15:15.604
So, as usual, what we see just beyond the horizon

00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:18.944
is full of promise and peril.

00:15:18.944 --> 00:15:22.132
It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out.

00:15:22.132 --> 00:15:24.766
Thanks. (Applause)
