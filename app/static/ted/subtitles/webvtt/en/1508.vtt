00:00:01.028 --> 00:00:03.187
I love to collect things.

00:00:03.187 --> 00:00:05.177
Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:07.906
of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces

00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:11.144
from all around the world to insects

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.548
that I've captured and put in jars.

00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:15.585
Now, it's no secret, because I like collecting things,

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:17.521
that I love the Natural History Museum

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.921
and the collections of animals

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:20.736
at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:22.873
These, to me, are like living sculptures, right,

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:24.290
that you can go and look at,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.025
and they memorialize a specific point of time

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.672
in this animal's life.

00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:29.554
So I was thinking about my own life,

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.467
and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know,

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:34.250
for the ages, and also — (Laughter) —

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.737
the lives of my friends, but

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:39.353
the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen

00:00:39.353 --> 00:00:42.529
on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them. (Laughter)

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:45.232
So instead, I turned to video,

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:47.530
and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.304
someone and to capture a specific moment in time.

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:52.481
So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.881
and then, using video mapping and video projection,

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:57.362
I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends

00:00:57.362 --> 00:01:01.304
projected into jars. (Laughter)

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:03.018
So now I have this collection of my friends

00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:04.807
I can take around with me whenever I go,

00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:06.719
and this is called Animalia Chordata,

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.536
from the Latin nomenclature for

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.696
human being, classification system.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:13.658
So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars,

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:18.017
and they actually move around. (Laughter)

00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:20.110
So, this is interesting to me,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.000
but it lacked a certain human element. (Laughter)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.822
It's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:27.434
an interaction system. So what I did was,

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:29.217
I added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close

00:01:29.217 --> 00:01:31.376
to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:33.103
You know, just like people on the street

00:01:33.103 --> 00:01:34.959
when you get too close to them.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.545
Some people reacted in terror. (Laughter)

00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:39.558
Others reacted in asking you for help,

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:43.056
and some people hide from you.

00:01:43.056 --> 00:01:44.687
So this was really interesting to me, this idea of

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:46.822
taking video off the screen and putting it in real life,

00:01:46.822 --> 00:01:49.069
and also adding interactivity to sculpture.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.134
So over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:54.966
and trapped them in jars as well

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:56.911
and created a piece known as Garden,

00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.263
which is literally a garden of humanity.

00:01:59.263 --> 00:02:01.407
But something about the first piece,

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:03.312
the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me,

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:05.133
this idea of interaction with art,

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.455
and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact,

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:09.744
and also being challenged by interacting with art.

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:11.599
So I wanted to create a new piece that actually

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.488
forced people to come and interact with something,

00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:15.187
and the way I did this was actually by projecting

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:19.567
a 1950s housewife into a blender. (Laughter)

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.062
This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is

00:02:22.062 --> 00:02:23.925
it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.

00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:26.266
You may never experience the entire thing yourself.

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.590
You can walk away, you can just watch as this character

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.015
stands there in the blender and looks at you,

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:33.089
or you can actually choose to interact with it.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:37.222
So if you do choose to interact with the piece,

00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:39.382
and you press the blender button, it actually sends

00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:42.814
this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment.

00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:46.366
By doing that, you are now part of my piece.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.398
You, like the people that are trapped in my work

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:52.459
— (Blender noises, laughter) —

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.566
have become part of my work as well. (Laughter)

00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:01.759
(Laughter)

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.182
(Applause)

00:03:04.182 --> 00:03:07.822
But, but this seems a bit unfair, right?

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:10.334
I put my friends in jars, I put this character,

00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:13.151
this sort of endangered species character in a blender.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.151
But I'd never done anything about myself.

00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:16.863
I'd never really memorialized myself.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.133
So I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece.

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:21.358
This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:23.605
called A Point Just Passed,

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:26.237
in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock,

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:27.941
and it's up to you.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.887
If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock,

00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:31.594
you actually age me.

00:03:31.594 --> 00:03:34.150
So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.812
you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler,

00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:42.043
and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.

00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:44.563
From a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self.

00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:47.651
From my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man,

00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:51.510
and then, from there, into an elderly man.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.442
And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:57.513
in one day, the piece goes black

00:03:57.513 --> 00:04:00.206
and is not to be reset until the next day.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.290
So, in doing so, you're erasing time.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.218
You're actually implicit in this work

00:04:04.218 --> 00:04:06.224
and you're erasing my life.

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:08.370
So I like this about interactive video sculpture,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.947
that you can actually interact with it,

00:04:09.947 --> 00:04:11.819
that all of you can actually touch an artwork

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.683
and be part of the artwork yourselves,

00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:16.154
and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you

00:04:16.154 --> 00:04:18.314
trapped in one of my jars. (Laughter)

00:04:18.314 --> 00:04:23.405
Thank you. (Applause)
