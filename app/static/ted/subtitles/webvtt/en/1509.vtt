00:00:00.432 --> 00:00:03.154
Now, I don't usually like cartoons,

00:00:03.154 --> 00:00:05.664
I don't think many of them are funny,

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:10.887
I find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker.

00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:13.499
(Text: Never, ever think outside the box.) (Laughter)

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.968
So, the guy is telling the cat,

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:21.339
don't you dare think outside the box.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.646
Well, I'm afraid I used to be the cat.

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:27.704
I always wanted to be outside the box.

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:31.186
And it's partly because I came to this field

00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:36.399
from a different background, chemist and a bacterial geneticist.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.001
So, what people were saying to me

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.192
about the cause of cancer, sources of cancer,

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:45.273
or, for that matter, why you are who you are,

00:00:45.273 --> 00:00:47.147
didn't make sense.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:50.194
So, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that

00:00:50.194 --> 00:00:52.795
and how I went about it.

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:55.227
So, to begin with, however,

00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:59.653
I have to give you a very, very quick lesson

00:00:59.653 --> 00:01:01.420
in developmental biology,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.482
with apologies to those of you who know some biology.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.496
So, when your mom and dad met,

00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:11.170
there is a fertilized egg,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.291
that round thing with that little blip.

00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:16.346
It grows and then it grows,

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:20.499
and then it makes this handsome man.

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:21.914
(Applause)

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:27.572
So, this guy, with all the cells in his body,

00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:31.784
all have the same genetic information.

00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:36.159
So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow,

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.335
and why doesn't he get up one morning

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:40.895
and have his nose turn into his foot?

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:44.135
It could. It has the genetic information.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:45.343
You all remember, dolly,

00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:48.024
it came from a single mammary cell.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.958
So, why doesn't it do it?

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:55.461
So, have a guess of how many cells he has in his body.

00:01:55.461 --> 00:02:02.863
Somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.

00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:04.503
Trillion!

00:02:04.503 --> 00:02:09.141
Now, how did these cells, all with the same genetic material,

00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.349
make all those tissues?

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.493
And so, the question I raised before

00:02:14.493 --> 00:02:18.107
becomes even more interesting if you thought about

00:02:18.107 --> 00:02:22.693
the enormity of this in every one of your bodies.

00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:25.693
Now, the dominant cancer theory would say

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:28.005
that there is a single oncogene

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:31.709
in a single cancer cell, and it would make you

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.358
a cancer victim.

00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:38.024
Well, this did not make sense to me.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.206
Do you even know how a trillion looks?

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:42.925
Now, let's look at it.

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:47.966
There it comes, these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes.

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:54.784
Now, if .0001 of these cells got mutated,

00:02:54.784 --> 00:03:00.041
and .00001 got cancer, you will be a lump of cancer.

00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:02.337
You will have cancer all over you. And you're not.

00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:04.646
Why not?

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:08.368
So, I decided over the years,

00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:10.296
because of a series of experiments

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:15.176
that this is because of context and architecture.

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:17.353
And let me quickly tell you

00:03:17.353 --> 00:03:21.280
some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.191
To begin with, I came to work with this virus

00:03:25.191 --> 00:03:28.584
that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:31.944
Rous discovered this in 1911.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:35.509
It was the first cancer virus discovered,

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:40.400
and when I call it "oncogene," meaning "cancer gene."

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.312
So, he made a filtrate, he took this filter

00:03:43.312 --> 00:03:47.568
which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter,

00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:51.569
and he injected it to another chicken, and he got another tumor.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.280
So, scientists were very excited,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.448
and they said, a single oncogene can do it.

00:03:56.448 --> 00:03:58.744
All you need is a single oncogene.

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:01.639
So, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells,

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.674
dumped the virus on it,

00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:05.123
and it would pile up,

00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:08.144
and they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.

00:04:08.144 --> 00:04:10.162
And again this didn't make sense to me.

00:04:10.162 --> 00:04:13.448
So for various reasons, we took this oncogene,

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:15.760
attached it to a blue marker,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.768
and we injected it into the embryos.

00:04:18.768 --> 00:04:22.961
Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:27.240
Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.656
inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.

00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:36.256
So, when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish,

00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:38.968
we got a mass of blue cells.

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:40.434
So, in the chicken you get a tumor,

00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:42.138
in the embryo you don't,

00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:46.130
you dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.353
What does that mean?

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:50.337
That means that microenvironment

00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:54.346
and the context which surrounds those cells

00:04:54.346 --> 00:05:01.273
actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do.

00:05:01.273 --> 00:05:04.585
Now, let's take a normal example.

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:07.770
The normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.250
I work on breast cancer.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.257
So, here is a lovely human breast.

00:05:12.257 --> 00:05:14.205
And many of you know how it looks,

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:17.058
except that inside that breast, there are all these

00:05:17.058 --> 00:05:20.435
pretty, developing, tree-like structures.

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:23.333
So, we decided that what we like to do

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:26.293
is take just a bit of that mammary gland,

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:28.325
which is called an "acinus,"

00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:31.966
where there are all these little things inside the breast

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:35.509
where the milk goes, and the end of the nipple

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.053
comes through that little tube when the baby sucks.

00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:42.460
And we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.229
We want to make this a structure, and ask the question,

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.933
how do the cells do that?

00:05:47.933 --> 00:05:49.725
So, we took the red cells --

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:52.973
you see the red cells are surrounded by blue,

00:05:52.973 --> 00:05:56.302
other cells that squeeze them, and behind it

00:05:56.302 --> 00:06:00.020
is material that people thought was mainly inert,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.617
and it was just having a structure to keep the shape,

00:06:03.617 --> 00:06:06.545
and so we first photographed it

00:06:06.545 --> 00:06:09.313
with the electron microscope years and years ago,

00:06:09.313 --> 00:06:12.369
and you see this cell is actually quite pretty.

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:14.832
It has a bottom, it has a top,

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:17.513
it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk,

00:06:17.513 --> 00:06:20.705
because it just came from an early pregnant mouse.

00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:23.032
You take these cells, you put them in a dish,

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:26.377
and within three days, they look like that.

00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:29.537
They completely forget.

00:06:29.537 --> 00:06:32.337
So you take them out, you put them in a dish,

00:06:32.337 --> 00:06:35.000
they don't make milk. They completely forget.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.899
For example, here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.154
on the left, there is nothing on the right.

00:06:42.154 --> 00:06:45.883
Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left

00:06:45.883 --> 00:06:49.379
is in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish.

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:52.115
They are completely different from each other.

00:06:52.115 --> 00:06:54.140
So, what does this tell you?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.107
This tells you that here also, context overrides.

00:06:59.107 --> 00:07:02.492
In different contexts, cells do different things.

00:07:02.492 --> 00:07:05.237
But how does context signal?

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:07.779
So, Einstein said that

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:14.432
"For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope."

00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:20.392
So, you can imagine the amount of skepticism

00:07:20.392 --> 00:07:22.793
I received -- couldn't get money,

00:07:22.793 --> 00:07:24.736
couldn't do a whole lot of other things,

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.465
but I'm so glad it all worked out.

00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:30.280
So, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.463
and all those lovely acini are there,

00:07:33.463 --> 00:07:37.674
every one of those with the red around them are an acinus,

00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:41.368
and we said okay, we are going to try and make this,

00:07:41.368 --> 00:07:44.600
and I said, maybe that red stuff

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.725
around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold,

00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:51.665
maybe it has information,

00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:56.231
maybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.

00:07:56.231 --> 00:08:00.514
So I said, extracellular matrix, which is this stuff

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:04.905
called ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do.

00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:08.672
So, we decided to make things that would look like that.

00:08:08.672 --> 00:08:11.552
We found some gooey material

00:08:11.552 --> 00:08:14.427
that had the right extracellular matrix in it,

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.966
we put the cells in it, and lo and behold,

00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:19.787
in about four days, they got reorganized

00:08:19.787 --> 00:08:23.195
and on the right, is what we can make in culture.

00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:27.691
On the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo,

00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:30.275
and the one in culture was full of milk,

00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:33.075
the lovely red there is full of milk.

00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:36.491
So, we Got Milk, for the American audience.

00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:41.835
All right. And here is this beautiful human cell,

00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:46.781
and you can imagine that here also, context goes.

00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:49.497
So, what do we do now?

00:08:49.497 --> 00:08:51.721
I made a radical hypothesis.

00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:58.384
I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant,

00:08:58.384 --> 00:09:02.870
architecture restored to a cancer cell

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.859
should make the cancer cell think it's normal.

00:09:05.859 --> 00:09:07.343
Could this be done?

00:09:07.343 --> 00:09:09.871
So, we tried it.

00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:11.909
In order to do that, however,

00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:16.794
we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant,

00:09:16.794 --> 00:09:20.791
and on the left is the single normal cell,

00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:24.754
human breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel

00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:28.618
that has extracellular matrix, it makes all these beautiful structures.

00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:31.506
On the right, you see it looks very ugly,

00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:33.154
the cells continue to grow,

00:09:33.154 --> 00:09:34.730
the normal ones stop.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.562
And you see here in higher magnification

00:09:37.562 --> 00:09:41.914
the normal acinus and the ugly tumor.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:46.138
So we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors?

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:48.306
Could we calm them down --

00:09:48.306 --> 00:09:53.226
they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up --

00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:56.290
and make them to the level of the normal?

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:01.010
Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.171
This is what we got.

00:10:03.171 --> 00:10:06.850
We can revert the malignant phenotype.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.418
(Applause)

00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:12.530
And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.248
I didn't just choose one,

00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:17.018
here are little movies, sort of fuzzy,

00:10:17.018 --> 00:10:20.674
but you see that on the left are the malignant cells,

00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:22.018
all of them are malignant,

00:10:22.018 --> 00:10:26.818
we add one single inhibitor in the beginning,

00:10:26.818 --> 00:10:30.275
and look what happens, they all look like that.

00:10:30.275 --> 00:10:33.722
We inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right,

00:10:33.722 --> 00:10:35.962
and none of them would make tumors.

00:10:35.962 --> 00:10:39.498
We inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.

00:10:39.498 --> 00:10:42.170
So, it's a new way of thinking about cancer,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.570
it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.546
We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level,

00:10:48.546 --> 00:10:54.458
and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior

00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:58.330
is regulated at the level of tissue organization

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.322
and that the tissue organization is dependent

00:11:02.322 --> 00:11:06.018
on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment.

00:11:06.018 --> 00:11:13.649
All right, thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally.

00:11:13.649 --> 00:11:17.769
And here is another five seconds of repose,

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:22.191
is my mantra. Form and function.

00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:25.837
And of course, we now ask, where do we go now?

00:11:25.837 --> 00:11:28.832
We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic.

00:11:28.832 --> 00:11:32.756
But before we do that, I'd like you to think

00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:36.344
that at any given time when you're sitting there,

00:11:36.344 --> 00:11:39.357
in your 70 trillion cells,

00:11:39.357 --> 00:11:42.830
the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus,

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.908
the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix

00:11:45.908 --> 00:11:51.902
and this is how your balance is kept and restored.

00:11:51.902 --> 00:11:54.117
We have made a lot of discoveries,

00:11:54.117 --> 00:11:57.205
we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin.

00:11:57.205 --> 00:12:00.652
We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA

00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:04.475
on the specific genes of the mammary gland

00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:07.339
that actually respond to extracellular matrix.

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:11.036
It has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding.

00:12:11.036 --> 00:12:15.427
And before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you

00:12:15.427 --> 00:12:20.539
that there are so many additional discoveries to be made.

00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:23.067
There is so much mystery we don't know.

00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:27.428
And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to,

00:12:27.428 --> 00:12:33.091
don't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.

00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:35.283
Curiosity and passion.

00:12:35.283 --> 00:12:39.180
You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.155
And maybe my discovery needs to be added to

00:12:42.155 --> 00:12:43.947
or maybe it needs to be changed.

00:12:43.947 --> 00:12:47.451
So, we have now made an amazing discovery,

00:12:47.451 --> 00:12:50.555
a post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me,

00:12:50.555 --> 00:12:52.732
what do the cells do when you put them in?

00:12:52.732 --> 00:12:56.026
What do they do in the beginning when they do?

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.507
I said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them.

00:12:57.507 --> 00:13:00.100
We didn't have high images in the old days.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.795
So she, being an imager and a physicist,

00:13:02.795 --> 00:13:04.539
did this incredible thing.

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:08.915
This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.

00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:11.443
Look at it. It's constantly doing this.

00:13:11.443 --> 00:13:13.539
Has a coherent movement.

00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:17.873
You put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over,

00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:19.777
they do this. They don't do this.

00:13:19.777 --> 00:13:23.785
And when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.

00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:25.969
Absolutely boggles my mind.

00:13:25.969 --> 00:13:31.313
So the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing.

00:13:31.313 --> 00:13:34.169
So I'd like to finish with a poem.

00:13:34.169 --> 00:13:37.233
Well I used to love English literature,

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.840
and I debated in college, which one should I do?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.452
And unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.

00:13:44.452 --> 00:13:50.176
But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.

00:13:50.176 --> 00:13:52.835
It's called "Among the School Children."

00:13:52.835 --> 00:13:57.356
"O body swayed to music / O brightening glance /

00:13:57.356 --> 00:14:00.506
How [can we know] the dancer from the dance?"

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.417
And here is Merce Cunningham,

00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:05.401
I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger,

00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:07.594
and here he is a dancer,

00:14:07.594 --> 00:14:10.898
and while he is dancing, he is both the dancer and the dance.

00:14:10.898 --> 00:14:14.599
The minute he stops, we have neither.

00:14:14.599 --> 00:14:18.073
So it's like form and function.

00:14:18.073 --> 00:14:23.852
Now, I'd like to show you a current picture of my group.

00:14:23.852 --> 00:14:27.380
I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.604
students and post-docs who have taught me so much,

00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:33.867
and I have had many of these groups come and go.

00:14:33.867 --> 00:14:38.444
They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:42.147
of being the cat and being told,

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.740
don't think outside the box.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.235
And I'd like to leave you with this thought.

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:50.980
On the left is water coming through the shore,

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.875
taken from a NASA satellite.

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:55.924
On the right, there is a coral.

00:14:55.924 --> 00:14:59.926
Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:03.371
and take the fat away, on a dish it looks like that.

00:15:03.371 --> 00:15:06.723
Do they look the same? Do they have the same patterns?

00:15:06.723 --> 00:15:10.675
Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?

00:15:10.675 --> 00:15:13.035
And I'd like to submit to you

00:15:13.035 --> 00:15:15.212
that we have sequenced the human genome,

00:15:15.212 --> 00:15:18.092
we know everything about the sequence of the gene,

00:15:18.092 --> 00:15:20.523
the language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene,

00:15:20.523 --> 00:15:23.762
But we know nothing, but nothing,

00:15:23.762 --> 00:15:28.425
about the language and alphabet of form.

00:15:28.425 --> 00:15:31.469
So, it's a wonderful new horizon,

00:15:31.469 --> 00:15:35.219
it's a wonderful thing to discover for the young

00:15:35.219 --> 00:15:37.699
and the passionate old, and that's me.

00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:39.747
So go to it!

00:15:39.747 --> 00:15:51.247
(Applause)
