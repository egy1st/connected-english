00:00:00.765 --> 00:00:04.367
So let me start by taking you back,

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:06.603
back into the mists of your memory

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:10.116
to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life,

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:12.752
but certainly the most anticipated year

00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:14.730
in all human history:

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.668
the year 2000. Remember that?

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:21.221
Y2K, the dotcom bubble,

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.618
stressing about whose party you're going to go to

00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:25.840
as the clock strikes midnight,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.882
before the champagne goes flat,

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:31.201
and then there's that inchoate yearning

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:34.440
that was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.956
that the year 2000, should mean more,

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:40.175
more than just a two and some zeroes.

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:43.933
Well, amazingly, for once, our world leaders

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.555
actually lived up to that millennium moment

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:48.704
and back in 2000 agreed to some

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:51.111
pretty extraordinary stuff:

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.557
visionary, measurable, long-term targets

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:57.290
called the Millennium Development Goals.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.535
Now, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:02.317
under your pillow, or by the bedside table,

00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:04.403
but just in case you don't,

00:01:04.403 --> 00:01:06.233
and your memory needs some jogging,

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.855
the deal agreed then goes like this:

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:11.430
developing countries promised to at least halve

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.828
extreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease,

00:01:14.828 --> 00:01:17.608
alongside some other targets, by 2015,

00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:20.463
and developed nations promised to help them

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:22.861
get that done by dropping debts,

00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:25.582
increasing smart aid, and trade reform.

00:01:25.582 --> 00:01:27.831
Well, we're approaching 2015,

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:30.630
so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.392
But we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals?

00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:37.631
Some people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:40.864
what we want to do on these goals going forward.

00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:43.043
What does the world want to do together?

00:01:43.043 --> 00:01:45.566
We've got to decide a process by which we decide.

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.464
Well, I definitely think these goals are worth building on

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:52.265
and seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:55.382
Incredible partnerships between the private sector,

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.586
political leaders, philanthropists

00:01:57.586 --> 00:01:59.615
and amazing grassroots activists

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:01.344
across the developing world,

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:05.878
but also 250,000 people marched in the streets

00:02:05.878 --> 00:02:08.314
of Edinburgh outside this very building

00:02:08.314 --> 00:02:09.658
for Make Poverty History.

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:12.349
All together, they achieved these results:

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.441
increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals,

00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.614
life-saving anti-AIDS drugs;

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:20.302
nearly halved deaths from malaria;

00:02:20.302 --> 00:02:25.064
vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.

00:02:25.064 --> 00:02:27.367
And combined, this is going to result

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:30.450
in two million fewer children dying every year,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.495
last year, than in the year 2000.

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:35.430
That's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.974
ten times you lot not dead every day,

00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:40.956
because of all of these partnerships.

00:02:40.956 --> 00:02:44.059
So I think this is amazing living proof of progress

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.016
that more people should know about,

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:48.423
but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:51.463
is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk.

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.981
Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results,

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:57.192
thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.

00:02:57.192 --> 00:02:59.809
But there's still a lot of unfinished business.

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:04.411
Still, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable,

00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:06.482
treatable diseases,

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:09.215
and 178 million kids are malnourished

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:10.645
to the point of stunting, a horrible term

00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:14.423
which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:16.911
So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got.

00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:19.959
But then, a lot of people think there are things

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.872
that should have been in the original package

00:03:21.872 --> 00:03:24.144
that weren't agreed back then that should now be included,

00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:26.674
like sustainable development targets,

00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:28.936
natural resource governance targets,

00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:31.131
access to opportunity, to knowledge,

00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:33.121
equity, fighting corruption.

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:35.777
All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals.

00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:37.745
But the key thing here is,

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:39.860
what do you think should be in the new goals?

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.772
What do you want?

00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:44.216
Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality

00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:46.093
or education?

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:48.479
Should those be in the new package of goals?

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.493
And quite frankly, that's a good question,

00:03:50.493 --> 00:03:52.439
but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.395
and choices here, so you want to hope

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:56.332
that the process by which the world decides

00:03:56.332 --> 00:03:59.571
these new goals is going to be legitimate, right?

00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:01.597
Well, as we gather here in Edinburgh,

00:04:01.597 --> 00:04:04.579
technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments,

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.042
with the best intentions, are busying themselves

00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:09.441
designing a new package of goals,

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:12.761
and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old

00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:16.494
late-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.

00:04:16.494 --> 00:04:20.296
But, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony,

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:23.038
along with ubiquitous reality TV formats

00:04:23.038 --> 00:04:25.155
have spread all around the world.

00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:27.939
So what we'd like to propose is that we use them

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.961
to involve people from all around the world

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:34.730
in an historic first: the world's first truly global

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.320
poll and consultation, where everyone everywhere

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.668
has an equal voice for the very first time.

00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:45.203
I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:47.851
not to do this, given that we can?

00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:52.750
There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.696
tens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake,

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.043
and, I'd argue, the security and future

00:04:59.043 --> 00:05:01.506
of you and your family is also at stake.

00:05:01.506 --> 00:05:05.095
So, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps

00:05:05.095 --> 00:05:07.450
in this crowdsourcing campaign:

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.327
collecting, connecting and committing.

00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:12.499
So first of all, we've got to ground this campaign

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:14.623
in core polling data.

00:05:14.623 --> 00:05:16.737
Let's go into every country that will let us in,

00:05:16.737 --> 00:05:19.325
ask 1,001 people what they want

00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:21.385
the new goals to be, making special efforts

00:05:21.385 --> 00:05:23.624
to reach the poorest, those without access

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:26.673
to modern technology, and let's make sure that their views

00:05:26.673 --> 00:05:28.957
are at the center of the goals going forward.

00:05:28.957 --> 00:05:33.052
Then, we've got to commission a baseline survey

00:05:33.052 --> 00:05:35.292
to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals

00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:37.318
going forward. The original goals didn't really have

00:05:37.318 --> 00:05:39.192
good baseline survey data,

00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:43.584
and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure

00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:45.656
we can really monitor the progress.

00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:48.361
And then we've got to connect with the big crowd.

00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:51.478
Now here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition

00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:54.448
of social media giants and upstarts,

00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:58.397
telecoms companies, reality TV show formats,

00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:01.895
gaming companies, telecoms, all of them together

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:05.336
in kind of their "We Are The World" moment.

00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:07.643
Could they come together and help

00:06:07.643 --> 00:06:10.424
the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded

00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:13.448
into the Millennial Generation's Goals?

00:06:13.448 --> 00:06:16.261
And if just five percent of the five billion plus

00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:19.508
who are currently connected made a comment,

00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:21.830
and that comment turned into a commitment,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.966
we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:28.384
around the world to help see these goals through.

00:06:28.384 --> 00:06:31.886
If we have this collected data, and this connected crowd,

00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:33.615
based upon our experience of campaigning

00:06:33.615 --> 00:06:35.256
and getting world leaders to commit,

00:06:35.256 --> 00:06:36.697
I think world leaders will commit

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:39.104
to most of the crowdsourced recommendations.

00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:41.727
But the question really is, through this process

00:06:41.727 --> 00:06:44.415
will we all have become committed?

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:47.316
And if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:49.580
and provide feedback, make sure these promises

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.563
are really delivering results?

00:06:51.563 --> 00:06:54.764
Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up,

00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:57.476
mostly piloted within Africa, actually.

00:06:57.476 --> 00:06:59.715
There's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes

00:06:59.715 --> 00:07:02.167
and crowdsources information about where projects are,

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:03.754
are they delivering results.

00:07:03.754 --> 00:07:05.530
Often, they're not in the right place.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.984
And Ushahidi, which means "witness" in Swahili,

00:07:08.984 --> 00:07:11.382
which geocodes and crowdsources information

00:07:11.382 --> 00:07:15.295
in complex emergencies to help target responses.

00:07:15.295 --> 00:07:18.704
This is some of the most exciting stuff

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.563
in development and democracy,

00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:22.662
where citizens on the edge of a network

00:07:22.662 --> 00:07:24.603
are helping to force open the process

00:07:24.603 --> 00:07:27.314
to make sure that the big global aid promises

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:30.768
and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people

00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:34.924
at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.

00:07:34.924 --> 00:07:38.436
This openness, this forcing openness, is key,

00:07:38.436 --> 00:07:41.372
and if it wasn't entirely transparent already,

00:07:41.372 --> 00:07:46.016
I should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda.

00:07:46.016 --> 00:07:48.423
Long-term trends suggest that this century

00:07:48.423 --> 00:07:50.679
is going to be a tough place to live,

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.576
with population increases, consumption patterns increasing,

00:07:54.576 --> 00:07:58.010
and conflict over scarce natural resources.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.654
And look at the state of global politics today.

00:08:01.654 --> 00:08:04.755
Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week,

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:07.109
or the Mexican G20, also last week.

00:08:07.109 --> 00:08:10.020
Both, if we're honest, a bust.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.183
Our world leaders, our global politics,

00:08:12.183 --> 00:08:14.872
currently can't get it done.

00:08:14.872 --> 00:08:18.245
They need our help. They need the cavalry,

00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:20.478
and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.

00:08:20.478 --> 00:08:23.713
It's got to come from us, and I see this process

00:08:23.713 --> 00:08:26.664
of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion

00:08:26.664 --> 00:08:29.058
what the world wants to work on together

00:08:29.058 --> 00:08:32.425
as one vital means by which we can crowdsource

00:08:32.425 --> 00:08:35.753
the force to really build that constituency

00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:38.184
that's going to reinvigorate global governance

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.175
in the 21st century.

00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:45.304
I started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030.

00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:48.803
Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago

00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:50.946
we had called Make Poverty History.

00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:54.236
It was a naive thought in many people's minds,

00:08:54.236 --> 00:08:57.005
and it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan

00:08:57.005 --> 00:09:00.235
that worked for the moment. But look.

00:09:00.235 --> 00:09:04.380
The empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.524
is trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.

00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:09.851
It's getting near zero.

00:09:09.851 --> 00:09:12.091
Now sure, progress in China and India

00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:14.313
and poverty reduction there was key to that,

00:09:14.313 --> 00:09:17.446
but recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:20.280
It will get harder as we get towards zero,

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.418
as the poor will be increasingly located

00:09:22.418 --> 00:09:24.708
in post-conflict, fragile states,

00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:26.684
or maybe in middle income states

00:09:26.684 --> 00:09:29.338
where they don't really care about the marginalized.

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:33.285
But I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning

00:09:33.285 --> 00:09:36.447
and creative and technological innovation combined

00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:38.866
working together more and more as one,

00:09:38.866 --> 00:09:42.489
I think we can get this and other goals done.

00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:45.175
Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:50.500
(Applause)

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.660
Chris Anderson: Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.436
If there was an incident today where a hundred kids

00:09:56.436 --> 00:09:59.961
died in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids

00:09:59.961 --> 00:10:02.852
were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces,

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.106
I mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.726
You just put up, just as one of your numbers there,

00:10:08.726 --> 00:10:11.808
that 5,000 -- is that the number?

00:10:11.808 --> 00:10:13.800
Jamie Drummond: Fewer children every day.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.471
CA: Five thousand fewer children dying every day.

00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:18.784
I mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:22.136
that is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.

00:10:22.136 --> 00:10:23.970
This must drive you crazy.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.809
JD: It does, and we're having a huge debate in this country

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:29.324
about aid levels, for example, and aid alone is not

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:31.642
the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is.

00:10:31.642 --> 00:10:36.196
But, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid,

00:10:36.196 --> 00:10:38.665
I mean, they'd be going crazy for it.

00:10:38.665 --> 00:10:42.296
I wish the 250,000 people who really did march

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:45.550
outside this very building knew these results.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.429
Right now they don't, and it would be great to find a way

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:50.681
to better communicate it, because we have not.

00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:53.963
Creatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far.

00:10:53.963 --> 00:10:57.171
If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice

00:10:57.171 --> 00:10:59.680
and amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.681
we'd get better policy.

00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:04.202
The Mexican G20 need not have been a bust.

00:11:04.202 --> 00:11:06.743
Rio, if anyone cares about the environment,

00:11:06.743 --> 00:11:09.085
need not have been a bust, okay?

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.955
But these conferences are going on,

00:11:10.955 --> 00:11:12.652
and I know people get skeptical and cynical

00:11:12.652 --> 00:11:14.428
about the big global summits and the promises

00:11:14.428 --> 00:11:16.175
and their never being kept, but actually,

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:18.558
the bits that are, are making a difference,

00:11:18.558 --> 00:11:20.007
and what the politicians need

00:11:20.007 --> 00:11:22.248
is more permission from the public.

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:24.337
CA: But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms, etc.

00:11:24.337 --> 00:11:26.297
by which this might happen.

00:11:26.297 --> 00:11:28.184
I mean, if the people here who've had experience

00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:31.344
using open platforms, you're interested to talk with them

00:11:31.344 --> 00:11:32.970
this week and try to take this forward.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.940
JD: Absolutely. CA: All right, well I must say,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.552
if this conference led in some way

00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:40.561
to advancing that idea, that's a huge idea,

00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:42.918
and if you carry that forward, that is really awesome,

00:11:42.918 --> 00:11:44.359
so thank you. JD: I'd love your help.

00:11:44.359 --> 00:11:46.307
CA: Thank you, thank you.

00:11:46.307 --> 00:11:49.380
(Applause)
