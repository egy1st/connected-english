00:00:01.012 --> 00:00:04.191
Well, I was born with a rare visual condition

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:07.904
called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.774
so I've never seen color,

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:12.297
and I don't know what color looks like,

00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:15.272
because I come from a grayscale world.

00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:17.932
To me, the sky is always gray,

00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:19.784
flowers are always gray,

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:21.986
and television is still in black and white.

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:24.279
But, since the age of 21,

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.408
instead of seeing color, I can hear color.

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:31.384
In 2003, I started a project

00:00:31.384 --> 00:00:34.072
with computer scientist Adam Montandon,

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:37.239
and the result, with further collaborations

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.087
with Peter Kese from Slovenia

00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:42.120
and Matias Lizana from Barcelona,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.485
is this electronic eye.

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:46.841
It's a color sensor that detects

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:50.424
the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) —

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:52.776
and sends this frequency to a chip installed

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:55.767
at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:58.663
through the bone, through bone conduction.

00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:02.171
(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like —

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:08.691
This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:16.109
For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.234
This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:22.603
This is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:24.480
Which is like yellow, this one.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.537
So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,

00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:31.172
since 2004, so I find it completely normal now

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:33.651
to hear color all the time.

00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:38.025
At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:40.431
for each color, so I had to memorize the notes,

00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:42.367
but after some time, all this information

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:44.360
became a perception.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.119
I didn't have to think about the notes.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.744
And after some time, this perception became a feeling.

00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:50.750
I started to have favorite colors,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.524
and I started to dream in colors.

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:56.799
So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.686
that the software and my brain had united,

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.642
because in my dreams, it was my brain creating

00:02:02.642 --> 00:02:05.003
electronic sounds. It wasn't the software,

00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:08.522
so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:11.572
It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:13.762
was no longer a device.

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:16.177
It had become a part of my body,

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:18.642
an extension of my senses,

00:02:18.642 --> 00:02:21.268
and after some time, it even became a part

00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:24.795
of my official image.

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:27.141
This is my passport from 2004.

00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:30.226
You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports

00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:33.038
with electronic equipment, but I insisted

00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:35.439
to the passport office that what they were seeing

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.943
was actually a new part of my body,

00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:41.463
an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me

00:02:41.463 --> 00:02:43.974
to appear with the passport photo.

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:47.431
So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,

00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:50.025
because color is almost everywhere,

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:52.902
so the biggest change for example is

00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:57.440
going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.294
for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:02.505
because I can listen to the paintings.

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:04.966
And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:07.916
it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:09.404
It's like going to a nightclub.

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:12.660
It's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.735
Especially the aisle with cleaning products.

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:18.086
It's just fabulous. (Laughter)

00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:20.558
Also, the way I dress has changed.

00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:22.966
Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:27.543
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)

00:03:27.543 --> 00:03:32.674
(Applause)

00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:35.183
So today I'm dressed in C major,

00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:38.492
so it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:40.366
If I had to go to a funeral, though,

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:42.933
I would dress in B minor, which would be

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:51.692
turquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)

00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:56.037
Also, food, the way I look at food has changed,

00:03:56.037 --> 00:03:59.493
because now I can display the food on a plate,

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:02.445
so I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)

00:04:02.445 --> 00:04:03.674
So depending on how I display it,

00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:06.424
I can hear and I can compose music with food.

00:04:06.424 --> 00:04:09.149
So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.133
Lady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:15.150
this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.589
And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.823
as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,

00:04:21.823 --> 00:04:24.932
that would be a very exciting restaurant

00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:27.692
where you can actually eat songs.

00:04:27.692 --> 00:04:32.142
Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed,

00:04:32.142 --> 00:04:36.822
because when I look at someone, I hear their face,

00:04:36.822 --> 00:04:41.824
so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.

00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:43.585
(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,

00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:45.833
the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:47.562
sound portraits of people.

00:04:47.562 --> 00:04:51.202
Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,

00:04:51.202 --> 00:04:53.633
I point at them with the eye and I write down

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:56.904
the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.

00:04:56.904 --> 00:04:58.641
Here's some faces.

00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:13.168
(Musical chords)

00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:16.601
Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)

00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:19.650
Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.448
Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.

00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:24.585
They have similar sound of eyes.

00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:26.633
So you relate people that you wouldn't relate,

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:30.146
and you can actually also create concerts

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:32.786
by looking at the audience faces.

00:05:32.786 --> 00:05:35.882
So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.386
The good thing about this is,

00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:40.353
if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.

00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:42.624
It's not my fault, because — (Laughter)

00:05:42.624 --> 00:05:46.931
And so another thing that happens is that

00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:49.808
I started having this secondary effect

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:53.138
that normal sounds started to become color.

00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:56.899
I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.225
because it sounded just like the color green.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.523
The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,

00:06:02.523 --> 00:06:05.650
and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.410
so I started to paint music and paint people's voices,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.353
because people's voices have frequencies

00:06:12.353 --> 00:06:13.896
that I relate to color.

00:06:13.896 --> 00:06:19.015
And here's some music translated into color.

00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:24.215
For example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.

00:06:24.215 --> 00:06:26.027
(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,

00:06:26.027 --> 00:06:28.217
because there's many different frequencies.

00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:31.127
(Music)

00:06:32.143 --> 00:06:34.457
And this is a completely different song.

00:06:34.457 --> 00:06:38.388
(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby." (Laughter)

00:06:38.388 --> 00:06:40.119
(Music)

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.689
It is very pink and very yellow.

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:50.856
So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,

00:06:50.856 --> 00:06:54.400
for example, these are two very well-known speeches.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.137
One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream,"

00:06:58.137 --> 00:06:59.589
and the other one is Hitler.

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:03.065
And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:05.641
without labels, and then I ask people,

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:07.488
"Which one do you prefer?"

00:07:07.488 --> 00:07:09.753
And most people change their preference

00:07:09.753 --> 00:07:12.664
when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler

00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:15.784
and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.

00:07:15.784 --> 00:07:21.523
So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,

00:07:21.523 --> 00:07:23.108
just like human vision.

00:07:23.108 --> 00:07:26.703
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.

00:07:26.703 --> 00:07:28.785
But then, I just thought that

00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:32.024
this human vision wasn't good enough.

00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:34.235
There's many, many more colors around us

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:36.072
that we cannot perceive,

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:37.828
but that electronic eyes can perceive.

00:07:37.828 --> 00:07:41.557
So I decided to continue extending my color senses,

00:07:41.557 --> 00:07:45.807
and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet

00:07:45.807 --> 00:07:49.165
to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors

00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:51.389
that the human eye cannot perceive.

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:54.836
For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can

00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:58.904
actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.

00:07:58.904 --> 00:08:02.357
I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:05.507
And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that

00:08:05.507 --> 00:08:10.472
you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,

00:08:10.472 --> 00:08:12.629
because ultraviolet is a dangerous color,

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:16.613
a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish

00:08:16.613 --> 00:08:19.574
to perceive things that we cannot perceive.

00:08:19.574 --> 00:08:21.309
That's why, two years ago,

00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:22.990
I created the Cyborg Foundation,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.432
which is a foundation that tries to help people

00:08:25.432 --> 00:08:28.129
become a cyborg, tries to encourage people

00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:29.506
to extend their senses

00:08:29.506 --> 00:08:32.577
by using technology as part of the body.

00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:36.480
We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.456
so if we extend our senses,

00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:41.544
we will consequently extend our knowledge.

00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:44.337
I think life will be much more exciting

00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:47.561
when we stop creating applications for mobile phones

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.962
and we start creating applications for our own body.

00:08:50.962 --> 00:08:52.778
I think this will be a big, big change

00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:54.856
that we will see during this century.

00:08:54.856 --> 00:08:58.771
So I do encourage you all to think about which senses

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.190
you'd like to extend.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.363
I would encourage you to become a cyborg.

00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:08.011
You won't be alone. Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:14.531
(Applause)
