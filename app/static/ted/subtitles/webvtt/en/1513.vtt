WEBVTT

00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:05.342
I'm gonna talk a little bit about open-source security,

00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:07.366
because we've got to get better at security

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.386
in this 21st century.

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:14.073
Let me start by saying, let's look back to the 20th century,

00:00:14.073 --> 00:00:17.742
and kind of get a sense of how that style of security

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:19.220
worked for us.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.512
This is Verdun, a battlefield in France

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:25.829
just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.445
At Verdun, in 1916, over a 300-day period,

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:35.573
700,000 people were killed,

00:00:35.573 --> 00:00:37.632
so about 2,000 a day.

00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:41.960
If you roll it forward -- 20th-century security --

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.863
into the Second World War,

00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:47.345
you see the Battle of Stalingrad,

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.913
300 days, 2 million people killed.

00:00:50.913 --> 00:00:53.699
We go into the Cold War, and we continue

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.478
to try and build walls.

00:00:56.478 --> 00:01:00.530
We go from the trench warfare of the First World War

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.109
to the Maginot Line of the Second World War,

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:06.538
and then we go into the Cold War,

00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:09.476
the Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:11.703
Walls don't work.

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:16.035
My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:19.691
to create security, we need to build bridges.

00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:22.115
This is a famous bridge in Europe.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.237
It's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

00:01:24.237 --> 00:01:26.476
It's the bridge over the Drina River,

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:29.302
the subject of a novel by Ivo Andrić,

00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:31.060
and it talks about how,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.926
in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans,

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:39.069
over time there's been enormous building of walls.

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.160
More recently, in the last decade, we begin to see

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.850
these communities start, hesitatingly,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.403
to come together.

00:01:47.403 --> 00:01:51.576
I would argue, again, open-source security

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:54.412
is about connecting the international,

00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:58.159
the interagency, the private-public,

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.924
and lashing it together with strategic communication,

00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:04.392
largely in social networks.

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:08.757
So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that,

00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:12.504
because our global commons is under attack

00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:14.487
in a variety of ways,

00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:18.253
and none of the sources of threat to the global commons

00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:21.082
will be solved by building walls.

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:23.388
Now, I'm a sailor, obviously.

00:02:23.388 --> 00:02:27.997
This is a ship, a liner, clipping through the Indian Ocean.

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.618
What's wrong with this picture?

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:34.129
It's got concertina wire along the sides of it.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.885
That's to prevent pirates from attacking it.

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:39.992
Piracy is a very active threat today

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:43.321
around the world. This is in the Indian Ocean.

00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:47.112
Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.

00:02:47.112 --> 00:02:49.188
It's active in the Gulf of Guinea.

00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:50.945
We see it in the Caribbean.

00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:53.732
It's a $10-billion-a-year discontinuity

00:02:53.732 --> 00:02:57.298
in the global transport system.

00:02:57.298 --> 00:03:00.753
Last year, at this time, there were 20 vessels,

00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:03.340
500 mariners held hostage.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.963
This is an attack on the global commons.

00:03:06.963 --> 00:03:09.749
We need to think about how to address it.

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.199
Let's shift to a different kind of sea,

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.577
the cyber sea.

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:17.814
Here are photographs of two young men.

00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:20.211
At the moment, they're incarcerated.

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:25.690
They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.010
over 10 billion dollars.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.036
This is part of cybercrime which is a $2-trillion-a-year

00:03:34.036 --> 00:03:37.062
discontinuity in the global economy.

00:03:37.062 --> 00:03:38.408
Two trillion a year.

00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:41.870
That's just under the GDP of Great Britain.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.797
So this cyber sea, which we know endlessly

00:03:44.797 --> 00:03:48.793
is the fundamental piece of radical openness,

00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:53.323
is very much under threat as well.

00:03:53.323 --> 00:03:56.346
Another thing I worry about in the global commons

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:59.106
is the threat posed by trafficking,

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:03.640
by the movement of narcotics, opium,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.004
here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe

00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:08.414
over to the United States.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.571
We worry about cocaine

00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:12.956
coming from the Andean Ridge north.

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:16.174
We worry about the movement of illegal weapons

00:04:16.174 --> 00:04:18.593
and trafficking. Above all, perhaps,

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:22.564
we worry about human trafficking, and the awful cost of it.

00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:25.219
Trafficking moves largely at sea

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.706
but in other parts of the global commons.

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:32.319
This is a photograph, and I wish I could tell you

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.191
that this is a very high-tech piece of US Navy gear

00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:39.880
that we're using to stop the trafficking.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.680
The bad news is,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.305
this is a semi-submersible run by drug cartels.

00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:51.478
It was built in the jungles of South America.

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:56.340
We caught it with that low-tech raft — (Laughter) —

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.222
and it was carrying six tons of cocaine.

00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:04.693
Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep.

00:05:04.693 --> 00:05:09.755
This kind of trafficking, in narcotics, in humans, in weapons,

00:05:09.755 --> 00:05:12.660
God forbid, in weapons of mass destruction,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.549
is part of the threat to the global commons.

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:19.703
And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today.

00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:22.449
This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan.

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.757
Eighty to 90 percent of the world's poppy,

00:05:25.757 --> 00:05:29.076
opium and heroin, comes out of Afghanistan.

00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:31.855
We also see there, of course, terrorism.

00:05:31.855 --> 00:05:34.157
This is where al Qaeda is staged from.

00:05:34.157 --> 00:05:38.763
We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there.

00:05:38.763 --> 00:05:42.543
So this terrorism concern is also part

00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:46.616
of the global commons, and what we must address.

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:49.929
So here we are, 21st century.

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:53.648
We know our 20th-century tools are not going to work.

00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:56.213
What should we do?

00:05:56.213 --> 00:06:00.978
I would argue that we will not deliver security

00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:03.431
solely from the barrel of a gun.

00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:07.594
We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.

00:06:07.594 --> 00:06:10.497
We will need the application of military force.

00:06:10.497 --> 00:06:13.591
When we do it, we must do it well, and competently.

00:06:13.591 --> 00:06:19.756
But my thesis is, open-source security is about international,

00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:24.291
interagency, private-public connection pulled together

00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:30.580
by this idea of strategic communication on the Internet.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.141
Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way.

00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:38.612
This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers.

00:06:38.612 --> 00:06:40.930
They are all holding books.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.734
You should say, "That's odd. I thought I read that

00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:49.230
this demographic, young men and women

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.199
in their 20s and 30s, is largely illiterate in Afghanistan."

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.940
You would be correct.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.137
Eighty-five percent cannot read

00:06:58.137 --> 00:07:01.197
when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan.

00:07:01.197 --> 00:07:04.344
Why? Because the Taliban withheld education

00:07:04.344 --> 00:07:07.628
during the period of time in which these men and women

00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:09.019
would have learned to read.

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:10.762
So the question is, so,

00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:14.103
why are they all standing there holding books?

00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:17.796
The answer is, we are teaching them to read

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:21.164
in literacy courses by NATO

00:07:21.164 --> 00:07:24.659
in partnership with private sector entities,

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:28.046
in partnership with development agencies.

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:32.507
We've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces

00:07:32.507 --> 00:07:35.055
to read and write at a basic level.

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:37.838
When you can read and write in Afghanistan,

00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:40.977
you will typically put a pen in your pocket.

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:43.565
At the ceremonies, when these young men and women

00:07:43.565 --> 00:07:47.109
graduate, they take that pen with great pride,

00:07:47.109 --> 00:07:49.209
and put it in their pocket.

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:52.151
This is bringing together international

00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:54.997
— there are 50 nations involved in this mission —

00:07:54.997 --> 00:07:57.843
interagency — these development agencies —

00:07:57.843 --> 00:08:01.933
and private-public, to take on this kind of security.

00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:05.567
Now, we are also teaching them combat skills, of course,

00:08:05.567 --> 00:08:08.335
but I would argue, open-source security

00:08:08.335 --> 00:08:11.019
means connecting in ways that create

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:13.871
longer lasting security effect.

00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:16.171
Here's another example.

00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:19.610
This is a US Navy warship.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.529
It's called the Comfort.

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:24.266
There's a sister ship called the Mercy.

00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:26.401
They are hospital ships.

00:08:26.401 --> 00:08:28.483
This one, the Comfort, operates throughout

00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:32.094
the Caribbean and the coast of South America

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:34.082
conducting patient treatments.

00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:38.823
On a typical cruise, they'll do 400,000 patient treatments.

00:08:38.823 --> 00:08:42.614
It is crewed not strictly by military

00:08:42.614 --> 00:08:46.518
but by a combination of humanitarian organizations:

00:08:46.518 --> 00:08:49.786
Operation Hope, Project Smile.

00:08:49.786 --> 00:08:53.372
Other organizations send volunteers.

00:08:53.372 --> 00:08:55.627
Interagency physicians come out.

00:08:55.627 --> 00:08:57.756
They're all part of this.

00:08:57.756 --> 00:09:00.661
To give you one example of the impact this can have,

00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:03.890
this little boy, eight years old,

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.109
walked with his mother two days

00:09:07.109 --> 00:09:10.201
to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort.

00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:15.569
When he was fitted, over his extremely myopic eyes,

00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:18.715
he suddenly looked up and said,

00:09:18.715 --> 00:09:21.953
"Mama, veo el mundo."

00:09:21.953 --> 00:09:24.841
"Mom, I see the world."

00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:28.299
Multiply this by 400,000 patient treatments,

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:32.968
this private-public collaboration with security forces,

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:35.037
and you begin to see the power

00:09:35.037 --> 00:09:38.833
of creating security in a very different way.

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:43.130
Here you see baseball players.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.950
Can you pick out the two US Army soldiers

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.907
in this photograph?

00:09:48.907 --> 00:09:51.102
They are the two young men on either side

00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:54.117
of these young boys. This is part of a series

00:09:54.117 --> 00:09:57.960
of baseball clinics, where we have explored collaboration

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.068
between Major League Baseball,

00:10:00.068 --> 00:10:01.424
the Department of State,

00:10:01.424 --> 00:10:03.815
who sets up the diplomatic piece of this,

00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:08.040
military baseball players, who are real soldiers

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.073
with real skills but participate in this mission,

00:10:12.073 --> 00:10:13.975
and they put on clinics

00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:16.061
throughout Latin America and the Caribbean,

00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:19.421
in Honduras, in Nicaragua,

00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:24.123
in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.913
where baseball is so popular,

00:10:25.913 --> 00:10:28.169
and it creates security.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.627
It shows role models to young men and women

00:10:30.627 --> 00:10:34.227
about fitness and about life that I would argue

00:10:34.227 --> 00:10:38.392
help create security for us.

00:10:38.392 --> 00:10:40.989
Another aspect of this partnership

00:10:40.989 --> 00:10:42.940
is in disaster relief.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.687
This is a US Air Force helicopter participating

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:53.641
after the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people.

00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:58.152
In each of these major disasters — the tsunami in 2004,

00:10:58.152 --> 00:11:05.026
250,000 dead, the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan, 2005,

00:11:05.026 --> 00:11:07.052
85,000 dead,

00:11:07.052 --> 00:11:11.721
the Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead,

00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:16.612
more recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination

00:11:16.612 --> 00:11:19.976
which struck Japan and its nuclear industry —

00:11:19.976 --> 00:11:23.063
in all of these instances, we see partnerships

00:11:23.063 --> 00:11:26.385
between international actors,

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:30.293
interagency, private-public working with security forces

00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:34.119
to respond to this kind of natural disaster.

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:38.471
So these are examples of this idea of open-source security.

00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:43.142
We tie it together, increasingly, by doing things like this.

00:11:43.142 --> 00:11:46.053
Now, you're looking at this thinking, "Ah, Admiral,

00:11:46.053 --> 00:11:49.239
these must be sea lanes of communication,

00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:52.039
or these might be fiber optic cables."

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:57.231
No. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter.

00:11:57.231 --> 00:12:03.799
Purple are tweets. Green are geolocation.

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:05.845
White is the synthesis.

00:12:05.845 --> 00:12:09.930
It's a perfect evocation of that great population survey,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.677
the six largest nations in the world in descending order:

00:12:13.677 --> 00:12:16.355
China, India, Facebook, the United States,

00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:20.677
Twitter and Indonesia. (Laughter)

00:12:20.677 --> 00:12:22.440
Why do we want to get in these nets?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.250
Why do we want to be involved?

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.106
We talked earlier about the Arab Spring,

00:12:26.106 --> 00:12:27.507
and the power of all this.

00:12:27.507 --> 00:12:28.850
I'll give you another example,

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.103
and it's how you move this message.

00:12:31.103 --> 00:12:33.436
I gave a talk like this in London a while back

00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:36.824
about this point. I said, as I say to all of you,

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:38.970
I'm on Facebook. Friend me.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.097
Got a little laugh from the audience.

00:12:41.097 --> 00:12:46.328
There was an article which was run by AP, on the wire.

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:48.844
Got picked up in two places in the world:

00:12:48.844 --> 00:12:51.192
Finland and Indonesia.

00:12:51.192 --> 00:12:55.082
The headline was: NATO Admiral Needs Friends.

00:12:55.082 --> 00:12:56.565
(Laughter)

00:12:56.565 --> 00:12:59.109
Thank you. (Applause)

00:12:59.109 --> 00:13:01.663
Which I do. (Laughter)

00:13:01.663 --> 00:13:04.220
And the story was a catalyst,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.939
and the next morning I had hundreds

00:13:06.939 --> 00:13:08.574
of Facebook friend requests

00:13:08.574 --> 00:13:11.091
from Indonesians and Finns,

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:14.073
mostly saying, "Admiral, we heard you need a friend,

00:13:14.073 --> 00:13:17.675
and oh, by the way, what is NATO?" (Laughter)

00:13:17.675 --> 00:13:19.727
So ... (Laughter)

00:13:19.727 --> 00:13:23.813
Yeah, we laugh, but this is how we move the message,

00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:26.548
and moving that message is how we connect

00:13:26.548 --> 00:13:28.999
international, interagency, private-public,

00:13:28.999 --> 00:13:32.869
and these social nets to help create security.

00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:36.302
Now, let me hit a somber note.

00:13:36.302 --> 00:13:40.060
This is a photograph of a brave British soldier.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.266
He's in the Scots Guards.

00:13:42.266 --> 00:13:44.012
He's standing the watch in Helmand,

00:13:44.012 --> 00:13:46.276
in southern Afghanistan.

00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:48.932
I put him here to remind us,

00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:52.259
I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking

00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:56.472
that we do not need capable, competent militaries

00:13:56.472 --> 00:13:59.707
who can create real military effect.

00:13:59.707 --> 00:14:02.802
That is the core of who we are and what we do,

00:14:02.802 --> 00:14:06.858
and we do it to protect freedom, freedom of speech,

00:14:06.858 --> 00:14:09.823
all the things we treasure in our societies.

00:14:09.823 --> 00:14:14.082
But, you know, life is not an on-and-off switch.

00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:16.471
You don't have to have a military that is either

00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:20.274
in hard combat or is in the barracks.

00:14:20.274 --> 00:14:25.057
I would argue life is a rheostat.

00:14:25.057 --> 00:14:27.586
You have to dial it in,

00:14:27.586 --> 00:14:30.855
and as I think about how we create security

00:14:30.855 --> 00:14:33.507
in this 21st century, there will be times

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:38.636
when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis,

00:14:38.636 --> 00:14:40.557
but there will be many instances,

00:14:40.557 --> 00:14:42.315
as we've talked about today,

00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:45.507
where our militaries can be part of creating

00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:49.561
21st-century security, international,

00:14:49.561 --> 00:14:51.969
interagency, private-public,

00:14:51.969 --> 00:14:56.525
connected with competent communication.

00:14:56.525 --> 00:15:01.012
I would close by saying that we heard earlier today

00:15:01.012 --> 00:15:04.975
about Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time

00:15:04.975 --> 00:15:08.136
to look up facts, and as all of you appreciate,

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:12.289
Wikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people

00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:14.764
locked in a room writing articles.

00:15:14.764 --> 00:15:18.477
Wikipedia, every day, is tens of thousands of people

00:15:18.477 --> 00:15:23.277
inputting information, and every day millions of people

00:15:23.277 --> 00:15:25.140
withdrawing that information.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.760
It's a perfect image for the fundamental point

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.382
that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.

00:15:33.382 --> 00:15:37.042
No one person, no one alliance, no one nation,

00:15:37.042 --> 00:15:41.823
no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.

00:15:41.823 --> 00:15:46.505
The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple:

00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:49.619
a world in which every human being can freely share

00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:51.252
in the sum of all knowledge.

00:15:51.252 --> 00:15:55.730
My thesis for you is that by combining international,

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.900
interagency, private-public, strategic communication,

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.365
together, in this 21st century,

00:16:03.365 --> 00:16:06.632
we can create the sum of all security.

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.089
Thank you. (Applause)

00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:13.315
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
