WEBVTT

00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:03.388
I'm going to start
on a slightly somber note.

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:07.423
Two thousand and seven, five years ago,

00:00:07.447 --> 00:00:10.468
my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.342
Stage IIB.

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:17.095
Now, looking back, the most
harrowing part of that experience

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.926
was not just the hospital visits --

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.762
these were very painful
for my wife, understandably so.

00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:25.641
It was not even the initial shock
of knowing that she had breast cancer

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:26.816
at just 39 years old,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.281
absolutely no history
of cancer in her family.

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:34.400
The most horrifying and agonizing part
of the whole experience

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:38.191
was we were making decisions
after decisions after decisions

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:39.810
that were being thrust upon us.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:42.996
Should it be a mastectomy?
Should it be a lumpectomy?

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.620
Should it be a more
aggressive form of treatment,

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:47.157
given that it was stage IIB?

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.789
With all the side effects?

00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:51.326
Or should it be a less
aggressive form of treatment?

00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:55.493
And these were being thrust
upon us by the doctors.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.022
Now you could ask this question,

00:00:58.046 --> 00:00:59.584
why were the doctors doing this?

00:00:59.608 --> 00:01:01.067
A simplistic answer would be,

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:02.348
the doctors are doing this

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.965
because they want to protect
themselves legally.

00:01:05.893 --> 00:01:07.576
I think that is too simplistic.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.116
These are well-meaning doctors,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.775
some of them have gone on
to become very good friends.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.952
They probably were simply
following the wisdom

00:01:13.976 --> 00:01:15.729
that has come down through the ages,

00:01:15.753 --> 00:01:17.868
this adage that when
you're making decisions,

00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:19.574
especially decisions of importance,

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:22.141
it's best to be in charge,
it's best to be in control,

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:24.163
it's best to be in the driver's seat.

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:27.217
And we were certainly
in the driver's seat,

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.551
making all these decisions.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:31.169
And let me tell you --
if some of you have been there,

00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:33.614
it was a most agonizing
and harrowing experience.

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:35.831
Which got me thinking.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:39.140
I said, is there any validity
to this whole adage

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:41.228
that when you're making decisions,

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:43.349
it's best to take the driver's seat,

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:44.755
be in charge, be in control?

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.567
Or are there contexts
where we're far better off

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:50.073
taking the passenger's seat

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:51.447
and have someone else drive?

00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:53.453
For example, a trusted financial advisor,

00:01:53.477 --> 00:01:55.089
could be a trusted doctor, etc.

00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:58.816
And since I study human decision making,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.293
I said, I'm going to run some studies

00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:02.773
to find some answers.

00:02:02.797 --> 00:02:05.739
And I'm going to share one
of these studies with you today.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.111
So, imagine that all of you
are participants in the study.

00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:13.379
I want to tell you that
what you're going to do in the study is,

00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:15.409
you're going to drink a cup of tea.

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:19.369
If you're wondering why, I'll tell you why
in a few seconds from now.

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:21.718
You are going to solve
a series of puzzles,

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:25.647
and I'm going to show you examples
of these puzzles momentarily.

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:27.700
And the more puzzles you solve,

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:30.341
the greater the chances
that you'll win some prizes.

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.085
Now, why do you have to consume the tea?

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.928
Why? Because it makes a lot of sense:

00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:38.166
In order to solve these puzzles
effectively, if you think about it,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.588
your mind needs to be in two states
simultaneously, right?

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.108
It needs to be alert,

00:02:44.132 --> 00:02:45.735
for which caffeine is very good.

00:02:46.823 --> 00:02:49.523
Simultaneously, it needs to be calm --

00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:51.270
not agitated, calm --

00:02:51.294 --> 00:02:53.113
for which chamomile is very good.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:58.172
Now comes the between-subjects design,

00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:00.007
the AB design, the AB testing.

00:03:00.031 --> 00:03:03.728
So what I'm going to do is randomly
assign you to one of two groups.

00:03:03.752 --> 00:03:06.349
So imagine that there is
an imaginary line out here,

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:09.557
so everyone here will be group A,

00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.389
everyone out here will be group B.

00:03:12.427 --> 00:03:17.115
Now, for you folks, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you these two teas,

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.331
and I'll go ahead and ask you
to choose your tea.

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:22.323
So you can choose whichever tea you want.

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:24.497
You can decide, what is your mental state:

00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.133
OK, I choose the caffeinated tea,

00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:27.448
I choose the chamomile tea.

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:30.458
So you're going to be in charge,
you're going to be in control,

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:32.844
you're going to be in the driver's seat.

00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:36.021
You folks, I'm going to show you
these two teas,

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:37.672
but you don't have a choice.

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:40.200
I'm going to give you
one of these two teas,

00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:42.922
and keep in mind, I'm going
to pick one of these two teas

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:44.341
at random for you.

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:45.647
And you know that.

00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:49.013
So if you think about it,
this is an extreme-case scenario,

00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:50.323
because in the real world,

00:03:50.347 --> 00:03:52.344
whenever you are taking passenger's seat,

00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:54.964
very often the driver is going
to be someone you trust,

00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:56.211
an expert, etc.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.068
So this is an extreme-case scenario.

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:03.996
Now, you're all going to consume the tea.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.059
So imagine that you're taking the tea now,

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.863
we'll wait for you to finish the tea.

00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:11.743
We'll give another five minutes
for the ingredient to have its effects.

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:16.551
Now you're going to have
30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles.

00:04:17.328 --> 00:04:19.929
Here's an example of the puzzle
you're going to solve.

00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:22.738
Anyone in the audience
want to take a stab?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.923
Audience member: Pulpit!
Baba Shiv: Whoa! OK.

00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:26.097
That's cool.

00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:29.125
Yeah, so what we'd do if we had
you who gave the answer

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:30.428
as a participant,

00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:32.610
we would have calibrated
the difficulty level

00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:34.717
of the puzzles to your expertise.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.066
Because we want
these puzzles to be difficult.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.305
These are tricky puzzles,

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:40.843
because your first instinct
is to say "tulip."

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.307
And then you have to unstick yourself.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.111
Right?

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:47.850
So these have been calibrated
to your level of expertise,

00:04:47.874 --> 00:04:49.731
because we want this to be difficult,

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:51.925
and I'll tell you why, momentarily.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.680
Now, here's another example.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.266
Anyone? This is much more difficult.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.306
Audience member: Embark.
BS: Yeah. Wow! OK.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.205
So, yeah, so this is, again, difficult.

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.062
You'll say "kamber," then you'll go,
"maker," and all that,

00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:04.716
and then you can unstick yourself.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.647
So you have 30 minutes now
to solve these 15 puzzles.

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:12.897
Now, the question we're asking
here is, in terms of the outcome --

00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:15.516
and it comes in the number
of puzzles solved --

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.740
will you in the driver's seat
end up solving more puzzles

00:05:19.764 --> 00:05:21.067
because you are in control,

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:23.249
you could decide which tea
you would choose,

00:05:23.273 --> 00:05:24.780
or would you be better off,

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:26.890
in terms of the number of puzzles solved?

00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:30.380
And, systemically, what we will show,

00:05:30.404 --> 00:05:31.958
across a series of studies,

00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:34.276
is that you, the passengers,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.849
even though the tea
was picked for you at random,

00:05:37.873 --> 00:05:40.744
will end up solving
more puzzles than you, the drivers.

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.492
We also observe another thing,

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:47.274
and that is, you folks not only
are solving fewer puzzles,

00:05:47.298 --> 00:05:51.115
you're also putting less juice
into the task -- less effort,

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.805
you're less persistent, and so on.

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:53.980
How do we know that?

00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:56.299
Well, we have two objective measures.

00:05:56.323 --> 00:05:59.471
One is, what is the time,
on average, you're taking

00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:01.577
in attempting to solve these puzzles?

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:04.275
You will spend less time compared to you.

00:06:04.771 --> 00:06:06.787
Second, you have
30 minutes to solve these;

00:06:06.811 --> 00:06:08.549
are you taking the entire 30 minutes

00:06:08.573 --> 00:06:10.962
or are you giving up
before the 30 minutes elapse?

00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:14.060
You will be more likely to give up
before the 30 minutes elapse,

00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:16.076
compared to you.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.732
So you're putting in less juice,

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:20.191
and therefore, the outcome:
fewer puzzles solved.

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:25.766
That brings us now to:
why does this happen?

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.389
And under what situations -- when --
would we see this pattern of results

00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:34.104
where the passenger is going to show
better, more favorable outcomes,

00:06:34.128 --> 00:06:35.561
compared to the driver?

00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:41.001
It all has to do with when you face
what I call the INCA.

00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:46.261
It's an acronym that stands for the nature
of the feedback you're getting

00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:47.820
after you made the decision.

00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.063
So if you think about it,
in this particular puzzle task --

00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:53.411
it could happen in investing
in the stock market,

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:54.589
very volatile out there,

00:06:54.613 --> 00:06:56.415
it could be the medical situation --

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.082
the feedback here is immediate.

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:01.387
You know the feedback,
whether you're solving the puzzles or not.

00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:04.022
Right? Second, it is negative.

00:07:04.046 --> 00:07:06.614
Remember, the deck
was stacked against you,

00:07:06.638 --> 00:07:09.106
in terms of the difficulty
level of these puzzles.

00:07:09.454 --> 00:07:11.468
And this can happen in the medical domain.

00:07:11.492 --> 00:07:13.594
For example, very early on
in the treatment,

00:07:13.618 --> 00:07:16.682
things are negative, the feedback,
before things become positive.

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:18.728
Right? It can happen in the stock market.

00:07:18.752 --> 00:07:22.108
Volatile stock market, getting negative
feedback, it is also immediate.

00:07:22.132 --> 00:07:25.780
And the feedback in all these cases
is concrete, it's unambiguous;

00:07:25.804 --> 00:07:28.309
you know if you've solved
the puzzles or not.

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:29.966
Now, the added one,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.444
apart from this immediacy,
negative, this concreteness --

00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:38.069
now you have a sense of agency.

00:07:39.004 --> 00:07:41.474
You were responsible for your decision.

00:07:41.974 --> 00:07:43.426
So what do you do?

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.954
You focus on the foregone option.

00:07:46.327 --> 00:07:47.979
You say, you know what?

00:07:48.003 --> 00:07:49.795
I should have chosen the other tea.

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:52.605
(Laughter)

00:07:53.422 --> 00:07:56.180
That casts your decision in doubt,

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:58.506
reduces the confidence
you have in the decision,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.886
the confidence you have
in the performance,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.181
the performance in terms
of solving the puzzles.

00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:05.259
And therefore less juice into the task,

00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:07.036
fewer puzzles solved

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.715
and less favorable outcomes
compared to you folks.

00:08:10.312 --> 00:08:13.735
And this can happen in the medical
domain, if you think about it, right?

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.878
A patient in the driver's
seat, for example.

00:08:15.902 --> 00:08:18.253
Less juice, which means
keeping herself or himself

00:08:18.277 --> 00:08:21.801
less physically fit, physically active
to hasten the recovery process,

00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:23.420
which is what is often advocated.

00:08:23.444 --> 00:08:25.055
You probably wouldn't do that.

00:08:25.656 --> 00:08:31.556
And therefore, there are times
when you're facing the INCA,

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.497
when the feedback is going
to be immediate, negative, concrete

00:08:35.521 --> 00:08:37.117
and you have the sense of agency,

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:40.596
where you're far better off
taking the passenger's seat

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.350
and have someone else drive.

00:08:43.604 --> 00:08:46.804
Now, I started off on a somber note.

00:08:46.828 --> 00:08:48.867
I want to finish up on a more upbeat note.

00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:52.001
It has now been five years,
slightly more than five years,

00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:57.586
and the good news, thank God,
is that the cancer is still in remission.

00:08:58.618 --> 00:09:00.343
So it all ends well.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:07.135
But one thing I didn't mention
was that very early on into her treatment,

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:10.587
my wife and I decided
that we would take the passenger's seat.

00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:13.066
And that made so much of a difference

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.865
in terms of the peace of mind
that came with that;

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.751
we could focus on her recovery.

00:09:17.775 --> 00:09:20.706
We let the doctors make all the decisions

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.238
and take the driver's seat.

00:09:22.936 --> 00:09:24.088
Thank you.

00:09:24.112 --> 00:09:28.118
(Applause)
