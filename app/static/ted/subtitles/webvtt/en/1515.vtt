WEBVTT

00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.790
So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.188
could see the world in the same way that we do,

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:08.114
as we're walking around being able

00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:10.313
to point a phone at anything,

00:00:10.313 --> 00:00:12.408
and then have it actually recognize images and objects

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:15.178
like the human brain, and then be able to pull in information

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:18.177
from an almost infinite library of knowledge

00:00:18.177 --> 00:00:20.290
and experiences and ideas.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.377
Well, traditionally that was seen as science fiction,

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:23.527
but now we've moved to a world

00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:25.858
where actually this has become possible.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.453
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it.

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:30.058
What you can see over here is Tamara,

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:31.873
who is holding my phone that's now plugged in.

00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:33.809
So let me start with this.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.377
What we have here is a painting

00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:37.633
of the great poet Rabbie Burns,

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.450
and it's just a normal image,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.841
but if we now switch inputs over to the phone,

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.066
running our technology, you can see

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.408
effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen,

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:47.961
and when she points at this image,

00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:50.178
something magical happens.

00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:54.540
(Laughter) (Bagpipes)

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.148
(Bagpipes) (Applause)

00:00:57.148 --> 00:01:04.028
(Bagpipes)

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:05.826
Voice: Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:07.451
Matt Mills: Now, what's great about this is,

00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:09.263
there's no trickery here.

00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:11.899
There's nothing done to this image.

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.924
And what's great about this is the technology's

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:17.499
actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.629
much like how the human brain does.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:22.132
Not only that, but as I move the object around,

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:28.171
it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.208
Again, the thing that's incredible about this is

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:32.394
this is how advanced these devices have become.

00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:34.522
All the processing to do that was actually done

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:36.988
on the device itself.

00:01:36.988 --> 00:01:39.039
Now, this has applications everywhere,

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.754
whether in things like art in museums, like you just saw,

00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:46.009
or in the world of, say, advertising, or print journalism.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.410
So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.402
And here is this morning's newspaper,

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.580
and we have some Wimbledon news, which is great.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.545
Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:58.641
and immediately get the bulletin.

00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:01.872
Voice: ... To the grass, and it's very important that you adapt

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.268
and you, you have to be flexible, you have to be willing

00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:06.789
to change direction at a split second,

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.771
and she does all that. She's won this title.

00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:12.956
MM: And that linking of the digital content

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:15.385
to something that's physical is what we call an aura, and

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.752
I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk.

00:02:17.752 --> 00:02:21.044
So, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster,

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:23.864
more convenient way to get information in the real world,

00:02:23.864 --> 00:02:26.383
but there are times when actually using this medium

00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:28.715
allows you to be able to display information in a way

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.830
that was never before possible.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.669
So what I have here is a wireless router.

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.934
My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router,

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:38.754
so that everyone here understands — (Laughter) —

00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:42.199
but nonetheless, here is the device.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.269
So now what I can do is, rather than getting the instructions

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.875
for the device online, I can simply point at it,

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:52.447
the device is recognized, and then --

00:02:52.447 --> 00:02:55.559
Voice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable.

00:02:55.559 --> 00:03:01.030
Then connect the power. Finally, the yellow ethernet cable.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.386
Congratulations. You have now completed setup.

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:06.552
(Laughter) MM: Awesome. Thank you.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:09.662
(Applause)

00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:12.640
The incredible work that made that possible was done

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.478
here in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge,

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:17.263
and they work in our offices,

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.791
and I've got a lovely picture of them here.

00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.550
They couldn't all be on stage, but we're going to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.248
bring their aura to the stage, so here they are.

00:03:27.955 --> 00:03:29.879
They're not very animated. (Laughter)

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.147
This was the fourth take, I'm told. (Laughter)

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.612
Okay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge,

00:03:37.612 --> 00:03:39.973
let's now move on to technical advancements,

00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:42.140
because since we started putting this technology

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.255
on mobile phones less than 12 months ago,

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:48.309
the speed and the processing in these devices

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:50.709
has grown at a really phenomenal rate,

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.963
and that means that I can now take cinema-quality

00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:56.173
3D models and place them in the world around me,

00:03:56.173 --> 00:03:58.357
so I have one over here.

00:03:58.357 --> 00:04:02.042
Tamara, would you like to jump in?

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:06.594
(Music)

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:11.601
(Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter)

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:13.778
MM: I should leap in.

00:04:13.778 --> 00:04:17.555
(Music) (Dinosaur roaring)

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:22.704
(Applause)

00:04:22.704 --> 00:04:25.144
So then, after the fun, comes the more emotional side

00:04:25.144 --> 00:04:27.600
of what we do, because effectively, this technology

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.992
allows you to see the world through someone's eyes,

00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:32.905
and for that person to be able to take a moment in time

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:36.038
and effectively store it and tag it to something physical

00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:38.015
that exists in the real world.

00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:40.536
What's great about this is, the tools to do this are free.

00:04:40.536 --> 00:04:43.664
They're open, they're available to everyone within our application,

00:04:43.664 --> 00:04:47.346
and educators have really got on board with the classrooms.

00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:49.720
So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.760
teachers who've tagged up school classrooms,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.933
and a great example of this is a school in the U.K.

00:04:53.933 --> 00:04:56.941
I have a picture here from a video, and we're now going to play it.

00:04:58.372 --> 00:05:06.112
Teacher: See what happens. (Children talking) Keep going.

00:05:06.112 --> 00:05:10.025
Child: TV. (Children react)

00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:11.405
Child: Oh my God.

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:13.959
Teacher: Now move it either side. See what happens.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:17.371
Move away from it and come back to it.

00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:20.516
Child: Oh, that is so cool.

00:05:20.516 --> 00:05:23.403
Teacher: And then, have you got it again?

00:05:23.403 --> 00:05:27.811
Child: Oh my God! How did you do that?

00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:30.543
Second child: It's magic.

00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:34.116
(Laughter) MM: (Laughs) So, it's not magic.

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:35.883
It's available for everyone to do,

00:05:35.883 --> 00:05:37.768
and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do

00:05:37.768 --> 00:05:39.057
by doing one right now.

00:05:39.057 --> 00:05:41.813
So, as sort of — I'm told it's called a stadium wave,

00:05:41.813 --> 00:05:43.130
so we're going to start from this side of the room

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.080
on the count of three, and go over to here.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.463
Tamara, are you recording?

00:05:46.463 --> 00:05:48.347
Okay, so are you all ready?

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:50.546
One, two, three. Go!

00:05:50.546 --> 00:05:54.171
Audience: Whooooooo!

00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:57.605
MM: Fellows are really good at that. (Laughs) (Laughter)

00:05:57.605 --> 00:05:59.302
Okay. Now we're going to switch back

00:05:59.302 --> 00:06:01.123
into the Aurasma application,

00:06:01.123 --> 00:06:04.508
and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just

00:06:04.508 --> 00:06:10.547
took onto my badge, so that I can remember it forever.

00:06:10.547 --> 00:06:13.852
Now, we have lots of people who are doing this already,

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:16.110
and we've talked a little bit about the educational side.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.260
On the emotional side, we have people who've

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.332
done things like send postcards and Christmas cards

00:06:21.332 --> 00:06:24.558
back to their family with little messages on them.

00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:26.787
We have people who have, for example,

00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:28.844
taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car

00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:31.309
and tagged up different components within an engine,

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:33.588
so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more,

00:06:33.588 --> 00:06:36.149
you can point and discover the information.

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:39.219
We're all very, very familiar with the Internet.

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.069
In the last 20 years, it's really

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.963
changed the way that we live and work,

00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:46.995
and the way that we see the world, and what's great is,

00:06:46.995 --> 00:06:49.309
we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift,

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:52.716
because now we can literally take the content

00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:55.912
that we share, we discover, and that we enjoy

00:06:55.912 --> 00:06:58.284
and make it a part of the world around us.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.110
It's completely free to download this application.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.844
If you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G,

00:07:02.844 --> 00:07:04.109
this process is very, very quick.

00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:06.022
Oh, there we are. We can save it now.

00:07:06.022 --> 00:07:08.258
It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing

00:07:08.258 --> 00:07:10.379
to convert that image that we just took

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.283
into a sort of digital fingerprint,

00:07:12.283 --> 00:07:14.316
and the great thing is, if you're a professional user,

00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:16.996
-- so, a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:19.490
to what we've just used to create this demonstration.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.202
The only difference is that you've got the ability

00:07:21.202 --> 00:07:23.879
to add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready?

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:24.931
Tamara Roukaerts: We're ready to go.

00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:27.137
MM: Okay. So, I'm told we're ready, which means

00:07:27.137 --> 00:07:29.556
we can now point at the image, and there you all are.

00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:35.951
MM on video: One, two, three. Go!

00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:38.300
MM: Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.934
(Applause)
