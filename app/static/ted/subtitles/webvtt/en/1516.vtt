00:00:00.502 --> 00:00:05.787
Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.

00:00:05.787 --> 00:00:07.930
where we are looking to find

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.470
alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.278
That's what we're after.

00:00:14.278 --> 00:00:16.458
And we do this because we actually believe

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:19.732
that silicon technology today is mostly about

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:21.484
a culture of excess.

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:23.657
It's about the fastest and the most efficient

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:26.087
and the most dazzling gadget you can have,

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:28.985
while about two-thirds of the world

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:32.669
can hardly reach the most basic of this technology

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.252
to even address fundamental needs in life,

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:38.420
including health care, education

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.499
and all these kinds of very fundamental issues.

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:45.744
So before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:49.767
a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:51.954
So this man, his name is Sathi Shri.

00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:54.060
He is an outstanding person,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.202
because he's a small entrepreneur.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:57.944
He runs a little shop

00:00:57.944 --> 00:00:59.947
in one of the back streets of Mumbai.

00:00:59.947 --> 00:01:02.995
He has this little 10-square-meter store,

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.145
where so much is being done.

00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:07.050
It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.533
when I once just happened to bump into him.

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.658
Basically, what he does is, he has all these services

00:01:11.658 --> 00:01:14.411
for micro-payments and booking tickets

00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:17.744
and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for,

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.933
but he does it for people offline

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.930
and connects to the digital world.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.435
More importantly, he makes his money

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.028
by selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know,

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:28.303
for the prepaid subscriptions.

00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:31.544
But then, in the backside, he's got this little nook

00:01:31.544 --> 00:01:34.117
with a few of his employees

00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:36.701
where they can fix almost anything.

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:39.959
Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.077
And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there,

00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:45.246
and he was like, "Yeah, do you want an upgrade?"

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:47.564
"Yes." (Laughter)

00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:49.504
I was a bit skeptical, but then, I decided

00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:54.137
to give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)

00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:59.352
But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:04.304
and know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.

00:02:04.304 --> 00:02:06.895
They have figured out everything that's required

00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.921
to dismantle, take things apart,

00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:11.880
rewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.847
do whatever you want to with the phone,

00:02:13.847 --> 00:02:16.416
and they can fix anything so quickly.

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:18.416
You can hand over a phone this morning

00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:20.336
and you can go pick it up after lunch,

00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:22.256
and it was quite incredible.

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:23.827
But then we were wondering whether this is

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:26.369
a local phenomenon, or is truly global?

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:28.619
And, over time, we started understanding

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.338
and systematically researching

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:32.454
what this tinkering ecosystem is about,

00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:34.059
because that is something that's happening

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.091
not just in one street corner in Mumbai.

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:39.205
It's actually happening in all parts of the country.

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:41.466
It's even happening in Africa, like, for example,

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.513
in Cape Town we did extensive research on this.

00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:46.708
Even here in Doha I found this little nook

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.595
where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,

00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:52.796
and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.

00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:54.909
You've got to try it on your own to believe it.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.463
But what fuels this?

00:02:56.463 --> 00:02:59.971
It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:03.277
and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,

00:03:03.277 --> 00:03:07.043
and then redistributed to basically service this industry,

00:03:07.043 --> 00:03:09.214
and you can even buy salvaged parts.

00:03:09.214 --> 00:03:11.370
Basically, you don't have to necessarily buy

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.833
brand new things. You have condemned computers

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.140
that are stripped apart,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.710
and you can buy salvaged components

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.531
and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.

00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.012
But what does this new, sort of, approach give us?

00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:25.932
That's the real question, because this is something

00:03:25.932 --> 00:03:28.157
that's been there, part of every society

00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:30.523
that's deprived of enough resources.

00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:32.420
But there's an interesting paradigm.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.912
There's the traditional crafts,

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:35.915
and then there's the technology crafts.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.123
We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.

00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:40.195
They're not something that's been established.

00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:42.862
It's not something that's institutionalized.

00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:44.633
It's not taught in universities.

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:46.356
It's taught [by] word of mouth,

00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:48.265
and it's an informal education system around this.

00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:51.067
So we said, "What can we get out of this?

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:53.801
You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?"

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:56.146
The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,

00:03:56.146 --> 00:03:58.486
which is fantastic because it means that your product

00:03:58.486 --> 00:04:00.531
or your service doesn't have to go through

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:03.139
a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.218
It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,

00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:08.250
so it means that you can do a lot more with it.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.564
And then, the most important thing is,

00:04:10.564 --> 00:04:12.940
it gives us large math for low cost.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.269
So it means that you can actually embed

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.794
pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds

00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:22.452
of extendable ideas into really simple devices.

00:04:22.452 --> 00:04:27.260
So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.206
It's basically what was the system or the paradigm

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:32.670
before the industrial revolution is now re-happening

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.678
in a whole new way in small digital shops

00:04:35.678 --> 00:04:38.759
across the planet in most developing countries.

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.893
So, we kind of toyed around with this idea,

00:04:42.893 --> 00:04:44.571
and we said, "What can we do with this?

00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:47.099
Can we make a little product or a service out of it?"

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.519
So one of the first things we did is this thing called

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.915
a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.

00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:54.666
Basically one of the contexts that we studied was

00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:58.153
schools in very remote parts of India.

00:04:58.153 --> 00:05:01.412
So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,

00:05:01.412 --> 00:05:04.114
which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker

00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:06.591
who teaches this amazing little social setting.

00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:08.128
It's an informal school,

00:05:08.128 --> 00:05:10.287
but it's really about holistic education.

00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:11.525
The only thing that they don't have

00:05:11.525 --> 00:05:13.919
is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.746
sometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.

00:05:16.746 --> 00:05:20.250
So we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.062
to do more?" How to access the digital world?

00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:25.624
Instead of being the sole guardian of information,

00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:28.028
be a facilitator to all this information.

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:31.412
So we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?"

00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:34.067
How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.599
and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.591
that can be constructed locally and serviced locally?"

00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:41.934
So we walked around.

00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:44.224
We went and scavenged the nearby markets,

00:05:44.224 --> 00:05:48.245
and we tried to understand, "What can we pick up that will make this happen?"

00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:50.772
So the thing that we got

00:05:50.772 --> 00:05:53.979
was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.316
that comes for about 60 dollars.

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:58.772
We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,

00:05:58.772 --> 00:06:00.562
and a bunch of small speakers.

00:06:00.562 --> 00:06:02.860
So essentially, the mobile phone gives us

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.784
a connected multimedia platform.

00:06:04.784 --> 00:06:08.269
It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:10.620
of different formats and play them.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.646
The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,

00:06:13.646 --> 00:06:16.637
and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,

00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:18.853
and the lunch box is a nice little package

00:06:18.853 --> 00:06:20.900
in which you can put everything inside,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.463
and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of

00:06:22.463 --> 00:06:23.881
amplify the sound large enough.

00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:27.420
Believe me, those little classrooms are really noisy.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.013
They are kids who scream at the top of their voices,

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:31.673
and you really have to get above that.

00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:34.394
And we took it back to this little tinkering setup

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.484
of a mobile phone repair shop,

00:06:36.484 --> 00:06:37.912
and then the magic happens.

00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:39.293
We dismantle the whole thing,

00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:41.650
we reassemble it in a new configuration,

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.828
and we do this hardware mashup,

00:06:43.828 --> 00:06:46.437
systematically training the guy how to do this.

00:06:46.437 --> 00:06:49.892
Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:56.718
(Applause)

00:06:56.718 --> 00:06:59.736
And we systematically field tested,

00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:02.104
because in the field testing we learned some

00:07:02.104 --> 00:07:04.621
important lessons, and we went through many iterations.

00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:07.316
One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:11.294
Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.

00:07:11.294 --> 00:07:13.846
Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough

00:07:13.846 --> 00:07:16.974
darkness in the classroom to do these things.

00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:19.816
We extended this idea. We tested it many times over,

00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:22.394
and the next version we came up with was a box

00:07:22.394 --> 00:07:24.774
that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,

00:07:24.774 --> 00:07:27.573
but most importantly connect to a car battery,

00:07:27.573 --> 00:07:30.567
because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:32.774
in places where there's not enough electricity

00:07:32.774 --> 00:07:34.734
or erratic electricity.

00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:36.703
And the other key thing that we did was

00:07:36.703 --> 00:07:39.165
make this box run off a USB key, because we realized

00:07:39.165 --> 00:07:42.519
that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:45.094
at least, in theory, it was much more efficient

00:07:45.094 --> 00:07:48.984
to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.

00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:50.824
It might take a few days to get there,

00:07:50.824 --> 00:07:53.198
but at least it gets there in high definition

00:07:53.198 --> 00:07:55.413
and in a reliable quality.

00:07:55.413 --> 00:07:57.695
So we made this box, and we tested it again

00:07:57.695 --> 00:07:59.230
and again and again, and we're going through

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.779
multiple iterations to do these things.

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:03.748
But it's not limited to just education.

00:08:03.748 --> 00:08:05.614
This kind of a technique or metrology

00:08:05.614 --> 00:08:07.626
can actually be applied to other kinds of areas,

00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:09.534
and I'm going to tell you one more little story.

00:08:09.534 --> 00:08:11.989
It's about this little device called a medi-meter.

00:08:11.989 --> 00:08:15.356
It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.

00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:18.683
In India, there is a context of these amazing people,

00:08:18.683 --> 00:08:20.962
the health care workers called ASHA workers.

00:08:20.962 --> 00:08:23.379
They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:25.763
who live in the local community and are trained

00:08:25.763 --> 00:08:28.331
with basic tools and basic concepts of health care,

00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:32.093
and the main purpose is basically to inform people

00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:35.626
to basically, how to lead a better life, but also

00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:38.854
to divert or sort of make recommendations

00:08:38.854 --> 00:08:41.528
of what kind of health care should they approach?

00:08:41.528 --> 00:08:44.240
They are basically referral services, essentially.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.548
But the problem with that is that we realized

00:08:46.548 --> 00:08:50.738
after a bunch of research that they are amazing

00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:53.218
at referring people to the nearest clinic

00:08:53.218 --> 00:08:56.091
or the public health care system, but what happens at the

00:08:56.091 --> 00:09:00.169
public health care system is this: these incredibly long lines

00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.979
and too many people who overload the system

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:05.545
simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.747
for the population that's being referred.

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.866
So everything from a common cold

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:12.526
to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same

00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:15.570
level of attention, and there's no priorities.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.641
So we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way

00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:19.442
of doing this for sure."

00:09:19.442 --> 00:09:22.019
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:25.950
that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.465
but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral

00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:31.946
system that allows load balancing of the network,

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.885
and directs patients to different sources of health care

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:39.765
based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?"

00:09:39.765 --> 00:09:41.746
So the real key question was,

00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:43.414
how do we empower this woman?

00:09:43.414 --> 00:09:45.341
How do we empower her with simple tools

00:09:45.341 --> 00:09:48.292
that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature

00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:52.072
so she at least knows how to advise the patients better?

00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:54.100
And that'll make such a huge difference on the system,

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.018
because the amount of waiting time and the amount of

00:09:59.018 --> 00:10:00.938
distances that people need to travel, often sometimes

00:10:00.938 --> 00:10:03.611
seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,

00:10:03.611 --> 00:10:09.074
to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental

00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:11.528
in the sense that it really dissuades people

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.537
from getting access to health care.

00:10:13.537 --> 00:10:15.572
So if there was something that she could do,

00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:16.681
that would be amazing.

00:10:16.681 --> 00:10:19.742
So what we did was that we converted this device

00:10:19.742 --> 00:10:21.559
into a medical device.

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:22.835
I want to demo this actually,

00:10:22.835 --> 00:10:25.508
because it's a very simple process.

00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:27.917
Bruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:34.119
Come along. (Applause)

00:10:34.119 --> 00:10:37.044
So, what we're going to do is that

00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:40.016
we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,

00:10:40.016 --> 00:10:42.871
including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen

00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:44.744
that's there in your blood.

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:48.035
So you're going to put your thumb on top of this.

00:10:48.035 --> 00:10:49.809
Bruno Giussani: Like this, works?

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:51.475
Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.

00:10:51.475 --> 00:10:55.483
VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.

00:10:55.483 --> 00:10:59.833
(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:01.845
So ... (Laughter)

00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:06.236
So I take it into the start position, and then

00:11:06.236 --> 00:11:09.848
I press the read button. (Beeps)

00:11:09.848 --> 00:11:15.329
So it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps)

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:18.107
And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.

00:11:18.107 --> 00:11:21.382
Let's see what happens here.

00:11:21.382 --> 00:11:23.465
(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:27.301
BG: Great. Good news. (Applause)

00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:29.646
VV: So ... (Applause)

00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:32.863
So the thing about this is that

00:11:32.863 --> 00:11:36.968
if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,

00:11:36.968 --> 00:11:38.814
we would have to rush you to a hospital.

00:11:38.814 --> 00:11:42.934
Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange

00:11:42.934 --> 00:11:45.763
or the amber, it basically meant you had to have,

00:11:45.763 --> 00:11:48.807
sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.

00:11:48.807 --> 00:11:51.158
So that was a very simple three-step screening process

00:11:51.158 --> 00:11:53.273
that could basically change the equation

00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:56.013
of how public health care works in so many different ways.

00:11:56.013 --> 00:11:57.910
BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.303
(Applause)

00:12:02.303 --> 00:12:05.743
So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,

00:12:05.743 --> 00:12:08.033
because that's the more interesting part.

00:12:08.033 --> 00:12:10.727
So essentially, the three things that are required

00:12:10.727 --> 00:12:15.255
to make this conversion from this guy to this guy

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:19.384
is a cheap remote control for a television

00:12:19.384 --> 00:12:22.295
that you can almost find in every home today,

00:12:22.295 --> 00:12:26.009
some parts from a computer mouse, basically,

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:29.872
something that you can scavenge for very low cost,

00:12:29.872 --> 00:12:32.783
and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.

00:12:32.783 --> 00:12:35.184
Basically this is a micro-controller with a few

00:12:35.184 --> 00:12:37.979
extra components that can be shipped for very little cost

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:40.972
across the world, and that's what is all required

00:12:40.972 --> 00:12:43.363
with a little bit of local tinkering talent

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:46.150
to convert the device into something else.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.546
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests

00:12:49.546 --> 00:12:52.596
to basically ascertain whether something like this actually

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:54.163
makes sense to the ASHA worker.

00:12:54.163 --> 00:12:57.707
We are going through some reference tests to compare it

00:12:57.707 --> 00:13:01.165
against professional equipment to see if there's a degree

00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:03.487
of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact

00:13:03.487 --> 00:13:06.095
in people's lives. But most importantly,

00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:07.890
what we are trying to do right now

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.144
is we are trying to scale this up, because there

00:13:10.144 --> 00:13:12.831
are over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground

00:13:12.831 --> 00:13:15.568
who are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can

00:13:15.568 --> 00:13:19.128
give at least a fraction of them the access to these things,

00:13:19.128 --> 00:13:22.086
it just changes the way the economics of public health care

00:13:22.086 --> 00:13:25.097
works, and it changes the way systems actually function,

00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:29.363
not just on a systematic planning level,

00:13:29.363 --> 00:13:32.548
but also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level.

00:13:32.548 --> 00:13:35.349
So that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:38.507
Thank you. (Applause)

00:13:38.507 --> 00:13:47.153
(Applause)
