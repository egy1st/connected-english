00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:08.535
Hi. This is my mobile phone.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:15.978
A mobile phone can change your life,

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:24.810
and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.178
With a mobile phone,

00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:31.962
you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria.

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:33.914
With a mobile phone,

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:36.202
you can tweet a message

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:42.045
and start a protest in Egypt.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.522
And with a mobile phone,

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:47.443
you can record a song, load it up to

00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:49.924
SoundCloud and become famous.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:54.494
All this is possible with your mobile phone.

00:00:54.494 --> 00:00:56.543
I'm a child of 1984,

00:00:56.543 --> 00:00:59.904
and I live in the city of Berlin.

00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:05.584
Let's go back to that time, to this city.

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:06.823
Here you can see

00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:09.007
how hundreds of thousands of people

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:13.246
stood up and protested for change.

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:16.432
This is autumn 1989,

00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:21.055
and imagine that all those people standing up

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:23.864
and protesting for change had a

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:27.024
mobile phone in their pocket.

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:28.751
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?

00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:29.886
Hold it up.

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:33.015
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up!

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:35.741
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:42.134
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:46.686
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone,

00:01:46.686 --> 00:01:50.203
and how it changed my life.

00:01:50.203 --> 00:01:53.783
And I will talk about this.

00:01:53.783 --> 00:01:58.886
These are 35,830 lines of information.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:01.649
Raw data.

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.275
And why are these informations there?

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:09.256
Because in the summer of 2006,

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:12.743
the E.U. Commission tabled a directive.

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:17.408
This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive.

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:21.767
This directive says that each phone company in Europe,

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:26.264
each Internet service company all over Europe,

00:02:26.264 --> 00:02:31.543
has to store a wide range of information about the users.

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:34.704
Who calls whom? Who sends whom an email?

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:36.848
Who sends whom a text message?

00:02:36.848 --> 00:02:41.183
And if you use your mobile phone, where you are.

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:45.635
All this information is stored for at least six months,

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:48.919
up to two years by your phone company

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:54.991
or your Internet service provider.

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:58.651
And all over Europe, people stood up and said,

00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:01.158
"We don't want this."

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:04.556
They said, we don't want this data retention.

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:08.093
We want self-determination in the digital age,

00:03:08.093 --> 00:03:11.092
and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies

00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:14.541
have to store all this information about us.

00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:17.224
They were lawyers, journalists, priests,

00:03:17.224 --> 00:03:20.380
they all said: "We don't want this."

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.447
And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people

00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:26.103
went out on the streets of Berlin and said,

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:29.310
"Freedom, not fear."

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.759
And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:39.796
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany.

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:44.277
And I also ask myself, does it really work?

00:03:44.277 --> 00:03:47.709
Can they really store all this information about us?

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.339
Every time I use my mobile phone?

00:03:51.354 --> 00:03:55.110
So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.875
which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany,

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:00.271
and I asked them, please,

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:04.627
send me all the information you have stored about me.

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:06.801
And I asked them once, and I asked them again,

00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:09.977
and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers.

00:04:09.977 --> 00:04:13.089
But then I said, I want to have this information,

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:17.841
because this is my life you are protocoling.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.833
So I decided to start a lawsuit against them,

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:24.793
because I wanted to have this information.

00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:26.793
But Deutsche Telekom said, no,

00:04:26.793 --> 00:04:29.545
we will not give you this information.

00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:33.762
So at the end, I had a settlement with them.

00:04:33.762 --> 00:04:35.121
I'll put down the lawsuit

00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:38.329
and they will send me all the information I ask for.

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:39.546
Because in the mean time,

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:41.783
the German Constitutional Court ruled

00:04:41.783 --> 00:04:45.600
that the implementation of this E.U. directive

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.019
into German law was unconstitutional.

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:52.137
So I got this ugly brown envelope

00:04:52.137 --> 00:04:54.705
with a C.D. inside.

00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:57.785
And on the C.D., this was on.

00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:03.146
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information.

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:05.561
At first I saw it, and I said, okay,

00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:08.964
it's a huge file. Okay.

00:05:08.964 --> 00:05:11.481
But then after a while I realized,

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:13.769
this is my life.

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:15.553
This is six months of my life,

00:05:15.553 --> 00:05:19.851
into this file.

00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:24.101
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it?

00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:27.280
Because you can see where I am,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.488
where I sleep at night,

00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:34.192
what I am doing.

00:05:34.192 --> 00:05:38.785
But then I said, I want to go out with this information.

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:40.561
I want to make them public.

00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:44.975
Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean.

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:50.239
So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this.

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:54.367
This is a visualization of six months of my life.

00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:56.255
You can zoom in and zoom out,

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.704
you can wind back and fast forward.

00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:02.122
You can see every step I take.

00:06:02.122 --> 00:06:04.447
And you can even see

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.496
how I go from Frankfurt by train

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:11.728
to Cologne, and how often I call in between.

00:06:11.728 --> 00:06:16.461
All this is possible with this information.

00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:21.916
That's a little bit scary.

00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:27.416
But it is not only about me.

00:06:27.416 --> 00:06:29.816
It's about all of us.

00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:34.540
First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.211
and we talk to each other a couple of times.

00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:39.673
And then there are some friends calling me,

00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:41.601
and they call each other.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.720
And after a while you are calling you,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.984
and you are calling you, and you have this great

00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:48.408
communication network.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:52.889
But you can see how your people are communicating with each other,

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.192
what times they call each other, when they go to bed.

00:06:56.192 --> 00:06:58.346
You can see all of this.

00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:02.361
You can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group.

00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:05.841
If you have access to this information,

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:09.688
you can see what your society is doing.

00:07:09.688 --> 00:07:12.313
If you have access to this information,

00:07:12.313 --> 00:07:16.730
you can control your society.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.706
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.

00:07:21.706 --> 00:07:25.874
This is a blueprint how to survey your society,

00:07:25.874 --> 00:07:28.490
because you know who talks to whom,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.371
who sends whom an email, all this is possible

00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:34.069
if you have access to this information.

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:37.106
And this information is stored for at least six months

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:42.093
in Europe, up to two years.

00:07:42.093 --> 00:07:43.708
Like I said at the beginning,

00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:47.141
imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin

00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:49.589
in autumn of 1989

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:52.612
had a mobile phone in their pocket.

00:07:52.612 --> 00:07:56.581
And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest,

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:58.268
and if the Stasi would have known

00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:01.762
who are the leaders behind it,

00:08:01.762 --> 00:08:04.983
this may never have happened.

00:08:04.983 --> 00:08:08.014
The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there.

00:08:08.014 --> 00:08:11.630
And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.238
Because today, state agencies and companies

00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:20.527
want to store as much information as they can get about us,

00:08:20.527 --> 00:08:22.407
online and offline.

00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:26.614
They want to have the possibility to track our lives,

00:08:26.614 --> 00:08:30.462
and they want to store them for all time.

00:08:30.462 --> 00:08:34.905
But self-determination and living in the digital age

00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:37.602
is no contradiction.

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:42.761
But you have to fight for your self-determination today.

00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:46.788
You have to fight for it every day.

00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:49.550
So, when you go home,

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.206
tell your friends

00:08:51.206 --> 00:08:55.517
that privacy is a value of the 21st century,

00:08:55.517 --> 00:08:58.037
and it's not outdated.

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:02.103
When you go home, tell your representative

00:09:02.103 --> 00:09:06.582
only because companies and state agencies have the possibility

00:09:06.582 --> 00:09:11.998
to store certain information, they don't have to do it.

00:09:11.998 --> 00:09:14.343
And if you don't believe me,

00:09:14.343 --> 00:09:21.966
ask your phone company what information they store about you.

00:09:21.966 --> 00:09:28.826
So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone,

00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:31.898
let it be a reminder to you

00:09:31.898 --> 00:09:35.665
that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.

00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:36.890
Thank you.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.038
(Applause)
