00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.919
As an architect, I often ask myself,

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.759
what is the origin of the forms that we design?

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.664
What kind of forms could we design

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:11.487
if we wouldn't work with references anymore?

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:14.872
If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions,

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:17.079
what kind of forms could we design

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.679
if we could free ourselves from

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.815
our experience?

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:25.549
If we could free ourselves from our education?

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:28.576
What would these unseen forms look like?

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:32.287
Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?

00:00:32.287 --> 00:00:34.702
Would they delight us?

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:38.623
If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?

00:00:38.623 --> 00:00:41.015
I propose we look to nature.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:45.279
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:48.867
And I'm not saying that we should copy nature,

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:51.247
I'm not saying we should mimic biology,

00:00:51.247 --> 00:00:54.695
instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:59.149
We can abstract them and to create something that is new.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.027
Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis,

00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:06.856
is the splitting of one cell into two cells.

00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:08.913
And these cells can either be identical,

00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:11.088
or they can be distinct from each other

00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:13.152
through asymmetric cell division.

00:01:13.152 --> 00:01:16.951
If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible,

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.184
then we could start with a single sheet of paper,

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:21.680
one surface, and we could make a fold

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.616
and divide the surface into two surfaces.

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:26.879
We're free to choose where we make the fold.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:31.789
And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.683
Through this very simple process,

00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:37.295
we can create an astounding variety of forms.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:40.020
Now, we can take this form and use the same process

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.012
to generate three-dimensional structures,

00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:44.420
but rather than folding things by hand,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.005
we'll bring the structure into the computer,

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:49.980
and code it as an algorithm.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.988
And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:55.147
We can fold a million times faster,

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:58.308
we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.

00:01:58.308 --> 00:02:00.788
And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional,

00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:04.004
we start not with a single surface, but with a volume.

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:05.357
A simple volume, the cube.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.077
If we take its surfaces and fold them

00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:09.133
again and again and again and again,

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:11.996
then after 16 iterations, 16 steps,

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:15.845
we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks,

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:18.380
for instance, like this.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.092
And if we change where we make the folds,

00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:22.733
if we change the folding ratio,

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:26.156
then this cube turns into this one.

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:30.295
We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape,

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:32.122
or this shape.

00:02:32.122 --> 00:02:33.745
So we exert control over the form

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:37.249
by specifying the position of where we're making the fold,

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.955
but essentially you're looking at a folded cube.

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:43.019
And we can play with this.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.635
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:48.380
of the form to create local conditions.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.323
We can begin to sculpt the form.

00:02:50.323 --> 00:02:53.211
And because we're doing the folding on the computer,

00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:56.907
we are completely free of any physical constraints.

00:02:56.907 --> 00:02:59.858
So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves,

00:02:59.858 --> 00:03:01.347
they can become impossibly small.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:04.948
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.

00:03:04.948 --> 00:03:06.826
Surfaces can become porous.

00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:09.555
They can stretch. They can tear.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:14.190
And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.940
But in each case, I didn't design the form.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.541
I designed the process that generated the form.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:26.029
In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio,

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.624
which is what you're seeing here,

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:31.397
then the form changes correspondingly.

00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:33.653
But that's only half of the story --

00:03:33.653 --> 00:03:37.976
99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this,

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:42.872
but this, the geometric equivalent of noise.

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:44.992
The forms that I showed before were made actually

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.640
through very long trial and error.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.856
A far more effective way to create forms, I have found,

00:03:49.856 --> 00:03:53.744
is to use information that is already contained in forms.

00:03:53.744 --> 00:03:56.399
A very simple form such as this one actually contains

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.991
a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.

00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:02.472
So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.

00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:05.808
White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:09.385
We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature,

00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:13.472
how radial they are -- all information that may not be

00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:15.419
instantly visible to you,

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.844
but that we can bring out, that we can articulate,

00:04:17.844 --> 00:04:21.220
and that we can use to control the folding.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.179
So now I'm not specifying a single

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.355
ratio anymore to fold it,

00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:27.907
but instead I'm establishing a rule,

00:04:27.907 --> 00:04:30.343
I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface

00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:33.316
and how that surface is folded.

00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:36.267
And because I've designed the process and not the form,

00:04:36.267 --> 00:04:38.589
I can run the process again and again and again

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:41.124
to produce a whole family of forms.

00:04:53.385 --> 00:04:57.828
These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.

00:04:57.828 --> 00:04:58.957
There is a simple input,

00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:00.909
it's always a cube that I start with,

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.485
and it's a very simple operation -- it's making a fold,

00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:08.437
and doing this over and over again.

00:05:08.437 --> 00:05:10.717
So let's bring this process to architecture.

00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:12.317
How? And at what scale?

00:05:12.317 --> 00:05:14.045
I chose to design a column.

00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:17.421
Columns are architectural archetypes.

00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:20.488
They've been used throughout history to express ideals

00:05:20.488 --> 00:05:25.563
about beauty, about technology.

00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:27.485
A challenge to me was how we could express

00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:30.781
this new algorithmic order in a column.

00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:33.765
I started using four cylinders.

00:05:33.765 --> 00:05:37.541
Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders

00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:40.676
eventually evolved into this.

00:05:40.676 --> 00:05:45.292
And these columns, they have information at very many scales.

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:47.810
We can begin to zoom into them.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.365
The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.

00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:55.037
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.

00:05:55.037 --> 00:05:56.989
And unlike traditional architecture,

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.773
it's a single process that creates both the overall form

00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:05.118
and the microscopic surface detail.

00:06:05.118 --> 00:06:07.809
These forms are undrawable.

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:11.185
An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper

00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:12.977
would probably take months,

00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:15.361
or it would take even a year to draw all the sections,

00:06:15.361 --> 00:06:17.665
all of the elevations, you can only create something like this

00:06:17.665 --> 00:06:19.801
through an algorithm.

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:21.833
The more interesting question, perhaps, is,

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:24.462
are these forms imaginable?

00:06:24.462 --> 00:06:27.097
Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state

00:06:27.097 --> 00:06:28.961
of what he is designing.

00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:31.786
In this case, the process is deterministic.

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:34.145
There's no randomness involved at all,

00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:36.152
but it's not entirely predictable.

00:06:36.152 --> 00:06:37.728
There's too many surfaces,

00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:41.338
there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.

00:06:41.338 --> 00:06:44.552
So this leads to a new role for the architect.

00:06:44.552 --> 00:06:48.163
One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities

00:06:48.163 --> 00:06:49.939
that are out there.

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:53.171
For one thing, one can design many variants of a form,

00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:55.385
in parallel, and one can cultivate them.

00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:57.633
And to go back to the analogy with nature,

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:00.129
one can begin to think in terms of populations,

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.657
one can talk about permutations, about generations,

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:08.520
about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.905
And the architect is really, he moves into the position

00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:14.337
of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.

00:07:14.337 --> 00:07:16.681
But enough of the theory.

00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:19.208
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside

00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:23.037
this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue

00:07:23.037 --> 00:07:25.973
3D glasses, got up very close to the screen,

00:07:25.973 --> 00:07:28.045
but still that wasn't the same as being able to

00:07:28.045 --> 00:07:30.397
walk around and touch things.

00:07:30.397 --> 00:07:32.300
So there was only one possibility --

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.397
to bring the column out of the computer.

00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:38.317
There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.

00:07:38.317 --> 00:07:41.276
For me, or for my purpose at this moment,

00:07:41.276 --> 00:07:44.358
there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff

00:07:44.358 --> 00:07:51.141
between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.

00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:53.398
So instead, we decided to take the column,

00:07:53.398 --> 00:07:55.837
and we decided to build it as a layered model,

00:07:55.837 --> 00:07:59.965
made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.

00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:01.862
What you're looking at here is an X-ray

00:08:01.862 --> 00:08:04.637
of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.

00:08:04.637 --> 00:08:06.637
Unbeknownst to me at the time,

00:08:06.637 --> 00:08:09.013
because we had only seen the outside,

00:08:09.013 --> 00:08:11.173
the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves,

00:08:11.173 --> 00:08:13.437
to grow on the inside of the column,

00:08:13.437 --> 00:08:15.983
which was quite a surprising discovery.

00:08:15.983 --> 00:08:19.597
From this shape, we calculated a cutting line,

00:08:19.597 --> 00:08:22.621
and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter

00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:26.435
to produce -- and you're seeing a segment of it here --

00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:31.326
very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.293
And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering,

00:08:36.293 --> 00:08:38.093
and the column that we ended up with

00:08:38.093 --> 00:08:41.140
after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.850
that we had designed in the computer.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.971
Almost all of the details, almost all of the

00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:50.011
surface intricacies were preserved.

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:54.972
But it was very labor intensive.

00:08:54.972 --> 00:08:57.373
There's a huge disconnect at the moment still

00:08:57.373 --> 00:09:00.133
between the virtual and the physical.

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:02.259
It took me several months to design the column,

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:04.977
but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:07.825
to calculate all of the 16 million faces.

00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:09.786
The physical model, on the other hand,

00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:13.994
is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick,

00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:18.141
it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.279
this entire auditorium.

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.367
And the cutting path that the laser followed

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:27.484
goes from here to the airport and back again.

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.233
But it is increasingly possible.

00:09:29.233 --> 00:09:31.844
Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive,

00:09:31.844 --> 00:09:34.604
and there's some promising technological developments

00:09:34.604 --> 00:09:36.387
just on the horizon.

00:09:36.387 --> 00:09:39.459
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale.

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:42.983
And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns,

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:44.837
we used the bigger, faster machine,

00:09:44.837 --> 00:09:47.894
and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural,

00:09:47.894 --> 00:09:50.870
they can bear loads for once.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.885
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.

00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:56.294
You can see a different column in the mirror,

00:09:56.294 --> 00:09:58.344
if there's a mirror behind the column

00:09:58.344 --> 00:10:01.416
that creates a sort of an optical illusion.

00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:03.262
So where does this leave us?

00:10:03.262 --> 00:10:07.730
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.613
if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object,

00:10:11.613 --> 00:10:15.006
but a process to generate objects.

00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:18.279
I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature;

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:21.127
there's countless other ones.

00:10:21.127 --> 00:10:24.574
In short, we have no constraints.

00:10:24.574 --> 00:10:28.144
Instead, we have processes in our hands right now

00:10:28.144 --> 00:10:32.725
that allow us to create structures at all scales

00:10:32.725 --> 00:10:35.757
that we couldn't even have dreamt up.

00:10:35.757 --> 00:10:40.576
And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.

00:10:40.576 --> 00:10:47.199
Thank you. (Applause)
