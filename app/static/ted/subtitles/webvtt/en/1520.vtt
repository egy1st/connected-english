WEBVTT

00:00:00.902 --> 00:00:06.856
Doc Edgerton inspired us
with awe and curiosity

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.118
with this photo of a bullet
piercing through an apple,

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:15.994
and exposure just a millionth of a second.

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:24.550
But now, 50 years later,
we can go a million times faster

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:29.336
and see the world
not at a million or a billion,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.413
but one trillion frames per second.

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:37.529
I present to you
a new type of photography,

00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:39.588
femto-photography,

00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:44.188
a new imaging technique so fast

00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:48.484
that it can create slow motion
videos of light in motion.

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:54.272
And with that, we can create cameras
that can look around corners,

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:56.269
beyond line of sight,

00:00:56.293 --> 00:01:01.149
or see inside our body without an x-ray,

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:04.980
and really challenge
what we mean by a camera.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.574
Now if I take a laser pointer
and turn it on and off

00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:12.401
in one trillionth of a second --

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:15.212
which is several femtoseconds --

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:19.233
I'll create a packet of photons
barely a millimeter wide.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.769
And that packet of photons, that bullet,

00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:24.719
will travel at the speed of light,

00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:28.701
and again, a million times faster
than an ordinary bullet.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:34.133
Now, if you take that bullet
and take this packet of photons

00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:37.489
and fire into this bottle,

00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:41.084
how will those photons
shatter into this bottle?

00:01:41.864 --> 00:01:44.452
How does light look in slow motion?

00:01:44.552 --> 00:01:47.552
[Light in Slow Motion ...
10 Billion x Slow]

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:07.588
Now, the whole event --

00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:14.599
(Applause)

00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:18.124
Now remember, the whole event
is effectively taking place

00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:19.811
in less than a nanosecond --

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.236
that's how much time
it takes for light to travel.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.907
But I'm slowing down in this video
by a factor of 10 billion,

00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:29.479
so you can see the light in motion.

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:30.573
(Laughter)

00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:32.884
But Coca-Cola did not
sponsor this research.

00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:35.010
(Laughter)

00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:37.057
Now, there's a lot going on in this movie,

00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.701
so let me break this down
and show you what's going on.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.659
So the pulse enters
the bottle, our bullet,

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:45.221
with a packet of photons
that start traveling through

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:47.058
and that start scattering inside.

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.289
Some of the light leaks,
goes on the table,

00:02:49.313 --> 00:02:51.925
and you start seeing
these ripples of waves.

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.957
Many of the photons
eventually reach the cap

00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:57.871
and then they explode
in various directions.

00:02:57.895 --> 00:02:59.783
As you can see, there's a bubble of air

00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:01.449
and it's bouncing around inside.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.923
Meanwhile, the ripples
are traveling on the table,

00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:05.947
and because of the reflections at the top,

00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:09.718
you see at the back of the bottle,
after several frames,

00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:11.441
the reflections are focused.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.599
Now, if you take an ordinary bullet

00:03:18.623 --> 00:03:21.623
and let it go the same distance
and slow down the video --

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:23.868
again, by a factor of 10 billion --

00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:28.285
do you know how long you'll have to sit
here to watch that movie?

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:29.897
(Laughter)

00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:33.430
A day, a week? Actually, a whole year.

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.566
It'll be a very boring movie --

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.981
(Laughter)

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:41.377
of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.057
And what about some
still-life photography?

00:03:53.112 --> 00:03:58.098
You can watch the ripples,
again, washing over the table,

00:03:58.122 --> 00:04:00.780
the tomato and the wall in the back.

00:04:00.804 --> 00:04:03.594
It's like throwing a stone
in a pond of water.

00:04:07.403 --> 00:04:11.063
I thought: this is how
nature paints a photo,

00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:13.650
one femto frame at a time,

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:17.931
but of course our eye sees
an integral composite.

00:04:19.923 --> 00:04:22.057
But if you look at this tomato
one more time,

00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:24.826
you will notice, as the light
washes over the tomato,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.514
it continues to glow.

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:28.565
It doesn't become dark. Why is that?

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:30.887
Because the tomato is actually ripe,

00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.300
and the light is bouncing
around inside the tomato,

00:04:33.324 --> 00:04:36.744
and it comes out after several
trillionths of a second.

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:42.053
So in the future, when this femto-camera
is in your camera phone,

00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:44.031
you might be able to go to a supermarket

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:47.110
and check if the fruit is ripe
without actually touching it.

00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:48.820
(Laughter)

00:04:48.844 --> 00:04:52.533
So how did my team at MIT
create this camera?

00:04:53.906 --> 00:04:55.850
Now, as photographers, you know,

00:04:55.874 --> 00:04:59.835
if you take a short exposure photo,
you get very little light.

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:03.367
But we're going to go a billion times
faster than your shortest exposure,

00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:05.320
so you're going to get hardly any light.

00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:07.257
So what we do is we send that bullet --

00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:09.777
that packet of photons --
millions of times,

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:12.884
and record again and again
with very clever synchronization,

00:05:12.908 --> 00:05:14.847
and from the gigabytes of data,

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:17.091
we computationally weave together

00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:20.014
to create those femto-videos I showed you.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:25.346
And we can take all that raw data
and treat it in very interesting ways.

00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:27.832
So, Superman can fly.

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:30.114
Some other heroes can become invisible.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.392
But what about a new power
for a future superhero:

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:37.277
To see around corners.

00:05:38.094 --> 00:05:42.563
The idea is that we could
shine some light on the door,

00:05:42.587 --> 00:05:45.238
it's going to bounce, go inside the room,

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.668
some of that is going to reflect
back on the door,

00:05:47.692 --> 00:05:49.175
and then back to the camera.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.196
And we could exploit
these multiple bounces of light.

00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:55.354
And it's not science fiction.
We have actually built it.

00:05:55.378 --> 00:05:57.444
On the left, you see our femto-camera.

00:05:57.468 --> 00:05:59.823
There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,

00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:02.352
and we're going to bounce
light off the door.

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:06.242
So after our paper was published
in Nature Communications,

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:08.408
it was highlighted by Nature.com,

00:06:08.432 --> 00:06:10.908
and they created this animation.

00:06:10.932 --> 00:06:12.216
(Music)

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.104
[A laser pulse is fired]

00:06:15.128 --> 00:06:18.000
(Music)

00:06:18.024 --> 00:06:20.891
Ramesh Raskar: We're going to fire
those bullets of light,

00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:24.291
and they're going to hit this wall,

00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:26.946
and because of the packet of the photons,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.080
they will scatter in all the directions,

00:06:29.104 --> 00:06:31.445
and some of them will reach
our hidden mannequin,

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.851
which in turn will again
scatter that light,

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:39.446
and again in turn, the door will reflect
some of that scattered light.

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:44.179
And a tiny fraction of the photons
will actually come back to the camera,

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:45.354
but most interestingly,

00:06:45.378 --> 00:06:48.461
they will all arrive
at a slightly different time slot.

00:06:48.926 --> 00:06:53.759
(Music)

00:06:53.783 --> 00:06:56.296
And because we have a camera
that can run so fast --

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.402
our femto-camera --
it has some unique abilities.

00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:02.244
It has very good time resolution,

00:07:02.268 --> 00:07:05.163
and it can look at the world
at the speed of light.

00:07:06.114 --> 00:07:09.371
And this way, we know the distances,
of course to the door,

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.172
but also to the hidden objects,

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:14.353
but we don't know which point
corresponds to which distance.

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:18.422
(Music)

00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:21.876
By shining one laser,
we can record one raw photo,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.924
which, if you look on the screen,
doesn't really make any sense.

00:07:24.948 --> 00:07:27.068
But then we will take
a lot of such pictures,

00:07:27.092 --> 00:07:29.252
dozens of such pictures,
put them together,

00:07:29.276 --> 00:07:31.734
and try to analyze
the multiple bounces of light,

00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:35.209
and from that, can we see
the hidden object?

00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:37.367
Can we see it in full 3D?

00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:40.042
So this is our reconstruction.

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:45.196
(Music)

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:52.196
(Applause)

00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:54.260
Now, we have some ways to go

00:07:54.284 --> 00:07:57.419
before we take this
outside the lab on the road,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:01.172
but in the future, we could create
cars that avoid collisions

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:02.677
with what's around the bend.

00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:07.668
Or we can look for survivors
in hazardous conditions

00:08:07.692 --> 00:08:10.916
by looking at light reflected
through open windows.

00:08:11.604 --> 00:08:17.475
Or we can build endoscopes that can see
deep inside the body around occluders,

00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:19.199
and also for cardioscopes.

00:08:19.223 --> 00:08:21.589
But of course,
because of tissue and blood,

00:08:21.613 --> 00:08:22.868
this is quite challenging,

00:08:22.892 --> 00:08:24.827
so this is really a call for scientists

00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:27.158
to start thinking about femto-photography

00:08:27.182 --> 00:08:29.063
as really a new imaging modality

00:08:29.087 --> 00:08:32.607
to solve the next generation
of health-imaging problems.

00:08:33.082 --> 00:08:36.939
Now, like Doc Edgerton,
a scientist himself,

00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:39.266
science became art --

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.952
an art of ultra-fast photography.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.031
And I realized

00:08:44.055 --> 00:08:47.496
that all the gigabytes of data
that we're collecting every time,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.941
are not just for scientific imaging.

00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:55.504
But we can also do a new form
of computational photography,

00:08:55.528 --> 00:08:58.060
with time-lapse and color coding.

00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:00.616
And we look at those ripples.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.798
Remember:

00:09:01.822 --> 00:09:07.295
The time between each of those ripples
is only a few trillionths of a second.

00:09:08.602 --> 00:09:10.809
But there's also something
funny going on here.

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:13.629
When you look at the ripples
under the cap,

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.836
the ripples are moving away from us.

00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:18.765
The ripples should be moving towards us.

00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:20.161
What's going on here?

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:26.975
It turns out, because we're recording
nearly at the speed of light,

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.888
we have strange effects,

00:09:28.912 --> 00:09:32.173
and Einstein would have loved
to see this picture.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:33.236
(Laughter)

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.307
The order at which events
take place in the world

00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:39.657
appears in the camera
sometimes in reversed order.

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:44.241
So by applying the corresponding
space and time warp,

00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:46.632
we can correct for this distortion.

00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:52.955
So whether it's for photography
around corners,

00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:56.975
or creating the next generation
of health imaging,

00:09:56.999 --> 00:09:59.891
or creating new visualizations,

00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:01.539
since our invention,

00:10:01.563 --> 00:10:06.688
we have open-sourced all the data
and details on our website,

00:10:06.712 --> 00:10:13.665
and our hope is that the DIY,
the creative and the research communities

00:10:13.689 --> 00:10:19.194
will show us that we should stop obsessing
about the megapixels in cameras --

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:20.497
(Laughter)

00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:24.909
and start focusing
on the next dimension in imaging.

00:10:25.607 --> 00:10:26.917
It's about time.

00:10:27.337 --> 00:10:28.489
Thank you.

00:10:28.513 --> 00:10:35.383
(Applause)
