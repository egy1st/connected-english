00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:04.623
I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.

00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:07.127
And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you

00:00:07.127 --> 00:00:09.047
suffer from it as well.

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:11.144
When I'm walking around an art gallery,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.247
rooms and rooms full of paintings,

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:17.764
after about 15 or 20 minutes,

00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:19.655
I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:21.263
I'm not connecting to them.

00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:23.767
Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:26.767
I desperately need to wake me up.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.951
I'm suffering from gallery fatigue.

00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:32.327
How many of you out there suffer from --

00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:34.332
yes. Ha ha, ha ha!

00:00:34.332 --> 00:00:36.482
Now, sometimes you might last longer

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:38.576
than 20 minutes, or even shorter,

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:40.790
but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.871
the accompanying guilt?

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:45.858
For me, I look at the paintings on the wall

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:48.873
and I think, somebody has decided to put them there,

00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:51.401
thinks they're good enough to be on that wall,

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:52.759
but I don't always see it.

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:55.423
In fact, most of the time I don't see it.

00:00:55.423 --> 00:00:59.197
And I leave feeling actually unhappy.

00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:02.664
I feel guilty and unhappy with myself,

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:04.727
rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting,

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:06.184
I think there's something wrong with me.

00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:09.092
And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.

00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:10.363
(Laughter)

00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:12.672
The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.132
If you think about going into a restaurant,

00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:18.819
when you look at the menu, are you expected to order

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.002
every single thing on the menu?

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:22.884
No! You select.

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:26.059
If you go into a department store to buy a shirt,

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:29.036
are you going to try on every single shirt

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:30.364
and want every single shirt?

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:34.491
Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected.

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:37.112
How come, then, it's not so expected

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:39.685
to be selective when we go to an art gallery?

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.980
Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.684
Well I'm trying to take a different approach.

00:01:45.684 --> 00:01:47.302
And there's two things I do:

00:01:47.302 --> 00:01:51.796
When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast,

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:56.031
and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones

00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:59.085
that make me slow down for some reason or other.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.886
I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:03.943
pulls me like a magnet

00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:07.061
and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:09.525
So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:12.821
I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50.

00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:16.511
And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting,

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:19.588
and I tell myself a story about it.

00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:23.186
Why a story? Well, I think that we are wired,

00:02:23.186 --> 00:02:27.077
our DNA tells us to tell stories.

00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:29.446
We tell stories all the time about everything,

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:34.557
and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place,

00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:38.508
and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit,

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:40.677
trying to bring some order to it.

00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:44.668
Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?

00:02:44.668 --> 00:02:48.383
So I now have this sort of restaurant menu

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:51.606
visiting of art galleries.

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:54.814
There are three paintings I'm going to show you now

00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:57.878
that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks

00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:00.424
and want to tell stories about them.

00:03:00.424 --> 00:03:03.975
The first one needs little introduction --

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:07.006
"Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer,

00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.162
17th-century Dutch painter.

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:11.662
This is the most glorious painting.

00:03:11.662 --> 00:03:13.806
I first saw it when I was 19,

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:16.086
and I immediately went out and got a poster of it,

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:20.243
and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.

00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:23.393
It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone,

00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:25.737
I never tire of looking at her.

00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:29.516
What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:32.073
was just the gorgeous colors he uses

00:03:32.073 --> 00:03:34.017
and the light falling on her face.

00:03:34.017 --> 00:03:36.801
But I think what's kept me still coming back

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:39.857
year after year is another thing, and that is

00:03:39.857 --> 00:03:43.551
the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.

00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:45.969
I can't tell if she's happy or sad,

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.936
and I change my mind all the time.

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:52.535
So that keeps me coming back.

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:56.544
One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall,

00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:59.226
I lay in bed and looked at her,

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:01.805
and I suddenly thought, I wonder what

00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:05.723
the painter did to her to make her look like that.

00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:08.667
And it was the first time I'd ever thought that

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.467
the expression on her face is actually reflecting

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.606
how she feels about him.

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:16.762
Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.

00:04:16.762 --> 00:04:21.531
Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.

00:04:21.531 --> 00:04:24.363
And I thought, well, what is that relationship?

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:27.571
So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered,

00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:29.896
we have no idea who she is.

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:32.243
In fact, we don't know who any of the models

00:04:32.243 --> 00:04:34.603
in any of Vermeer's paintings are,

00:04:34.603 --> 00:04:36.730
and we know very little about Vermeer himself.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.504
Which made me go, "Yippee!"

00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:44.163
I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.

00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:46.759
So here's how I came up with the story.

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.636
First of all, I thought,

00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:50.728
I've got to get her into the house.

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.216
How does Vermeer know her?

00:04:53.216 --> 00:04:54.760
Well, there've been suggestions that

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.183
she is his 12-year-old daughter.

00:04:59.183 --> 00:05:01.408
The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.

00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:04.104
And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look,

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:06.288
but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.

00:05:06.288 --> 00:05:08.128
For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time,

00:05:08.128 --> 00:05:11.720
if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.608
It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer

00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:15.504
to paint his daughter like that.

00:05:15.504 --> 00:05:17.384
So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:19.634
close to him, physically close to him.

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:21.898
Well, who else would be in the house?

00:05:21.898 --> 00:05:25.281
A servant, a lovely servant.

00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:26.842
So, she's in the house.

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:29.503
How do we get her into the studio?

00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:31.637
We don't know very much about Vermeer,

00:05:31.637 --> 00:05:33.776
but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know

00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:36.767
is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:39.040
in a house where he had his own room

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.323
where he -- his studio. He also had 11 children.

00:05:43.323 --> 00:05:46.400
It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.344
And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before,

00:05:49.344 --> 00:05:53.208
you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.

00:05:53.208 --> 00:05:57.104
How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?

00:05:57.104 --> 00:05:59.400
Well, he compartmentalizes his life.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.080
He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.808
Not the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."

00:06:07.808 --> 00:06:14.859
She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together.

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:16.939
And he decides to paint her.

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.207
He has her wear very plain clothes.

00:06:19.207 --> 00:06:22.578
Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings

00:06:22.578 --> 00:06:28.544
wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.

00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:31.064
This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain

00:06:31.064 --> 00:06:33.104
is her pearl earring.

00:06:33.104 --> 00:06:36.551
Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford

00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:38.758
a pair of pearl earrings.

00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:42.020
So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.061
We happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.

00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.677
Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur,

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:52.424
a yellow and black bodice,

00:06:52.424 --> 00:06:56.118
and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings,

00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:59.232
different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.

00:06:59.232 --> 00:07:03.710
So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.229
It's not such a leap of faith to take

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.813
that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.

00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:12.990
So we've got all the elements for our story.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.420
She's in the studio with him for a long time.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.463
These paintings took a long time to make.

00:07:17.463 --> 00:07:20.334
They would have spent the time alone, all that time.

00:07:20.334 --> 00:07:22.334
She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.

00:07:22.334 --> 00:07:25.149
She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted.

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:27.941
And does the wife know? Maybe not.

00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:31.319
And if she doesn't, well --

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:33.174
that's the story.

00:07:33.174 --> 00:07:35.351
(Laughter)

00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:37.941
The next painting I'm going to talk about

00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:41.188
is called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.

00:07:41.188 --> 00:07:45.564
He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes,

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.157
but he did occasionally paint people.

00:07:48.157 --> 00:07:52.124
And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting,

00:07:52.124 --> 00:07:56.084
different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.

00:07:56.084 --> 00:07:59.548
I like this version the best, because some of the boys

00:07:59.548 --> 00:08:02.941
are older and some are younger, and to me, this one,

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.893
like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.

00:08:05.893 --> 00:08:09.884
He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.

00:08:09.884 --> 00:08:14.677
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience,

00:08:14.677 --> 00:08:19.160
and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.877
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.500
The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.724
in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting,

00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:30.736
and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it,

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:31.943
I was standing there going,

00:08:31.943 --> 00:08:34.896
"Look at me. Please look at me."

00:08:34.896 --> 00:08:37.632
And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards,

00:08:37.632 --> 00:08:40.384
and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is,

00:08:40.384 --> 00:08:44.874
he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.

00:08:44.874 --> 00:08:48.767
And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece,

00:08:48.767 --> 00:08:52.744
of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.

00:08:52.744 --> 00:08:54.265
He's never going to look at me.

00:08:54.265 --> 00:08:55.944
So I was thinking of a story where,

00:08:55.944 --> 00:08:59.160
if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.362
Not the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.

00:09:01.362 --> 00:09:03.888
I'm thinking of an older version of himself.

00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:09.833
He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant,

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:12.304
saying, "Look at me. I want to warn you about

00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:14.754
what you're about to go through. Please look at me."

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:16.280
And he never does.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.083
And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" --

00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:22.127
we don't know if she's happy or sad.

00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:23.776
I've written an entire novel about her,

00:09:23.776 --> 00:09:25.776
and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:27.880
Again and again, back to the painting,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.561
looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.

00:09:32.561 --> 00:09:36.008
And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily,

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:41.823
but not really, and we come back again and again.

00:09:41.823 --> 00:09:44.361
The last painting I'm going to talk about

00:09:44.361 --> 00:09:49.225
is called "Anonymous" by anonymous. (Laughter)

00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:52.276
This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.

00:09:52.276 --> 00:09:54.889
They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury,

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:57.553
and then they discovered that it wasn't him,

00:09:57.553 --> 00:09:59.153
and they have no idea who it is.

00:09:59.153 --> 00:10:01.296
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery,

00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:03.065
if you don't know the biography of the painting,

00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:04.689
it's kind of useless to you.

00:10:04.689 --> 00:10:07.113
They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.

00:10:07.113 --> 00:10:12.017
So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage,

00:10:12.017 --> 00:10:14.161
along with quite a number of other orphans,

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:16.672
some of them some beautiful paintings.

00:10:16.672 --> 00:10:21.675
This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons:

00:10:21.675 --> 00:10:24.552
One is the disconnection between his mouth

00:10:24.552 --> 00:10:27.257
that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.

00:10:27.257 --> 00:10:30.264
He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?

00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:33.981
The second thing that really attracted me

00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:35.697
were his bright red cheeks.

00:10:35.697 --> 00:10:39.304
He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:42.338
This must be a guy who blushes all the time.

00:10:42.338 --> 00:10:44.480
What is he thinking about that's making him blush?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.256
The third thing that made me stop in my tracks

00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:51.056
is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.

00:10:51.056 --> 00:10:54.624
Silk, gray, those beautiful buttons.

00:10:54.624 --> 00:10:56.256
And you know what it makes me think of,

00:10:56.256 --> 00:11:01.048
is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.

00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:03.704
I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks,

00:11:03.704 --> 00:11:06.464
and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him,

00:11:06.464 --> 00:11:09.072
and I thought, is that what he's thinking about?

00:11:09.072 --> 00:11:11.344
And I thought, if I'm going to make a story,

00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:13.328
what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?

00:11:13.328 --> 00:11:16.958
Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.888
And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.

00:11:18.888 --> 00:11:23.032
He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.

00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:26.681
Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?

00:11:26.681 --> 00:11:30.561
You put all those together, and you've got your story

00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:33.915
to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.

00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:38.636
Now, here's the story.

00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:41.566
It's short.

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:44.297
"Rosy"

00:11:44.297 --> 00:11:48.347
I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.

00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:52.658
It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves

00:11:52.658 --> 00:11:55.834
and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread,

00:11:55.834 --> 00:11:58.760
set close together so that the fit is snug.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.323
The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.

00:12:02.323 --> 00:12:06.073
Perhaps that was the intention.

00:12:06.073 --> 00:12:10.991
I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.

00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:12.817
I knew even before I stood up to speak

00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:15.386
that my cheeks were inflamed.

00:12:15.386 --> 00:12:19.087
I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion,

00:12:19.087 --> 00:12:21.442
from wine, from high emotion.

00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:25.907
As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys,

00:12:25.907 --> 00:12:28.354
but not by George.

00:12:28.354 --> 00:12:31.428
Only George could call me Rosy.

00:12:31.428 --> 00:12:33.587
I would not allow anyone else.

00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:37.811
He managed to make the word tender.

00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:40.610
When I made the announcement, George did not

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.674
turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.

00:12:43.674 --> 00:12:45.578
He should not have been surprised.

00:12:45.578 --> 00:12:47.250
It has been a common assumption

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.098
that I would one day marry his cousin.

00:12:51.098 --> 00:12:53.682
But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.

00:12:53.682 --> 00:12:56.983
I know, I could barely utter them.

00:12:56.983 --> 00:13:01.385
Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.

00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:06.642
Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.

00:13:06.642 --> 00:13:10.867
We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.

00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:13.129
"What do you think of my doublet?" I asked.

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:18.573
He glanced at me. "That collar looks to be strangling you."

00:13:18.573 --> 00:13:20.577
"We will still see each other," I insisted.

00:13:20.577 --> 00:13:23.865
"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.

00:13:23.865 --> 00:13:25.601
Nothing need change."

00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:29.318
George did not speak.

00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:32.712
"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:36.817
and produce an heir. It is expected of me."

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:40.398
George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.

00:13:40.398 --> 00:13:44.481
"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.

00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:49.317
I'm sure you'll be content together."

00:13:49.317 --> 00:13:52.634
He never used my nickname again.

00:13:52.634 --> 00:13:54.393
Thank you.

00:13:54.393 --> 00:13:57.775
(Applause)

00:13:57.775 --> 00:13:58.957
Thank you.

00:13:58.957 --> 00:14:00.504
(Applause)
