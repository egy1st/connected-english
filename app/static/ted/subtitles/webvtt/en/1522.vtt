00:00:01.552 --> 00:00:04.266
This man is wearing what we call

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.036
a bee beard. (Laughter)

00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:08.485
A beard full of bees.

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:11.728
Now, this is what many of you might picture

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:14.701
when you think about honeybees, maybe insects,

00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.789
or maybe anything that has more legs than two.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.447
And let me start by telling you, I gotcha.

00:00:20.447 --> 00:00:24.928
I understand that. But, there are many things to know,

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:27.608
and I want you to open your minds here,

00:00:27.608 --> 00:00:31.098
keep them open, and change your perspective about honeybees.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:34.063
Notice that this man is not getting stung.

00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:37.507
He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin,

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:39.626
and the other bees are attracted to it.

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:43.662
So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees,

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:47.430
and that goes deep back for thousands of years.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.592
We're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:53.552
for pollination and, even more recently,

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.376
as an economic commodity.

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:58.176
Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing,

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:00.753
not just dying, but they're gone.

00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:02.555
We don't even find dead bodies.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:04.926
This is called colony collapse disorder,

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:07.138
and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe

00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:09.584
still do not know what's causing it,

00:01:09.584 --> 00:01:12.154
but what we do know is that, with the declining numbers

00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:16.391
of bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:21.398
that we rely on for food is going up in price.

00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:25.156
So honeybees are important for their role in the economy

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:27.181
as well as in agriculture.

00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:29.000
Here you can see some pictures of what are called

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.689
green roofs, or urban agriculture.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.967
We're familiar with the image on the left that shows

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:36.751
a local neighborhood garden in the South End.

00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.542
That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard.

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:41.961
And perhaps a green roof in the future,

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:43.892
when we're further utilizing urban areas,

00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:47.350
where there are stacks of garden spaces.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.703
Check out this image above the orange line in Boston.

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:54.180
Try to spot the beehive. It's there.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.877
It's on the rooftop, right on the corner there,

00:01:56.877 --> 00:01:59.270
and it's been there for a couple of years now.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.522
The way that urban beekeeping currently operates

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.113
is that the beehives are quite hidden,

00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:07.140
and it's not because they need to be.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.117
It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea,

00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:13.791
and that's why I want you today to try to think about this,

00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.074
think about the benefits of bees in cities

00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:18.333
and why they really are a terrific thing.

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:21.303
Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works.

00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:23.886
So we know flowers, we know fruits and vegetables,

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:27.092
even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock

00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:29.555
for the meats that we eat, rely on pollinators,

00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:32.988
but you've got male and female parts to a plant here,

00:02:32.988 --> 00:02:35.878
and basically pollinators are attracted to plants

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:38.905
for their nectar, and in the process,

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:42.280
a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.712
or that male kind of sperm counterpart, along the way,

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:48.330
and then travel to different flowers, and eventually

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.449
an apple, in this case, will be produced.

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.716
You can see the orientation. The stem is down.

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:56.670
The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.528
but that's a basic overview of how pollination works.

00:02:59.528 --> 00:03:02.400
And let's think about urban living, not today,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.265
and not in the past, but what about in a hundred years?

00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:09.203
What's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges

00:03:09.203 --> 00:03:13.133
these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people,

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:16.494
billions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people,

00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:19.858
and how little space there will be to fit all of them,

00:03:19.858 --> 00:03:23.280
so we need to change the way that we see cities, and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.643
looking at this picture on the left of New York City today,

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:28.510
you can see how gray and brown it is.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.041
We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back

00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:34.077
into the atmosphere,

00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:36.412
contributing to global climate change, no doubt.

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:38.912
What about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops

00:03:38.912 --> 00:03:42.075
everywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops

00:03:42.075 --> 00:03:45.878
right in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation,

00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:49.974
we save on a healthier diet, and we also educate

00:03:49.974 --> 00:03:51.676
and create new jobs locally.

00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:56.342
We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living.

00:03:56.342 --> 00:03:59.726
Here's some data that we collected through our company

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:02.628
with Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage

00:04:02.628 --> 00:04:04.871
honeybee hives for anybody who wants them,

00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:08.388
in the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees,

00:04:08.388 --> 00:04:11.247
and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop

00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:13.728
or fire escape, for even that matter,

00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:16.502
and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is.

00:04:16.502 --> 00:04:18.634
There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed

00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:22.077
in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here,

00:04:22.077 --> 00:04:23.477
overwintering survival.

00:04:23.477 --> 00:04:26.302
Now this has been a huge problem for many years,

00:04:26.302 --> 00:04:30.362
basically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came

00:04:30.362 --> 00:04:33.738
and brought many different viruses, bacteria

00:04:33.738 --> 00:04:35.542
and fungal diseases with it.

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:37.291
Overwintering success is hard,

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.584
and that's when most of the colonies are lost,

00:04:39.584 --> 00:04:42.250
and we found that in the cities, bees are surviving

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.598
better than they are in the country.

00:04:44.598 --> 00:04:46.826
A bit counterintuitive, right?

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:48.908
We think, oh, bees, countryside, agriculture,

00:04:48.908 --> 00:04:51.135
but that's not what the bees are showing.

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:53.284
The bees like it in the city. (Laughter)

00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:56.431
Furthermore, they also produce more honey.

00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:59.000
The urban honey is delicious.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.097
The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel,

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:04.569
where we have hundreds of thousands of bees

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.072
flying overheard right now

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:08.377
that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by,

00:05:08.377 --> 00:05:10.687
are going to all of the local community gardens

00:05:10.687 --> 00:05:13.086
and making delicious, healthy honey

00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:16.114
that just tastes like the flowers in our city.

00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:20.901
So the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production,

00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:24.016
is higher as well as the overwintering survival,

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:25.390
compared to rural areas.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.392
Again, a bit counterintuitive.

00:05:27.392 --> 00:05:30.713
And looking back historically at the timeline

00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:34.989
of honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:38.037
that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:41.188
So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily

00:05:41.188 --> 00:05:43.813
something new. It has been happening

00:05:43.813 --> 00:05:45.880
since over a thousand years ago,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.577
but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities.

00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:51.605
So one thing I want to encourage you to think about

00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:54.007
is the idea of what an urban island is.

00:05:54.007 --> 00:05:57.403
You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer.

00:05:57.403 --> 00:05:58.982
Why are bees doing better in the city?

00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:01.654
This is a big question now to help us understand

00:06:01.654 --> 00:06:03.975
why they should be in the city.

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:05.997
Perhaps there's more pollen in the city.

00:06:05.997 --> 00:06:08.213
With the trains coming in to urban hubs, they can

00:06:08.213 --> 00:06:10.792
carry pollen with them, very light pollen,

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:13.129
and it's just a big supermarket in the city.

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.956
A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks.

00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:19.722
Perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities

00:06:19.722 --> 00:06:21.940
than there are in [rural] areas.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.792
Perhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet,

00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:27.399
but that's one idea to think about, urban islands.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:31.323
And colony collapse disorder is not the only thing

00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:34.225
affecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying,

00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:37.929
and it's a huge, huge grand challenge of our time.

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.401
What you can see up here is a map of the world,

00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:43.473
and we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite.

00:06:43.473 --> 00:06:46.161
Now, the varroa mite is what changed the game

00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.016
in beekeeping, and you can see, at the top right,

00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:52.279
the years are changing, we're coming up to modern times,

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.609
and you can see the spread of the varroa mite

00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:57.260
from the early 1900s through now.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.211
It's 1968, and we're pretty much covering Asia.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:04.273
1971, we saw it spread to Europe and South America,

00:07:04.273 --> 00:07:08.661
and then, when we get to the 1980s,

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:12.895
and specifically to 1987, the varroa mite finally came

00:07:12.895 --> 00:07:15.277
to North America and to the United States,

00:07:15.277 --> 00:07:17.733
and that is when the game changed

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:20.414
for honeybees in the United States.

00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:22.502
Many of us will remember our childhood growing up,

00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:24.728
maybe you got stung by a bee, you saw bees on flowers.

00:07:24.728 --> 00:07:28.666
Think of the kids today. Their childhood's a bit different.

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:30.590
They don't experience this.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.090
The bees just aren't around anymore.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.530
So we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.235
What can we do here?

00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:40.800
So, what I do is honeybee research.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.893
I got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health.

00:07:42.893 --> 00:07:46.358
I started in 2005 studying honeybees.

00:07:46.358 --> 00:07:48.700
In 2006, honeybees started disappearing,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.061
so suddenly, like, this little nerd kid

00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:53.678
going to school working with bugs — (Laughter) —

00:07:53.678 --> 00:07:55.771
became very relevant in the world.

00:07:55.771 --> 00:07:56.852
And it worked out that way.

00:07:56.852 --> 00:08:00.851
So my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier.

00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:03.642
I don't research what's killing the bees, per se.

00:08:03.642 --> 00:08:05.825
I'm not one of the many researchers around the world

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:08.896
who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases

00:08:08.896 --> 00:08:11.448
or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees.

00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:13.441
We're looking at ways to make bees healthier

00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:17.072
through vaccines, through yogurt, like probiotics,

00:08:17.072 --> 00:08:21.872
and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees,

00:08:21.872 --> 00:08:24.907
and this process is so easy, even a 7-year-old can do it.

00:08:24.907 --> 00:08:27.267
You just mix up some pollen, sugar and water,

00:08:27.267 --> 00:08:29.069
and whatever active ingredient you want to put in,

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:31.267
and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved,

00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:33.437
just immune boosters.

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:35.637
Humans think about our own health in a prospective way.

00:08:35.637 --> 00:08:38.297
We exercise, we eat healthy, we take vitamins.

00:08:38.297 --> 00:08:41.340
Why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way?

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.906
Bring them to areas where they're thriving

00:08:43.906 --> 00:08:47.342
and try to make them healthier before they get sick.

00:08:47.342 --> 00:08:51.531
I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.873
with needles. (Laughter) Like, years,

00:08:54.873 --> 00:08:57.175
years at the bench, "Oh my gosh, it's 3 a.m.

00:08:57.175 --> 00:08:58.526
and I'm still pricking bees." (Laughter)

00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:02.400
And then one day I said, "Why don't we just do an oral vaccine?"

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.048
It's like, "Ugh," so that's what we do. (Laughter)

00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:10.236
I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives,

00:09:10.236 --> 00:09:12.718
because they can be anything.

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.621
I mean, really open your mind with this.

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:16.795
You can paint a hive to match your home.

00:09:16.795 --> 00:09:20.165
You can hide a hive inside your home.

00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:21.977
These are three hives on the rooftop

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:24.088
of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel,

00:09:24.088 --> 00:09:26.548
and they're beautiful here. I mean, we matched

00:09:26.548 --> 00:09:29.229
the new color of the inside of their rooms to do

00:09:29.229 --> 00:09:32.466
some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets,

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:35.485
and these bees are terrific, and they also will use

00:09:35.485 --> 00:09:38.091
herbs that are growing in the garden.

00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:41.190
That's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking,

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.069
and the honey -- they do live events --

00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:45.207
they'll use that honey at their bars.

00:09:45.207 --> 00:09:47.827
Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar

00:09:47.827 --> 00:09:49.954
because there are different types of sugars in there.

00:09:49.954 --> 00:09:52.331
We also have a classroom hives project,

00:09:52.331 --> 00:09:54.983
where -- this is a nonprofit venture --

00:09:54.983 --> 00:09:58.100
we're spreading the word around the world for how

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.385
honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom

00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:02.691
or into the museum setting, behind glass,

00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:05.099
and used as an educational tool.

00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:06.723
This hive that you see here has been

00:10:06.723 --> 00:10:09.274
in Fenway High School for many years now.

00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:11.233
The bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park.

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.188
Nobody notices it. If you're not a flower,

00:10:13.188 --> 00:10:15.809
these bees do not care about you. (Laughter)

00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:18.180
They don't. They don't. They'll say,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.091
"S'cuse me, flying around." (Laughter)

00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:23.654
Some other images here in telling a part of the story

00:10:23.654 --> 00:10:26.292
that really made urban beekeeping terrific is

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.656
in New York City, beekeeping was illegal until 2010.

00:10:29.656 --> 00:10:32.993
That's a big problem, because what's going to pollinate

00:10:32.993 --> 00:10:36.417
all of the gardens and the produce locally? Hands?

00:10:36.417 --> 00:10:39.773
I mean, locally in Boston, there is a terrific company

00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:42.178
called Green City Growers, and they are going

00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:45.689
and pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q-Tips,

00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:48.243
and if they miss that three day window, there's no fruit.

00:10:48.243 --> 00:10:51.146
Their clients aren't happy, and people go hungry.

00:10:51.146 --> 00:10:53.014
So this is important.

00:10:53.014 --> 00:10:55.121
We have also some images of honey from Brooklyn.

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:57.073
Now, this was a mystery in the New York Times

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.921
where the honey was very red, and the

00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:00.445
New York State forensics department came in

00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:03.047
and they actually did some science to match

00:11:03.047 --> 00:11:05.567
the red dye with that found

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:08.818
in a maraschino cherry factory down the street. (Laughter)

00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:12.216
So you can tailor your honey to taste however you want

00:11:12.216 --> 00:11:14.511
by planting bee-friendly flowers.

00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:17.249
Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping.

00:11:17.249 --> 00:11:19.799
They've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:22.735
for many years now, and that's what really got people started, thinking,

00:11:22.735 --> 00:11:26.203
"Wow, we can do this, and we should do this."

00:11:26.203 --> 00:11:29.036
Also in London, and in Europe across the board,

00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:32.288
they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops

00:11:32.288 --> 00:11:34.786
and integrating beehives,

00:11:34.786 --> 00:11:37.967
and I'll show you an ending note here.

00:11:37.967 --> 00:11:40.042
I would like to encourage you to open your mind.

00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:43.203
What can you do to save the bees or to help them

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:46.994
or to think of sustainable cities in the future?

00:11:46.994 --> 00:11:48.964
Well, really, just change your perspective.

00:11:48.964 --> 00:11:50.938
Try to understand that bees are very important.

00:11:50.938 --> 00:11:53.349
A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it.

00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:56.663
The bee dies. Honeybees die when they sting,

00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:59.105
so they don't want to do it either. (Laughter)

00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:03.195
It's nothing to panic about. They're all over the city.

00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:05.297
You could even get your own hive if you want.

00:12:05.297 --> 00:12:07.025
There are great resources available,

00:12:07.025 --> 00:12:09.976
and there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you

00:12:09.981 --> 00:12:13.107
and it's important for our educational system in the world

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:15.793
for students to learn about agriculture worldwide

00:12:15.793 --> 00:12:19.628
such as this little girl, who, again, is not even getting stung.

00:12:19.628 --> 00:12:21.982
Thank you. (Applause)
