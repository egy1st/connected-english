00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:05.449
In the past several days, I heard people talking about China.

00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:09.403
And also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet.

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:11.866
Something is very challenging to me.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.927
I want to make my friends understand:

00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:18.495
China is complicated.

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:20.590
So I always want to tell the story, like,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.046
one hand it is that, the other hand is that.

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:26.832
You can't just tell a one sided story.

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:30.013
I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country.

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:35.423
BRIC country means Brazil, Russia, India and China.

00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:41.249
This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.418
But at the same time, on the other hand,

00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:47.322
China is a SICK country,

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:53.278
the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers -- file.

00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:59.560
He said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.240
The four countries have no access to Facebook.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.358
So basically, China is a SICK BRIC country.

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:09.352
(Laughter)

00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:11.247
Another project was built up

00:01:11.247 --> 00:01:14.091
to watch China and Chinese Internet.

00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:17.474
And now, today I want to tell you my personal

00:01:17.474 --> 00:01:22.706
observation in the past several years, from that wall.

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:26.267
So, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones,

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:31.250
you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.126
It prevents weird things from the north.

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.323
Same was true for China.

00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:42.883
In the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng.

00:01:42.883 --> 00:01:48.255
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years.

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:52.318
But China also has a great firewall.

00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:56.647
That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world.

00:01:56.647 --> 00:02:00.972
It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas,

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:04.676
from the universal values, but also to prevent

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:08.351
China's own citizens to access the global free Internet,

00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:13.639
and even separate themselves into blocks, not united.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.785
So, basically the "Internet" has two Internets.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:21.777
One is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet.

00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:25.569
But if you think the Chinanet is something

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.091
like a deadland, wasteland, I think it's wrong.

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:37.828
But we also use a very simple metaphor, the cat and the mouse game,

00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:40.851
to describe in the past 15 years

00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:44.251
the continuing fight between Chinese

00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:47.531
censorship, government censorship, the cat,

00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:53.683
and the Chinese Internet users. That means us, the mouse.

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:57.876
But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:03.311
So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version.

00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.073
In China, we have 500 million Internet users.

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:11.928
That's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world.

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:17.439
So even though China's is a totally censored Internet,

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.033
but still, Chinese Internet society is really booming.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.743
How to make it? It's simple.

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:26.444
You have Google, we have Baidu.

00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:29.558
You have Twitter, we have Weibo.

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.583
You have Facebook, we have Renren.

00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:37.916
You have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:42.446
The Chinese government blocked every

00:03:42.446 --> 00:03:46.157
single international Web 2.0 service,

00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:48.973
and we Chinese copycat every one.

00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:50.366
(Laughter)

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:54.981
So, that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship.

00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:58.549
That's not only to censor you.

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.148
Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple:

00:04:03.148 --> 00:04:05.535
Block and clone.

00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:10.639
On the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network,

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.919
which is very important; people really love social networking.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.744
But on the other hand, they want to keep the server

00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:21.274
in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want.

00:04:21.274 --> 00:04:25.522
That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China,

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:27.331
because they can't accept the fact

00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:32.130
that Chinese government wants to keep the server.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.558
Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands.

00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:41.311
For example, Mubarak, he shut down the Internet.

00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:44.423
He wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him.

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:50.113
But once Netizens can't go online, they go in the street.

00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:53.393
And now the result is very simple.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:59.003
We all know Mubarak is technically dead.

00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:03.515
But also, Ben Ali, Tunisian president,

00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:05.441
didn't follow the second rule.

00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:09.394
That means keep the server in your hands.

00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:15.239
He allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service,

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:18.641
to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia.

00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:22.213
So he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post

00:05:22.213 --> 00:05:24.865
critical videos against his corruption.

00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:28.914
The same thing happend. He was the first

00:05:28.914 --> 00:05:31.931
to topple during the Arab Spring.

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:37.081
But those two very smart international censorship policies

00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:43.418
didn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere,

00:05:43.418 --> 00:05:49.091
a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials.

00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:53.619
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:57.451
It's the entire population of the United States.

00:05:57.451 --> 00:06:01.315
So when these 300 million people, microbloggers,

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:06.083
even they block the tweet in our censored platform.

00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:10.070
But itself -- the Chinanet -- but itself can create

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.165
very powerful energy, which has never happened

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.819
in the Chinese history.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.515
2011, in July, two [unclear] trains crashed,

00:06:20.515 --> 00:06:22.771
in Wenzhou, a southern city.

00:06:22.771 --> 00:06:24.395
Right after the train crash,

00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:29.411
authorities literally wanted to cover up the train, bury the train.

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:31.627
So it angered the Chinese Netizens.

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:34.690
The first five days after the train crash,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.835
there were 10 million criticisms of the posting

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:42.588
on social media, which never happened in Chinese history.

00:06:42.588 --> 00:06:45.916
And later this year, the rail minister

00:06:45.916 --> 00:06:51.382
was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years.

00:06:51.382 --> 00:06:56.429
And also, recently, very funny debate between

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:59.725
the Beijing Environment Ministry

00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:03.093
and the American Embassy in Beijing

00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:05.558
because the Ministry blamed

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.703
the American Embassy for intervening in

00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:11.132
Chinese internal politics by disclosing

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:13.816
the air quality data of Beijing.

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:20.704
So, the up is the Embassy data, the PM 2.5.

00:07:20.704 --> 00:07:26.648
He showed 148, they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group.

00:07:26.648 --> 00:07:30.450
So a suggestion, it's not good to go outside.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:36.074
But that is the Ministry's data. He shows 50.

00:07:36.074 --> 00:07:39.426
He says it's good. It's good to go outside.

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:42.970
But 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.730
stand firmly on the Embassy's side.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.402
I live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch

00:07:51.402 --> 00:08:00.133
the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window.

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:04.424
Why is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship,

00:08:04.424 --> 00:08:08.668
so booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages.

00:08:08.668 --> 00:08:12.340
You know, Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.805
a limitation of 140 characters.

00:08:14.805 --> 00:08:19.004
But in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link.

00:08:19.004 --> 00:08:22.252
Maybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just "Aha!"

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.786
(Laughter)

00:08:24.786 --> 00:08:30.531
But in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters,

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:33.207
means a paragraph, a story.

00:08:33.207 --> 00:08:37.445
You can almost have all the journalistic elements there.

00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:41.132
For example, this is Hamlet, of Shakespeare.

00:08:41.132 --> 00:08:44.923
It's the same content. One, you can see exactly

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:51.436
one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets.

00:08:51.436 --> 00:08:54.693
Chinese is always cheating, right?

00:08:54.693 --> 00:08:58.606
So because of this, the Chinese really regard this

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:03.687
microblogging as a media, not only a headline to media.

00:09:03.687 --> 00:09:07.398
And also, the clone, Sina company is

00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:09.485
the guy who cloned Twitter.

00:09:09.485 --> 00:09:11.906
It even has its own name, with Weibo.

00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:14.341
"Weibo" is the Chinese translation for "microblog".

00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:16.245
It has its own innovation.

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:19.878
At the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo

00:09:19.878 --> 00:09:23.620
more like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.044
So these innovations and clones, as the Weibo and microblogging,

00:09:28.044 --> 00:09:30.364
when it came to China in 2009,

00:09:30.364 --> 00:09:34.377
it immediately became a media platform itself.

00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:38.578
It became the media platform of 300 million readers.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.479
It became the media.

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:42.904
Anything not mentioned in Weibo,

00:09:42.904 --> 00:09:48.188
it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public.

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:50.624
But also, Chinese social media is

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:55.019
really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life.

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:58.508
For example, they give the voiceless people

00:09:58.508 --> 00:10:01.261
a channel to make your voice heard.

00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:06.704
We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system,

00:10:06.704 --> 00:10:09.781
because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth:

00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:14.407
The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs.

00:10:14.407 --> 00:10:17.798
So that's why the petitioner, the victims, the peasants,

00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:21.429
want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government,

00:10:21.429 --> 00:10:24.224
they want the emperor to settle the problem.

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:27.063
But when more and more people go to Beijing,

00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:30.586
they also cause the risk of a revolution.

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:33.458
So they send them back in recent years.

00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:37.025
And even some of them were put into black jails.

00:10:37.025 --> 00:10:40.626
But now we have Weibo, so I call it the Weibo petition.

00:10:40.626 --> 00:10:43.465
People just use their cell phones to tweet.

00:10:43.465 --> 00:10:47.042
So your sad stories, by some chance your story

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:50.683
will be picked up by reporters, professors or celebrities.

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:52.596
One of them is Yao Chen,

00:10:52.596 --> 00:10:55.985
she is the most popular microblogger in China,

00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:59.844
who has about 21 million followers.

00:10:59.844 --> 00:11:03.466
They're almost like a national TV station.

00:11:03.466 --> 00:11:06.802
If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her.

00:11:06.802 --> 00:11:11.250
So this Weibo social media, even in the censorship,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.990
still gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.314
every day chatting together, talking together.

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:23.220
It's like a big TED, right?

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.068
But also, it is like the first time a public sphere

00:11:27.068 --> 00:11:28.772
happened in China.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:31.987
Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate

00:11:31.987 --> 00:11:35.172
and talk to people.

00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:38.876
But also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping.

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:43.122
It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo.

00:11:43.122 --> 00:11:46.329
For example, you can't post the name of the president,

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:51.907
Hu Jintao, and also you can't post the city of Chongqing, the name,

00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:56.641
and until recently, you can't search the surname of top leaders.

00:11:56.641 --> 00:12:00.974
So, the Chinese are very good at these puns

00:12:00.974 --> 00:12:04.646
and alternative wording and even memes.

00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:06.891
They even name themselves -- you know,

00:12:06.891 --> 00:12:09.386
use the name of this world-changing

00:12:09.386 --> 00:12:13.357
battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab.

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:15.366
The grass-mud horse is caoníma,

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:18.320
is the phonogram for motherfucker,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:24.536
the Netizens call themselves.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:27.153
River crab is héxiè, is the phonogram for

00:12:27.153 --> 00:12:30.047
harmonization, for censorship.

00:12:30.047 --> 00:12:35.167
So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:41.144
So, when some very political, exciting moments happened,

00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:46.725
you can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened.

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:51.557
Weird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD

00:12:51.557 --> 00:12:55.024
of Chinese language, you can't understand them.

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.847
But you can't even expand more, no, because

00:12:57.847 --> 00:13:00.770
Chinese Sina Weibo, when it was founded

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.906
was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com.

00:13:05.906 --> 00:13:08.002
That means from the very beginning,

00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:12.194
Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government,

00:13:12.194 --> 00:13:14.938
we will not become the stage for

00:13:14.938 --> 00:13:17.530
any kind of a threat to the regime.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.730
For example, anything you want to post,

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.625
like "get together" or "meet up" or "walk,"

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:26.818
it is automatically recorded and data mined

00:13:26.818 --> 00:13:33.346
and reported to a poll for further political analyzing.

00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:35.346
Even if you want to have some gathering,

00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:39.026
before you go there, the police are already waiting for you.

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:40.834
Why? Because they have the data.

00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:43.026
They have everything in their hands.

00:13:43.026 --> 00:13:49.250
So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.849
So the crackdown is very serious.

00:13:52.849 --> 00:13:55.390
But I want you to notice a very funny thing

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.278
during the process of the cat-and-mouse.

00:13:58.278 --> 00:14:02.503
The cat is the censorship, but Chinese is not only one cat,

00:14:02.503 --> 00:14:06.131
but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats.

00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:08.057
(Laughter)

00:14:08.057 --> 00:14:11.131
You know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands,

00:14:11.131 --> 00:14:15.753
so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government,

00:14:15.753 --> 00:14:20.391
the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing.

00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:22.279
Without bribing the central cats,

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:25.705
he can do nothing, only apologize.

00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:28.433
So these three years, in the past three years,

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:31.079
social movements about microblogging

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.440
really changed local government,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.696
became more and more transparent,

00:14:35.696 --> 00:14:38.544
because they can't access the data.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:42.157
The server is in Beijing.

00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:43.627
The story about the train crash,

00:14:43.627 --> 00:14:46.834
maybe the question is not about why 10 million

00:14:46.834 --> 00:14:51.080
criticisms in five days, but why the Chinese central government

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.304
allowed the five days of freedom of speech online.

00:14:54.304 --> 00:14:56.213
It's never happened before.

00:14:56.213 --> 00:14:59.664
And so it's very simple, because even the top leaders

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:03.185
were fed up with this guy, this independent kingdom.

00:15:03.185 --> 00:15:04.855
So they want an excuse --

00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:08.312
public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him.

00:15:08.312 --> 00:15:11.282
But also, the Bo Xilai case recently, very big news,

00:15:11.282 --> 00:15:12.613
he's a princeling.

00:15:12.613 --> 00:15:16.732
But from February to April this year,

00:15:16.732 --> 00:15:19.435
Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors.

00:15:19.435 --> 00:15:22.772
You can almost joke everything about these princelings,

00:15:22.772 --> 00:15:26.172
everything! It's almost like you're living in the United States.

00:15:26.172 --> 00:15:30.821
But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup

00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:34.764
about Beijing, you definitely will be arrested.

00:15:34.764 --> 00:15:40.687
So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window.

00:15:40.687 --> 00:15:44.556
So Chinese in China, censorship is normal.

00:15:44.556 --> 00:15:47.301
Something you find is, freedom is weird.

00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.068
Something will happen behind it.

00:15:49.068 --> 00:15:52.224
Because he was a very popular Leftist leader,

00:15:52.224 --> 00:15:54.428
so the central government wanted to purge him,

00:15:54.428 --> 00:15:58.510
and he was very cute, he convinced all the Chinese people,

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.340
why he is so bad.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.118
So Weibo, the 300 million public sphere,

00:16:04.118 --> 00:16:08.629
became a very good, convenient tool for a political fight.

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:10.786
But this technology is very new,

00:16:10.786 --> 00:16:12.452
but technically is very old.

00:16:12.452 --> 00:16:15.380
It was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.277
because he mobilized millions of Chinese people

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:22.359
in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government.

00:16:22.359 --> 00:16:25.229
It's very simple, because Chinese central government

00:16:25.229 --> 00:16:27.365
doesn't need to even lead the public opinion.

00:16:27.365 --> 00:16:31.896
They just give them a target window to not censor people.

00:16:31.896 --> 00:16:37.805
Not censoring in China has become a political tool.

00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:41.775
So that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse.

00:16:41.775 --> 00:16:43.945
Social media changed Chinese mindset.

00:16:43.945 --> 00:16:47.455
More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech

00:16:47.455 --> 00:16:49.615
and human rights as their birthright,

00:16:49.615 --> 00:16:53.237
not some imported American privilege.

00:16:53.237 --> 00:16:56.949
But also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere

00:16:56.949 --> 00:17:01.279
for people to, it's like a training of their citizenship,

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:03.850
preparing for future democracy.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.306
But it didn't change the Chinese political system,

00:17:06.306 --> 00:17:09.551
and also the Chinese central government utilized this

00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:13.487
centralized server structure to strengthen its power

00:17:13.487 --> 00:17:17.985
to counter the local government and the different factions.

00:17:17.985 --> 00:17:20.757
So, what's the future?

00:17:20.757 --> 00:17:22.941
After all, we are the mouse.

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:26.741
Whatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat].

00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:30.732
There is not only in China, but also in the United States

00:17:30.732 --> 00:17:35.561
there are some very small, cute but bad cats.

00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:37.205
(Laughter)

00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:43.943
SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU.

00:17:43.943 --> 00:17:49.298
And also, like Facebook and Google, they claim they are friends of the mouse,

00:17:49.298 --> 00:17:53.485
but sometimes we see them dating the cats.

00:17:53.485 --> 00:17:56.669
So my conclusion is very simple.

00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:59.514
We Chinese fight for our freedom,

00:17:59.514 --> 00:18:03.109
you just watch your bad cats.

00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:06.012
Don't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats.

00:18:06.012 --> 00:18:08.853
Only in this way, in the future,

00:18:08.853 --> 00:18:12.101
we will achieve the dreams of the mouse:

00:18:12.101 --> 00:18:16.077
that we can tweet anytime, anywhere, without fear.

00:18:16.077 --> 00:18:23.436
(Applause)

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.121
Thank you.

00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:29.469
(Applause)
