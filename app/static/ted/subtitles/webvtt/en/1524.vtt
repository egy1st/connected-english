00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:02.641
I worked on a film called "Apollo 13,"

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:04.521
and when I worked on this film, I discovered something

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:06.984
about how our brains work, and how our brains work

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:09.263
is that, when we're sort of infused with

00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:13.509
either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.917
it changes and alters our perception of things.

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:18.094
It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:21.602
And as an experiment, because I dauntingly create

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:25.522
a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.944
for this particular movie, because I put it out there,

00:00:28.944 --> 00:00:31.001
I felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.609
and bring a group of people like this in a projection room

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.289
and play this stock footage, and when I played this

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.090
stock footage, I simply wanted to find out

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.505
what people remembered, what was memorable about it?

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:45.508
What should I actually try to replicate?

00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:49.279
What should I try to emulate to some degree?

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:52.368
So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:55.050
And what I discovered is, because of the nature

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.248
of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film,

00:00:57.248 --> 00:00:59.201
there was an emotion that was built into it

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:02.279
and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:03.953
and all these various things.

00:01:03.953 --> 00:01:05.985
When I showed it, and I asked, immediately after

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:08.776
the screening was over, what they thought of it,

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:11.242
what was your memorable shots, they changed them.

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.620
They were -- had camera moves on them.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.296
They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,

00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:19.278
and I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:20.645
were you looking at just a few minutes ago

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:24.489
and how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description?

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:28.337
And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually

00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:32.027
replicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.

00:01:32.027 --> 00:01:36.009
So this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.717
taking notes, asking people what they thought, and then

00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:41.159
the combination of all the different shots and all

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.087
the different things put together created their sort of

00:01:43.087 --> 00:01:45.126
collective consciousness of what they remembered

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:46.776
it looked like, but not what it really looked like.

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:49.774
So this is what we created for "Apollo 13."

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:54.241
(Launch noises)

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.007
So literally what you're seeing now is the confluence

00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:59.068
of a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:02.366
including my own, of taking a little bit of liberty

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.090
with the subject matter.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.727
I basically shot everything with short lenses,

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.644
which means that you're very close to the action,

00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:10.934
but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:13.574
which gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically

00:02:13.574 --> 00:02:15.558
was setting up something that would remind you

00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:19.030
of something you haven't really quite seen before. (Music)

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.561
And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.162
that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.

00:02:25.162 --> 00:02:38.057
(Music)

00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:40.187
Tom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:42.978
It's good to see you again. (Cheers) (Music)

00:02:42.978 --> 00:02:45.418
Rob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.

00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:47.576
(Laughter)

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:50.981
So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can,

00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:52.806
and I'm basically recreating the launch with

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:57.145
fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw

00:02:57.145 --> 00:03:00.490
in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.307
if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,

00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:06.488
what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to,

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.923
is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:10.317
really kind of fascinating.

00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:13.293
And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie,

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.502
and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:20.072
take a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:22.075
And that's simply what I did.

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:24.552
That's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator,

00:03:24.552 --> 00:03:28.091
so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of,

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.923
you know, following the rocket all the way down,

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:32.602
and giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:36.102
trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing.

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:38.699
We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut,

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.704
who was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15,

00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:45.223
and he was there to basically double check my science.

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:48.744
And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.

00:03:48.744 --> 00:03:50.476
(Laughter)

00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:53.064
I don't know why, but they thought they did.

00:03:53.064 --> 00:03:57.206
So we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and

00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:00.012
we're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:02.483
the liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did

00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:04.892
didn't really suck that bad.

00:04:04.892 --> 00:04:08.152
And so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little

00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:10.609
good about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.146
to really check and see what we were doing,

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:16.132
and basically give us our A plus report card,

00:04:16.132 --> 00:04:18.097
and so I showed him some shots we were working on,

00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:21.207
and waiting for the reaction that you hope for,

00:04:21.207 --> 00:04:24.296
which is what I got. (Music) (Launch noises)

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:26.335
So I showed him these two shots,

00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:29.752
and then he basically told me what he thought.

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:32.289
("That's wrong") (Laughter)

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.248
Okay. (Laughter)

00:04:35.248 --> 00:04:37.172
It's what you dream about.

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:40.172
(Laughter)

00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:43.679
So what I got from him is, he turned to me and said,

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.133
"You would never, ever design a rocket like that.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:48.382
You would never have a rocket go up

00:04:48.382 --> 00:04:50.443
while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine

00:04:50.443 --> 00:04:52.498
the tragedy that could possibly happen with that?

00:04:52.498 --> 00:04:55.340
You would never, ever design a rocket like that."

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.487
And he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't know

00:04:57.487 --> 00:04:59.497
if you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lot

00:04:59.497 --> 00:05:01.425
recreating one of America's finest moments with

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:03.084
fire extinguishers.

00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:05.443
(Laughter)

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:08.371
And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut,

00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.648
a hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so --

00:05:10.648 --> 00:05:12.347
(Laughter)

00:05:12.347 --> 00:05:14.384
I'm just going to show you some footage.

00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:16.994
I'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think.

00:05:16.994 --> 00:05:19.417
And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.

00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:21.456
So I showed him this, and this is actual footage

00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:25.001
that he was on. This is Apollo 15. This was his mission.

00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:30.277
So I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting.

00:05:30.277 --> 00:05:33.061
("That's wrong too.") (Laughter)

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:36.295
So, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned

00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:38.777
in that is that he remembered it differently.

00:05:38.777 --> 00:05:41.121
He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry

00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:43.824
system, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sitting

00:05:43.824 --> 00:05:46.047
in a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand pounds

00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:48.321
of thrust, built by the lowest bidder.

00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:50.576
He was hoping it was going to work out okay.

00:05:50.576 --> 00:05:53.345
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:55.489
So he twisted his memory around.

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:58.563
Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not

00:05:58.563 --> 00:06:00.878
on the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking

00:06:00.878 --> 00:06:03.104
any of this footage, and he just responded

00:06:03.104 --> 00:06:05.934
as he would respond, and I'll run this.

00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:08.368
Ron Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:12.806
and said, "Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:17.804
I'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you find

00:06:17.804 --> 00:06:20.265
that stuff in?" And I said, "Well, no vault, Buzz,

00:06:20.265 --> 00:06:23.683
we generated all that from scratch."

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:27.587
And he said, "Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:31.043
(Explosion) ("Sure") (Laughter)

00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:32.970
RL: I think he's a great American.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.751
(Laughter)

00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:40.054
So, "Titanic" was, if you don't know the story,

00:06:40.054 --> 00:06:41.794
doesn't end well.

00:06:41.794 --> 00:06:44.575
(Laughter)

00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:47.726
Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.

00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:50.007
So he basically set up, or basically shattered

00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:52.410
the suspension of disbelief, because what he photographed

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.837
was the real thing, a Mir sub going down, or actually

00:06:55.837 --> 00:06:58.180
two Mir subs going down to the real wreck,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.217
and he created this very haunting footage.

00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:03.090
It's really beautiful, and it conjures up all these

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.284
various different emotions, but he couldn't photograph

00:07:05.284 --> 00:07:08.013
everything, and to tell the story,

00:07:08.013 --> 00:07:09.863
I had to fill in the gaps, which is now rather daunting,

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:12.424
because now I have to recreate back to back

00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:15.479
what really happened and I had, I'm the only one

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.754
who could really blow it at that point.

00:07:19.754 --> 00:07:21.794
So this is the footage he photographed,

00:07:21.794 --> 00:07:26.438
and it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring.

00:07:26.438 --> 00:07:28.935
So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:32.136
this sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions

00:07:32.136 --> 00:07:34.813
when I was looking at it for the very first time.

00:07:34.813 --> 00:07:39.379
I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:40.764
see it come back to life.

00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:43.485
I automatically wanted to see this ship,

00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:46.148
this magnificent ship, basically in all its glory,

00:07:46.148 --> 00:07:49.224
and conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory,

00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:51.672
basically go back to what it looks like.

00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:55.132
So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you

00:07:55.132 --> 00:07:57.537
what I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie,

00:07:57.537 --> 00:08:01.136
for me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie,

00:08:01.136 --> 00:08:04.732
that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created.

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:06.713
And I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found

00:08:06.713 --> 00:08:09.000
interesting is what we really were emoting to

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.418
when you take a look at it.

00:08:10.418 --> 00:08:13.324
So here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.

00:08:13.324 --> 00:08:15.287
So, when you saw my footage,

00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:17.930
you were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.927
flipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs

00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:23.532
are actually about the size of small footballs,

00:08:23.532 --> 00:08:25.565
and shot in smoke.

00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:27.775
Jim went three miles went down, and I went about

00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:29.373
three miles away from the studio

00:08:29.373 --> 00:08:31.973
and photographed this in a garage.

00:08:31.973 --> 00:08:34.204
And so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're looking

00:08:34.204 --> 00:08:37.316
at, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:40.557
that Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinating

00:08:40.557 --> 00:08:45.049
that our brains sort of, once you believe something's real,

00:08:45.049 --> 00:08:47.856
you transfer everything that you feel about it,

00:08:47.856 --> 00:08:50.248
this quality you have, and it's totally artificial.

00:08:50.248 --> 00:08:53.980
It's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.980
and I found that that was a very interesting thing

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.775
to explore and use, and it caused me to create the next

00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:00.570
effect that I'll show you, which is

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.785
this sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:07.738
to do is basically have the audience cue the effect,

00:09:07.738 --> 00:09:10.390
so it became a seamless experience for them,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.720
that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.641
I was showing you what you wanted to see.

00:09:15.641 --> 00:09:22.424
And the very next shot, right after this --

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:23.989
So you can see what I was doing.

00:09:23.989 --> 00:09:25.783
So basically, if there's two subs in the same shot,

00:09:25.783 --> 00:09:28.691
I shot it, because where's the camera coming from?

00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:30.252
And when Jim shot it, it was only one sub,

00:09:30.252 --> 00:09:31.523
because he was photographing from the other,

00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:33.227
and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this.

00:09:33.227 --> 00:09:36.597
I'll give it to Jim, because he could use the pat on the back.

00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:42.915
(Laughter)

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:45.254
Okay. So now the Titanic transition.

00:09:45.254 --> 00:09:48.405
So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically

00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:51.322
magically transplant from one state of the Titanic

00:09:51.322 --> 00:09:55.270
to the other. So I'll just play the shot once. (Music)

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.710
(Music)

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:04.462
And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.

00:10:09.754 --> 00:10:14.295
Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.

00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:17.084
RL: So, what I did is basically I had another

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:19.922
screening room experience where I was basically tracking

00:10:19.922 --> 00:10:22.224
where I was looking, or where we were looking,

00:10:22.224 --> 00:10:24.642
and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow

00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:26.835
of the ship, and then at some point,

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.853
I'm changing the periphery of the shot,

00:10:28.853 --> 00:10:31.175
I'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck,

00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:34.184
and then I would run it every day, and then I would find

00:10:34.184 --> 00:10:37.251
exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them

00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:39.441
and start noticing the rest of it, and the moment

00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:41.999
my eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame.

00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:44.375
The moment my eye shifted, I immediately started

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:46.714
to change them, so now somehow you missed

00:10:46.714 --> 00:10:49.054
where it started and where it stopped.

00:10:49.054 --> 00:10:51.207
And so I'll just show it one more time.

00:10:51.207 --> 00:10:54.404
(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:58.139
naturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift

00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:00.091
your attention, something changes, and then I left

00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:02.234
the little scarf going, because it really wanted to be

00:11:02.234 --> 00:11:06.087
a ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still

00:11:06.087 --> 00:11:09.417
on the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:11.426
Or something like that. I just made that up.

00:11:11.426 --> 00:11:13.895
(Laughter)

00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:15.779
It was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:19.250
It was a long film to work on. (Laughter)

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.532
Now, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, because

00:11:21.532 --> 00:11:23.642
the movie itself is about film illusions.

00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:26.507
It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence

00:11:26.507 --> 00:11:29.325
of vision that creates a motion picture,

00:11:29.325 --> 00:11:32.999
and one of the things I had to do is, we —

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:36.326
Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy,

00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:38.477
comedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of

00:11:38.477 --> 00:11:40.705
the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted

00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:44.013
his leg brace to get caught on a moving train.

00:11:44.013 --> 00:11:46.134
Very dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly

00:11:46.134 --> 00:11:49.459
on our stage, because there literally is no way to actually

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:54.323
move this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.

00:11:54.323 --> 00:11:56.786
So let me show you the scene, and then I basically

00:11:56.786 --> 00:12:00.469
used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:03.643
which is, if you have a camera that's moving with a moving

00:12:03.643 --> 00:12:06.412
object, what is not moving appears to be moving,

00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:09.011
and what is moving appears to be stopped,

00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.926
so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not

00:12:11.926 --> 00:12:17.006
moving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:20.037
So this is the shot. That's a little video of

00:12:20.037 --> 00:12:23.319
what you're looking at there, which is our little test,

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:25.898
so that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it was

00:12:25.898 --> 00:12:28.055
sort of an interesting thing, because it was, part

00:12:28.055 --> 00:12:31.380
of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.898
sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:36.563
I'd love to but I can't, because it was invented

00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:41.208
like in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty,

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:42.864
and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's

00:12:42.864 --> 00:12:45.245
really hard to really get until you actually see it work,

00:12:45.245 --> 00:12:48.125
and I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said,

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:50.347
"So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels?

00:12:50.347 --> 00:12:52.300
That doesn't move."

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.718
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:59.694
"And the thing without the wheels, that moves."

00:12:59.694 --> 00:13:02.169
Precisely. (Laughter)

00:13:02.169 --> 00:13:04.964
Brings me to the next, and final --

00:13:04.964 --> 00:13:09.033
Marty's not going to see this, is he? (Laughter)

00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:12.823
This isn't viewed outside of -- (Laughter)

00:13:12.823 --> 00:13:17.250
The next illustration is something that, there's like

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.312
all one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story,

00:13:20.312 --> 00:13:22.369
especially if you're following somebody on a journey,

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.677
and that journey basically tells something about

00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:26.918
their personality in a very concise way,

00:13:26.918 --> 00:13:29.301
and what we wanted to do based on the shot in "Goodfellas,"

00:13:29.301 --> 00:13:31.185
which is one of the great shots ever,

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:34.562
a Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hill

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:36.698
through what it feels like to be a gangster walk

00:13:36.698 --> 00:13:39.261
going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.

00:13:39.261 --> 00:13:42.768
He was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo

00:13:42.768 --> 00:13:45.424
to feel the same way, so we created this shot.

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:48.741
(Music)

00:13:48.741 --> 00:13:53.767
That's Hugo. (Music)

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:56.844
And we felt that if we could basically move the camera

00:13:56.844 --> 00:13:59.534
with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy

00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:02.325
who is basically the master of his universe,

00:14:02.325 --> 00:14:04.784
and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes

00:14:04.784 --> 00:14:07.425
in the bowels of this particular train station

00:14:07.425 --> 00:14:09.729
that only he can actually navigate through

00:14:09.729 --> 00:14:12.028
and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that

00:14:12.028 --> 00:14:14.335
this is his normal, everyday sort of life,

00:14:14.335 --> 00:14:16.901
so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,

00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:19.517
and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically

00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:23.528
it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick,

00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:27.050
so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.316
and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got

00:14:30.316 --> 00:14:31.878
when you saw the "Goodfellas" shot.

00:14:31.878 --> 00:14:35.679
So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:38.864
It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times

00:14:38.864 --> 00:14:40.051
with two different boys.

00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:42.213
The one on the left is where the shot ends,

00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:47.639
and the shot on the right is where it takes over,

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:51.144
and now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,

00:14:51.144 --> 00:14:55.018
who's the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)

00:14:55.018 --> 00:14:56.867
I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig

00:14:56.867 --> 00:14:59.331
that we built for this. (Music)

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:02.882
And so this is, and now this is set number three

00:15:02.882 --> 00:15:07.262
we're into, and then we're going to go into, basically

00:15:07.262 --> 00:15:09.926
the very last moment of the shot is actually

00:15:09.926 --> 00:15:12.208
the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:14.253
and various things like that, and it literally was done

00:15:14.253 --> 00:15:17.550
over five different sets, two different boys, different times,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.380
and it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what was

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.075
sort of great for me was it was probably

00:15:25.075 --> 00:15:27.592
the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on,

00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:30.180
and, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:35.078
which is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.

00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:37.888
So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,

00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:39.812
and said, "You know, this is, you know, kind of

00:15:39.812 --> 00:15:41.684
the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on.

00:15:41.684 --> 00:15:44.595
What do you think was the reason?"

00:15:44.595 --> 00:15:46.005
And he said, "Because no one knows

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:47.971
you had anything to do with it."

00:15:47.971 --> 00:15:50.777
(Laughter)

00:15:50.777 --> 00:15:54.691
So, all I can say is, thank you,

00:15:54.691 --> 00:15:59.891
and that's my presentation for you. (Applause)

00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:05.235
(Applause)
