WEBVTT

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.227
I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves,

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:09.413
but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that,

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:11.235
so that was a bad idea. (Laughter)

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:14.656
Anyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:18.593
to present to you some of my music and some of my work

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:21.687
as a composer, presumably because it appeals

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:25.670
to my well-known and abundant narcissism. (Laughter)

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.278
And I'm not kidding, I just think we should just

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.734
say that and move forward. (Laughter)

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:34.614
So, but the thing is, a dilemma quickly arose,

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:36.819
and that is that I'm really bored with music,

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:39.885
and I'm really bored with the role of the composer,

00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:43.093
and so I decided to put that idea, boredom,

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:46.067
as the focus of my presentation to you today.

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.355
And I'm going to share my music with you, but I hope

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:50.590
that I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.999
tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.553
for creativity and invention, and how boredom

00:00:56.553 --> 00:00:59.714
actually forced me to change the fundamental question

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.795
that I was asking in my discipline,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.854
and how boredom also, in a sense,

00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:08.298
pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of

00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:10.908
most traditional, narrow definition of a composer.

00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:13.379
What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:16.207
of a piece of music at the piano.

00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:25.522
(Music)

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:28.836
Okay, I wrote that. (Laughter)

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:30.743
No, it's not — (Applause) Oh, why thank you.

00:01:30.743 --> 00:01:32.374
No, no, I didn't write that.

00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:34.646
In fact, that was a piece by Beethoven,

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:37.201
and so I was not functioning as a composer.

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:40.252
Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter,

00:01:40.252 --> 00:01:42.313
and there I am, interpreter.

00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:45.022
So, an interpreter of what? Of a piece of music, right?

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:49.229
But we can ask the question, "But is it music?"

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.009
And I say this rhetorically, because of course

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.830
by just about any standard we would have to concede

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.778
that this is, of course, a piece of music,

00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:58.104
but I put this here now because,

00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:00.387
just to set it in your brains for the moment,

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:02.228
because we're going to return to this question.

00:02:02.228 --> 00:02:04.010
It's going to be a kind of a refrain

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.821
as we go through the presentation.

00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.049
So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven,

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.255
and my problem with it is, it's boring.

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:18.075
I mean, you — I'm just like, a hush, huh -- It's like -- (Laughter)

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:19.793
It's Beethoven, how can you say that?

00:02:19.793 --> 00:02:21.528
No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.

00:02:21.528 --> 00:02:24.559
I had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So -- (Laughter)

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.282
I would, so what I might like to try to do is to change it,

00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:29.926
to transform it in some ways, to personalize it,

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:32.353
so I might take the opening, like this idea --

00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:34.561
(Music)

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:39.458
and then I might substitute -- (Music)

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.097
and then I might improvise on that melody

00:02:41.097 --> 00:02:44.732
that goes forward from there -- (Music)

00:02:44.732 --> 00:03:10.754
(Music)

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:13.866
So that might be the kind of thing -- Why thank you.

00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:17.461
(Applause)

00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:19.579
That would be the kind of thing that I would do,

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.676
and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.

00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:25.408
In fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is -- (Laughter) --

00:03:25.408 --> 00:03:30.707
it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.

00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:33.877
I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have

00:03:33.877 --> 00:03:37.449
to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.651
as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head

00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:42.856
and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:44.454
I'm going to make to it.

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:47.029
So this is an engaging enterprise for me, and

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:51.687
I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there,

00:03:51.687 --> 00:03:54.008
and now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree

00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:57.699
that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise. (Laughter)

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.113
But it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:02.533
for a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it,

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:05.184
I actually mean, the piano, because it becomes,

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:08.402
it's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually

00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:10.923
pretty compressed, at least when you play on the keyboard,

00:04:10.923 --> 00:04:13.533
and if you're not doing things like listening to it

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:16.256
after you've lit it on fire or something like that, you know.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.225
It gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:20.385
I go through other instruments, they become familiar,

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.062
and eventually I find myself designing and constructing

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:27.225
my own instrument, and I brought one with me today,

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:30.161
and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:32.367
so you can hear what it sounds like.

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:43.780
(Music)

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.543
You gotta have doorstops, that's important. (Laughter)

00:04:49.543 --> 00:04:52.651
I've got combs. They're the only combs that I own. (Music)

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:55.807
They're all mounted on my instruments. (Laughter)

00:04:55.807 --> 00:05:04.866
(Music)

00:05:04.866 --> 00:05:07.451
I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play

00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:09.949
with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks.

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:17.802
So we have this sound. (Music)

00:05:17.802 --> 00:05:19.846
And with a bank of live electronics,

00:05:19.846 --> 00:05:23.967
I can change the sounds radically. (Music)

00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:33.041
(Music)

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:39.292
Like that, and like this. (Music)

00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:41.410
And so forth.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.549
So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world

00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:46.226
of this instrument, which I think is quite interesting

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:50.000
and it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about —

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.119
This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ... (Laughter)

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.383
and the cool thing about it is

00:05:55.383 --> 00:05:58.951
I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player. (Laughter)

00:05:58.951 --> 00:06:00.570
Okay? (Applause)

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.746
So in that regard, this is one of the things,

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:05.606
this is one of the privileges of being,

00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:08.612
and here's another role, the inventor, and by the way,

00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:10.790
when I told you that I'm the world's greatest,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.794
if you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism

00:06:14.794 --> 00:06:16.798
and now a healthy dose of egocentricism.

00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:20.398
I know some of you are just, you know, bingo! Or, I don't know. (Laughter)

00:06:20.398 --> 00:06:25.945
Anyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:28.677
I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player,

00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:30.927
and it was this distinction that I was most worried about

00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:33.864
when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide.

00:06:33.864 --> 00:06:36.350
I'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.307
I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars.

00:06:39.307 --> 00:06:43.123
Anyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises

00:06:43.123 --> 00:06:46.858
are engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them

00:06:46.858 --> 00:06:50.210
to you today, they're actually solitary enterprises,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.237
and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so

00:06:53.237 --> 00:06:55.755
I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them.

00:06:55.755 --> 00:06:58.841
I get to write, sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person,

00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:02.150
sometimes full orchestras, and I work with a lot of people,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.829
and this is probably the capacity, the role creatively

00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:08.991
for which I'm probably best known professionally.

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.966
Now, some of my scores as a composer look like this,

00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:14.039
and others look like this,

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.123
and some look like this,

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:19.169
and I make all of these by hand, and it's really tedious.

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:21.502
It takes a long, long time to make these scores,

00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:23.675
and right now I'm working on a piece

00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:25.698
that's 180 pages in length,

00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:29.894
and it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair.

00:07:29.894 --> 00:07:32.403
I have a lot of it, and that's a good thing I suppose. (Laughter)

00:07:32.403 --> 00:07:35.967
So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me,

00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:38.940
so after a while the process of notating is not only boring,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.072
but I actually want the notation to be more interesting,

00:07:42.072 --> 00:07:44.791
and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one.

00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:47.021
This is an excerpt from a score called

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:49.212
"The Metaphysics of Notation."

00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:51.756
The full score is 72 feet wide.

00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:54.454
It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation.

00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:57.340
Let's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.157
it's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates,

00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:04.774
with straight edges, with French curves, and by freehand,

00:08:04.774 --> 00:08:07.428
and the 72 feet was actually split

00:08:07.428 --> 00:08:10.463
into 12 six-foot-wide panels that were installed

00:08:10.463 --> 00:08:15.347
around the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony,

00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:19.155
and it appeared for one year in the museum,

00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:22.013
and during that year, it was experienced as visual art

00:08:22.013 --> 00:08:23.914
most of the week, except, as you can see in these pictures,

00:08:23.914 --> 00:08:26.952
on Fridays, from noon til one, and only during that time,

00:08:26.952 --> 00:08:30.332
various performers came and interpreted these strange

00:08:30.332 --> 00:08:33.611
and undefined pictographic glyphs. (Laughter)

00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:37.295
Now this was a really exciting experience for me.

00:08:37.295 --> 00:08:38.898
It was gratifying musically, but I think

00:08:38.898 --> 00:08:41.594
the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on

00:08:41.594 --> 00:08:44.490
another role, especially given that it appeared in a museum,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.766
and that is as visual artist. (Laughter)

00:08:47.766 --> 00:08:50.266
We're going to fill up the whole thing, don't worry. (Laughter)

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:52.269
I am multitudes. (Laughter)

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:55.173
So one of the things is that, I mean, some people

00:08:55.173 --> 00:08:56.960
would say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante,"

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.537
and maybe that's true. I can understand how, I mean,

00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:01.696
because I don't have a pedigree in visual art

00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:03.732
and I don't have any training, but it's just something

00:09:03.732 --> 00:09:06.199
that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition,

00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:09.099
as an extension of a kind of creative impulse.

00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:12.195
I can understand the question, though. "But is it music?"

00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:14.454
I mean, there's not any traditional notation.

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:16.707
I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism

00:09:16.707 --> 00:09:20.079
in this piece, "S-tog," which I made when I was living in Copenhagen.

00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:22.066
I took the Copenhagen subway map and

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:25.198
I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations,

00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:27.969
and the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches,

00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:30.830
follow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.891
So this is a case of actually adapting something,

00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:35.774
or maybe stealing something,

00:09:35.774 --> 00:09:38.115
and then turning it into a musical notation.

00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:40.270
Another adaptation would be this piece.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.616
I took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:46.854
I made my own faces, and had a company fabricate them,

00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:49.092
and the players follow these scores.

00:09:49.092 --> 00:09:51.113
They follow the second hands, and as they pass over

00:09:51.113 --> 00:09:54.099
the various symbols, the players respond musically.

00:09:54.099 --> 00:09:56.322
Here's another example from another piece,

00:09:56.322 --> 00:09:58.376
and then its realization.

00:09:58.376 --> 00:10:00.855
So in these two capacities, I've been scavenger,

00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:03.242
in the sense of taking, like, the subway map, right,

00:10:03.242 --> 00:10:05.760
or thief maybe, and I've also been designer,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.075
in the case of making the wristwatches.

00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:11.655
And once again, this is, for me, interesting.

00:10:11.655 --> 00:10:14.974
Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.

00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:17.661
Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements,

00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:19.815
and I often perform them. I want to show you a clip

00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:21.579
from a piece called "Echolalia."

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.650
This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter,

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.955
who is an extraordinary performer.

00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:29.387
Let's watch a little bit of this, and please notice the instrumentation.

00:10:29.387 --> 00:10:58.275
(Music)

00:10:58.275 --> 00:10:59.959
Okay, I hear you were laughing nervously because

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:02.253
you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp,

00:11:02.253 --> 00:11:04.381
the intonation was a little questionable. (Laughter)

00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:06.393
Let's watch just another clip.

00:11:06.393 --> 00:11:16.969
(Music)

00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:19.665
You can see the mayhem continues, and there's, you know,

00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:21.543
there were no clarinets and trumpets

00:11:21.543 --> 00:11:23.447
and flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has

00:11:23.447 --> 00:11:26.002
an even more unusual, more peculiar instrumentation.

00:11:26.002 --> 00:11:29.579
This is "Tlön," for three conductors and no players. (Laughter)

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.267
This was based on the experience of actually watching

00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:46.783
two people having a virulent argument in sign language,

00:11:46.783 --> 00:11:48.642
which produced no decibels to speak of,

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:52.053
but affectively, psychologically, was a very loud experience.

00:11:52.053 --> 00:11:55.721
So, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances

00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:59.823
and then the total absence of conventional instruments

00:11:59.823 --> 00:12:02.696
and this glut of conductors, people might, you know,

00:12:02.696 --> 00:12:05.599
wonder, yeah, "Is this music?"

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:09.446
But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself,

00:12:09.446 --> 00:12:11.933
and that is my "Concerto for Orchestra."

00:12:11.933 --> 00:12:13.931
You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments

00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:17.631
in this clip. (Music)

00:12:17.631 --> 00:12:30.478
(Music)

00:12:30.478 --> 00:12:32.518
This, in fact, is not the title of this piece.

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:35.073
I was a bit mischievous. In fact, to make it more interesting,

00:12:35.073 --> 00:12:39.358
I put a space right in here, and this is the actual title of the piece.

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.384
Let's continue with that same excerpt.

00:12:41.384 --> 00:12:51.677
(Music)

00:12:51.677 --> 00:12:59.767
It's better with a florist, right? (Laughter) (Music)

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.003
Or at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips.

00:13:02.003 --> 00:13:15.979
(Music)

00:13:15.979 --> 00:13:19.027
So with all these theatric elements, this pushes me in another role,

00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:21.850
and that would be, possibly, the dramaturge.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:26.337
I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right?

00:13:26.337 --> 00:13:28.800
Okay? But then there was this other stuff, right?

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.733
There was the florist, and I can understand that,

00:13:30.733 --> 00:13:33.873
once again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music

00:13:33.873 --> 00:13:36.586
as we know it conventionally,

00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:41.009
but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you.

00:13:41.009 --> 00:13:43.674
This is going to be a piece called "Aphasia,"

00:13:43.674 --> 00:13:47.109
and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound,

00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:49.848
and this invites yet another role, and final one

00:13:49.848 --> 00:13:52.421
I'll share with you, which is that of the choreographer.

00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:54.899
And the score for the piece looks like this,

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:59.309
and it instructs me, the performer, to make

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:02.039
various hand gestures at very specific times

00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:04.293
synchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape

00:14:04.293 --> 00:14:07.170
is made up exclusively of vocal samples.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.592
I recorded an awesome singer,

00:14:09.592 --> 00:14:11.937
and I took the sound of his voice in my computer,

00:14:11.937 --> 00:14:14.536
and I warped it in countless ways to come up with

00:14:14.536 --> 00:14:16.804
the soundtrack that you're about to hear.

00:14:16.804 --> 00:14:21.769
And I'll perform just an excerpt of "Aphasia" for you here. Okay?

00:14:21.769 --> 00:15:00.105
(Music)

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:06.731
So that gives you a little taste of that piece. (Applause)

00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:09.015
Yeah, okay, that's kind of weird stuff.

00:15:09.015 --> 00:15:11.254
Is it music? Here's how I want to conclude.

00:15:11.254 --> 00:15:13.830
I've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.788
that this is not the important question.

00:15:15.788 --> 00:15:18.521
The important question is, "Is it interesting?"

00:15:18.521 --> 00:15:21.413
And I follow this question, not worrying about "Is it music?" --

00:15:21.413 --> 00:15:23.899
not worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making.

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:26.352
I allow my creativity to push me

00:15:26.352 --> 00:15:28.512
in directions that are simply interesting to me,

00:15:28.512 --> 00:15:31.561
and I don't worry about the likeness of the result

00:15:31.561 --> 00:15:33.617
to some notion, some paradigm,

00:15:33.617 --> 00:15:36.606
of what music composition is supposed to be,

00:15:36.606 --> 00:15:39.049
and that has actually urged me, in a sense,

00:15:39.049 --> 00:15:40.784
to take on a whole bunch of different roles,

00:15:40.784 --> 00:15:42.919
and so what I want you to think about is,

00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:46.137
to what extent might you change the fundamental question

00:15:46.137 --> 00:15:48.860
in your discipline, and, okay,

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.240
I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here,

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.854
because, like, I realized I mentioned

00:15:52.854 --> 00:15:55.789
some psychological defects earlier, and we also,

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:59.532
along the way, had a fair amount of obsessive behavior,

00:15:59.532 --> 00:16:01.693
and there was some delusional behavior and things like that,

00:16:01.693 --> 00:16:04.674
and here I think we could say that this is an argument

00:16:04.674 --> 00:16:06.653
for self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia,

00:16:06.653 --> 00:16:08.589
at least in the popular use of the term,

00:16:08.589 --> 00:16:10.823
and I really mean dissociative identity disorder, okay. (Laughter)

00:16:10.823 --> 00:16:13.886
Anyway, despite those perils, I would urge you

00:16:13.886 --> 00:16:16.461
to think about the possibility that you might take on roles

00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:18.552
in your own work, whether they are neighboring

00:16:18.552 --> 00:16:21.050
or far-flung from your professional definition.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.827
And with that, I thank you very much. (Applause)

00:16:22.827 --> 00:16:29.026
(Applause)
