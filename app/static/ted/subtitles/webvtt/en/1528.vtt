WEBVTT

00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:02.611
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:07.506
When I was first asked to do a TED Talk,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.247
I Googled to try and find out
a little bit more about,

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:14.610
you know, how it felt to be giving one.

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:17.648
And one of the first things I read
was a speaker in the States

00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:20.720
saying that she felt fine
until she came onstage,

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:22.788
and then she saw the timer ticking down.

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:23.850
(Laughter)

00:00:23.874 --> 00:00:25.529
And it reminded her of a bomb.

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:28.602
I was thinking,
"That's the last thing I need."

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:30.614
(Laughter)

00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:35.649
(Applause)

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.032
Anyway, it's a great privilege to be here.

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:39.799
I think it's a bit of a joke

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:43.898
for an editor of a paper to choose
a photographer to open a speaking event.

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:44.954
(Laughter)

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.851
We're not renowned for our words,

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:49.452
and I spent the last 40 years
hiding behind a camera

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:51.297
so I didn't have to speak.

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:54.303
But I'm here today, and what I want
to talk about are stories

00:00:54.327 --> 00:00:56.104
and the importance of stories to me

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.688
and, I think, the importance
of stories to everybody.

00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:01.008
I'm sure today you'll hear
a lot of stories

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:03.136
and, by listening to other
people's stories,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.866
I think we can learn
about the world, about other people

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.427
and get a better understanding.

00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:12.097
So I want to talk about three stories
that I've done as a photographer,

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.095
and how they've inspired me,

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.137
and how, in my life, I've become
a part of the stories

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.825
that I document myself.

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.145
As John said, I was a fashion photographer

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:23.931
and music photographer for 10 years.

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:25.558
I enjoyed it, I had a lot of fun,

00:01:25.582 --> 00:01:28.354
but always wanted to do
something more with my work.

00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:31.044
And storytelling was always
something I wanted to do.

00:01:32.187 --> 00:01:35.657
So 10 years ago, I set out
to travel the world,

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:39.816
to go and photograph
other people in their situations

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.574
and to record their stories,
to bring them back,

00:01:42.598 --> 00:01:45.048
so that other people might understand.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:46.923
But this didn't happen overnight.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.674
When I worked as a music photographer
and a fashion photographer,

00:01:50.698 --> 00:01:53.916
I always had this nagging feeling
that there was something missing,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.950
that I wasn't quite
using my skills productively.

00:01:56.974 --> 00:01:59.142
And it may seem
very obvious, the link, now,

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.281
but at the time,
I couldn't really work out

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:04.140
how could I use my photography
to do something useful.

00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:06.598
So I gave up photography.

00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:09.985
I walked away from it completely
and decided to do care work.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.222
As a care worker, I started looking
after a young guy called Nick.

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:18.707
Nick has autism, very severe autism.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.288
But over the years of looking after him,
we became very close friends.

00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:24.951
I would give him a 24-hour care,

00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:28.500
we would go off and do things
from swimming, going for walks ...

00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:29.859
all sorts.

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:32.800
Bit by bit, though,
as I got to know him better,

00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:35.531
I realized that his story
wasn't being told.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:40.118
He self-harmed, he would punch himself
quite a lot in the face.

00:02:40.142 --> 00:02:43.047
And nobody really got to see that.

00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:46.624
So this is Nick.

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:51.860
He used to describe his life
as living downstairs at a party.

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:54.109
He said he could hear
the party in the kitchen,

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.842
but he felt like he was always
trapped in the basement,

00:02:56.866 --> 00:02:58.030
in his own little world,

00:02:58.054 --> 00:03:01.486
wanting to be part of the party
but not able to walk upstairs.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.411
So I documented his life.

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:06.374
I started to photograph it,

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:09.494
not really with any intention
of doing anything with the pictures,

00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:11.405
but just as a way of recording.

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:15.588
And as I started doing that, I realized
that I could tell somebody's story

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.193
through my photographs.

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:21.502
As I said, Nick would self-harm.

00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:23.925
He would punch himself in the face.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.110
And nobody really got to see that.

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:31.612
As we built up a kind
of closer friendship,

00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:35.838
he finally would allow me
to actually see him doing this

00:03:35.862 --> 00:03:37.014
and to document it.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:39.191
It was a moment of trust.

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:44.335
The social services were not
particularly good at helping Nick,

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.648
and they said that he wouldn't be
self-harming as bad as we said.

00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:52.456
So one day, I took a photograph
of when he'd really been self-harming.

00:03:54.188 --> 00:03:56.047
We took that to the social services,

00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:58.830
and their reaction was immediately
incredibly different,

00:03:58.854 --> 00:04:01.197
and they managed to get a lot of help.

00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:03.916
And I'm glad to say now,
eight years later,

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.748
I actually spoke to Nick last night,

00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:08.900
and he wanted to let me know
that he was feeling a lot better,

00:04:08.924 --> 00:04:11.291
and he doesn't do
the self-harming anymore.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:14.375
And in some small way,
I hope that the photographs

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:15.902
was a part of that process.

00:04:16.886 --> 00:04:20.692
The main thing it did is it inspired
me to go out with my camera

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:22.683
and to tell other people's stories.

00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:28.128
One of the stories I did
was in Kutupalong,

00:04:28.152 --> 00:04:31.373
on the border of Burma and Bangladesh.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.717
Here, the Rohingyas refugees
have been left,

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:36.566
pretty much to rot,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.990
for over 20 years.

00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:40.783
This is a picture of the unofficial camp.

00:04:40.807 --> 00:04:44.351
At the top, you can see
the official UN camp.

00:04:44.956 --> 00:04:47.298
All these huts are the unofficial camps.

00:04:47.322 --> 00:04:49.951
Literally, the raw sewage
runs through the camp.

00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:53.679
The people there have been forgotten,

00:04:53.703 --> 00:04:56.726
so I thought it was important to go
and document their stories.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.555
So I arranged with the village elder;

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:00.788
the people would come along the next day,

00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:03.080
and I would take portraits
of all these people

00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:04.447
and record their stories.

00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:08.661
So as the time went on,
I turned up in the morning,

00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:12.922
I put a big, white sheet up,
and I started to photograph these people.

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:16.815
Suddenly, though, everything
got a bit out of control,

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.460
and, although it was still dawn,

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.523
we were filled in this small
little compound we had made

00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:26.605
with literally hundreds of people
turning up with ailments and diseases

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.633
and just ... a hopeless situation.

00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:32.808
And that's exactly
what their situation is -- helpless.

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:37.748
A child with a tumor that nobody helped,
who was slowly suffocating.

00:05:39.562 --> 00:05:41.209
I got in a bit of a panic,

00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:43.728
because these people were
coming up to me, desperate,

00:05:43.752 --> 00:05:46.009
and I was trying to explain
to the village elder

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.974
that I was not a doctor,
and I couldn't help these people.

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:51.230
And the village elder
turned to me and he said,

00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:54.519
"No, it's really important;
these people know you're not a doctor,

00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:56.930
but at least somebody
is now telling their story,

00:05:56.954 --> 00:05:59.754
and somebody is recording
what is happening to them."

00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:02.128
And it was a good moment for me.

00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:06.004
It was a realization
that maybe it was worthwhile

00:06:06.028 --> 00:06:08.121
going off and doing these things.

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:13.434
Another story that inspired me
was in Odessa, in Ukraine.

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:15.917
I was documenting a bunch of street kids.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:18.897
I ended up actually living
with them in a squat,

00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.328
which I can say was an experience.

00:06:22.262 --> 00:06:25.167
Many late nights of vodka-fueled violence

00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:27.588
with me sitting in the corner with my bag,

00:06:27.612 --> 00:06:29.970
just going, "When was this a good idea?"

00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:31.105
(Laughter)

00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:33.767
I would say it's moments
like that when I think,

00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:35.593
"Why did I leave the fashion world?"

00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:36.822
But they were great kids,

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:40.443
and on the last day,
they took me down to the sea

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:43.089
for a sort of trip, a sort of farewell.

00:06:43.113 --> 00:06:44.682
There they are, drinking vodka.

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:48.010
And then Serge, who was the oldest
and the most violent --

00:06:48.034 --> 00:06:50.697
he'd just got out of the prison
for stabbing somebody --

00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:53.628
comes and puts his arm around me
and says, "We go swimming."

00:06:53.652 --> 00:06:57.302
Now, I have to say, I had
a "Lonely Planet" guide to Ukraine

00:06:57.326 --> 00:06:59.624
and in it, it gave some advice.

00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:03.919
And in that advice was,
"Do not talk to the street kids,

00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:07.469
at no point leave your baggage unattended

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.330
and in all counts, do not go swimming."

00:07:11.354 --> 00:07:13.125
(Laughter)

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:15.910
So I was like, "I don't know
if this is a good idea."

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:19.260
Serge has got his arm around me.

00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:21.011
I'm like, "OK." So there I am.

00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:22.045
(Laughter)

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:25.641
I literally handed all my cameras,
all my equipment, to these street kids.

00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:27.474
And they took it.

00:07:27.498 --> 00:07:30.241
It's kind of funny to know,
if you look in the background,

00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:33.338
you can see the other street kids
who didn't get in the water go,

00:07:33.362 --> 00:07:35.009
"Why would you get in that water?"

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:36.694
But one of the little kids, Lilic,

00:07:36.718 --> 00:07:38.646
he was the one who had taken my camera,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.315
and he started taking photographs.

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:42.320
He was really excited by this camera.

00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:45.253
And we talked a lot about
how I was going to get him a camera

00:07:45.277 --> 00:07:48.251
and would return and we could start
to teach him photography.

00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:49.893
He had a real eye for things.

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.314
That's him, there.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:55.254
That was taken on the last
evening I was there.

00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:58.873
I'd been staying there, but that night,
I left to go and collect my things.

00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:01.443
And when I came back
in the morning, he was dead.

00:08:02.057 --> 00:08:05.079
He had taken a lot of pills
and a lot of vodka.

00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:08.709
And he had passed out in the night
and didn’t recover.

00:08:09.814 --> 00:08:11.441
Again, it was another reminder

00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:13.933
of maybe why I should record
these people's stories:

00:08:13.957 --> 00:08:15.590
because their lives are important,

00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:18.123
and it's important
for me to document them.

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:22.086
Then in February of last year,
when I was on patrol in Afghanistan,

00:08:22.848 --> 00:08:24.489
I stepped on an IED.

00:08:26.002 --> 00:08:27.701
That's me down there, somewhere.

00:08:29.178 --> 00:08:30.707
I became part of the story.

00:08:31.617 --> 00:08:35.370
At first, I was devastated
by what had happened, obviously.

00:08:36.598 --> 00:08:38.496
I thought my work was over,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.915
I thought -- everything
didn't make sense to me.

00:08:42.423 --> 00:08:45.446
And then I realized:
I never set out to Congo,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.258
to Angola, to Bangladesh

00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:48.882
to take photographs.

00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:52.382
I went to those places because I wanted
to make some kind of change,

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:54.423
and photography happened to be my tool.

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:59.195
And then I became aware
that my body was, in many ways,

00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:01.728
a living example
of what war does to somebody.

00:09:01.752 --> 00:09:05.335
And I realized I could use
my own experience, my own body,

00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:06.736
to tell that story.

00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:11.048
And it was also by looking back
at the other people I've documented.

00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:13.540
I thought of Nick, and I thought
of his resilience.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:18.094
I thought of the Rohingyas
and the fact that they have no hope.

00:09:19.023 --> 00:09:21.983
I thought of Lilic and a lost life.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.335
And in fact, it was the stories
that I've documented

00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:28.568
that inspired me to get
through the last year,

00:09:28.592 --> 00:09:29.765
to survive,

00:09:30.408 --> 00:09:32.457
to get back up on my new legs

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:34.894
and to be able to come
and tell their stories,

00:09:34.918 --> 00:09:36.401
but also my own story.

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:38.847
So I did a self-portrait,

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:43.226
because I wanted to show everybody
what a bomb does to somebody,

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.938
but also to show that losing your limbs
doesn't end your life;

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.788
that you can have
what people say is disability,

00:09:49.812 --> 00:09:51.278
but not be disabled;

00:09:51.302 --> 00:09:53.095
that you can be able to do anything

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:54.960
if you put your mind to it

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:56.488
and have belief in it.

00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:59.546
It's strange,

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.963
but in many ways I look
at where I was a year ago,

00:10:01.987 --> 00:10:03.425
and I look at where I am now,

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:06.354
and I realize that I have
a lot of things I didn't have then.

00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:09.291
I wouldn't be sitting here right now
if this hadn't happened.

00:10:09.315 --> 00:10:11.927
I wouldn't have been able
to show you those photographs

00:10:11.951 --> 00:10:13.340
and tell you those stories.

00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:16.822
I was lucky 10 years ago,
when I sat down and I tried to work out

00:10:16.846 --> 00:10:19.267
what I could do to make
a difference in this world.

00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.587
I realized that my photography
was a tool and a way to do it.

00:10:23.175 --> 00:10:24.840
I think that's what's really key.

00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:28.600
It's that we all can
be part of that wheel.

00:10:28.624 --> 00:10:31.083
We can all be cogs in a wheel of change.

00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:32.667
We can all make a difference.

00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:35.509
Everybody here has an ability
to use something

00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:37.241
to make a difference to the world.

00:10:37.265 --> 00:10:40.239
We can all sit in front of the TV and go,

00:10:40.263 --> 00:10:42.931
"I don't know what to do
about it," and forget about it.

00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:45.235
But the reality is that we can
all do something.

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:47.045
It might be just writing a letter.

00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:49.579
It might be standing
on a soapbox and talking.

00:10:49.603 --> 00:10:51.677
It might be just recording
somebody's story

00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:53.332
and telling it to somebody else.

00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:55.149
But every single one of us here,

00:10:55.173 --> 00:10:58.632
if we want to make a difference, we can,
an there is nothing to stop us.

00:10:58.656 --> 00:11:01.921
And we all have our own experiences
that we can use as well.

00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:04.977
So really, that's all I wanted
to talk about today.

00:11:05.001 --> 00:11:10.066
I just wanted to say that life
goes on all around the world.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.410
People are going through terrible things.

00:11:13.164 --> 00:11:16.024
Everyone of us is going
through our own terrible experience.

00:11:16.048 --> 00:11:18.362
But if we share those
and we talk about stories,

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.882
then we can inspire each other

00:11:19.906 --> 00:11:22.568
to get through our own bad experiences.

00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:26.346
I know that the people I've recorded
have gotten me to this point.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.671
And I hope in some small way,
the stories I've been able to tell you

00:11:29.695 --> 00:11:31.289
will help you get through things.

00:11:31.313 --> 00:11:34.877
And in turn, I hope you will use
your experiences to help others.

00:11:35.624 --> 00:11:36.807
Thank you very much.

00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:40.458
(Applause)
