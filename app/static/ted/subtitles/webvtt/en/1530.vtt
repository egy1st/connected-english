00:00:00.426 --> 00:00:01.747
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.747 --> 00:00:04.690
I am not a farmer.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:05.625
(Laughter)

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.177
I'm not. I'm a parent, I'm a resident and I'm a teacher.

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:10.739
And this is my world.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.352
And along the way I've started noticing --

00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:13.821
I'm on my third generation of kids --

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:15.074
that they're getting bigger.

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:16.233
They're getting sicker.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.217
In addition to these complexities,

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.130
I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.140
who are labeled learning disabled would not have been

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.497
had they had proper prenatal nutrition.

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:28.173
The realities of my community are simple. They look like this.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:30.907
Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.

00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:33.049
And as jobs continue to leave my community,

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:35.992
and energy continues to come in, be exported in,

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:41.327
it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:43.927
But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet,

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:46.560
so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.896
that I'm hoping to share with you all today.

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:52.373
And with that note, I come to you with this belief

00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:54.847
that kids should not have to leave their communities

00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:56.228
to live, learn and earn in a better one.

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:57.866
So I'm here to tell you a story about me

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:01.387
and this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:03.130
And it starts with three people.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.208
The crazy teacher -- that's me on the left,

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:08.586
I dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit --

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:10.250
my passionate borough president

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.795
and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:14.059
who helped me with my class

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:16.546
and helped me get involved with this patented technology.

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:19.410
But it all starts with seeds in classrooms,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.066
in my place, which looks like this.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:27.719
And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.418
And that's really what this is all about.

00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:31.154
And it starts with incredible kids like this,

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:32.875
who come early and stay late.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.843
All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,

00:01:35.843 --> 00:01:37.602
most come with a lot of handicaps,

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:40.155
most are homeless and many are in foster care.

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:42.406
Almost all of my kids live below poverty.

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:45.827
But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:48.018
and this is what it looks like in my classroom.

00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:50.619
And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.058
And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:59.275
But again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:01.931
And I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.059
So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:06.427
into something small, like this,

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:09.219
and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:10.941
kids who didn't want to be outside could do it,

00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:12.241
and everyone could have access.

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.374
So I called George Irwin, and what do you know?

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:18.035
He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:21.383
And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,

00:02:21.383 --> 00:02:23.090
private-based learning.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.714
And lo and behold, we gave birth to

00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:27.962
the first edible wall in New York City.

00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:29.122
So if you're hungry, get up and eat.

00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:30.946
You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.

00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:34.298
Okay? But we were just getting started,

00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:35.667
the kids loved the technology,

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.012
so we called up George and we said, "We gotta learn more!"

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:40.867
Now, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits,

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:43.644
which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we're available for you --

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:45.650
We decided to go to Boston.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.076
And my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:51.341
became the first to install a green wall,

00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:53.626
designed by a computer, with real-live learning tools,

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:55.175
21 stories up -- if you're going to go visit it,

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.234
it's on top of the John Hancock building.

00:02:57.234 --> 00:03:00.026
But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:01.946
that look like this with lighting like that,

00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:05.035
real LED stuff, 21st-century technology.

00:03:05.035 --> 00:03:07.354
And what do you know? We made 21st century money,

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.173
and that was groundbreaking. Wow!

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:12.985
This is my harvest, people.

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.742
And what do you do with this food? You cook it!

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:18.646
And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce,

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:21.108
with plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria,

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:23.308
and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers.

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:25.519
And that is the youngest nationally certified

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.342
workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President.

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:31.246
And what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,

00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:32.983
and they invited us to the Hamptons.

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:35.254
So I call this "from South Bronx to Southampton."

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:37.759
And we started putting in roofs that look like this,

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.047
and we came in from destitute neighborhoods

00:03:40.047 --> 00:03:43.615
to start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.

00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:45.609
And so we got invited back this past summer,

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.368
and we actually moved into the Hamptons,

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:50.191
payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.

00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:52.967
And when you can do stuff like this --

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:56.183
These are my kids putting in this technology,

00:03:56.183 --> 00:03:58.720
and when you can build a roof that looks like that

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.134
on a house that looks like that

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:03.944
with sedum that looks like this,

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.686
this is the new green graffiti.

00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:10.191
So, you may wonder what does a wall like this

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:12.751
really do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.647
Okay, I'm going to tell you what it does.

00:04:14.647 --> 00:04:16.967
It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,

00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:19.119
Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:21.852
And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.

00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:25.341
Because Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,

00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:28.225
really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:30.423
for New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:32.767
And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:35.607
Now, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:37.622
out of work looking to manage a million dollars.

00:04:37.622 --> 00:04:40.031
I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed

00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.042
or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:44.495
for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.

00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:46.274
That's the beauty of this economy.

00:04:46.274 --> 00:04:49.608
But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:52.584
And that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.993
This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.

00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:58.375
And this is the true triple bottom line,

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:00.630
because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.551
and turn them into something like this with interiors like this.

00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:05.630
Wow! People noticed. And notice they did.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.126
So CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market.

00:05:09.126 --> 00:05:11.694
And then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC,

00:05:11.694 --> 00:05:13.598
could you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted.

00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:17.590
But this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in America

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.310
can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.475
design it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City,

00:05:23.475 --> 00:05:25.494
that's a true "sí se puede" moment.

00:05:25.494 --> 00:05:27.879
Really scholastic, if you ask me.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.150
But this is not a Getty image.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.726
That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:35.941
addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse,

00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:37.488
making them feel a part of it.

00:05:37.488 --> 00:05:39.842
That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,

00:05:39.842 --> 00:05:42.442
coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.160
And when the Bronx Borough President shows up

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.342
and the State Senator comes to our class,

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:50.086
believe you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.

00:05:50.086 --> 00:05:51.608
We are poised, ready, willing and able

00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:54.808
to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined.

00:05:54.808 --> 00:05:56.874
And when the local senator gets on the scale in public

00:05:56.874 --> 00:06:00.087
and says he's got to lose weight, so do I!

00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:02.952
And I tell you what, I'm doing it and so are the kids.

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:05.030
Okay? And then celebrities started.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.046
Produce Pete can't believe what we grow.

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:09.262
Lorna Sass came and donated books.

00:06:09.262 --> 00:06:11.494
Okay? We're feeding seniors.

00:06:11.494 --> 00:06:15.055
And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx,

00:06:15.055 --> 00:06:16.940
so did the international community.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.510
And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.686
the first international green roof conference.

00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:22.118
And that's just great.

00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:23.729
Except what about locally?

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.793
Well, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the Ground Up Campaign.

00:06:26.793 --> 00:06:29.153
Unbelievable! Through her, my kids,

00:06:29.153 --> 00:06:31.281
the most disenfranchised and marginalized,

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:35.050
were able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.907
That's triple bottom line! Okay?

00:06:37.907 --> 00:06:40.842
A year ago today, I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.

00:06:40.842 --> 00:06:44.306
I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:47.017
made sense, especially when the resources were free.

00:06:47.017 --> 00:06:48.793
So thank you all and I love them.

00:06:48.793 --> 00:06:51.811
They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health,

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.775
again, free resources, don't waste them.

00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:56.921
And what do you know? Six months later,

00:06:56.921 --> 00:07:00.020
my school and my kids were awarded the first ever

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.707
high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.

00:07:03.707 --> 00:07:05.833
The greenest class in New York City.

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:08.275
But more importantly is my kids learned to get,

00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:09.908
they learned to give.

00:07:09.908 --> 00:07:12.377
And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market,

00:07:12.377 --> 00:07:13.825
and started buying gifts for the homeless

00:07:13.825 --> 00:07:15.265
and for needy around the world.

00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:16.675
So we started giving back.

00:07:16.675 --> 00:07:19.174
And that's when I realized that the greening of America

00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:22.409
starts first with the pockets, then with the heart

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.627
and then with the mind.

00:07:23.627 --> 00:07:25.958
So we were onto something, and we're still onto something.

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.792
And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed,

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:31.025
because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.

00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:32.832
We're 3,000 strong right now.

00:07:32.832 --> 00:07:34.153
And what does it really do?

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.187
It teaches kids to re-vision their communities,

00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:39.233
so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this.

00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:41.376
And my kids, trained and certified --

00:07:41.376 --> 00:07:43.368
Ma, you get the tax abatement. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg --

00:07:43.368 --> 00:07:47.075
can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that,

00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:50.464
and that to me, people, is another true "sí se puede" moment.

00:07:50.464 --> 00:07:52.544
Now, how does it start? It starts in schools.

00:07:52.544 --> 00:07:54.264
No more little Knicks and little Nets.

00:07:54.264 --> 00:07:57.674
Group by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable,

00:07:57.674 --> 00:07:59.305
something you can aspire to.

00:07:59.305 --> 00:08:01.352
Okay? And these are my future farmers of America,

00:08:01.352 --> 00:08:03.825
growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street,

00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:05.552
the most migrant community in America.

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.640
When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.001
it's no wonder we get fruit like that.

00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:11.992
And I love it! And so do they.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:14.907
And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down.

00:08:14.907 --> 00:08:17.280
And that's a true "sí se puede" moment.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.657
And again, Brook Park feeds hundreds of people

00:08:20.657 --> 00:08:23.075
without a food stamp or a fingerprint.

00:08:23.075 --> 00:08:25.128
The poorest congressional district in America,

00:08:25.128 --> 00:08:28.312
the most migratory community in America, we can do this.

00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:32.016
Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions,

00:08:32.016 --> 00:08:34.320
moving kids into an economy they never imagined.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.784
Now, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends,

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:40.512
is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it.

00:08:40.512 --> 00:08:43.367
How does it start? Well, look at Jose's attention to detail.

00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:46.008
Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground,

00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:47.584
and not aisle 9 at the supermarket

00:08:47.584 --> 00:08:50.375
or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam.

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:53.075
And when Henry knows that green is good, so do I.

00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:56.129
And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.

00:08:56.129 --> 00:08:59.762
And most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids,

00:08:59.762 --> 00:09:02.109
you get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool,

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:05.541
and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible.

00:09:05.541 --> 00:09:08.130
God, I'm going to run out of time, so I've gotta keep it moving.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.330
But this is my weekly paycheck for kids; that's our green graffiti.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.995
This is what we're doing.

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:17.474
And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.817
Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other.

00:09:20.817 --> 00:09:22.977
I gotta tell you, I'm a protective parent.

00:09:22.977 --> 00:09:24.518
But those kids are the kids who are now putting

00:09:24.518 --> 00:09:26.394
pumpkin patches on top of trains.

00:09:26.394 --> 00:09:29.235
We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.941
We're also becoming children of the corn,

00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:33.545
creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness

00:09:33.545 --> 00:09:35.098
and window bottles out of garbage.

00:09:35.098 --> 00:09:36.897
Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer,

00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:40.258
but I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service.

00:09:40.258 --> 00:09:42.745
I expect them to be engaged, and man, are they!

00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:45.129
So that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:48.929
Where does it go? Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria.

00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:51.008
Or more importantly, to local shelters,

00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:53.361
where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.

00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:55.049
And we're stepping it up.

00:09:55.049 --> 00:09:57.611
No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm.

00:09:57.611 --> 00:10:00.890
And in his day, a million dollar gardens and incredible installations.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.530
Let me tell you something, people.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.436
This is a beautiful moment.

00:10:06.436 --> 00:10:09.621
Black field, brown field, toxic waste field, battlefield --

00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:12.476
we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere, on cement.

00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:16.397
And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame.

00:10:16.397 --> 00:10:18.429
We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring.

00:10:18.429 --> 00:10:21.797
And these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything.

00:10:21.797 --> 00:10:24.693
And again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse

00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:26.750
as this to do something as special as this,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.474
we're really creating a moment.

00:10:28.474 --> 00:10:31.190
Now, you may ask about these kids.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.371
Forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance.

00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:37.260
All start overage and under-credit.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.196
They are now, my first cohort is all in college, earning a living wage.

00:10:41.196 --> 00:10:43.477
The rest are scheduled to graduate this June.

00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:46.429
Happy kids, happy families, happy colleagues.

00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:50.565
Amazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County.

00:10:50.565 --> 00:10:52.828
Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint?

00:10:52.828 --> 00:10:55.016
I grow seven kinds of mint in my class.

00:10:55.016 --> 00:10:57.167
Mojitos, anybody? I'll be at Telepan later.

00:10:57.167 --> 00:11:00.362
But, understand this is my intellectual Viagra.

00:11:00.362 --> 00:11:03.562
Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta move quick, but understand this:

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:06.298
The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.450
is becoming home to the organic ones.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.386
My green [unclear] 25,000 pounds of vegetables,

00:11:11.386 --> 00:11:14.698
I'm growing organic citizens, engaged kids.

00:11:14.698 --> 00:11:17.408
So help us go from this to this.

00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:20.698
Self-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment,

00:11:20.698 --> 00:11:22.890
plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits,

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.746
while feeding people for pennies on the dollar.

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:28.362
Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity.

00:11:28.362 --> 00:11:31.627
So here in New York, I urge you, my fellow Americans,

00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:34.274
to help us make America great again.

00:11:34.274 --> 00:11:36.218
It's simple. Share your passion.

00:11:36.218 --> 00:11:38.643
It's real easy. Go see these two videos, please.

00:11:38.643 --> 00:11:41.542
One got us invited to the White House, one's a recent incarnation.

00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:44.176
And most importantly, get the biggest bully out of schools.

00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:46.281
This has got to go tomorrow.

00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:48.342
People, you can all do that.

00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:51.578
Keep kids out of stores that look like this.

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:53.275
Make them a healthy plate,

00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:56.026
especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso!

00:11:56.026 --> 00:11:59.362
Model good behavior. Get them to a green cart.

00:11:59.362 --> 00:12:01.578
Big kids love strawberries and bananas.

00:12:01.578 --> 00:12:04.594
Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC.

00:12:04.594 --> 00:12:07.826
Let them cook. Great lunch today, let them do culinary things.

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:09.745
But most importantly, just love them.

00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:12.059
Nothing works like unconditional love.

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:15.266
So, my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green.

00:12:15.266 --> 00:12:17.950
It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.975
35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment,

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:23.626
where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.

00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:28.013
Okay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me,

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:31.276
we have everything to gain and nothing to lose.

00:12:31.276 --> 00:12:33.528
So here, and at a time when we've gone from

00:12:33.528 --> 00:12:36.083
the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity,

00:12:36.083 --> 00:12:37.978
I urge you to do something.

00:12:37.978 --> 00:12:39.449
I urge you to do something.

00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:41.193
Right now, we're all tadpoles,

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:44.487
but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap.

00:12:44.487 --> 00:12:47.781
I don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.

00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:51.541
Join me. Use -- I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it.

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:54.175
We can do something here.

00:12:54.175 --> 00:12:56.845
And along the way, please take time to smell the flowers,

00:12:56.845 --> 00:12:58.382
especially if you and your students grew them.

00:12:58.382 --> 00:13:00.981
I'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine.

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:04.350
I've got to say thank you to my wife and family, for my kids,

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.108
thank you for coming every day, and for my colleagues,

00:13:06.108 --> 00:13:07.542
believing and supporting me.

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:09.675
We are growing our way into a new economy.

00:13:09.675 --> 00:13:12.876
Thank you, God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz.

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.042
Sí se puede!

00:13:15.042 --> 00:13:20.413
(Applause)
