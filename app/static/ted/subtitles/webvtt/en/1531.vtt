00:00:00.725 --> 00:00:03.836
Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:07.236
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:11.474
I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:15.268
In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.

00:00:15.268 --> 00:00:19.117
So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities,

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:22.918
which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:27.038
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:30.173
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa,

00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:32.878
education is just not readily accessible.

00:00:32.878 --> 00:00:35.853
In South Africa, the educational system was constructed

00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:38.726
in the days of apartheid for the white minority.

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:41.426
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:45.278
for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:49.158
That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:50.994
at the University of Johannesburg.

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:53.125
There were a handful of positions left open

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:56.094
from the standard admissions process, and the night before

00:00:56.094 --> 00:00:58.654
they were supposed to open that for registration,

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:02.706
thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:06.586
hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.894
When the gates opened, there was a stampede,

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:12.546
and 20 people were injured and one woman died.

00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:14.486
She was a mother who gave her life

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:18.549
trying to get her son a chance at a better life.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.706
But even in parts of the world like the United States

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:26.062
where education is available, it might not be within reach.

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:28.734
There has been much discussed in the last few years

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:30.723
about the rising cost of health care.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.365
What might not be quite as obvious to people

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:37.387
is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition

00:01:37.387 --> 00:01:39.867
has been increasing at almost twice the rate,

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:44.147
for a total of 559 percent since 1985.

00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:48.681
This makes education unaffordable for many people.

00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:52.482
Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education,

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:55.107
the doors of opportunity might not open.

00:01:55.107 --> 00:01:58.314
Only a little over half of recent college graduates

00:01:58.314 --> 00:02:00.627
in the United States who get a higher education

00:02:00.627 --> 00:02:04.090
actually are working in jobs that require that education.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.930
This, of course, is not true for the students

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.882
who graduate from the top institutions,

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:10.514
but for many others, they do not get the value

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:14.050
for their time and their effort.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.080
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.448
captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.

00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:24.568
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:28.467
when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.088
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:33.600
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.719
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.287
three big Stanford classes,

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:42.167
each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:45.551
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes,

00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:47.471
the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague

00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:49.200
and cofounder Andrew Ng.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.519
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.728
It's a Machine Learning class,

00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:56.246
and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.

00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:59.511
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.127
it had 100,000 people registered.

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:04.136
So to put that number in perspective,

00:03:04.136 --> 00:03:06.495
for Andrew to reach that same size audience

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:08.321
by teaching a Stanford class,

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.247
he would have to do that for 250 years.

00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:15.733
Of course, he'd get really bored.

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:18.470
So, having seen the impact of this,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.598
Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:25.718
to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.

00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:27.213
So we formed Coursera,

00:03:27.213 --> 00:03:30.350
whose goal is to take the best courses

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.667
from the best instructors at the best universities

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:37.695
and provide it to everyone around the world for free.

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:40.295
We currently have 43 courses on the platform

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:43.494
from four universities across a range of disciplines,

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:45.327
and let me show you a little bit of an overview

00:03:45.327 --> 00:03:48.605
of what that looks like.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:49.818
(Video) Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.

00:03:49.818 --> 00:03:51.698
Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:54.969
Scott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.377
We get unbelievable segregation.

00:03:57.377 --> 00:03:59.169
Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future,

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.547
you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.

00:04:01.547 --> 00:04:05.801
Mitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:09.466
RG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:12.537
Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.

00:04:12.537 --> 00:04:15.514
Paul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.

00:04:15.514 --> 00:04:19.137
Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.

00:04:19.137 --> 00:04:22.753
Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.

00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:26.440
Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.049
(Applause)

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:34.323
DK: It turns out, maybe not surprisingly,

00:04:34.323 --> 00:04:36.561
that students like getting the best content

00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:39.448
from the best universities for free.

00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:41.970
Since we opened the website in February,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.328
we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.

00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:48.480
We have 1.5 million enrollments,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.330
6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.246
so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.

00:04:56.246 --> 00:04:58.764
But it's not just about the numbers,

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:00.405
it's also about the people.

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:03.381
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India

00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:05.556
and would never have access in this case

00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:07.045
to a Stanford-quality course

00:05:07.045 --> 00:05:09.560
and would never be able to afford it.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.598
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two

00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:13.565
and wants to hone her skills

00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:16.700
so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.836
Or Ryan, who can't go to school,

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:21.701
because his immune deficient daughter

00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:25.084
can't be risked to have germs come into the house,

00:05:25.084 --> 00:05:26.924
so he couldn't leave the house.

00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:28.556
I'm really glad to say --

00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:30.808
recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan --

00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:32.740
that this story had a happy ending.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.643
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left --

00:05:34.643 --> 00:05:35.994
is doing much better now,

00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:40.192
and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.

00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:42.436
So what made these courses so different?

00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:46.156
After all, online course content has been available for a while.

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:49.868
What made it different was that this was real course experience.

00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.594
It started on a given day,

00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:55.228
and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis

00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:57.083
and do homework assignments.

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.874
And these would be real homework assignments

00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:02.178
for a real grade, with a real deadline.

00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:04.234
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.

00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:06.322
These are the spikes showing

00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:10.111
that procrastination is global phenomenon.

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:12.687
(Laughter)

00:06:12.687 --> 00:06:14.359
At the end of the course,

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:16.215
the students got a certificate.

00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:18.375
They could present that certificate

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:20.528
to a prospective employer and get a better job,

00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:22.588
and we know many students who did.

00:06:22.588 --> 00:06:24.507
Some students took their certificate

00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:27.629
and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.470
for actual college credit.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.684
So these students were really getting something meaningful

00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:34.518
for their investment of time and effort.

00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:37.073
Let's talk a little bit about some of the components

00:06:37.073 --> 00:06:38.965
that go into these courses.

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:41.593
The first component is that when you move away

00:06:41.593 --> 00:06:43.890
from the constraints of a physical classroom

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.730
and design content explicitly for an online format,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.258
you can break away from, for example,

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:51.673
the monolithic one-hour lecture.

00:06:51.673 --> 00:06:53.458
You can break up the material, for example,

00:06:53.458 --> 00:06:56.834
into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes,

00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:59.808
each of which represents a coherent concept.

00:06:59.808 --> 00:07:02.378
Students can traverse this material in different ways,

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:06.082
depending on their background, their skills or their interests.

00:07:06.082 --> 00:07:08.602
So, for example, some students might benefit

00:07:08.602 --> 00:07:11.362
from a little bit of preparatory material

00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:13.433
that other students might already have.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.873
Other students might be interested in a particular

00:07:15.873 --> 00:07:18.959
enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:22.194
So this format allows us to break away

00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:25.018
from the one-size-fits-all model of education,

00:07:25.018 --> 00:07:29.010
and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.353
Of course, we all know as educators

00:07:31.353 --> 00:07:34.713
that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.

00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:37.658
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:40.250
is that we need to have students

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.659
who practice with the material

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:45.815
in order to really understand it.

00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:49.083
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:51.615
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example,

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:54.447
demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,

00:07:54.447 --> 00:07:57.239
where students are just supposed to repeat

00:07:57.239 --> 00:07:58.639
what they already learned

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.559
gives considerably improved results

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:02.828
on various achievement tests down the line

00:08:02.828 --> 00:08:07.132
than many other educational interventions.

00:08:07.132 --> 00:08:10.094
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,

00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:12.348
as well as other forms of practice in many ways.

00:08:12.348 --> 00:08:16.492
For example, even our videos are not just videos.

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:18.535
Every few minutes, the video pauses

00:08:18.535 --> 00:08:20.686
and the students get asked a question.

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:22.907
(Video) SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting,

00:08:22.907 --> 00:08:25.999
status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:28.766
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:30.390
DK: So here the video pauses,

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.646
and the student types in the answer into the box

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:35.869
and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.

00:08:35.884 --> 00:08:36.753
(Laughter)

00:08:36.753 --> 00:08:38.763
So they get to try again,

00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:41.299
and this time they got it right.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.492
There's an optional explanation if they want.

00:08:43.492 --> 00:08:47.749
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.

00:08:47.749 --> 00:08:49.627
This is a kind of simple question

00:08:49.627 --> 00:08:51.708
that I as an instructor might ask in class,

00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:54.208
but when I ask that kind of a question in class,

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:55.508
80 percent of the students

00:08:55.508 --> 00:08:57.374
are still scribbling the last thing I said,

00:08:57.374 --> 00:09:00.695
15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:03.151
and then there's the smarty pants in the front row

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.510
who blurts out the answer

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.717
before anyone else has had a chance to think about it,

00:09:06.717 --> 00:09:09.589
and I as the instructor am terribly gratified

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:11.237
that somebody actually knew the answer.

00:09:11.237 --> 00:09:14.029
And so the lecture moves on before, really,

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:17.558
most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:20.165
Here, every single student

00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:22.949
has to engage with the material.

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:24.885
And of course these simple retrieval questions

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:26.547
are not the end of the story.

00:09:26.547 --> 00:09:29.517
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,

00:09:29.517 --> 00:09:31.870
and one also needs to provide the students with feedback

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.533
on those questions.

00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:36.421
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students

00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:39.503
if you do not have 10,000 TAs?

00:09:39.503 --> 00:09:41.857
The answer is, you need to use technology

00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:43.352
to do it for you.

00:09:43.352 --> 00:09:46.000
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.268
and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.

00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:50.795
In addition to multiple choice

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:53.948
and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video,

00:09:53.948 --> 00:09:57.208
we can also grade math, mathematical expressions

00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:59.160
as well as mathematical derivations.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.034
We can grade models, whether it's

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:04.210
financial models in a business class

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.194
or physical models in a science or engineering class

00:10:07.194 --> 00:10:10.938
and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.

00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:12.857
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple

00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:14.337
but fairly visual.

00:10:14.337 --> 00:10:16.814
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class,

00:10:16.814 --> 00:10:18.418
and the students are supposed to color-correct

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.010
that blurry red image.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.028
They're typing their program into the browser,

00:10:22.028 --> 00:10:26.086
and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.

00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:29.842
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that,

00:10:29.842 --> 00:10:32.201
and they can move on to the next assignment.

00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:35.349
This ability to interact actively with the material

00:10:35.349 --> 00:10:37.033
and be told when you're right or wrong

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:40.159
is really essential to student learning.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:42.434
Now, of course we cannot yet grade

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:45.268
the range of work that one needs for all courses.

00:10:45.268 --> 00:10:48.569
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:50.491
that is so essential in such disciplines

00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:54.088
as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.

00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:56.337
So we tried to convince, for example,

00:10:56.337 --> 00:10:57.953
some of our humanities faculty

00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:00.649
that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:02.840
That didn't go over really well.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.273
So we had to come up with a different solution.

00:11:05.273 --> 00:11:08.347
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.

00:11:08.347 --> 00:11:10.769
It turns out that previous studies show,

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:12.441
like this one by Saddler and Good,

00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:14.929
that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy

00:11:14.929 --> 00:11:18.143
for providing reproducible grades.

00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:19.913
It was tried only in small classes,

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:21.400
but there it showed, for example,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.882
that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis

00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:25.193
are actually very well correlated

00:11:25.193 --> 00:11:27.489
with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.

00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:30.649
What's even more surprising is that self-grades,

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:32.960
where the students grade their own work critically --

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.697
so long as you incentivize them properly

00:11:34.697 --> 00:11:36.635
so they can't give themselves a perfect score --

00:11:36.635 --> 00:11:39.826
are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.

00:11:39.826 --> 00:11:41.433
And so this is an effective strategy

00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:43.537
that can be used for grading at scale,

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:46.273
and is also a useful learning strategy for the students,

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:48.528
because they actually learn from the experience.

00:11:48.528 --> 00:11:53.177
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,

00:11:53.177 --> 00:11:55.681
where tens of thousands of students

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:56.879
are grading each other's work,

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:59.948
and quite successfully, I have to say.

00:11:59.948 --> 00:12:02.208
But this is not just about students

00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:05.249
sitting alone in their living room working through problems.

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:07.056
Around each one of our courses,

00:12:07.056 --> 00:12:09.216
a community of students had formed,

00:12:09.216 --> 00:12:11.096
a global community of people

00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:13.628
around a shared intellectual endeavor.

00:12:13.628 --> 00:12:16.280
What you see here is a self-generated map

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.241
from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course,

00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:22.000
where they have put themselves on a world map,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.960
and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.527
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.

00:12:29.527 --> 00:12:32.166
First of all, there was a question and answer forum,

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:34.310
where students would pose questions,

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.734
and other students would answer those questions.

00:12:36.734 --> 00:12:38.447
And the really amazing thing is,

00:12:38.447 --> 00:12:40.117
because there were so many students,

00:12:40.117 --> 00:12:42.482
it means that even if a student posed a question

00:12:42.482 --> 00:12:44.114
at 3 o'clock in the morning,

00:12:44.114 --> 00:12:45.696
somewhere around the world,

00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:47.770
there would be somebody who was awake

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.083
and working on the same problem.

00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:52.041
And so, in many of our courses,

00:12:52.041 --> 00:12:54.370
the median response time for a question

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.788
on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.

00:12:57.788 --> 00:13:02.365
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.706
(Laughter)

00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:05.648
And you can see from the student testimonials

00:13:05.648 --> 00:13:07.335
that students actually find

00:13:07.335 --> 00:13:09.856
that because of this large online community,

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:12.455
they got to interact with each other in many ways

00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:16.648
that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.

00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:18.992
Students also self-assembled,

00:13:18.992 --> 00:13:20.855
without any kind of intervention from us,

00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:22.758
into small study groups.

00:13:22.758 --> 00:13:25.120
Some of these were physical study groups

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.946
along geographical constraints

00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:29.668
and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.

00:13:29.668 --> 00:13:31.568
This is the San Francisco study group,

00:13:31.568 --> 00:13:33.887
but there were ones all over the world.

00:13:33.887 --> 00:13:35.919
Others were virtual study groups,

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:38.908
sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,

00:13:38.908 --> 00:13:40.352
and on the bottom left there,

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:44.148
you see our multicultural universal study group

00:13:44.148 --> 00:13:45.911
where people explicitly wanted to connect

00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:48.917
with people from other cultures.

00:13:48.917 --> 00:13:51.028
There are some tremendous opportunities

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:54.353
to be had from this kind of framework.

00:13:54.353 --> 00:13:58.007
The first is that it has the potential of giving us

00:13:58.007 --> 00:14:00.441
a completely unprecedented look

00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:02.730
into understanding human learning.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.193
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.

00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:10.202
You can collect every click, every homework submission,

00:14:10.202 --> 00:14:14.565
every forum post from tens of thousands of students.

00:14:14.565 --> 00:14:16.908
So you can turn the study of human learning

00:14:16.908 --> 00:14:18.841
from the hypothesis-driven mode

00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:21.699
to the data-driven mode, a transformation that,

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:24.740
for example, has revolutionized biology.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.164
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions

00:14:28.164 --> 00:14:30.044
like, what are good learning strategies

00:14:30.044 --> 00:14:32.740
that are effective versus ones that are not?

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.980
And in the context of particular courses,

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.517
you can ask questions

00:14:36.517 --> 00:14:39.772
like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common

00:14:39.772 --> 00:14:41.949
and how do we help students fix them?

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:43.373
So here's an example of that,

00:14:43.373 --> 00:14:45.389
also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:47.597
This is a distribution of wrong answers

00:14:47.597 --> 00:14:49.207
to one of Andrew's assignments.

00:14:49.207 --> 00:14:51.100
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.371
so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.

00:14:53.371 --> 00:14:57.149
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.

00:14:57.149 --> 00:14:59.555
The big cross at the top left

00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:01.703
is where 2,000 students

00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:04.748
gave the exact same wrong answer.

00:15:04.748 --> 00:15:07.075
Now, if two students in a class of 100

00:15:07.075 --> 00:15:08.362
give the same wrong answer,

00:15:08.362 --> 00:15:09.713
you would never notice.

00:15:09.713 --> 00:15:12.273
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,

00:15:12.273 --> 00:15:13.970
it's kind of hard to miss.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.162
So Andrew and his students went in,

00:15:16.162 --> 00:15:17.682
looked at some of those assignments,

00:15:17.682 --> 00:15:21.770
understood the root cause of the misconception,

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.290
and then they produced a targeted error message

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.539
that would be provided to every student

00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:28.718
whose answer fell into that bucket,

00:15:28.718 --> 00:15:30.802
which means that students who made that same mistake

00:15:30.802 --> 00:15:32.828
would now get personalized feedback

00:15:32.828 --> 00:15:37.227
telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:41.038
So this personalization is something that one can then build

00:15:41.038 --> 00:15:44.178
by having the virtue of large numbers.

00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:46.490
Personalization is perhaps

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.913
one of the biggest opportunities here as well,

00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:51.258
because it provides us with the potential

00:15:51.258 --> 00:15:53.948
of solving a 30-year-old problem.

00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:57.297
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,

00:15:57.297 --> 00:15:59.548
posed what's called the 2 sigma problem,

00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:02.610
which he observed by studying three populations.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.218
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.

00:16:06.218 --> 00:16:08.995
The second is a population of students that studied

00:16:08.995 --> 00:16:10.714
using a standard lecture-based classroom,

00:16:10.714 --> 00:16:12.794
but with a mastery-based approach,

00:16:12.794 --> 00:16:14.714
so the students couldn't move on to the next topic

00:16:14.714 --> 00:16:18.068
before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.

00:16:18.068 --> 00:16:20.362
And finally, there was a population of students

00:16:20.362 --> 00:16:24.890
that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.162
The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation,

00:16:28.162 --> 00:16:30.450
or sigma, in achievement scores better

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.844
than the standard lecture-based class,

00:16:32.844 --> 00:16:34.988
and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma

00:16:34.988 --> 00:16:36.818
improvement in performance.

00:16:36.818 --> 00:16:38.281
To understand what that means,

00:16:38.281 --> 00:16:40.114
let's look at the lecture-based classroom,

00:16:40.114 --> 00:16:43.033
and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.

00:16:43.033 --> 00:16:44.371
So in a lecture-based class,

00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:48.250
half the students are above that level and half are below.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.348
In the individual tutoring instruction,

00:16:50.348 --> 00:16:55.149
98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.

00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:59.069
Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students

00:16:59.069 --> 00:17:01.267
would be above average.

00:17:01.267 --> 00:17:04.690
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.089
Because we cannot afford, as a society,

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.161
to provide every student with an individual human tutor.

00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:12.410
But maybe we can afford to provide each student

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.429
with a computer or a smartphone.

00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:16.618
So the question is, how can we use technology

00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:19.993
to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,

00:17:19.993 --> 00:17:22.731
to the right side with the green curve?

00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:25.068
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer,

00:17:25.068 --> 00:17:26.473
because a computer doesn't get tired

00:17:26.473 --> 00:17:29.546
of showing you the same video five times.

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:32.797
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.828
we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.

00:17:35.828 --> 00:17:37.682
And even personalization

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.818
is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of,

00:17:39.818 --> 00:17:43.010
whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.274
or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.762
So the goal here is to try and push,

00:17:48.762 --> 00:17:52.259
and see how far we can get towards the green curve.

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:57.618
So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?

00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:00.610
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.155
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes

00:18:03.155 --> 00:18:04.858
go straight to the students' lecture notes,

00:18:04.858 --> 00:18:07.234
without passing through the brains of either."

00:18:07.234 --> 00:18:11.281
(Laughter)

00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.949
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.

00:18:13.949 --> 00:18:16.614
I think what he was complaining about is not

00:18:16.614 --> 00:18:19.364
universities but rather the lecture-based format

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:22.148
that so many universities spend so much time on.

00:18:22.148 --> 00:18:25.307
So let's go back even further, to Plutarch,

00:18:25.307 --> 00:18:27.534
who said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling,

00:18:27.534 --> 00:18:29.557
but wood that needs igniting."

00:18:29.557 --> 00:18:31.747
And maybe we should spend less time at universities

00:18:31.747 --> 00:18:34.318
filling our students' minds with content

00:18:34.318 --> 00:18:38.118
by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity,

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:41.373
their imagination and their problem-solving skills

00:18:41.373 --> 00:18:43.871
by actually talking with them.

00:18:43.871 --> 00:18:45.238
So how do we do that?

00:18:45.238 --> 00:18:48.669
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:51.118
So there's been many studies, including this one,

00:18:51.118 --> 00:18:53.198
that show that if you use active learning,

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:55.614
interacting with your students in the classroom,

00:18:55.614 --> 00:18:58.310
performance improves on every single metric --

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.759
on attendance, on engagement and on learning

00:19:00.759 --> 00:19:02.814
as measured by a standardized test.

00:19:02.814 --> 00:19:04.678
You can see, for example, that the achievement score

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:07.548
almost doubles in this particular experiment.

00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:11.949
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.

00:19:11.949 --> 00:19:16.526
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:18.429
to everyone around the world for free,

00:19:18.429 --> 00:19:21.250
what would that do? Three things.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.671
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right,

00:19:24.671 --> 00:19:26.037
where anyone around the world

00:19:26.037 --> 00:19:27.958
with the ability and the motivation

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.909
could get the skills that they need

00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:31.494
to make a better life for themselves,

00:19:31.494 --> 00:19:33.511
their families and their communities.

00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:36.142
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.

00:19:36.142 --> 00:19:38.093
It's a shame that for so many people,

00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:41.405
learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.

00:19:41.405 --> 00:19:43.886
By having this amazing content be available,

00:19:43.886 --> 00:19:46.629
we would be able to learn something new

00:19:46.629 --> 00:19:47.765
every time we wanted,

00:19:47.765 --> 00:19:49.094
whether it's just to expand our minds

00:19:49.094 --> 00:19:51.053
or it's to change our lives.

00:19:51.053 --> 00:19:54.198
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation,

00:19:54.198 --> 00:19:57.270
because amazing talent can be found anywhere.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.278
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs

00:20:00.278 --> 00:20:02.893
is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.

00:20:02.893 --> 00:20:05.549
And if we could offer that person an education,

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:07.905
they would be able to come up with the next big idea

00:20:07.905 --> 00:20:10.309
and make the world a better place for all of us.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.469
Thank you very much.

00:20:11.469 --> 00:20:19.052
(Applause)
