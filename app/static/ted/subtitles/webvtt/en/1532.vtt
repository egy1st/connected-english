WEBVTT

00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:05.321
Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.268
based in New York City.

00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:10.324
We're pale, gray creatures.

00:00:10.324 --> 00:00:12.384
We hide in dark, windowless rooms,

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:14.712
and generally avoid sunlight.

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:18.976
We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.956
and the impossible possible,

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:25.006
and we get criticized in the press all the time,

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.507
but some of us are actually talented artists

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:30.587
with years of experience

00:00:30.587 --> 00:00:34.491
and a real appreciation for images and photography.

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:39.655
On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:43.491
of the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan.

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:45.664
Soon after, an organization I volunteer with,

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:49.506
All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days,

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:52.338
working as part of the response efforts.

00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:54.634
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers,

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:56.298
knew we couldn't just sit at home,

00:00:56.298 --> 00:01:00.022
so I decided to join them for three weeks.

00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:03.667
On May the 13th, I made my way to the town of ÅŒfunato.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.347
It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture,

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:09.754
about 50,000 people,

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:12.559
one of the first that was hit by the wave.

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:15.370
The waters here have been recorded at reaching

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.072
over 24 meters in height,

00:01:18.072 --> 00:01:19.781
and traveled over two miles inland.

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:23.323
As you can imagine, the town had been devastated.

00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:25.854
We pulled debris from canals and ditches.

00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:29.285
We cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:31.783
ready for renovation and rehabilitation.

00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:36.235
We cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:38.454
from the local fish processing plant.

00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:41.863
We got dirty, and we loved it.

00:01:41.863 --> 00:01:44.980
For weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.220
had been finding similar things.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.166
They'd been finding photos and photo albums

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.799
and cameras and SD cards.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.015
And everyone was doing the same.

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:56.680
They were collecting them up, and handing them in to

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.853
various places around the different towns for safekeeping.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.969
Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.399
that these photos were such a huge part

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.399
of the personal loss these people had felt.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.193
As they had run from the wave, and for their lives,

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.713
absolutely everything they had,

00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:16.537
everything had to be left behind.

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:18.822
At the end of my first week there, I found myself

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:22.016
helping out in an evacuation center in the town.

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:25.351
I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen,

00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.657
the huge giant bathtubs.

00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:30.094
This happened to also be a place in the town where

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:33.098
the evacuation center was collecting the photos.

00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:35.023
This is where people were handing them in,

00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:37.531
and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me

00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:40.175
to help them start hand-cleaning them.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.224
Now, it was emotional and it was inspiring,

00:02:43.224 --> 00:02:46.982
and I've always heard about thinking outside the box,

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:50.393
but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.820
that something happened.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.873
As I looked through the photos, there were some

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.639
were over a hundred years old,

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.223
some still in the envelope from the processing lab,

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:02.113
I couldn't help but think as a retoucher

00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:04.938
that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:08.975
and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:11.362
So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook

00:03:11.362 --> 00:03:13.556
and asked a few of them, and by morning

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:17.035
the response had been so overwhelming and so positive,

00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:18.900
I knew we had to give it a go.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.754
So we started retouching photos.

00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:24.547
This was the very first.

00:03:24.547 --> 00:03:29.154
Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused

00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:31.340
that discoloration on the girl's face

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.943
had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy.

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.238
Otherwise, that little girl isn't going to look

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:39.938
like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic

00:03:39.938 --> 00:03:43.482
as having the photo damaged.

00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:49.810
(Applause)

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.023
Over time, more photos came in, thankfully,

00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:56.497
and more retouchers were needed,

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:59.435
and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:02.518
and within five days, 80 people wanted to help

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:04.487
from 12 different countries.

00:04:04.487 --> 00:04:06.856
Within two weeks, I had 150 people

00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:08.727
wanting to join in.

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:11.103
Within Japan, by July, we'd branched out

00:04:11.103 --> 00:04:13.715
to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata,

00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:16.109
further north to a town called Yamada.

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.377
Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment

00:04:19.377 --> 00:04:21.885
in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up,

00:04:21.885 --> 00:04:24.258
where people were reclaiming their photos.

00:04:24.258 --> 00:04:28.090
The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.964
but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo,

00:04:31.964 --> 00:04:33.873
they could give it to us, have it scanned,

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.887
uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded

00:04:35.887 --> 00:04:38.520
by a gaijin, a stranger,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.623
somewhere on the other side of the globe,

00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:42.987
and it'd start being fixed.

00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:46.125
The time it took, however, to get it back

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:48.172
is a completely different story,

00:04:48.172 --> 00:04:50.760
and it depended obviously on the damage involved.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.493
It could take an hour. It could take weeks.

00:04:52.493 --> 00:04:54.597
It could take months.

00:04:54.597 --> 00:04:58.714
The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn,

00:04:58.714 --> 00:05:02.416
or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:04.846
and detail that the water hadn't damaged.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:07.591
It was very time-consuming.

00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:10.212
Now, all these photos had been damaged by water,

00:05:10.212 --> 00:05:13.543
submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria,

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:16.984
in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:18.928
is going to continue to damage them,

00:05:18.928 --> 00:05:22.044
so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project.

00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:25.014
We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned,

00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:28.030
dry and reclaimed.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.482
Now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning.

00:05:30.482 --> 00:05:33.719
We had an amazing local woman who guided us.

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.912
It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos.

00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:39.697
As my team leader Wynne once said,

00:05:39.697 --> 00:05:41.643
it's like doing a tattoo on someone.

00:05:41.643 --> 00:05:45.174
You don't get a chance to mess it up.

00:05:45.174 --> 00:05:48.157
The lady who brought us these photos was lucky,

00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:50.387
as far as the photos go.

00:05:50.387 --> 00:05:52.769
She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.188
when she realized she was doing more damage.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.439
She also had duplicates.

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.532
Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise

00:06:00.532 --> 00:06:02.636
would have been completely impossible to fix,

00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:05.494
we could just put them together in one good photo,

00:06:05.494 --> 00:06:07.946
and remake the whole photo.

00:06:07.946 --> 00:06:10.624
When she collected the photos from us,

00:06:10.624 --> 00:06:12.987
she shared a bit of her story with us.

00:06:12.987 --> 00:06:15.947
Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues

00:06:15.947 --> 00:06:17.937
at a local fire department in the debris

00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:21.053
a long way from where the home had once stood,

00:06:21.053 --> 00:06:23.228
and they'd recognized him.

00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:25.509
The day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.036
of making sure the tsunami gates were closed.

00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:31.164
He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded.

00:06:31.164 --> 00:06:34.606
Her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys

00:06:34.606 --> 00:06:36.796
were both at school, separate schools.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:39.364
One of them got caught up in the water.

00:06:39.364 --> 00:06:41.311
It took her a week to find them all again

00:06:41.311 --> 00:06:43.708
and find out that they had all survived.

00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:46.638
The day I gave her the photos also happened to be

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:50.581
her youngest son's 14th birthday.

00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:54.254
For her, despite all of this, those photos

00:06:54.254 --> 00:06:56.965
were the perfect gift back to him,

00:06:56.965 --> 00:07:00.061
something he could look at again, something he remembered from before

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.328
that wasn't still scarred from that day in March

00:07:04.328 --> 00:07:07.143
when absolutely everything else in his life had changed

00:07:07.143 --> 00:07:11.292
or been destroyed.

00:07:11.292 --> 00:07:13.149
After six months in Japan,

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:16.299
1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:18.549
hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:21.789
over 135,000 photographs,

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:27.493
the large majority â€” (Applause) â€”

00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:30.723
a large majority of which did actually find their home again,

00:07:30.723 --> 00:07:33.478
importantly.

00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:36.651
Over five hundred volunteers around the globe

00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:41.309
helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back,

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:43.559
fully restored and retouched.

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:46.012
During this time, we hadn't really spent more than

00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:48.858
about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials,

00:07:48.858 --> 00:07:52.188
most of which was printer inks.

00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:55.075
We take photos constantly.

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:57.644
A photo is a reminder of someone or something,

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.502
a place, a relationship, a loved one.

00:08:00.502 --> 00:08:03.011
They're our memory-keepers and our histories,

00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:05.723
the last thing we would grab

00:08:05.723 --> 00:08:08.231
and the first thing you'd go back to look for.

00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:10.335
That's all this project was about,

00:08:10.335 --> 00:08:13.766
about restoring those little bits of humanity,

00:08:13.766 --> 00:08:15.878
giving someone that connection back.

00:08:15.878 --> 00:08:21.571
When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this,

00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:23.655
it makes a huge difference

00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:26.440
in the lives of the person receiving it.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.243
The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:33.314
For some of them, it's given them a connection

00:08:33.314 --> 00:08:35.846
to something bigger, giving something back,

00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:37.725
using their talents on something

00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.145
other than skinny models and perfect skin.

00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:43.758
I would like to conclude by reading an email

00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:46.188
I got from one of them, Cindy,

00:08:46.188 --> 00:08:50.790
the day I finally got back from Japan after six months.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.545
"As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals

00:08:54.545 --> 00:08:57.694
and the stories represented in the images.

00:08:57.694 --> 00:09:01.181
One in particular, a photo of women of all ages,

00:09:01.181 --> 00:09:05.557
from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby,

00:09:05.557 --> 00:09:09.079
struck a chord, because a similar photo from my family,

00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:11.531
my grandmother and mother, myself,

00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:14.940
and newborn daughter, hangs on our wall.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.094
Across the globe, throughout the ages,

00:09:18.094 --> 00:09:21.983
our basic needs are just the same, aren't they?"

00:09:21.983 --> 00:09:24.300
Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.766
(Applause)
