00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.770
So, well, I do applied math,

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.294
and this is a peculiar problem

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:06.467
for anyone who does applied math, is that

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:08.400
we are like management consultants.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.346
No one knows what the hell we do.

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:12.620
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.913
to try and explain to you what I do.

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:18.234
So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:21.916
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:23.064
you will see later on.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.754
Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:28.668
and a high level of skill,

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:31.199
and probably a level of initial suitability

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.046
that may well have a genetic component to it.

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:36.439
Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:38.526
gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:40.849
as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:43.816
a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:46.870
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.814
However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:53.262
who have the disease, and they have to live with

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:55.830
incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.687
and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,

00:00:57.687 --> 00:01:00.070
so what we need are objective tools

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.127
to detect the disease before it's too late.

00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:05.681
We need to be able to measure progression objectively,

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:08.854
and ultimately, the only way we're going to know

00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:11.046
when we actually have a cure is when we have

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:14.444
an objective measure that can answer that for sure.

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:17.294
But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease

00:01:17.294 --> 00:01:19.647
and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.876
so there's no simple blood test that you can do,

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:23.678
and the best that we have is like

00:01:23.678 --> 00:01:25.919
this 20-minute neurologist test.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.377
You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,

00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:31.134
and that means that, outside the clinical trials,

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:33.862
it's just never done. It's never done.

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:36.939
But what if patients could do this test at home?

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.037
Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:43.291
and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.211
No expensive staff time required.

00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.629
Takes about $300, by the way,

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:48.622
in the neurologist's clinic to do it.

00:01:48.622 --> 00:01:51.303
So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way

00:01:51.303 --> 00:01:52.817
in which we can try to achieve this,

00:01:52.817 --> 00:01:54.625
because, you see, in one sense, at least,

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.881
we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.

00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:01.636
So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.

00:02:01.636 --> 00:02:04.865
Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:08.329
and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.543
because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs

00:02:10.543 --> 00:02:12.838
when we make sounds, and we all actually

00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:15.134
have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.847
And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.

00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:20.432
I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.814
From the sound, we can actually track

00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:25.095
the vocal fold position as it vibrates,

00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:27.638
and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,

00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:30.419
so too are the vocal organs.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.299
So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.997
irregular vocal fold tremor.

00:02:33.997 --> 00:02:35.165
We see all the same symptoms.

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:38.095
We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:40.199
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.432
after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.

00:02:42.432 --> 00:02:45.279
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.495
in some cases, but with any digital microphone,

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:51.040
and using precision voice analysis software

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.449
in combination with the latest in machine learning,

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.027
which is very advanced by now,

00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:57.913
we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies

00:02:57.913 --> 00:03:00.794
on a continuum between health and disease

00:03:00.794 --> 00:03:03.390
using voice signals alone.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.704
So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against

00:03:05.704 --> 00:03:07.854
expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:11.836
The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:14.840
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.142
And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,

00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:20.469
voice-based tests are non-expert.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.461
That means they can be self-administered.

00:03:22.461 --> 00:03:25.041
They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:27.335
They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:29.775
When something becomes ultra-low cost,

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:32.071
it becomes massively scalable.

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:35.746
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:38.172
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:40.484
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.

00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:42.804
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:46.909
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.024
and we can make population-scale screening

00:03:49.024 --> 00:03:50.620
feasible for the first time.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.822
We have the opportunity to start to search

00:03:52.822 --> 00:03:56.363
for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.

00:03:56.363 --> 00:03:59.121
So, taking the first steps towards this today,

00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:01.247
we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.

00:04:01.247 --> 00:04:03.479
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.407
to record a very large number of voices worldwide

00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:08.547
to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:10.247
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters

00:04:10.247 --> 00:04:11.857
of a billion people on the planet.

00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:14.934
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:17.073
and leave recordings, a few cents each,

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:19.263
and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit

00:04:19.263 --> 00:04:22.806
six percent of our target just in eight hours.

00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:26.557
Thank you. (Applause)

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:32.877
(Applause)

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:36.452
Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:39.228
let's say, 10,000 people,

00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:42.082
you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:43.767
What are you going to get out of those samples?

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:45.597
Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,

00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:47.254
during the call you have to indicate whether or not

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:48.521
you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.028
ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.

00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:53.745
But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:57.153
from all different circumstances, and it's getting it

00:04:57.153 --> 00:04:59.058
in different circumstances that matter because then

00:04:59.058 --> 00:05:02.442
we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,

00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:04.603
and looking for the actual markers of the disease.

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:07.100
TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.294
ML: It's much better than that.

00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:10.014
Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,

00:05:10.014 --> 00:05:11.884
because he's done some fantastic work,

00:05:11.884 --> 00:05:15.654
and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,

00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:19.044
which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.

00:05:19.044 --> 00:05:20.620
TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.821
So what that means is that people will be able to â€”

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:24.673
ML: (Laughs)

00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:26.579
TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:29.651
and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,

00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:32.521
record their voice, and then their doctor can check up

00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:35.202
on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:36.172
ML: Absolutely.

00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:37.915
TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:43.072
ML: Thanks, Tom. (Applause)
