WEBVTT

00:00:00.758 --> 00:00:04.049
We're going to begin in 1964.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.022
Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career

00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:09.183
is just reaching its pinnacle.

00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:11.624
He's been christened the voice of a generation,

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:14.084
and he's churning out classic songs

00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:16.047
at a seemingly impossible rate,

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:20.498
but there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:24.237
that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:28.377
2004. Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse,

00:00:28.377 --> 00:00:30.290
takes the Beatles' "White Album,"

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.067
combines it with Jay-Z's "The Black Album"

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:33.891
to create "The Grey Album."

00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:35.810
"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.570
and the Beatles' record company sends out countless

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.810
cease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.691
and dilution of our valuable property."

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:47.683
Now, "The Grey Album" is a remix.

00:00:47.683 --> 00:00:50.080
It is new media created from old media.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.665
It was made using these three techniques:

00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:55.907
copy, transform and combine.

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:57.829
It's how you remix. You take existing songs,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.549
you chop them up, you transform the pieces,

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.389
you combine them back together again,

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.366
and you've got a new song, but that new song

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.100
is clearly comprised of old songs.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.413
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing.

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:12.457
I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.

00:01:12.457 --> 00:01:14.268
I think everything is a remix,

00:01:14.268 --> 00:01:18.959
and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.952
All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear

00:01:21.952 --> 00:01:24.973
where some of Dylan's early songs came from.

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:26.850
We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.056
All right, this first song you're going to hear

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:30.470
is "Nottamun Town." It's a traditional folk tune.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.051
After that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War."

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:37.958
Jean Ritchie: ♫ In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, ♫


00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:44.556
♫ not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down. ♫

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:48.830
Bob Dylan: ♫ Come you masters of war, ♫

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:57.435
♫ you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, ♫

00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:00.504
♫ You that build all the bombs. ♫

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:02.426
Kirby Ferguson: Okay, so that's the same basic melody

00:02:02.426 --> 00:02:05.585
and overall structure. This next one is "The Patriot Game,"

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.577
by Dominic Behan. Alongside that,

00:02:07.577 --> 00:02:09.851
you're going to hear "With God on Our Side," by Dylan.

00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:15.109
Dominic Behan: ♫ Come all ye young rebels, ♫

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.639
♫ and list while I sing, ♫

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:27.851
♫ for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. ♫

00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:33.663
BD: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫

00:02:33.663 --> 00:02:38.191
♫ my age it means less, ♫

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:45.010
♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.636
KF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:49.076
he must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it,

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:50.635
then when the song kind of bubbled back up

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:52.946
in his brain, he just thought it was his song.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.178
Last one, this is "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons,"

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:55.738
another traditional folk tune.

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:58.035
Alongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."

00:02:58.035 --> 00:02:59.860
This one's more about the lyric.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.751
Paul Clayton: ♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:14.615
♫ darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. ♫

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:20.560
BD: ♫ It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.212
♫ if you don't know by now, ♫

00:03:24.212 --> 00:03:29.603
♫ and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫


00:03:29.603 --> 00:03:32.490
♫ it'll never do somehow. ♫

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.762
KF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these.

00:03:34.762 --> 00:03:36.776
It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies

00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:39.319
Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.175
This is pretty typical among folk singers.

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:43.538
Here's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie.

00:03:43.538 --> 00:03:45.068
"The worlds are the important thing.

00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:46.900
Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.576
sing high when they sing low,

00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:51.784
sing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."

00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:55.781
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.728
And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here,

00:03:57.728 --> 00:04:00.335
and I'm sure you all recognize the results.

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:06.252
(Music)

00:04:06.252 --> 00:04:08.647
We know this tune, right? We know it?

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:10.060
Actually you don't.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.744
That is "When the World's on Fire," a very old melody,

00:04:12.744 --> 00:04:15.005
in this case performed by the Carter Family.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.683
Guthrie adapted it into "This Land Is Your Land."

00:04:17.683 --> 00:04:22.003
So, Bob Dylan, like all folk singers, he copied melodies,

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:24.725
he transformed them, he combined them with new lyrics

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:27.122
which were frequently their own concoction

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:29.383
of previous stuff.

00:04:29.383 --> 00:04:33.046
Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:35.769
to this notion that we build on the work of others.

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:38.436
Instead, these laws and laws around the world

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:42.158
use the rather awkward analogy of property.

00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:44.601
Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property,

00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:46.910
but it's property that we're all building on,

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.399
and creations can only take root and grow

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.115
once that ground has been prepared.

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:54.961
Henry Ford once said, "I invented nothing new.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.964
I simply assembled the discoveries of other men

00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.551
behind whom were centuries of work.

00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:01.934
Progress happens when all the factors that make for it

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:05.964
are ready and then it is inevitable."

00:05:05.964 --> 00:05:10.509
2007. The iPhone makes it debut.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.176
Apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early,

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:15.673
but its time was approaching because its core technology

00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:17.719
had been evolving for decades.

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.701
That's multi-touch, controlling a device

00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:21.478
by touching its display.

00:05:21.478 --> 00:05:23.897
Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch

00:05:23.897 --> 00:05:26.137
and making a rather foreboding joke.

00:05:26.137 --> 00:05:28.940
Steve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.200
called multi-touch.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.653
You can do multi-fingered gestures on it,

00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:37.264
and boy have we patented it. (Laughter)

00:05:37.264 --> 00:05:41.430
KF: Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.451
This is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.

00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:45.919
This is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch.

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.670
It's the same animal, at least.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.437
Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this

00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:51.263
newfangled technology.

00:05:51.263 --> 00:05:53.431
Jeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything --

00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:55.637
isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton

00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:57.286
have been playing around with it in the '80s.

00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:00.485
The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.547
right now other than probably its newfound accessibility.

00:06:03.547 --> 00:06:05.480
KF: So he's pretty frank about it not being new.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.023
So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented.

00:06:08.023 --> 00:06:10.160
It's the small parts of it that are,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.464
and it's in these small details where

00:06:11.464 --> 00:06:14.582
we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent:

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:17.743
to promote the progress of useful arts.

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:20.927
Here is the first ever slide-to-unlock.

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:23.796
That is all there is to it. Apple has patented this.

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:26.608
It's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize

00:06:26.608 --> 00:06:30.544
what it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:33.481
by sliding an icon with your finger. (Laughter)

00:06:33.481 --> 00:06:36.498
I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.

00:06:36.498 --> 00:06:39.347
Now, can someone own this idea?

00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:41.777
Now, back in the '80s, there were no software patents,

00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:44.938
and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface.

00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:47.856
What if they had patented pop-up menus,

00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:52.280
scrollbars, the desktop with icons that look like folders

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.267
and sheets of paper?

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:56.616
Would a young and inexperienced Apple

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:59.485
have survived the legal assault from a much larger

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:03.565
and more mature company like Xerox?

00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:06.012
Now, this idea that everything is a remix might sound

00:07:06.012 --> 00:07:10.139
like common sense until you're the one getting remixed.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:11.789
For example ...

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:13.028
SJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying.

00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:16.585
He said, "Good artists copy. Great artists steal."

00:07:16.585 --> 00:07:18.907
And we have, you know,

00:07:18.907 --> 00:07:22.035
always been shameless about stealing great ideas.

00:07:22.035 --> 00:07:23.933
KF: Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010.

00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:26.842
"I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product."

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:28.384
(Laughter)

00:07:28.384 --> 00:07:32.023
"I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this." (Laughter)

00:07:32.023 --> 00:07:35.527
Okay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.

00:07:35.527 --> 00:07:37.878
(Laughter)

00:07:37.878 --> 00:07:41.486
Now, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion

00:07:41.486 --> 00:07:43.705
We have a strong predisposition towards protecting

00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:45.634
what we feel is ours.

00:07:45.634 --> 00:07:47.552
We have no such aversion towards copying

00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:50.285
what other people have, because we do that nonstop.

00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:52.760
So here's the sort of equation we're looking at.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.417
We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property,

00:07:55.417 --> 00:07:58.202
plus massive rewards or settlements

00:07:58.202 --> 00:08:00.399
in infringement cases, plus huge legal fees

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:02.062
to protect yourself in court,

00:08:02.062 --> 00:08:05.566
plus cognitive biases against perceived loss.

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:07.709
And the sum looks like this.

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:10.532
That is the last four years of lawsuits

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:13.098
in the realm of smartphones.

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:18.869
Is this promoting the progress of useful arts?

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:24.637
1983. Bob Dylan is 42 years old, and his time

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:27.963
in the cultural spotlight is long since past.

00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:30.572
He records a song called "Blind Willie McTell,"

00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:32.758
named after the blues singer, and the song

00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:36.428
is a voyage through the past, through a much darker time,

00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:39.578
but a simpler one, a time when musicians like Willie McTell

00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:42.098
had few illusions about what they did.

00:08:42.098 --> 00:08:44.348
"I jump 'em from other writers

00:08:44.348 --> 00:08:46.913
but I arrange 'em my own way."

00:08:46.913 --> 00:08:48.630
I think this is mostly what we do.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.996
Our creativity comes from without, not from within.

00:08:51.996 --> 00:08:54.917
We are not self-made. We are dependent on one another,

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.742
and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace

00:08:57.742 --> 00:09:00.576
of mediocrity and derivativeness.

00:09:00.576 --> 00:09:03.209
It's a liberation from our misconceptions,

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.292
and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:09.027
and to simply begin.

00:09:09.027 --> 00:09:11.977
Thank you so much. It was an honor to be here.

00:09:11.977 --> 00:09:14.754
Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:18.138
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:18.138 --> 00:09:21.479
Thank you. (Applause)
