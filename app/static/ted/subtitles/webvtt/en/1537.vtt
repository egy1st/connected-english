00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:03.470
Two years ago, I was invited as an artist

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.330
to participate in an exhibition commemorating

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.988
100 years of Islamic art in Europe.

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:11.428
The curator had only one condition:

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.918
I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:18.029
Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab,

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.671
or a human being living in the world in 2010,

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:24.636
I only had one thing to say:

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:27.446
I wanted to say no.

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:29.662
And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no,

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.982
and a thousand times no."

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:35.778
So I decided to look for a thousand different noes.

00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:37.624
on everything ever produced

00:00:37.624 --> 00:00:42.305
under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years,

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:46.186
from Spain to the borders of China.

00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:48.185
I collected my findings in a book,

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:51.629
placed them chronologically, stating the name,

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.099
the patron, the medium and the date.

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:58.298
Now, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation,

00:00:58.298 --> 00:01:01.905
which stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany,

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:05.419
in September of 2010.

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:11.323
Now, in January, 2011, the revolution started,

00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:14.146
and life stopped for 18 days,

00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:15.605
and on the 12th of February,

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:18.593
we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo,

00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:22.626
believing that the revolution had succeeded.

00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:26.282
Nine months later I found myself spraying messages

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:30.482
in Tahrir Square. The reason for this act

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:34.241
was this image that I saw in my newsfeed.

00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:37.137
I did not feel that I could live in a city

00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:39.144
where people were being killed

00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:42.112
and thrown like garbage on the street.

00:01:42.112 --> 00:01:44.438
So I took one "no" off a tombstone from

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:48.023
the Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it:

00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:49.690
"no to military rule."

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.706
And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.

00:01:52.706 --> 00:01:55.737
But that led to a series of no, coming out of the book

00:01:55.737 --> 00:01:58.706
like ammunition, and adding messages to them,

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:01.106
and I started spraying them on the walls.

00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:03.812
So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you.

00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:06.410
No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.316
should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator.

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:14.462
No to violence: Ramy Essam came to Tahrir

00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:16.330
on the second day of the revolution,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.790
and he sat there with this guitar, singing.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.079
One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.105
No to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:30.856
on the 28th of January,

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:34.202
and he lost his left eye on the 19th of November,

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:37.688
by two different snipers.

00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:41.013
No to killing, in this case no to killing men of religion,

00:02:41.013 --> 00:02:44.199
because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.561
on December 16th, during a demonstration,

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:51.421
leaving behind three orphans and a widow.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.704
No to burning books. The Institute of Egypt was burned

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:58.924
on December 17th, a huge cultural loss.

00:02:58.924 --> 00:03:01.313
No to stripping the people,

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:04.807
and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame

00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:08.757
as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped

00:03:08.757 --> 00:03:12.758
and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads,

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.910
"Long live a peaceful revolution,"

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.430
because we will never retaliate with violence.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.845
No to barrier walls. On February 5th,

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:26.038
concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:31.719
to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.164
Now, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story

00:03:34.164 --> 00:03:36.966
of one wall in Cairo.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:41.273
A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank

00:03:41.273 --> 00:03:43.115
on a wall. It's one to one.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:46.979
In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.093
with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby,

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:52.947
there's no problem with this visual.

00:03:52.947 --> 00:03:56.861
After acts of violence, another artist came,

00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.334
painted blood, protesters being run over by the tank,

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:04.380
demonstrators, and a message that read,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.727
"Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face,

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.446
the face of every martyr. I exist."

00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:14.347
Authority comes, paints the wall white,

00:04:14.347 --> 00:04:16.989
leaves the tank and adds a message:

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.018
"Army and people, one hand. Egypt for Egyptians."

00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:25.653
Another artist comes, paints the head of the military

00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:29.015
as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:31.707
in front of the tank.

00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:35.708
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank,

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.336
leaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:39.943
just to hide the face of the monster.

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:43.836
So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit,

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:46.261
on the tank, and on the whole wall,

00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:48.335
and this is how it stands today

00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:50.114
until further notice. (Laughter)

00:04:50.114 --> 00:04:54.380
Now, I want to leave you with a final no.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.995
I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper

00:04:57.995 --> 00:05:03.224
in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of

00:05:03.224 --> 00:05:05.538
Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.323
The message reads,

00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:13.732
[Arabic]

00:05:13.732 --> 00:05:17.409
"You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring."

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.264
Thank you. (Applause)

00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:30.285
(Applause)

00:05:30.285 --> 00:05:36.047
Thank you. Shukran. (Applause)
