WEBVTT

00:00:00.586 --> 00:00:03.424
The will to live life differently can start

00:00:03.424 --> 00:00:06.870
in some of the most unusual places.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.816
This is where I come from, Todmorden.

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:10.836
It's a market town in the north of England,

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:13.507
15,000 people, between Leeds and Manchester,

00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:15.580
fairly normal market town.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.750
It used to look like this,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.498
and now it's more like this,

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:24.223
with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:28.940
We call it propaganda gardening. (Laughter)

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.955
Corner row railway, station car park,

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:35.707
front of a health center, people's front gardens,

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:39.244
and even in front of the police station. (Laughter)

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:42.234
We've got edible canal towpaths,

00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:44.400
and we've got sprouting cemeteries.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.901
The soil is extremely good. (Laughter)

00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:53.144
We've even invented a new form of tourism.

00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:56.751
It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not,

00:00:56.751 --> 00:01:00.675
people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds,

00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:03.659
even when there's not much growing. (Laughter)

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.289
But it starts a conversation. (Laughter)

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.297
And, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored. (Laughter)

00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:16.114
We're doing it because we want to start a revolution.

00:01:16.114 --> 00:01:17.432
We tried to answer this simple question:

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:20.322
Can you find a unifying language that cuts across age

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:24.539
and income and culture that will help people themselves

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.200
find a new way of living,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.325
see spaces around them differently,

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:30.928
think about the resources they use differently,

00:01:30.928 --> 00:01:32.921
interact differently?

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:35.290
Can we find that language?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.257
And then, can we replicate those actions?

00:01:39.257 --> 00:01:42.015
And the answer would appear to be yes,

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:45.418
and the language would appear to be food.

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:47.437
So, three and a half years ago, a few of us

00:01:47.437 --> 00:01:49.056
sat around a kitchen table and

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:52.424
we just invented the whole thing. (Laughter)

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:55.661
(Applause)

00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:58.252
We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting.

00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:00.565
We did not consult. We did not write a report.

00:02:00.565 --> 00:02:03.140
Enough of all that. (Laughter)

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.158
And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden,

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:09.104
look, let's imagine that our town

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:10.860
is focused around three plates:

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.084
a community plate, the way we live our everyday lives;

00:02:13.084 --> 00:02:16.132
a learning plate, what we teach our kids in school

00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:18.893
and what new skills we share amongst ourselves;

00:02:18.893 --> 00:02:22.012
and business, what we do with the pound in our pocket

00:02:22.012 --> 00:02:23.833
and which businesses we choose to support.

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:26.640
Now, let's imagine those plates agitated

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.280
with community actions around food.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.521
If we start one of those community plates spinning,

00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:34.905
that's really great, that really starts to empower people,

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:36.992
but if we can then spin that community plate

00:02:36.992 --> 00:02:39.888
with the learning plate, and then spin it with the business plate,

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:43.624
we've got a real show there, we've got some action theater.

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:46.969
We're starting to build resilience ourselves.

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.360
We're starting to reinvent community ourselves,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.827
and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:59.138
(Applause)

00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:01.930
And here's the thing as well.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.346
We've not asked anybody's permission to do this,

00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:06.639
we're just doing it. (Laughter)

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.400
And we are certainly not waiting for that check

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.138
to drop through the letterbox before we start,

00:03:11.138 --> 00:03:13.470
and most importantly of all, we are not daunted

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.322
by the sophisticated arguments that say,

00:03:15.322 --> 00:03:19.218
"These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems,"

00:03:19.218 --> 00:03:22.886
because I have seen the power of small actions,

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:24.957
and it is awesome.

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:28.070
So, back to the public meeting. (Laughter)

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.959
We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds,

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.667
and then the room exploded.

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:36.555
I have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:39.937
And it's been the same in every single room, in every town

00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:41.492
that we've ever told our story.

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:45.836
People are ready and respond to the story of food.

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:48.093
They want positive actions they can engage in,

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:50.692
and in their bones, they know it's time

00:03:50.692 --> 00:03:52.581
to take personal responsibility

00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:55.152
and invest in more kindness to each other

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:58.075
and to the environment.

00:03:58.075 --> 00:04:01.389
And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago,

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.639
it's been a heck of a roller coaster.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.535
We started with a seed swap, really simple stuff,

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:09.784
and then we took an area of land, a strip on the side

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:12.286
of our main road, which was a dog toilet, basically,

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:15.640
and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.926
We took the corner of the car park in the station

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:19.661
that you saw, and we made vegetable beds

00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:23.185
for everybody to share and pick from themselves.

00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:24.494
We went to the doctors. We've just had

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:27.399
a 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden,

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:30.087
and for some reason that I cannot comprehend,

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:33.880
it has been surrounded by prickly plants. (Laughter)

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.969
So we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?"

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.323
They said, "Absolutely fine, provided you get planning permission

00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:41.245
and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate,"

00:04:41.245 --> 00:04:44.035
so we did — (Laughter) — and now there are fruit trees

00:04:44.035 --> 00:04:47.330
and bushes and herbs and vegetables

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.560
around that doctor's surgery.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.836
And there's been lots of other examples, like the corn

00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:54.692
that was in front of the police station,

00:04:54.692 --> 00:04:56.509
and the old people's home that we've planted it with food

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.481
that they can pick and grow.

00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.191
But it isn't just about growing,

00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.736
because we all are part of this jigsaw.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:05.610
It's about taking those artistic people in your community

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.843
and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds

00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:09.914
to explain to people what's growing there,

00:05:09.914 --> 00:05:12.130
because there's so many people that don't really recognize

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.018
a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic

00:05:14.018 --> 00:05:16.090
with a bit of an instruction packet on the top. (Laughter)

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.986
So we have some people who designed these things,

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:21.003
"If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this,

00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:22.980
help yourself."

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.849
This is about sharing and investing in kindness.

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.706
And for those people that don't want to do either

00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:29.705
of those things, maybe they can cook,

00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:32.578
so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street,

00:05:32.578 --> 00:05:34.811
or in the pub, or in the church,

00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:36.443
or wherever people are living their lives.

00:05:36.443 --> 00:05:38.985
This is about us going to the people and saying,

00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:41.394
"We are all part of the local food jigsaw,

00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:44.049
we are all part of a solution."

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:46.265
And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists

00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.973
and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic,

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.549
we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:53.953
So we invented, without asking, of course,

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:56.059
the Incredible Edible Green Route.

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:58.784
And this is a route of exhibition gardens,

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:03.495
and edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story

00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:06.363
of pollinators, and it's a route that we designed

00:06:06.363 --> 00:06:08.969
that takes people through the whole of our town,

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.188
past our cafes and our small shops, through our market,

00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:15.601
not just to and fro from the supermarket,

00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:17.899
and we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.754
around our town, we're also changing their behavior.

00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:24.474
And then there's the second plate, the learning plate.

00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:26.054
Well, we're in partnership with a high school.

00:06:26.054 --> 00:06:29.127
We've created a company. We are designing and building

00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:31.175
an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:33.082
at the back of the high school, like you do,

00:06:33.082 --> 00:06:35.275
and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables

00:06:35.275 --> 00:06:37.824
in an orchard with bees,

00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:40.082
and the kids are helping us build that,

00:06:40.082 --> 00:06:42.895
and the kids are on the board, and because the community

00:06:42.895 --> 00:06:44.427
was really keen on working with the high school,

00:06:44.427 --> 00:06:47.795
the high school is now teaching agriculture,

00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:50.911
and because it's teaching agriculture, we started to think,

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.694
how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:56.245
before in their lives but are really excited about growing,

00:06:56.245 --> 00:06:57.949
how can we give them some more experience?

00:06:57.949 --> 00:06:59.908
So we got some land that was donated

00:06:59.908 --> 00:07:01.166
by a local garden center.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:04.500
It was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.110
totally voluntary-led, we have turned that

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.307
into a market garden training center,

00:07:09.307 --> 00:07:12.271
and that is polytunnels and raised beds

00:07:12.271 --> 00:07:14.975
and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers

00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:17.296
and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future.

00:07:17.296 --> 00:07:19.504
And because we were doing that, some local academics said,

00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:20.836
"You know, we could help design

00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:22.608
a commercial horticulture course for you.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:24.003
There's not one that we know of."

00:07:24.003 --> 00:07:26.647
So they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year,

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:29.232
and it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary.

00:07:29.232 --> 00:07:30.851
And then there's the third plate,

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.669
because if you walk through an edible landscape,

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:35.264
and if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get

00:07:35.264 --> 00:07:37.312
interested in what's growing seasonally,

00:07:37.312 --> 00:07:39.224
you might just want to spend more of your own money

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:41.304
in support of local producers,

00:07:41.304 --> 00:07:43.056
not just veg, but meat and cheese and beer

00:07:43.056 --> 00:07:45.135
and whatever else it might be.

00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:47.872
But then, we're just a community group, you know.

00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:49.830
We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do?

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.580
So we did some really simple things.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.367
We fundraised, we got some blackboards,

00:07:53.367 --> 00:07:54.537
we put "Incredible Edible" on the top,

00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:56.713
we gave it every market trader that was selling locally,

00:07:56.713 --> 00:07:59.640
and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.096
Really popular. People congregated around it.

00:08:02.096 --> 00:08:03.744
Sales were up.

00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:06.740
And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said,

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.717
"We're really serious about this,"

00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:10.135
but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought,

00:08:10.135 --> 00:08:12.760
okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.334
a campaign around one product and show them

00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:17.377
there is local loyalty to that product,

00:08:17.377 --> 00:08:19.720
maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.711
So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me --

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.784
called Every Egg Matters. (Laughter)

00:08:24.784 --> 00:08:28.405
And what we did was we put people on our egg map.

00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:30.556
It's a stylized map of Togmorden.

00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:32.195
Anybody that's selling their excess eggs

00:08:32.195 --> 00:08:34.733
at the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors,

00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:37.150
we've stuck on there. We started with four,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.424
and we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was

00:08:39.424 --> 00:08:40.924
that people were then going into shops

00:08:40.924 --> 00:08:43.605
asking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that

00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:45.894
was, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got

00:08:45.894 --> 00:08:48.003
of free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds,

00:08:48.003 --> 00:08:50.584
and although these are really, really small steps,

00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:55.273
that increasing local economic confidence

00:08:55.273 --> 00:08:57.850
is starting to play out in a number of ways,

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.152
and we now have farmers doing cheese

00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:00.941
and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs,

00:09:00.941 --> 00:09:02.349
they're doing pasties and pies and things

00:09:02.349 --> 00:09:04.722
that they would have never done before.

00:09:04.722 --> 00:09:07.343
We've got increasing market stalls selling local food,

00:09:07.343 --> 00:09:11.557
and in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent

00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:14.510
of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.916
had increased because of what we were actually doing.

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:20.006
And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment.

00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:21.410
(Laughter)

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.820
Now, none of this is rocket science.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.699
It certainly is not clever, and it's not original.

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:30.506
But it is joined up, and it is inclusive.

00:09:30.506 --> 00:09:32.629
This is not a movement for those people

00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:34.551
that are going to sort themselves out anyway.

00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:35.885
This is a movement for everyone.

00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:41.313
We have a motto: If you eat, you're in. (Laughter)

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:43.228
(Applause)

00:09:47.402 --> 00:09:52.479
Across age, across income, across culture.

00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:56.086
It's been really quite a roller coaster experience,

00:09:56.086 --> 00:09:56.634
but going back to that first question that we asked,

00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:01.818
is it replicable? Yeah. It most certainly is replicable.

00:10:01.818 --> 00:10:04.632
More than 30 towns in England now are spinning

00:10:04.632 --> 00:10:06.760
the Incredible Edible plate.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.255
Whichever way they want to do it, of their own volition,

00:10:10.255 --> 00:10:12.949
they're trying to make their own lives differently,

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:15.697
and worldwide, we've got communities across America

00:10:15.697 --> 00:10:17.441
and Japan -- it's incredible, isn't it? I mean,

00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:19.956
America and Japan and New Zealand.

00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:22.480
People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.531
in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness

00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:30.183
around local growing into the heart of Christchurch.

00:10:30.183 --> 00:10:33.030
And none of this takes more money

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.157
and none of this demands a bureaucracy,

00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:39.020
but it does demand that you think things differently

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.717
and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs

00:10:42.717 --> 00:10:44.845
in order to create that supportive framework

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:47.559
that communities can bounce off.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:50.475
And there's some great ideas already in our patch.

00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:53.259
Our local authority has decided to make everywhere

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:55.921
Incredible Edible, and in support of that

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.406
have decided to do two things.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:11:00.515
First, they're going to create an asset register of spare land

00:11:00.515 --> 00:11:02.746
that they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.482
can use that wherever they live,

00:11:04.482 --> 00:11:06.659
and they're going to underpin that with a license.

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:09.040
And then they've said to every single one of their workforce,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.537
if you can, help those communities grow,

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.650
and help them to maintain their spaces.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.689
Suddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground

00:11:15.689 --> 00:11:17.969
from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:22.394
We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded

00:11:22.394 --> 00:11:24.573
of us, and there's lots more you could do.

00:11:24.573 --> 00:11:26.933
I mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting

00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:30.301
prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space.

00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:33.703
(Laughter) Secondly, please create -- please, please create

00:11:33.703 --> 00:11:36.482
edible landscapes so that our children start to walk

00:11:36.482 --> 00:11:38.665
past their food day in, day out, on our high streets,

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:41.251
in our parks, wherever that might be.

00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:44.945
Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart

00:11:44.945 --> 00:11:48.208
of the town and the city plan, not relegate them

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:51.528
to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see.

00:11:51.528 --> 00:11:54.345
Encourage all our schools to take this seriously.

00:11:54.345 --> 00:11:56.578
This isn't a second class exercise.

00:11:56.578 --> 00:11:59.546
If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow,

00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:02.595
then please let us say to every school,

00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:06.575
create a sense of purpose around the importance

00:12:06.575 --> 00:12:09.375
to the environment, local food and soils.

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:11.262
Put that at the heart of your school culture,

00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:14.424
and you will create a different generation.

00:12:14.424 --> 00:12:16.863
There are so many things you can do, but ultimately

00:12:16.863 --> 00:12:19.151
this is about something really simple.

00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:22.776
Through an organic process, through

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:27.063
an increasing recognition of the power of small actions,

00:12:27.063 --> 00:12:30.888
we are starting, at last, to believe in ourselves again,

00:12:30.888 --> 00:12:34.729
and to believe in our capacity, each and every one of us,

00:12:34.729 --> 00:12:39.122
to build a different and a kinder future,

00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:41.545
and in my book, that's incredible.

00:12:41.545 --> 00:12:45.410
Thank you. (Applause)

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:55.902
(Applause)

00:12:55.902 --> 00:12:59.724
Thank you very much. (Applause)
