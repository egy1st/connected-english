00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.304
(Applause)

00:00:02.304 --> 00:00:06.083
So I arrived by truck with about 50 rebels

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:07.431
to the battle for Jalalabad

00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:11.690
as a 19-year-old vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.873
(Laughter)

00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:15.483
I traded my Converse black low-tops

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:17.397
for a pair of brown leather sandals

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:19.848
and launched a rocket towards government tanks

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:21.514
that I couldn't even see.

00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:25.115
And this was my first time in Afghanistan.

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:27.520
Long before that I had grown up with the war,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.055
but alongside weekend sleepovers and Saturday soccer games

00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:34.693
and fistfights with racist children of the Confederacy

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:36.877
and religio-nationalist demonstrations

00:00:36.877 --> 00:00:40.095
chanting, "Down with communism and long live Afghanistan,"

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:44.894
and burning effigies of Brezhnev before I even knew what it meant.

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:47.085
But this is the geography of self.

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:49.813
And so I stand here today,

00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:53.203
Afghan by blood, redneck by the grace of God,

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:54.447
(Laughter)

00:00:54.447 --> 00:00:57.614
an atheist and a radically politicized artist

00:00:57.614 --> 00:01:00.264
who's been living, working and creating in Afghanistan

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:02.146
for the last nine years.

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:05.088
Now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:07.001
make art about in Afghanistan,

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.913
but personally I don't want to paint rainbows;

00:01:09.913 --> 00:01:12.780
I want to make art that disturbs identity

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.814
and challenges authority

00:01:14.814 --> 00:01:16.430
and exposes hypocrisy

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.281
and reinterprets reality

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:20.964
and even uses kind of an imaginative ethnography

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:25.692
to try and understand the world that we live in.

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:30.138
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster

00:01:30.138 --> 00:01:33.344
who wears his jihad against the communists

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:34.881
like popstar bling

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.864
and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.863
to make himself rich.

00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:46.862
(Laughter)

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:53.215
And where else can the jihadi gangster go, but run for parliament

00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:54.995
and do a public installation campaign

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:58.215
with the slogan: "Vote for me! I've done jihad, and I'm rich."

00:01:58.215 --> 00:01:59.494
(Laughter)

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:02.899
And try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.514
who are masquerading as national heroes.

00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:10.992
I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan

00:02:10.992 --> 00:02:13.477
through a work called "Payback"

00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:15.425
and impersonate a police officer,

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:19.624
set up a fake checkpoint on the street of Kabul and stop cars,

00:02:19.624 --> 00:02:23.359
but instead of asking them for a bribe, offering them money

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.342
and apologizing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department --

00:02:26.342 --> 00:02:32.927
(Applause)

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:41.805
and hoping that they'll accept this 100 Afghanis on our behalf.

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:46.282
I want to look at how, in my opinion,

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:49.964
the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict chic.

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:52.214
The war and the expatriate life that comes with it

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:56.614
have created this environment of style and fashion

00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:58.980
that can only be described

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.400
through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.280
where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.568
or make multiple interior pockets

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:14.687
on fashionable neo-traditional vests.

00:03:14.687 --> 00:03:20.370
And I'd like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheelbarrow

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.359
and putting it on the wall amidst Kipling's call of 1899

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.054
to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives

00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:32.903
being rooted in yesterday's colonial rhetoric

00:03:32.903 --> 00:03:34.438
about a "white man's burden"

00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:37.237
to save the brown man from himself

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:41.688
and maybe even civilize him a bit.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:45.130
But doing these things, they can get you in jail,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.172
they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted.

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:51.030
But I do them because I have to,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.697
because the geography of self mandates it.

00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:57.611
That is my burden. What's yours?

00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:59.277
Thank you.

00:03:59.292 --> 00:04:06.315
(Applause)
