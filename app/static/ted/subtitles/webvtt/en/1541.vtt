00:00:00.723 --> 00:00:07.123
I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana.

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:11.244
The air is thick with heat and dust,

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:14.653
and it's hard to breathe.

00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:17.915
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:22.161
in the darkness, but I can't see much else.

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:26.131
I hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.119
is this cacophony of men coughing,

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.030
and stone being broken with primitive tools.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.085
Like the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:42.881
tied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:46.221
and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs

00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:49.250
holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.876
dropping hundreds of feet into the earth.

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:56.956
When my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner

00:00:56.956 --> 00:01:01.237
I had met days before who had lost his grip

00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:05.858
and fell countless feet down that shaft.

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:08.389
As I stand talking to you today,

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:11.893
these men are still deep in that hole,

00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:15.408
risking their lives without payment or compensation,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.548
and often dying.

00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:23.736
I got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home,

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:29.918
but they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery.

00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:32.825
For the last 28 years, I've been documenting

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.386
indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:39.181
on six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor

00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:43.593
of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit.

00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:47.165
Amongst all the astonishing people I met there,

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:50.335
I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:55.662
dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery.

00:01:55.662 --> 00:01:58.551
We started talking about slavery, and really,

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.415
I started learning about slavery,

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:04.624
for I had certainly known it existed in the world,

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.635
but not to such a degree.

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:11.378
After we finished talking, I felt so horrible

00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:14.754
and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:18.264
of this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:23.132
if I don't know, how many other people don't know?

00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:26.947
It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:29.923
I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director

00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:33.194
of Free the Slaves and offer them my help.

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:37.764
Thus began my journey into modern day slavery.

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:40.906
Oddly, I had been to many of these places before.

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:44.387
Some I even considered like my second home.

00:02:44.387 --> 00:02:51.822
But this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet.

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:54.127
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than

00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:58.282
27 million people enslaved in the world today.

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:01.762
That's double the amount of people taken from Africa

00:03:01.762 --> 00:03:05.887
during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade.

00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:09.031
A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave

00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:12.525
cost about three times the annual salary

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.271
of an American worker.

00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:19.264
That equates to about $50,000 in today's money.

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:23.656
Yet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations

00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:28.524
over a debt as small as $18.

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:31.556
Astonishingly, slavery generates profits

00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:37.302
of more than $13 billion worldwide each year.

00:03:37.302 --> 00:03:40.154
Many have been tricked by false promises

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:44.700
of a good education, a better job, only to find

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.208
that they're forced to work without pay

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:53.876
under the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away.

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:57.158
Today's slavery is about commerce,

00:03:57.158 --> 00:04:01.188
so the goods that enslaved people produce have value,

00:04:01.188 --> 00:04:06.186
but the people producing them are disposable.

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:10.576
Slavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world,

00:04:10.576 --> 00:04:17.543
and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world.

00:04:17.543 --> 00:04:22.333
In India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns.

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:25.124
This strange and awesome sight was like

00:04:25.124 --> 00:04:29.014
walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno.

00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:33.165
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,

00:04:33.165 --> 00:04:37.260
men, women, children, entire families in fact,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.411
were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,

00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:43.031
while mechanically stacking bricks on their head,

00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:46.152
up to 18 at a time, and carrying them

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:51.102
from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away.

00:04:51.102 --> 00:04:54.629
Deadened by monotony and exhaustion,

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:00.214
they work silently, doing this task over and over

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:03.567
for 16 or 17 hours a day.

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:07.286
There were no breaks for food, no water breaks,

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:09.838
and the severe dehydration made urinating

00:05:09.838 --> 00:05:12.710
pretty much inconsequential.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.142
So pervasive was the heat and the dust

00:05:15.142 --> 00:05:18.893
that my camera became too hot to even touch

00:05:18.893 --> 00:05:21.345
and ceased working.

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:24.117
Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser

00:05:24.117 --> 00:05:27.466
to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner

00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:30.521
to revive it, and as I sat there,

00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:35.131
I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment

00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:37.457
than these people.

00:05:37.457 --> 00:05:40.329
Back in the kilns, I wanted to cry,

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:43.507
but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:47.811
and he said, "Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here."

00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:51.704
And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays

00:05:51.704 --> 00:05:54.238
are very dangerous in a place like this,

00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:58.092
not just for me, but for them.

00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:01.742
I couldn't offer them any direct help.

00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:04.535
I couldn't give them money, nothing.

00:06:04.535 --> 00:06:06.332
I wasn't a citizen of that country.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:09.420
I could get them in a worse situation

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.200
than they were already in.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.456
I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work

00:06:14.456 --> 00:06:17.298
within the system for their liberation,

00:06:17.298 --> 00:06:20.767
and I trusted that they would.

00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:24.204
As for me, I'd have to wait until I got home

00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:28.166
to really feel my heartbreak.

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:31.039
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.789
for miles down mountainous terrain

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.687
to trucks waiting at roads below.

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:39.205
The big sheets of slate were heavier

00:06:39.205 --> 00:06:41.871
than the children carrying them,

00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:43.900
and the kids hoisted them from their heads

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.344
using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope

00:06:48.344 --> 00:06:50.191
and torn cloth.

00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:53.866
It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming.

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:56.513
How can we affect something so insidious,

00:06:56.513 --> 00:06:59.725
yet so pervasive?

00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:02.437
Some don't even know they're enslaved,

00:07:02.437 --> 00:07:07.443
people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,

00:07:07.443 --> 00:07:10.656
because this has been the case all their lives.

00:07:10.656 --> 00:07:14.938
They have nothing to compare it to.

00:07:14.938 --> 00:07:18.312
When these villagers claimed their freedom,

00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:23.727
the slaveholders burned down all of their houses.

00:07:23.727 --> 00:07:25.689
I mean, these people had nothing,

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:29.338
and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up,

00:07:29.338 --> 00:07:33.385
but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere,

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:34.881
and abolitionists on the ground

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.540
helped them get a quarry lease of their own,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.653
so that now they do the same back-breaking work,

00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:45.160
but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.583
and they do it in freedom.

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:50.651
Sex trafficking is what we often think of

00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:52.552
when we hear the word slavery,

00:07:52.552 --> 00:07:54.511
and because of this worldwide awareness,

00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:57.647
I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely

00:07:57.647 --> 00:08:00.469
within this particular industry.

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:03.311
In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had

00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:06.847
previously been sex slaves themselves.

00:08:06.847 --> 00:08:09.205
They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs

00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:14.818
that led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement.

00:08:14.818 --> 00:08:16.650
This wasn't a brothel, per se.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.961
It was more like a restaurant.

00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:21.221
Cabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade,

00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:23.843
are venues for forced prostitution.

00:08:23.843 --> 00:08:26.875
Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves,

00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:29.506
women, along with young girls and boys,

00:08:29.506 --> 00:08:32.285
some as young as seven years old,

00:08:32.285 --> 00:08:34.275
are forced to entertain the clients,

00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:38.055
encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.

00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:41.094
Each cubicle is dark and dingy,

00:08:41.094 --> 00:08:45.033
identified with a painted number on the wall,

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:49.138
and partitioned by plywood and a curtain.

00:08:49.138 --> 00:08:52.689
The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse

00:08:52.689 --> 00:08:55.271
at the hands of their customers.

00:08:55.271 --> 00:08:58.337
Standing in the near darkness, I remember feeling

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:02.423
this quick, hot fear, and in that instant,

00:09:02.423 --> 00:09:04.768
I could only imagine what it must be like

00:09:04.768 --> 00:09:07.431
to be trapped in that hell.

00:09:07.431 --> 00:09:12.033
I had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in.

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:13.889
There were no back doors.

00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:16.432
There were no windows large enough to climb through.

00:09:16.432 --> 00:09:20.692
These people have no escape at all,

00:09:20.692 --> 00:09:23.752
and as we take in such a difficult subject,

00:09:23.752 --> 00:09:28.363
it's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,

00:09:28.363 --> 00:09:31.292
occurs in our own backyard as well.

00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:35.916
Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture,

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:38.588
in restaurants, in domestic servitude,

00:09:38.588 --> 00:09:41.220
and the list can go on.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.859
Recently, the New York Times reported that

00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:49.665
between 100,000 and 300,000 American children

00:09:49.665 --> 00:09:53.626
are sold into sex slavery every year.

00:09:53.626 --> 00:10:00.169
It's all around us. We just don't see it.

00:10:00.169 --> 00:10:03.551
The textile industry is another one we often think of

00:10:03.551 --> 00:10:06.437
when we hear about slave labor.

00:10:06.437 --> 00:10:10.760
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.405
in the silk trade.

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.697
This is a family portrait.

00:10:15.697 --> 00:10:19.585
The dyed black hands are the father, while the blue

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:22.374
and red hands are his sons.

00:10:22.374 --> 00:10:25.098
They mix dye in these big barrels,

00:10:25.098 --> 00:10:29.063
and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,

00:10:29.063 --> 00:10:34.025
but the dye is toxic.

00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:37.330
My interpreter told me their stories.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.932
"We have no freedom," they said.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:44.036
"We hope still, though, that we could leave this house

00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:45.690
someday and go someplace else

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:52.354
where we actually get paid for our dyeing."

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:57.293
It's estimated that more than 4,000 children

00:10:57.293 --> 00:10:59.450
are enslaved on Lake Volta,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.536
the largest man-made lake in the world.

00:11:03.536 --> 00:11:06.510
When we first arrived, I went to have a quick look.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.878
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat,

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:14.043
two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right?

00:11:14.043 --> 00:11:18.091
Wrong. They were all enslaved.

00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:20.920
Children are taken from their families

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.427
and trafficked and vanished,

00:11:23.427 --> 00:11:26.339
and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:30.886
on the lake, even though they do not know how to swim.

00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:33.221
This young child is eight years old.

00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:35.877
He was trembling when our boat approached,

00:11:35.877 --> 00:11:38.532
frightened it would run over his tiny canoe.

00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:41.871
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water.

00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:45.156
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta

00:11:45.156 --> 00:11:49.121
often catch the fishing nets, and weary,

00:11:49.121 --> 00:11:52.854
frightened children are thrown into the water

00:11:52.854 --> 00:11:55.005
to untether the lines.

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:57.852
Many of them drown.

00:11:57.852 --> 00:12:01.192
For as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work

00:12:01.192 --> 00:12:03.365
on the lake.

00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:06.829
Terrified of his master, he will not run away,

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:10.317
and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life,

00:12:10.317 --> 00:12:12.749
he passes that down to the younger slaves

00:12:12.749 --> 00:12:15.754
that he manages.

00:12:15.754 --> 00:12:17.858
I met these boys at five in the morning,

00:12:17.858 --> 00:12:20.319
when they were hauling in the last of their nets,

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:23.180
but they had been working since 1 a.m.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.755
in the cold, windy night.

00:12:26.755 --> 00:12:30.021
And it's important to note that these nets weigh

00:12:30.021 --> 00:12:34.437
more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish.

00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:38.940
I want to introduce you to Kofi.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.186
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village.

00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:44.778
I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves

00:12:44.778 --> 00:12:48.707
rehabilitates victims of slavery.

00:12:48.707 --> 00:12:50.788
Here he's seen taking a bath at the well,

00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:53.691
pouring big buckets of water over his head,

00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:55.612
and the wonderful news is,

00:12:55.612 --> 00:12:57.610
as you and I are sitting here talking today,

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.845
Kofi has been reunited with his family,

00:13:00.845 --> 00:13:03.997
and what's even better, his family has been given tools

00:13:03.997 --> 00:13:09.724
to make a living and to keep their children safe.

00:13:09.724 --> 00:13:14.177
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility.

00:13:14.177 --> 00:13:18.748
Who will he become because someone took a stand

00:13:18.748 --> 00:13:22.340
and made a difference in his life?

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.568
Driving down a road in Ghana

00:13:24.568 --> 00:13:26.656
with partners of Free the Slaves,

00:13:26.656 --> 00:13:29.698
a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up

00:13:29.698 --> 00:13:32.645
to our cruiser and tapped on the window.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:37.425
He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle.

00:13:37.425 --> 00:13:40.214
At the end of the road, he urged us out of the car,

00:13:40.214 --> 00:13:42.893
and told the driver to quickly leave.

00:13:42.893 --> 00:13:46.238
Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath,

00:13:46.238 --> 00:13:50.135
and said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go."

00:13:50.135 --> 00:13:53.804
As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines

00:13:53.804 --> 00:13:57.604
blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,

00:13:57.604 --> 00:14:03.130
found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.946
so I hoisted the photo gear above my head

00:14:04.946 --> 00:14:09.532
as we descended into these waters up to my chest.

00:14:09.532 --> 00:14:13.317
After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail

00:14:13.317 --> 00:14:17.613
abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us

00:14:17.613 --> 00:14:19.629
was a mass of holes

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:23.449
that could fit into the size of a football field,

00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:29.043
and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring.

00:14:29.043 --> 00:14:32.188
Many women had children strapped to their backs

00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:34.228
while they were panning for gold,

00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:38.531
wading in water poisoned by mercury.

00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:43.409
Mercury is used in the extraction process.

00:14:43.409 --> 00:14:46.565
These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft

00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:49.639
in another part of Ghana.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.460
When they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.738
from their own sweat.

00:14:54.738 --> 00:14:58.741
I remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes,

00:14:58.741 --> 00:15:04.482
for many of them had been underground for 72 hours.

00:15:04.482 --> 00:15:08.457
The shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out

00:15:08.457 --> 00:15:12.026
heavy bags of stone that later will be transported

00:15:12.026 --> 00:15:14.627
to another area, where the stone will be pounded

00:15:14.627 --> 00:15:18.572
so that they can extract the gold.

00:15:18.572 --> 00:15:22.677
At first glance, the pounding site seems full

00:15:22.677 --> 00:15:27.570
of powerful men, but when we look closer,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.437
we see some less fortunate working on the fringes,

00:15:32.437 --> 00:15:34.580
and children too.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:41.722
All of them are victim to injury, illness and violence.

00:15:41.722 --> 00:15:45.702
In fact, it's very likely that this muscular person

00:15:45.702 --> 00:15:50.237
will end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis

00:15:50.237 --> 00:15:55.208
and mercury poisoning in just a few years.

00:15:55.208 --> 00:15:59.485
This is Manuru. When his father died,

00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:02.567
his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines.

00:16:02.567 --> 00:16:07.163
When his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt,

00:16:07.163 --> 00:16:12.105
which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines.

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:14.938
When I met him, he had been working in the mines

00:16:14.938 --> 00:16:19.731
for 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here

00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:21.744
is actually from a mining accident,

00:16:21.744 --> 00:16:26.861
one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated.

00:16:26.877 --> 00:16:30.827
On top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis,

00:16:30.827 --> 00:16:33.871
yet he's still forced to work day in and day out

00:16:33.871 --> 00:16:36.115
in that mine shaft.

00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:41.278
Even still, he has a dream that he will become free

00:16:41.278 --> 00:16:44.391
and become educated with the help of local activists

00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:46.819
like Free the Slaves,

00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:49.171
and it's this sort of determination,

00:16:49.171 --> 00:16:53.049
in the face of unimaginable odds,

00:16:53.049 --> 00:17:00.409
that fills me with complete awe.

00:17:00.409 --> 00:17:03.709
I want to shine a light on slavery.

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:05.964
When I was working in the field,

00:17:05.964 --> 00:17:08.645
I brought lots of candles with me,

00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:11.367
and with the help of my interpreter,

00:17:11.367 --> 00:17:13.683
I imparted to the people I was photographing

00:17:13.683 --> 00:17:16.794
that I wanted to illuminate their stories

00:17:16.794 --> 00:17:18.861
and their plight,

00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:22.366
so when it was safe for them, and safe for me,

00:17:22.366 --> 00:17:25.707
I made these images.

00:17:25.707 --> 00:17:27.940
They knew their image would be seen

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.769
by you out in the world.

00:17:29.769 --> 00:17:33.513
I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness

00:17:33.513 --> 00:17:37.442
to them, and that we will do whatever we can

00:17:37.442 --> 00:17:42.132
to help make a difference in their lives.

00:17:42.132 --> 00:17:45.612
I truly believe, if we can see one another

00:17:45.612 --> 00:17:50.096
as fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult

00:17:50.096 --> 00:17:55.300
to tolerate atrocities like slavery.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.984
These images are not of issues. They are of people,

00:17:58.984 --> 00:18:02.249
real people, like you and me, all deserving

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:05.729
of the same rights, dignity and respect

00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:07.958
in their lives.

00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:11.193
There is not a day that goes by that I don't think

00:18:11.193 --> 00:18:16.472
of these many beautiful, mistreated people

00:18:16.472 --> 00:18:21.041
I've had the tremendous honor of meeting.

00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:24.571
I hope that these images awaken a force

00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:27.617
in those who view them, people like you,

00:18:27.617 --> 00:18:31.893
and I hope that force will ignite a fire,

00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:36.816
and that fire will shine a light on slavery,

00:18:36.816 --> 00:18:40.825
for without that light, the beast of bondage

00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:44.009
can continue to live in the shadows.

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:46.986
Thank you very much.

00:18:46.986 --> 00:19:00.239
(Applause)
