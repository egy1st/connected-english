00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.494
In half a century of trying to help prevent wars,

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:08.009
there's one question that never leaves me:

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:11.725
How do we deal with extreme violence

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:15.226
without using force in return?

00:00:15.226 --> 00:00:17.777
When you're faced with brutality,

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:20.693
whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground

00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.393
or domestic violence --

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:25.309
or, on the streets of Syria today,

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.860
facing tanks and shrapnel,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.207
what's the most effective thing to do?

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:33.805
Fight back? Give in?

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:37.146
Use more force?

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:41.138
This question: "How do I deal with a bully

00:00:41.138 --> 00:00:44.888
without becoming a thug in return?"

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:47.904
has been with me ever since I was a child.

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:50.455
I remember I was about 13,

00:00:50.455 --> 00:00:55.441
glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.706
as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest,

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:02.505
and kids not much older than me

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:05.006
were throwing themselves at the tanks

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.174
and getting mown down.

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:10.975
And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase.

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.689
And my mother came up and said, "What on Earth are you doing?"

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.971
And I said, "I'm going to Budapest."

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:18.605
And she said, "What on Earth for?"

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:20.654
And I said, "Kids are getting killed there.

00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:22.506
There's something terrible happening."

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:24.523
And she said, "Don't be so silly."

00:01:24.523 --> 00:01:27.123
And I started to cry.

00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:29.338
And she got it, she said,

00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:31.105
"Okay, I see it's serious.

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:33.939
You're much too young to help.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.574
You need training. I'll help you.

00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:38.739
But just unpack your suitcase."

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.305
And so I got some training

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:46.238
and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s.

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:49.939
But I realized that what I really needed to know

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.338
I couldn't get from training courses.

00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:54.524
I wanted to understand

00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:58.974
how violence, how oppression, works.

00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:03.922
And what I've discovered since is this:

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:07.988
Bullies use violence in three ways.

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:13.291
They use political violence to intimidate,

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:18.705
physical violence to terrorize

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:26.229
and mental or emotional violence to undermine.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.456
And only very rarely in very few cases

00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:32.972
does it work to use more violence.

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:39.181
Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence,

00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:41.205
and 27 years later

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:43.188
he and his colleagues

00:02:43.188 --> 00:02:45.173
had slowly and carefully

00:02:45.173 --> 00:02:50.139
honed the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.339
to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:56.205
into a democracy.

00:02:56.205 --> 00:03:00.937
And they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.

00:03:00.937 --> 00:03:08.104
They realized that using force against force

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:13.300
doesn't work.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.493
So what does work?

00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:18.962
Over time I've collected about a half-dozen methods

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:20.795
that do work -- of course there are many more --

00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:23.141
that do work and that are effective.

00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:24.508
And the first is

00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:27.026
that the change that has to take place

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:31.491
has to take place here, inside me.

00:03:31.491 --> 00:03:35.591
It's my response, my attitude, to oppression

00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.442
that I've got control over,

00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:40.742
and that I can do something about.

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:44.925
And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:47.424
That means I need to know how I tick,

00:03:47.424 --> 00:03:49.675
when I collapse,

00:03:49.675 --> 00:03:54.009
where my formidable points are,

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.507
where my weaker points are.

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:57.975
When do I give in?

00:03:57.975 --> 00:04:03.238
What will I stand up for?

00:04:03.238 --> 00:04:08.377
And meditation or self-inspection

00:04:08.377 --> 00:04:10.911
is one of the ways -- again it's not the only one --

00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:12.029
it's one of the ways

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:16.146
of gaining this kind of inner power.

00:04:16.146 --> 00:04:18.628
And my heroine here -- like Satish's --

00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:21.661
is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:25.294
She was leading a group of students

00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:27.694
on a protest in the streets of Rangoon.

00:04:27.694 --> 00:04:31.877
They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.

00:04:31.877 --> 00:04:33.044
And she realized straight away

00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:36.962
that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers

00:04:36.962 --> 00:04:42.660
were more scared than the student protesters behind her.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.365
But she told the students to sit down.

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:52.661
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity

00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:56.111
and such total lack of fear

00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:00.211
that she could walk right up to the first gun,

00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:04.287
put her hand on it and lower it.

00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:12.082
And no one got killed.

00:05:12.097 --> 00:05:16.039
So that's what the mastery of fear can do --

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.340
not only faced with machine guns,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.506
but if you meet a knife fight in the street.

00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:24.871
But we have to practice.

00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:26.772
So what about our fear?

00:05:26.772 --> 00:05:31.726
I have a little mantra.

00:05:31.726 --> 00:05:35.167
My fear grows fat

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.384
on the energy I feed it.

00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:39.671
And if it grows very big

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:42.033
it probably happens.

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:46.468
So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome,

00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:49.184
when something you've been worrying about wakes you up --

00:05:49.184 --> 00:05:51.574
I see a lot of people --

00:05:51.574 --> 00:05:55.184
and for an hour you toss and turn,

00:05:55.184 --> 00:05:56.862
it gets worse and worse,

00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:59.984
and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.187
by a monster this big.

00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:04.121
The only thing to do

00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:05.955
is to get up, make a cup of tea

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:11.271
and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:13.752
You're the adult.

00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:15.639
The fear is the child.

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.084
And you talk to the fear

00:06:17.084 --> 00:06:20.270
and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.887
How can this be made better?

00:06:24.887 --> 00:06:26.637
How can the child feel stronger?

00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:28.086
And you make a plan.

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:30.091
And you say, "Okay, now we're going back to sleep.

00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:33.858
Half-past seven, we're getting up and that's what we're going to do."

00:06:33.858 --> 00:06:39.590
I had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday --

00:06:39.606 --> 00:06:43.591
paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you.

00:06:43.591 --> 00:06:45.589
(Laughter)

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:47.096
So I did the thing.

00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:51.225
I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all

00:06:51.225 --> 00:06:55.381
and I'm here -- still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:59.780
(Applause)

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.296
So that's fear. What about anger?

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:06.698
Wherever there is injustice there's anger.

00:07:06.698 --> 00:07:09.546
But anger is like gasoline,

00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:13.000
and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
you've got an inferno.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.117
But anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful.

00:07:20.117 --> 00:07:24.283
If we can put our anger inside an engine,

00:07:24.283 --> 00:07:26.066
it can drive us forward,

00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:29.054
it can get us through the dreadful moments

00:07:29.054 --> 00:07:33.017
and it can give us real inner power.

00:07:33.017 --> 00:07:36.135
And I learned this in my work

00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:38.399
with nuclear weapon policy-makers.

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:41.118
Because at the beginning I was so outraged

00:07:41.118 --> 00:07:44.434
at the dangers they were exposing us to

00:07:44.434 --> 00:07:49.568
that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:52.101
Totally ineffective.

00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:55.850
In order to develop a dialogue for change

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.923
we have to deal with our anger.

00:07:57.923 --> 00:08:02.600
It's okay to be angry with the thing --

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.700
the nuclear weapons in this case --

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.551
but it is hopeless to be angry with the people.

00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:11.166
They are human beings just like us.

00:08:11.166 --> 00:08:13.817
And they're doing what they think is best.

00:08:13.817 --> 00:08:17.800
And that's the basis on which we have to talk with them.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.717
So that's the third one, anger.

00:08:20.717 --> 00:08:22.117
And it brings me to the crux

00:08:22.117 --> 00:08:25.351
of what's going on, or what I perceive as going on,

00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:26.416
in the world today,

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:30.434
which is that last century was top-down power.

00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:34.699
It was still governments telling people what to do.

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:36.734
This century there's a shift.

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:40.617
It's bottom-up or grassroots power.

00:08:40.617 --> 00:08:43.833
It's like mushrooms coming through concrete.

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:50.514
It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away

00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:52.787
to bring about change.

00:08:52.787 --> 00:08:57.053
And Peace Direct spotted quite early on

00:08:57.053 --> 00:09:00.604
that local people in areas of very hot conflict

00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:03.040
know what to do.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.256
They know best what to do.

00:09:05.256 --> 00:09:08.538
So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that.

00:09:08.538 --> 00:09:10.737
And the kind of thing they're doing

00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:13.905
is demobilizing militias,

00:09:13.905 --> 00:09:16.508
rebuilding economies,

00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:18.858
resettling refugees,

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:24.359
even liberating child soldiers.

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:27.225
And they have to risk their lives almost every day

00:09:27.225 --> 00:09:30.444
to do this.

00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:34.258
And what they've realized

00:09:34.258 --> 00:09:39.191
is that using violence in the situations they operate in

00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:43.710
is not only less humane,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.845
but it's less effective

00:09:45.845 --> 00:09:52.376
than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.

00:09:52.376 --> 00:09:56.308
And I think that the U.S. military

00:09:56.308 --> 00:10:03.188
is finally beginning to get this.

00:10:03.188 --> 00:10:05.897
Up to now their counter-terrorism policy

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:10.730
has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost,

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.933
and if civilians get in the way,

00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:18.199
that's written as "collateral damage."

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:24.932
And this is so infuriating and humiliating

00:10:24.932 --> 00:10:27.282
for the population of Afghanistan,

00:10:27.282 --> 00:10:31.630
that it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.800
when people are so disgusted by, for example,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.179
the burning of the Koran.

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:40.180
So the training of the troops has to change.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:45.288
And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change.

00:10:45.288 --> 00:10:48.072
The British military have always been much better at this.

00:10:48.072 --> 00:10:53.754
But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from,

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:56.922
and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.587
called Chris Hughes.

00:10:58.587 --> 00:11:02.804
And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf --

00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:04.972
in Iraq actually --

00:11:04.972 --> 00:11:10.005
and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road,

00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:14.603
screaming, yelling, furiously angry,

00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:19.071
and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified,

00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:21.571
didn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic.

00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:25.821
And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng

00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:29.690
with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.388
and he said, "Kneel."

00:11:31.388 --> 00:11:34.188
And these huge soldiers

00:11:34.188 --> 00:11:36.821
with their backpacks and their body armor,

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:41.295
wobbled to the ground.

00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:47.380
And complete silence fell.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.938
And after about two minutes,

00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:54.214
everybody moved aside and went home.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:59.696
Now that to me is wisdom in action.

00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:03.862
In the moment, that's what he did.

00:12:03.862 --> 00:12:09.624
And it's happening everywhere now.

00:12:09.624 --> 00:12:11.533
You don't believe me?

00:12:11.533 --> 00:12:15.192
Have you asked yourselves

00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:19.632
why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed

00:12:19.632 --> 00:12:22.983
over the last 30 years?

00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:28.050
Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:32.265
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,

00:12:32.265 --> 00:12:35.151
Mali, Madagascar,

00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:38.933
Poland, the Philippines,

00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:44.016
Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on,

00:12:44.016 --> 00:12:48.606
and now Tunisia and Egypt.

00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:52.656
And this hasn't just happened.

00:12:52.656 --> 00:12:55.807
A lot of it is due to a book

00:12:55.807 --> 00:13:00.272
written by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp.

00:13:00.272 --> 00:13:04.289
He wrote a book called "From Dictatorship to Democracy"

00:13:04.289 --> 00:13:09.685
with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance.

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:11.772
And it's been translated into 26 languages.

00:13:11.772 --> 00:13:13.856
It's flown around the world.

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:21.043
And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere,

00:13:21.043 --> 00:13:26.465
because it works and it's effective.

00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:31.023
So this is what gives me hope --

00:13:31.023 --> 00:13:34.776
not just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now.

00:13:34.776 --> 00:13:38.792
Because finally human beings are getting it.

00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:46.410
We're getting practical, doable methodologies

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.994
to answer my question:

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:54.296
How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?

00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:58.706
We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined:

00:13:58.706 --> 00:14:02.424
inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self-knowledge,

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:05.990
recognizing and working with our fear,

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.508
using anger as a fuel,

00:14:09.508 --> 00:14:12.073
cooperating with others,

00:14:12.073 --> 00:14:14.008
banding together with others,

00:14:14.008 --> 00:14:16.190
courage,

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:23.159
and most importantly, commitment to active non-violence.

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:27.273
Now I don't just believe in non-violence.

00:14:27.273 --> 00:14:30.208
I don't have to believe in it.

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:33.758
I see evidence everywhere of how it works.

00:14:33.758 --> 00:14:39.808
And I see that we, ordinary people,

00:14:39.808 --> 00:14:46.126
can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did.

00:14:46.126 --> 00:14:48.849
We can bring to an end

00:14:48.849 --> 00:14:53.848
the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known.

00:14:53.848 --> 00:15:01.789
And we can organize to overcome oppression

00:15:01.789 --> 00:15:04.407
by opening our hearts

00:15:04.407 --> 00:15:10.257
as well as strengthening this incredible resolve.

00:15:10.257 --> 00:15:14.857
And this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced

00:15:14.857 --> 00:15:19.291
in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday.

00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:21.412
Thank you.

00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:25.981
(Applause)
