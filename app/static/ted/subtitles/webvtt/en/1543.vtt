WEBVTT

00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:01.181
Thanks very much.

00:00:01.205 --> 00:00:03.053
I am Hannah Fry, the badass.

00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:04.757
And today I'm asking the question:

00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:06.537
Is life really that complex?

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:09.886
Now, I've only got nine minutes
to try and provide you with an answer,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.626
so what I've done
is split this neatly into two parts:

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.003
part one: yes;

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:17.555
and later on, part two: no.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.123
Or, to be more accurate: no?

00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:21.351
(Laughter)

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.381
So first of all, let me try and define
what I mean by "complex."

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.846
Now, I could give you
a host of formal definitions,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.123
but in the simplest terms,

00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:33.046
any problem in complexity is something
that Einstein and his peers can't do.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.310
So, let's imagine --
if the clicker works ... there we go.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.437
Einstein is playing a game of snooker.

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.940
He's a clever chap, so he knows
that when he hits the cue ball,

00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:43.405
he could write you an equation

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.557
and tell you exactly where the red ball
is going to hit the sides,

00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:49.020
how fast it's going
and where it's going to end up.

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:52.513
Now, if you scale these snooker balls
up to the size of the solar system,

00:00:52.537 --> 00:00:54.496
Einstein can still help you.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.765
Sure, the physics changes,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.071
but if you wanted to know about
the path of the Earth around the Sun,

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.828
Einstein could write you an equation

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.495
telling you where both objects are
at any point in time.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.723
Now, with a surprising
increase in difficulty,

00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:08.199
Einstein could include
the Moon in his calculations.

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:11.290
But as you add more and more planets,
Mars and Jupiter, say,

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:15.078
the problem gets too tough for Einstein
to solve with a pen and paper.

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:17.945
Now, strangely, if instead of having
a handful of planets,

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.641
you had millions of objects
or even billions,

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:22.936
the problem actually becomes much simpler,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.882
and Einstein is back in the game.

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:26.752
Let me explain what I mean by this,

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:30.070
by scaling these objects back down
to a molecular level.

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:33.841
If you wanted to trace the erratic path
of an individual air molecule,

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:35.707
you'd have absolutely no hope.

00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:38.442
But when you have millions
of air molecules all together,

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:42.343
they start to act in a way
which is quantifiable, predictable

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.537
and well-behaved.

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.446
And thank goodness air is well-behaved,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.380
because if it wasn't,
planes would fall out of the sky.

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:51.468
Now, on an even bigger scale,
across the whole of the world,

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.614
the idea is exactly the same
with all of these air molecules.

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:57.556
It's true that you can't take
an individual rain droplet

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.365
and say where it's come from
or where it's going to end up.

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.423
But you can say with pretty good certainty

00:02:02.447 --> 00:02:04.260
whether it will be cloudy tomorrow.

00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:05.442
So that's it.

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.149
In Einstein's time,
this is how far science had got.

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:11.786
We could do really small problems
with a few objects

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.085
with simple interactions,

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.711
or we could do huge problems
with millions of objects

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.058
and simple interactions.

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:19.019
But what about everything in the middle?

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:21.736
Well, just seven years
before Einstein's death,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.418
an American scientist called
Warren Weaver made exactly this point.

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:29.066
He said that scientific methodology
has gone from one extreme to another,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.161
leaving out an untouched
great middle region.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.884
Now, this middle region
is where complexity science lies,

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:37.167
and this is what I mean by complex.

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.716
Now, unfortunately, almost
every single problem you can think of

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.962
to do with human behavior

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:44.055
lies in this middle region.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.369
Einstein's got absolutely no idea
how to model the movement of a crowd.

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:51.194
There are too many people
to look at them all individually

00:02:51.218 --> 00:02:53.090
and too few to treat them as a gas.

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:56.470
Similarly, people are prone
to annoying things like decisions

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:58.508
and not wanting to walk into each other,

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.145
which makes the problem
all the more complicated.

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.872
Einstein also couldn't tell you

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.245
when the next stock market crash
is going to be.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.033
Einstein couldn't tell you
how to improve unemployment.

00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:09.458
Einstein can't even tell you

00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:12.864
whether the next iPhone
is going to be a hit or a flop.

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:15.494
So to conclude part one:
we're completely screwed.

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:20.018
We've got no tools to deal with this,
and life is way too complex.

00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:21.838
But maybe there's hope,

00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:23.396
because in the last few years,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.257
we've begun to see the beginnings
of a new area of science

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.308
using mathematics
to model our social systems.

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:33.816
And I'm not just talking here
about statistics and computer simulations.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.836
I'm talking about writing down
equations about our society

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.929
that will help us understand
what's going on

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:42.168
in the same way as with the snooker balls
or the weather prediction.

00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:45.034
And this has come about
because people have begun to realize

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.401
that we can use and exploit analogies

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:51.367
between our human systems
and those of the physical world around us.

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:53.402
Now, to give you an example:

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:56.880
the incredibly complex problem
of migration across Europe.

00:03:56.904 --> 00:04:00.236
Actually, as it turns out, when you view
all of the people together,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.303
collectively, they behave as though
they're following the laws of gravity.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:07.455
But instead of planets
being attracted to one another,

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:11.689
it's people who are attracted
to areas with better job opportunities,

00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:15.728
higher pay, better quality of life
and lower unemployment.

00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:19.280
And in the same way as people
are more likely to go for opportunities

00:04:19.304 --> 00:04:22.339
close to where they live already --
London to Kent, for example,

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:24.155
as opposed to London to Melbourne --

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:28.315
the gravitational effect of planets
far away is felt much less.

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:31.064
So, to give you another example:

00:04:31.088 --> 00:04:35.313
in 2008, a group in UCLA
were looking into the patterns

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:38.049
of burglary hot spots in the city.

00:04:38.073 --> 00:04:43.592
Now, one thing about burglaries
is this idea of repeat victimization.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:47.853
So if you have a group of burglars
who manage to successfully rob an area,

00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:51.667
they'll tend to return to that area
and carry on burgling it.

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.547
So they learn the layout of the houses,

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.265
the escape routes

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.293
and the local security measures
that are in place.

00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:01.002
And this will continue to happen

00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:04.207
until local residents and police
ramp up the security,

00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:07.002
at which point, the burglars
will move off elsewhere.

00:05:07.026 --> 00:05:09.834
And it's that balance
between burglars and security

00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:12.895
which creates these dynamic
hot spots of the city.

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.463
As it turns out,
this is exactly the same process

00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:18.729
as how a leopard gets its spots,

00:05:18.753 --> 00:05:21.689
except in the leopard example,
it's not burglars and security,

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:25.178
it's the chemical process
that creates these patterns

00:05:25.202 --> 00:05:27.197
and something called "morphogenesis."

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:31.477
We actually know an awful lot
about the morphogenesis of leopard spots.

00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:36.145
Maybe we can use this to try and spot
some of the warning signs with burglaries

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.276
and perhaps, also to create
better crime strategies to prevent crime.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.872
There's a group here at UCL

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:44.721
who are working with
the West Midlands police right now

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.386
on this very question.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.325
I could give you
plenty of examples like this,

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.992
but I wanted to leave you
with one from my own research

00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:53.182
on the London riots.

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:55.221
Now, you probably
don't need me to tell you

00:05:55.245 --> 00:05:56.812
about the events of last summer,

00:05:56.836 --> 00:05:59.866
where London and the UK saw
the worst sustained period

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.416
of violent looting and arson

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.053
for over twenty years.

00:06:03.077 --> 00:06:06.364
It's understandable that, as a society,
we want to try and understand

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:08.182
exactly what caused these riots,

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:12.091
but also, perhaps, to equip our police
with better strategies

00:06:12.115 --> 00:06:15.896
to lead to a swifter
resolution in the future.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.276
Now, I don't want to upset
the sociologists here,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.157
so I absolutely cannot talk about
the individual motivations for a rioter,

00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:25.349
but when you look at
the rioters all together,

00:06:25.373 --> 00:06:28.581
mathematically, you can separate it
into a three-stage process

00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:30.580
and draw analogies accordingly.

00:06:30.604 --> 00:06:33.781
So, step one: let's say
you've got a group of friends.

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:35.680
None of them are involved in the riots,

00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:39.386
but one of them walks past
a Foot Locker which is being raided,

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.923
and goes in and bags himself
a new pair of trainers.

00:06:41.947 --> 00:06:46.036
He texts one of his friends and says,
"Come on down to the riots."

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.481
So his friend joins him,

00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:50.662
and then the two of them text
more of their friends, who join them,

00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:52.267
and text more of their friends

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:54.665
and more and more, and so it continues.

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.272
This process is identical to the way
that a virus spreads through a population.

00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:02.396
If you think about the bird flu epidemic
of a couple of years ago,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.723
the more people that were infected,
the more people that got infected,

00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:07.335
and the faster the virus spread

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.500
before the authorities managed
to get a handle on events.

00:07:10.988 --> 00:07:13.503
And it's exactly the same process here.

00:07:13.527 --> 00:07:16.803
So let's say you've got a rioter,
he's decided he's going to riot.

00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:19.362
The next thing he has to do
is pick a riot site.

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:23.898
Now, what you should know
about rioters is that, um ...

00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:25.564
Oops, clicker's gone. There we go.

00:07:25.588 --> 00:07:28.932
What you should know about rioters is,
they're not prepared to travel

00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:30.407
that far from where they live,

00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:32.283
unless it's a really juicy riot site.

00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:33.382
(Laughter)

00:07:33.406 --> 00:07:35.475
So you can see that here from this graph,

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:38.890
with an awful lot of rioters
having traveled less than a kilometer

00:07:38.914 --> 00:07:40.593
to the site that they went to.

00:07:40.617 --> 00:07:45.526
Now, this pattern is seen
in consumer models of retail spending,

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.859
i.e., where we choose to go shopping.

00:07:47.883 --> 00:07:50.805
So, of course, people like
to go to local shops,

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:53.421
but you'd be prepared
to go a little bit further

00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:55.561
if it was a really good retail site.

00:07:55.585 --> 00:07:59.027
And this analogy, actually, was already
picked up by some of the papers,

00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.313
with some tabloid press calling the events
"Shopping with violence,"

00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:05.125
which probably sums it up
in terms of our research.

00:08:05.673 --> 00:08:07.149
Oh! -- we're going backwards.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.186
OK, step three.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.027
Finally, the rioter is at his site,

00:08:13.051 --> 00:08:17.623
and he wants to avoid
getting caught by the police.

00:08:17.647 --> 00:08:20.348
The rioters will avoid
the police at all times,

00:08:20.372 --> 00:08:22.466
but there is some safety in numbers.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.551
And on the flip side, the police,
with their limited resources,

00:08:25.575 --> 00:08:28.154
are trying to protect
as much of the city as possible,

00:08:28.178 --> 00:08:30.191
arrest rioters wherever possible

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:32.256
and to create a deterrent effect.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.001
And actually, as it turns out,

00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:41.648
this mechanism between the two species,
so to speak, of rioters and police,

00:08:41.672 --> 00:08:44.321
is identical to predators
and prey in the wild.

00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:46.542
So if you can imagine rabbits and foxes,

00:08:46.566 --> 00:08:49.316
rabbits are trying to avoid
foxes at all costs,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.027
while foxes are patrolling the space,
trying to look for rabbits.

00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:56.405
We actually know an awful lot
about the dynamics of predators and prey.

00:08:56.429 --> 00:09:01.408
We also know a lot about
consumer spending flows.

00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:04.595
And we know a lot about
how viruses spread through a population.

00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:07.652
So if you take these three analogies
together and exploit them,

00:09:07.676 --> 00:09:10.912
you can come up with a mathematical
model of what actually happened,

00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:13.340
that's capable of replicating
the general patterns

00:09:13.364 --> 00:09:14.707
of the riots themselves.

00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:18.764
Now, once we've got this,
we can almost use this as a petri dish

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:20.411
and start having conversations

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:23.574
about which areas of the city
were more susceptible than others

00:09:23.598 --> 00:09:25.475
and what police tactics could be used

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:27.806
if this were ever to happen
again in the future.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.833
Even twenty years ago, modeling
of this sort was completely unheard of.

00:09:31.857 --> 00:09:36.301
But I think that these analogies
are an incredibly important tool

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.816
in tackling problems with our society,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.246
and perhaps, ultimately improving
our society overall.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.659
So, to conclude: life is complex,

00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:48.040
but perhaps understanding it need not
necessarily be that complicated.

00:09:48.064 --> 00:09:49.222
Thank you.

00:09:49.246 --> 00:09:50.632
(Applause)
