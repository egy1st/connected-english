00:00:00.947 --> 00:00:04.318
The story starts:
I was at a friend's house,

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:08.380
and she had on her shelf
a copy of the DSM manual,

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:10.616
which is the manual of mental disorders.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.910
It lists every known mental disorder.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.967
And it used to be, back in the '50s,
a very slim pamphlet.

00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:19.616
And then it got bigger
and bigger and bigger,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.722
and now it's 886 pages long.

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:27.090
And it lists currently
374 mental disorders.

00:00:27.448 --> 00:00:28.832
So I was leafing through it,

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:31.773
wondering if I had any mental disorders,

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.458
and it turns out I've got 12.

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:34.633
(Laughter)

00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:37.355
I've got generalized anxiety disorder,

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.625
which is a given.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.665
I've got nightmare disorder,

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:42.054
which is categorized

00:00:42.078 --> 00:00:46.118
if you have recurrent dreams of being
pursued or declared a failure,

00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:49.817
and all my dreams involve people
chasing me down the street

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.465
going, "You're a failure!"

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.272
(Laughter)

00:00:53.296 --> 00:00:56.398
I've got parent-child relational problems,

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:58.367
which I blame my parents for.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.286
(Laughter)

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.668
I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.

00:01:02.692 --> 00:01:03.842
I'm kidding.

00:01:04.628 --> 00:01:05.864
And I've got malingering.

00:01:05.888 --> 00:01:07.624
And I think it's actually quite rare

00:01:07.648 --> 00:01:10.664
to have both malingering
and generalized anxiety disorder,

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:13.399
because malingering tends
to make me feel very anxious.

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.411
Anyway, I was looking through this book,

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:18.036
wondering if I was much crazier
than I thought I was,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.593
or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose
yourself with a mental disorder

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:23.743
if you're not a trained professional,

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:28.640
or maybe the psychiatry profession
has a kind of strange desire

00:01:28.664 --> 00:01:33.030
to label what's essentially normal
human behavior as a mental disorder.

00:01:33.054 --> 00:01:36.832
I didn't know which of these was true,
but I thought it was kind of interesting,

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:39.716
and I thought maybe I should
meet a critic of psychiatry

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.124
to get their view,

00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:44.486
which is how I ended up having
lunch with the Scientologists.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.746
(Laughter)

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.268
It was a man called Brian,
who runs a crack team of Scientologists

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:54.560
who are determined to destroy
psychiatry wherever it lies.

00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:56.573
They're called the CCHR.

00:01:56.597 --> 00:01:59.548
And I said to him, "Can you prove to me

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:03.049
that psychiatry is a pseudo-science
that can't be trusted?"

00:02:03.652 --> 00:02:05.839
And he said, "Yes,
we can prove it to you."

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:07.276
And I said, "How?"

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.085
And he said, "We're going
to introduce you to Tony."

00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:12.344
And I said, "Who's Tony?"

00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:16.283
And he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor."

00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:18.617
Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:23.275
It used to be known as the Broadmoor
Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.735
It's where they send the serial killers,

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.815
and the people who can't help themselves.

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.996
And I said to Brian,
"Well, what did Tony do?"

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.469
And he said, "Hardly anything.

00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:37.106
He beat someone up or something,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.225
and he decided to fake madness
to get out of a prison sentence.

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.762
But he faked it too well,
and now he's stuck in Broadmoor

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:49.247
and nobody will believe he's sane.

00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:53.008
Do you want us to try and get you
into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"

00:02:53.032 --> 00:02:54.244
So I said, "Yes, please."

00:02:55.386 --> 00:02:56.910
So I got the train to Broadmoor.

00:02:56.934 --> 00:03:01.029
I began to yawn uncontrollably
around Kempton Park,

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:03.435
which apparently is what dogs
also do when anxious,

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.712
they yawn uncontrollably.

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:07.012
And we got to Broadmoor.

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:11.911
And I got taken through gate
after gate after gate after gate

00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:15.432
into the wellness center, which is where
you get to meet the patients.

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.894
It looks like a giant Hampton Inn.

00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:22.829
It's all peach and pine
and calming colors.

00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:28.045
And the only bold colors
are the reds of the panic buttons.

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:30.914
And the patients started drifting in.

00:03:32.148 --> 00:03:35.729
And they were quite overweight
and wearing sweatpants,

00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:37.412
and quite docile-looking.

00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:40.175
And Brian the Scientologist
whispered to me,

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.109
"They're medicated,"

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:45.352
which, to the Scientologists,
is like the worst evil in the world,

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:47.957
but I'm thinking
it's probably a good idea.

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:49.577
(Laughter)

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.160
And then Brian said, "Here's Tony."

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.678
And a man was walking in.

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:58.269
And he wasn't overweight,
he was in very good physical shape.

00:03:58.293 --> 00:04:00.596
And he wasn't wearing sweatpants,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.010
he was wearing a pinstripe suit.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.030
And he had his arm outstretched

00:04:05.054 --> 00:04:07.114
like someone out of The Apprentice.

00:04:07.138 --> 00:04:10.420
He looked like a man
who wanted to wear an outfit

00:04:10.444 --> 00:04:14.215
that would convince me
that he was very sane.

00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:16.154
And he sat down.

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:19.083
And I said, "So is it true
that you faked your way in here?"

00:04:19.503 --> 00:04:22.947
And he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely.
I beat someone up when I was 17.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.053
And I was in prison awaiting trial,

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:26.392
and my cellmate said to me,

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:27.900
'You know what you have to do?

00:04:27.924 --> 00:04:29.299
Fake madness.

00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:33.523
Tell them you're mad, you'll get
sent to some cushy hospital.

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:37.378
Nurses will bring you pizzas,
you'll have your own PlayStation.'"

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.094
I said, "Well, how did you do it?"

00:04:39.118 --> 00:04:41.861
He said, "Well, I asked to see
the prison psychiatrist.

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:44.172
And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,'

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:48.299
in which people get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:50.272
So I said to the psychiatrist,

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:54.061
'I get sexual pleasure
from crashing cars into walls.'"

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.510
And I said, "What else?"

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:58.187
He said, "Oh, yeah.
I told the psychiatrist

00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:01.495
that I wanted to watch women as they died,

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.684
because it would make
me feel more normal."

00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:05.430
I said, "Where'd you get that from?"

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:08.238
He said, "Oh, from a biography
of Ted Bundy that they had

00:05:08.262 --> 00:05:09.455
at the prison library."

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:13.716
Anyway, he faked madness
too well, he said.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.210
And they didn't send him
to some cushy hospital.

00:05:16.234 --> 00:05:17.815
They sent him to Broadmoor.

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:19.876
And the minute he got there,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.006
said he took one look at the place,
asked to see the psychiatrist,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.548
said, "There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:26.981
I'm not mentally ill."

00:05:27.772 --> 00:05:30.038
I said, "How long have you been here for?"

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:32.408
He said, "Well, if I'd just
done my time in prison

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:35.135
for the original crime,
I'd have got five years.

00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:38.027
I've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."

00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:44.940
Tony said that it's a lot harder
to convince people you're sane

00:05:44.964 --> 00:05:47.448
than it is to convince them you're crazy.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.695
He said, "I thought
the best way to seem normal

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.339
would be to talk to people
normally about normal things

00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:54.241
like football or what's on TV.

00:05:54.265 --> 00:05:56.003
I subscribe to New Scientist,

00:05:56.027 --> 00:05:57.694
and recently they had an article

00:05:57.718 --> 00:06:02.078
about how the U.S. Army was training
bumblebees to sniff out explosives.

00:06:02.102 --> 00:06:03.521
So I said to a nurse,

00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:06.144
'Did you know that the U.S. Army
is training bumblebees

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:07.496
to sniff out explosives?'

00:06:08.587 --> 00:06:11.042
When I read my medical notes,
I saw they'd written:

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:14.398
'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"

00:06:14.422 --> 00:06:15.976
(Laughter)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.107
He said, "You know, they're always
looking out for nonverbal clues

00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:20.871
to my mental state.

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.532
But how do you sit in a sane way?

00:06:23.556 --> 00:06:25.828
How do you cross your legs in a sane way?

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:27.360
It's just impossible."

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:28.933
When Tony said that to me,

00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:32.466
I thought to myself,
"Am I sitting like a journalist?

00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:35.156
Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"

00:06:36.072 --> 00:06:41.144
He said, "You know, I've got
the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:43.557
and I've got the 'Tiptoe
Through the Tulips' rapist

00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:44.948
on the other side of me.

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:48.421
So I tend to stay in my room a lot
because I find them quite frightening.

00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:50.706
And they take that as a sign of madness.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.245
They say it proves
that I'm aloof and grandiose."

00:06:54.693 --> 00:06:58.489
So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting
to hang out with serial killers

00:06:58.513 --> 00:07:00.100
be a sign of madness.

00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:03.200
Anyway, he seemed completely normal
to me, but what did I know?

00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:06.734
And when I got home I emailed
his clinician, Anthony Maden.

00:07:06.758 --> 00:07:08.332
I said, "What's the story?"

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:11.867
And he said, "Yep.
We accept that Tony faked madness

00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:15.657
to get out of a prison sentence,
because his hallucinations --

00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.832
that had seemed
quite cliche to begin with --

00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:20.474
just vanished the minute
he got to Broadmoor.

00:07:20.498 --> 00:07:22.703
However, we have assessed him,

00:07:22.727 --> 00:07:25.140
and we've determined that what he is

00:07:25.164 --> 00:07:26.552
is a psychopath."

00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:28.791
And in fact, faking madness

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:33.181
is exactly the kind of cunning
and manipulative act of a psychopath.

00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:35.623
It's on the checklist:
cunning, manipulative.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.727
So, faking your brain going wrong

00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:40.983
is evidence that your brain
has gone wrong.

00:07:41.007 --> 00:07:42.579
And I spoke to other experts,

00:07:42.603 --> 00:07:46.542
and they said the pinstripe
suit -- classic psychopath --

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:48.844
speaks to items one
and two on the checklist:

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:52.212
glibness, superficial charm
and grandiose sense of self-worth.

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:56.321
And I said, "Well, but why didn't
he hang out with the other patients?"

00:07:56.345 --> 00:08:00.275
Classic psychopath -- it speaks
to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.

00:08:00.718 --> 00:08:04.182
So all the things that had seemed
most normal about Tony

00:08:04.206 --> 00:08:07.231
was evidence, according to his clinician,

00:08:07.255 --> 00:08:09.079
that he was mad in this new way.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.833
He was a psychopath.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:14.382
And his clinician said to me, "If you
want to know more about psychopaths,

00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:17.611
you can go on a psychopath-spotting course

00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:20.522
run by Robert Hare, who invented
the psychopath checklist."

00:08:20.546 --> 00:08:21.706
So I did.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.773
I went on a psychopath-spotting course,

00:08:23.797 --> 00:08:27.974
and I am now a certified --

00:08:27.998 --> 00:08:32.257
and I have to say, extremely adept --
psychopath spotter.

00:08:32.934 --> 00:08:36.179
So, here's the statistics:

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:40.325
One in a hundred regular people
is a psychopath.

00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:44.828
So there's 1,500 people in his room.

00:08:44.852 --> 00:08:47.895
Fifteen of you are psychopaths.

00:08:49.831 --> 00:08:54.813
Although that figure rises to four percent
of CEOs and business leaders,

00:08:54.837 --> 00:08:57.572
so I think there's a very good chance

00:08:57.596 --> 00:09:02.710
there's about 30 or 40
psychopaths in this room.

00:09:02.734 --> 00:09:05.168
It could be carnage
by the end of the night.

00:09:05.192 --> 00:09:09.648
(Laughter)

00:09:09.672 --> 00:09:14.568
Hare said the reason why
is because capitalism at its most ruthless

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:17.236
rewards psychopathic behavior --

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.197
the lack of empathy, the glibness,

00:09:22.221 --> 00:09:24.579
cunning, manipulative.

00:09:24.603 --> 00:09:27.568
In fact, capitalism, perhaps
at its most remorseless,

00:09:27.592 --> 00:09:31.371
is a physical manifestation
of psychopathy.

00:09:32.117 --> 00:09:36.970
It's like a form of psychopathy
that's come down to affect us all.

00:09:37.307 --> 00:09:40.178
Hare said, "You know what?
Forget about some guy at Broadmoor

00:09:40.202 --> 00:09:42.017
who may or may not have faked madness.

00:09:42.041 --> 00:09:43.662
Who cares? That's not a big story.

00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:46.579
The big story," he said,
"is corporate psychopathy.

00:09:46.603 --> 00:09:50.434
You want to go and interview yourself
some corporate psychopaths."

00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:54.139
So I gave it a try.
I wrote to the Enron people.

00:09:54.163 --> 00:09:56.509
I said, "Could I come
and interview you in prison,

00:09:56.533 --> 00:09:58.303
to find out it you're psychopaths?"

00:09:58.327 --> 00:09:59.557
(Laughter)

00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:00.857
And they didn't reply.

00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:02.431
(Laughter)

00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:04.352
So I changed tack.

00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:07.652
I emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap,

00:10:07.676 --> 00:10:11.215
the asset stripper from the 1990s.

00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:13.446
He would come into failing businesses

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.505
and close down 30 percent
of the workforce,

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:18.673
just turn American towns into ghost towns.

00:10:18.697 --> 00:10:20.150
And I emailed him and I said,

00:10:20.174 --> 00:10:22.968
"I believe you may have
a very special brain anomaly

00:10:22.992 --> 00:10:25.003
that makes you ... special,

00:10:25.027 --> 00:10:29.388
and interested in the predatory
spirit, and fearless.

00:10:29.412 --> 00:10:32.864
Can I come and interview you
about your special brain anomaly?"

00:10:32.888 --> 00:10:34.706
And he said, "Come on over!"

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.091
(Laughter)

00:10:36.115 --> 00:10:39.167
So I went to Al Dunlap's
grand Florida mansion.

00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:43.899
It was filled with sculptures
of predatory animals.

00:10:44.262 --> 00:10:47.901
There were lions and tigers --
he was taking me through the garden --

00:10:47.925 --> 00:10:50.617
there were falcons and eagles,

00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:53.145
he was saying, "Over there
you've got sharks and --"

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:55.382
he was saying this
in a less effeminate way --

00:10:55.406 --> 00:10:59.608
"You've got more sharks
and you've got tigers."

00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:02.806
It was like Narnia.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.308
(Laughter)

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.978
And then we went into his kitchen.

00:11:08.772 --> 00:11:12.924
Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in
to save failing companies,

00:11:12.948 --> 00:11:15.371
he'd close down 30 percent
of the workforce.

00:11:15.395 --> 00:11:18.574
And he'd quite often
fire people with a joke.

00:11:18.598 --> 00:11:20.943
Like, for instance,
one famous story about him,

00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:24.419
somebody came up to him and said,
"I've just bought myself a new car."

00:11:24.443 --> 00:11:26.451
And he said, "Well,
you may have a new car,

00:11:26.475 --> 00:11:29.980
but I'll tell you what you
don't have -- a job."

00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:32.698
So in his kitchen --

00:11:32.722 --> 00:11:35.680
he was in there with his wife, Judy,
and his bodyguard, Sean --

00:11:35.704 --> 00:11:37.760
and I said, "You know
how I said in my email

00:11:37.784 --> 00:11:41.420
that you might have a special brain
anomaly that makes you special?"

00:11:41.444 --> 00:11:44.346
He said, "Yeah, it's an amazing
theory, it's like Star Trek.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.582
You're going where
no man has gone before."

00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:49.710
And I said, "Well --" (Clears throat)

00:11:49.734 --> 00:11:51.063
(Laughter)

00:11:51.087 --> 00:11:54.250
Some psychologists might say

00:11:54.274 --> 00:11:56.952
that this makes you --"
(Mumbles)

00:11:56.976 --> 00:11:58.603
(Laughter)

00:11:58.627 --> 00:12:00.101
And he said, "What?"

00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:02.145
And I said, "A psychopath."

00:12:02.169 --> 00:12:06.548
And I said, "I've got a list
of psychopathic traits in my pocket.

00:12:06.572 --> 00:12:08.731
Can I go through them with you?"

00:12:09.393 --> 00:12:11.486
And he looked intrigued despite himself,

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.885
and he said, "Okay, go on."

00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:16.292
And I said, "Okay.
Grandiose sense of self-worth."

00:12:16.316 --> 00:12:19.092
Which I have to say, would
have been hard for him to deny,

00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:22.500
because he was standing
under a giant oil painting of himself.

00:12:22.524 --> 00:12:26.675
(Laughter)

00:12:26.699 --> 00:12:29.732
He said, "Well, you've
got to believe in you!"

00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:32.644
And I said, "Manipulative."

00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:34.361
He said, "That's leadership."

00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:35.386
(Laughter)

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.816
And I said, "Shallow affect,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.112
an inability to experience
a range of emotions."

00:12:40.136 --> 00:12:43.742
He said, "Who wants to be weighed
down by some nonsense emotions?"

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:45.937
So he was going down
the psychopath checklist,

00:12:45.961 --> 00:12:49.162
basically turning it
into "Who Moved My Cheese?"

00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:52.278
(Laughter)

00:12:52.302 --> 00:12:55.722
But I did notice something happening
to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.

00:12:55.746 --> 00:12:58.643
Whenever he said anything to me
that was kind of normal --

00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:01.610
like he said "no" to juvenile delinquency,

00:13:01.634 --> 00:13:03.540
he said he got accepted into West Point,

00:13:03.564 --> 00:13:06.419
and they don't let
delinquents in West Point.

00:13:06.443 --> 00:13:09.159
He said "no" to many short-term
marital relationships.

00:13:09.183 --> 00:13:10.843
He's only ever been married twice.

00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:13.814
Admittedly, his first wife
cited in her divorce papers

00:13:13.838 --> 00:13:16.278
that he once threatened her with a knife

00:13:16.302 --> 00:13:19.019
and said he always wondered
what human flesh tasted like,

00:13:19.043 --> 00:13:21.085
but people say stupid things to each other

00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:23.164
in bad marriages
in the heat of an argument,

00:13:23.188 --> 00:13:26.209
and his second marriage
has lasted 41 years.

00:13:26.233 --> 00:13:29.931
So whenever he said anything to me
that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,

00:13:29.955 --> 00:13:33.098
I thought to myself, well I'm not
going to put that in my book.

00:13:33.608 --> 00:13:36.912
And then I realized that
becoming a psychopath spotter

00:13:36.936 --> 00:13:40.412
had kind of turned me
a little bit psychopathic.

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:45.380
Because I was desperate to shove him
in a box marked "Psychopath."

00:13:45.404 --> 00:13:50.114
I was desperate to define him
by his maddest edges.

00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:51.340
And I realized, my God --

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:53.367
this is what I've been doing for 20 years.

00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:55.013
It's what all journalists do.

00:13:55.037 --> 00:13:58.497
We travel across the world
with our notepads in our hands,

00:13:58.521 --> 00:14:00.316
and we wait for the gems.

00:14:00.982 --> 00:14:05.315
And the gems are always
the outermost aspects

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:06.968
of our interviewee's personality.

00:14:06.992 --> 00:14:10.466
And we stitch them together
like medieval monks,

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.017
and we leave the normal
stuff on the floor.

00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:17.946
And you know, this is a country
that over-diagnoses

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.247
certain mental disorders hugely.

00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:22.613
Childhood bipolar --

00:14:22.637 --> 00:14:26.192
children as young as four
are being labeled bipolar

00:14:26.216 --> 00:14:28.646
because they have temper tantrums,

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.384
which scores them high
on the bipolar checklist.

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:36.236
When I got back to London, Tony phoned me.

00:14:37.437 --> 00:14:40.210
He said, "Why haven't you
been returning my calls?"

00:14:40.234 --> 00:14:43.583
I said, "Well, they say
that you're a psychopath."

00:14:43.607 --> 00:14:45.561
And he said, "I'm not a psychopath."

00:14:45.585 --> 00:14:46.744
He said, "You know what?

00:14:46.768 --> 00:14:49.440
One of the items on the checklist
is lack of remorse,

00:14:49.464 --> 00:14:52.325
but another item on the checklist
is cunning, manipulative.

00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:54.715
So when you say you feel
remorse for your crime,

00:14:54.739 --> 00:14:56.479
they say, 'Typical of the psychopath

00:14:56.503 --> 00:14:59.880
to cunningly say he feels
remorse when he doesn't.'

00:14:59.904 --> 00:15:02.972
It's like witchcraft, they turn
everything upside-down."

00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:06.556
He said, "I've got a tribunal coming up.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.820
Will you come to it?"

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.897
So I said okay.

00:15:10.523 --> 00:15:12.007
So I went to his tribunal.

00:15:12.935 --> 00:15:16.783
And after 14 years
in Broadmoor, they let him go.

00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:20.646
They decided that he shouldn't
be held indefinitely

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.360
because he scores high
on a checklist that might mean

00:15:24.384 --> 00:15:28.915
that he would have a greater
than average chance of recidivism.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.130
So they let him go.

00:15:31.154 --> 00:15:33.175
And outside in the corridor he said to me,

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:34.354
"You know what, Jon?

00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:36.804
Everyone's a bit psychopathic."

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.887
He said, "You are, I am.
Well, obviously I am."

00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:44.028
I said, "What are you going to do now?"

00:15:44.052 --> 00:15:46.235
He said, "I'm going to go to Belgium.

00:15:46.259 --> 00:15:47.937
There's a woman there that I fancy.

00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:51.916
But she's married, so I'm going to have
to get her split up from her husband."

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.697
(Laughter)

00:15:56.075 --> 00:15:59.108
Anyway, that was two years ago,

00:15:59.132 --> 00:16:00.710
and that's where my book ended.

00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:05.296
And for the last 20 months,
everything was fine.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.361
Nothing bad happened.

00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:09.524
He was living with a girl outside London.

00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:11.646
He was, according
to Brian the Scientologist,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.696
making up for lost time,
which I know sounds ominous,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.276
but isn't necessarily ominous.

00:16:16.962 --> 00:16:18.859
Unfortunately, after 20 months,

00:16:18.883 --> 00:16:21.593
he did go back to jail for a month.

00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:25.773
He got into a "fracas"
in a bar, he called it.

00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:28.745
Ended up going to jail for a month,
which I know is bad,

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:32.657
but at least a month implies
that whatever the fracas was,

00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:34.286
it wasn't too bad.

00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:36.630
And then he phoned me.

00:16:37.802 --> 00:16:42.038
And you know what, I think
it's right that Tony is out.

00:16:42.898 --> 00:16:46.053
Because you shouldn't define
people by their maddest edges.

00:16:46.077 --> 00:16:49.913
And what Tony is,
is he's a semi-psychopath.

00:16:50.332 --> 00:16:55.062
He's a gray area in a world
that doesn't like gray areas.

00:16:55.796 --> 00:16:59.793
But the gray areas
are where you find the complexity.

00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:03.213
It's where you find the humanity,

00:17:03.237 --> 00:17:05.111
and it's where you find the truth.

00:17:06.121 --> 00:17:08.229
And Tony said to me,

00:17:08.253 --> 00:17:12.125
"Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?

00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:15.449
I just want to thank you
for everything you've done for me."

00:17:15.473 --> 00:17:16.764
And I didn't go.

00:17:17.674 --> 00:17:19.494
What would you have done?

00:17:20.501 --> 00:17:21.853
Thank you.

00:17:21.877 --> 00:17:28.524
(Applause)
