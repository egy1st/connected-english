00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:06.571
(Video) Newscaster: There's a large path
of destruction here in town.

00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:09.513
... pulling trees from the ground,
shattering windows,

00:00:09.537 --> 00:00:11.306
taking the roofs off of homes ...

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:14.412
Caitria O'Neill: That was me

00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:17.793
in front of our house in Monson,
Massachusetts last June.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.158
After an EF3 tornado ripped
straight through our town

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:22.661
and took parts of our roof off,

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:24.730
I decided to stay in Massachusetts,

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:26.659
instead of pursuing the master's program

00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:29.482
I had moved my boxes
home that afternoon for.

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:32.737
Morgan O'Neill: So, on June 1,
we weren't disaster experts,

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.835
but on June 3, we started faking it.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.865
This experience changed our lives,

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:39.326
and now we're trying
to change the experience.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.795
CO: So, tornadoes
don't happen in Massachusetts,

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:45.320
and I was cleverly standing in the front
yard when one came over the hill.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:48.644
After a lamppost flew by, my family
and I sprinted into the basement.

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:51.564
Trees were thrown against the house,
the windows exploded.

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:53.457
When we finally got out the back door,

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.458
transformers were burning in the street.

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:57.212
MO: I was here in Boston.

00:00:57.236 --> 00:00:58.953
I'm a PhD student at MIT,

00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:01.270
and I happen to study atmospheric science.

00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:03.031
Actually, it gets weirder --

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:06.349
I was in the museum of science
at the time the tornado hit,

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:08.204
playing with the tornado display --

00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:09.406
(Laughter)

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.581
so I missed her call.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:14.349
I get a call from Caitria, hear the news,
and start tracking the radar online

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:17.803
to call the family back when another
supercell was forming in their area.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:20.268
I drove home late that night
with batteries and ice.

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:22.605
We live across the street
from a historic church

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:25.294
that had lost its very
iconic steeple in the storm.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.783
It had become a community
gathering place overnight.

00:01:27.807 --> 00:01:31.111
The town hall and the police department
had also suffered direct hits,

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.765
and so people wanting to help
or needing information went to the church.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.824
CO: We walked to the church because
we heard they had hot meals,

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:39.720
but when we arrived, we found problems.

00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:42.189
There were a couple large,
sweaty men with chainsaws

00:01:42.213 --> 00:01:45.623
standing in the center of the church,
but nobody knew where to send them

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.946
because no one knew the extent
of the damage yet.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.121
As we watched, they became
frustrated and left

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.100
to go find somebody to help on their own.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:54.783
MO: So we started organizing.
Why? It had to be done.

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:58.250
We found Pastor Bob and offered to give
the response some infrastructure.

00:01:58.274 --> 00:02:01.446
And then, armed with just
two laptops and one air card,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.560
we built a recovery machine.

00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:08.082
(Applause)

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:11.114
CO: That was a tornado, and everyone's
heading to the church

00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:12.804
to drop things off and volunteer.

00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:14.408
MO: Everyone's donating clothing.

00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:16.826
We should inventory
the donations piling up here.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.787
CO: And we need a hotline.
Can you make a Google Voice number?

00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:22.393
MO: Sure. And we need to tell people
what not to bring.

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:24.830
I'll make a Facebook account.
Can you print flyers?

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:27.910
CO: Yeah, but we don't even know
what houses are accepting help.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:29.939
We need to canvas and send out volunteers.

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:32.076
MO: We need to tell people
what not to bring.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.104
Hey, there's a news truck. I'll tell them.

00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:37.152
CO: You got my number off the news?
We don't need more freezers!

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:41.180
(Together) MO: Insurance won't cover it?
CO: Juice boxes coming in an hour?

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:42.828
Together: Someone get me Post-its!

00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:43.853
(Laughter)

00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:47.554
CO: And then the rest of the community
figured out that we had answers.

00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:51.219
MO: I can donate three water heaters,
but someone needs to come pick them up.

00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:52.790
CO: My car is in my living room!

00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:55.639
MO: My boyscout troop
would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes.

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:58.533
CO: My puppy is missing and insurance
doesn't cover chimneys.

00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:01.620
MO: My church group of 50
would like housing and meals for a week

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:02.974
while we repair properties.

00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:05.911
CO: You sent me to that place
on Washington Street yesterday,

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.589
and now I'm covered in poison ivy.

00:03:07.613 --> 00:03:08.712
(Laughter)

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:10.502
So this is what filled our days.

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:12.740
We had to learn
how to answer questions quickly

00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:15.014
and to solve problems in a minute or less;

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:17.238
otherwise, something
more urgent would come up,

00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:18.596
and it wouldn't get done.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.427
MO: We didn't get our authority
from the board of selectmen

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.307
or the emergency management
director or the United Way.

00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:26.957
We just started answering questions
and making decisions

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.616
because someone -- anyone -- had to.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.995
And why not me? I'm a campaign organizer.

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.187
I'm good at Facebook.

00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:34.489
And there's two of me.

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.059
(Laughter)

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:39.611
CO: The point is, if there's a flood
or a fire or a hurricane,

00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:41.396
you, or somebody like you,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.031
are going to step up
and start organizing things.

00:03:44.055 --> 00:03:46.332
The other point is that it is hard.

00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:49.047
MO: Lying on the ground
after another 17-hour day,

00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:50.878
Caitria and I would empty our pockets

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.666
and try to place dozens of scraps
of paper into context --

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.556
all bits of information
that had to be remembered and matched

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.808
in order to help someone.

00:03:57.832 --> 00:03:59.991
After another day
and a shower at the shelter,

00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:02.188
we realized it shouldn't be this hard.

00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:05.057
CO: In a country like ours
where we breathe Wi-Fi,

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.612
leveraging technology for a faster
recovery should be a no-brainer.

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:11.180
Systems like the ones
that we were creating on the fly

00:04:11.204 --> 00:04:12.497
could exist ahead of time.

00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.050
And if some community member
is in this organizing position

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:18.620
in every area after every disaster,

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:20.446
these tools should exist.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.956
MO: So, we decided to build them:

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.490
a recovery in a box, something that
could be deployed after every disaster

00:04:26.514 --> 00:04:28.010
by any local organizer.

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:31.820
CO: I decided to stay in the country,
give up the master's in Moscow

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:33.908
and to work full-time to make this happen.

00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:35.425
In the course of the past year,

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.909
we've become experts in the field
of community-powered disaster recovery.

00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:41.417
And there are three main problems
that we've observed

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:43.131
with the way things work currently.

00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:44.647
MO: The tools.

00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:48.606
Large aid organizations are exceptional
at bringing massive resources to bear

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.793
after a disaster,

00:04:49.817 --> 00:04:53.232
but they often fulfill very specific
missions, and then they leave.

00:04:53.256 --> 00:04:57.474
This leaves local residents to deal with
the thousands of spontaneous volunteers,

00:04:57.498 --> 00:04:58.657
thousands of donations,

00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:00.688
and all with no training and no tools.

00:05:00.712 --> 00:05:03.840
So they use Post-its or Excel or Facebook.

00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:07.078
But none of these tools allow you
to value high-priority information

00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:09.571
amidst all of the photos and well-wishes.

00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:10.905
CO: The timing.

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:14.097
Disaster relief is essentially
a backwards political campaign.

00:05:14.121 --> 00:05:16.843
In a political campaign,
you start with no interest

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:19.049
and no capacity to turn that into action.

00:05:19.073 --> 00:05:20.284
You build both gradually,

00:05:20.308 --> 00:05:23.459
until a moment of peak mobilization
at the time of the election.

00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:26.218
In a disaster, however,
you start with all of the interest

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:27.558
and none of the capacity.

00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:29.654
And you've only got about seven days

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:33.117
to capture 50 percent of all
of the Web searches that will ever be made

00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:34.556
to help your area.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.167
Then some sporting event happens,

00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.207
and you've got only the resources
that you've collected thus far

00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:41.584
to meet the next five years
of recovery needs.

00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:44.610
This is the slide for Katrina.

00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:47.145
This is the curve for Joplin.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.293
And this is the curve
for the Dallas tornadoes in April,

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:51.667
where we deployed software.

00:05:51.995 --> 00:05:53.153
There's a gap here.

00:05:53.693 --> 00:05:56.902
Affected households have to wait
for the insurance adjuster to visit

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:59.664
before they can start accepting help
on their properties.

00:05:59.688 --> 00:06:02.670
And you've only got about four days
of interest in Dallas.

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:05.160
MO: Data.

00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:07.018
Data is inherently unsexy,

00:06:07.042 --> 00:06:09.264
but it can jump-start an area's recovery.

00:06:09.288 --> 00:06:12.305
FEMA and the state will pay
85 percent of the cost

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:13.924
of a federally-declared disaster,

00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:16.589
leaving the town to pay
the last 15 percent of the bill.

00:06:16.613 --> 00:06:18.222
Now that expense can be huge,

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:22.200
but if the town can mobilize X amount
of volunteers for Y hours,

00:06:22.224 --> 00:06:27.065
the dollar value of that labor used
goes toward the town's contribution.

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.417
But who knows that?

00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:31.004
Now try to imagine
the sinking feeling you get

00:06:31.028 --> 00:06:34.876
when you've just sent out 2,000 volunteers
and you can't prove it.

00:06:35.622 --> 00:06:38.059
CO: These are three problems
with a common solution.

00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:41.112
If we can get the right tools
at the right time

00:06:41.136 --> 00:06:43.102
to the people who will inevitably step up

00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:45.481
and start putting
their communities back together,

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:48.207
we can create new standards
in disaster recovery.

00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.165
MO: We needed canvasing tools,
donations databasing,

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.179
needs reporting, remote volunteer access,

00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:56.050
all in an easy-to-use website.

00:06:56.074 --> 00:06:57.511
CO: And we needed help.

00:06:57.535 --> 00:07:00.699
Alvin, our software engineer
and co-founder, has built these tools.

00:07:00.723 --> 00:07:04.794
Chris and Bill have volunteered their time
to use operations and partnerships.

00:07:04.818 --> 00:07:08.310
And we've been flying into disaster areas
since this past January,

00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:10.683
setting up software, training residents

00:07:10.707 --> 00:07:14.945
and licensing the software to areas
that are preparing for disasters.

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.795
MO: One of our first launches
was after the Dallas tornadoes

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:18.970
this past April.

00:07:18.994 --> 00:07:21.624
We flew into a town
that had a static, outdated website

00:07:21.648 --> 00:07:24.614
and a frenetic Facebook feed,
trying to structure the response,

00:07:24.638 --> 00:07:26.026
and we launched our platform.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.292
All of the interest came
in the first four days,

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:30.286
but by the time they lost the news cycle,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.747
that's when the needs came in,

00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:34.941
yet they had this massive resource
of what people were able to give

00:07:34.965 --> 00:07:37.729
and they've been able to meet
the needs of their residents.

00:07:37.753 --> 00:07:39.809
CO: So it's working,
but it could be better.

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:42.511
Emergency preparedness is a big deal
in disaster recovery

00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:44.784
because it makes towns safer
and more resilient.

00:07:44.808 --> 00:07:47.699
Imagine if we could have
these systems ready to go in a place

00:07:47.723 --> 00:07:49.496
before a disaster.

00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:51.780
So that's what we're working on.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:55.013
We're working on getting the software
to places so people expect it,

00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:56.378
so people know how to use it

00:07:56.402 --> 00:07:58.184
and so it can be filled ahead of time

00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.590
with that micro-information
that drives recovery.

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:02.447
MO: It's not rocket science.

00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:04.690
These tools are obvious
and people want them.

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:07.142
In our hometown,
we trained a half-dozen residents

00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:08.888
to run these Web tools on their own,

00:08:08.912 --> 00:08:11.100
because Caitria and I
live here, in Boston.

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:14.100
They took to it immediately,
and now they are forces of nature.

00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:17.079
There are over three volunteer groups
working almost every day,

00:08:17.103 --> 00:08:19.111
and have been since June 1 of last year,

00:08:19.135 --> 00:08:22.718
to make sure these residents get what
they need and get back in their homes.

00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:25.065
They have hotlines
and spreadsheets and data.

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:27.179
CO: And that makes a difference.

00:08:27.203 --> 00:08:31.057
June 1 this year marked the one-year
anniversary of the Monson tornado,

00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:34.374
and our community's never been
more connected or more empowered.

00:08:34.398 --> 00:08:38.630
We've been able to see the same
transformation in Texas and in Alabama.

00:08:38.654 --> 00:08:40.477
Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:42.566
to fly in and fix problems
after a disaster;

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.914
it takes a local.

00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:46.793
No matter how good an aid organization
is at what they do,

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.492
they eventually have to go home.

00:08:48.516 --> 00:08:50.730
But if you give locals the tools,

00:08:50.754 --> 00:08:53.559
if you show them
what they can do to recover,

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:55.138
they become experts.

00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:58.031
(Applause)

00:08:58.055 --> 00:08:59.207
MO: All right. Let's go.

00:08:59.231 --> 00:09:02.460
(Applause)
