00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:02.221
I want to talk to you today about something

00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:05.236
the open-source programming world can teach democracy,

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:06.871
but before that, a little preamble.

00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:08.691
Let's start here.

00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.086
This is Martha Payne. Martha's a 9-year-old Scot

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:14.107
who lives in the Council of Argyll and Bute.

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:16.800
A couple months ago, Payne started a food blog

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.673
called NeverSeconds, and she would take her camera

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:21.953
with her every day to school to document

00:00:21.953 --> 00:00:23.967
her school lunches.

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.856
Can you spot the vegetable? (Laughter)

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:29.610
And, as sometimes happens,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.200
this blog acquired first dozens of readers,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.880
and then hundreds of readers,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.466
and then thousands of readers, as people tuned in

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.134
to watch her rate her school lunches,

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:39.659
including on my favorite category,

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.251
"Pieces of hair found in food." (Laughter)

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:46.722
This was a zero day. That's good.

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:49.916
And then two weeks ago yesterday, she posted this.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.827
A post that read: "Goodbye."

00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:55.041
And she said, "I'm very sorry to tell you this, but

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.785
my head teacher pulled me out of class today and told me

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.781
I'm not allowed to take pictures in the lunch room anymore.

00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:02.507
I really enjoyed doing this.

00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:05.737
Thank you for reading. Goodbye."

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:10.915
You can guess what happened next, right? (Laughter)

00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:16.833
The outrage was so swift, so voluminous, so unanimous,

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:19.764
that the Council of Argyll and Bute reversed themselves

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.065
the same day and said, "We would,

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.231
we would never censor a nine-year-old." (Laughter)

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:25.708
Except, of course, this morning. (Laughter)

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:30.121
And this brings up the question,

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.335
what made them think they could get away

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:34.385
with something like that? (Laughter)

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:39.102
And the answer is, all of human history prior to now.

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:42.650
(Laughter) So,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.575
what happens when a medium suddenly puts

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:50.279
a lot of new ideas into circulation?

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.384
Now, this isn't just a contemporaneous question.

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:54.384
This is something we've faced several times

00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:55.740
over the last few centuries.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.725
When the telegraph came along, it was clear

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.943
that it was going to globalize the news industry.

00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:01.432
What would this lead to?

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:04.996
Well, obviously, it would lead to world peace.

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:07.806
The television, a medium that allowed us not just to hear

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.573
but see, literally see, what was going on

00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:12.890
elsewhere in the world, what would this lead to?

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.130
World peace. (Laughter)

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.087
The telephone?

00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:18.682
You guessed it: world peace.

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:23.656
Sorry for the spoiler alert, but no world peace. Not yet.

00:02:23.656 --> 00:02:26.135
Even the printing press, even the printing press

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:29.264
was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce

00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:32.917
Catholic intellectual hegemony across Europe.

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:35.401
Instead, what we got was Martin Luther's 95 Theses,

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.421
the Protestant Reformation, and, you know,

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:39.779
the Thirty Years' War. All right,

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:44.010
so what all of these predictions of world peace got right

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.541
is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.467
come into circulation, it changes society.

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:52.999
What they got exactly wrong was what happens next.

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.548
The more ideas there are in circulation,

00:02:55.548 --> 00:03:00.256
the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with.

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:05.029
More media always means more arguing.

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:07.949
That's what happens when the media's space expands.

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.852
And yet, when we look back on the printing press

00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:14.231
in the early years, we like what happened.

00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.475
We are a pro-printing press society.

00:03:17.475 --> 00:03:19.445
So how do we square those two things,

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:22.201
that it leads to more arguing, but we think it was good?

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:24.800
And the answer, I think, can be found in things like this.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.085
This is the cover of "Philosophical Transactions,"

00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:30.707
the first scientific journal ever published in English

00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:32.589
in the middle of the 1600s,

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.416
and it was created by a group of people who had been

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:36.053
calling themselves "The Invisible College,"

00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:38.257
a group of natural philosophers who only later

00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:40.862
would call themselves scientists,

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:44.406
and they wanted to improve the way

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:47.063
natural philosophers argued with each other,

00:03:47.063 --> 00:03:49.053
and they needed to do two things for this.

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:51.537
They needed openness. They needed to create a norm

00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:53.396
which said, when you do an experiment,

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:56.081
you have to publish not just your claims,

00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:57.507
but how you did the experiment.

00:03:57.507 --> 00:04:00.304
If you don't tell us how you did it, we won't trust you.

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:02.664
But the other thing they needed was speed.

00:04:02.664 --> 00:04:04.969
They had to quickly synchronize what

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.423
other natural philosophers knew. Otherwise,

00:04:07.423 --> 00:04:10.280
you couldn't get the right kind of argument going.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.230
The printing press was clearly the right medium for this,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.816
but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow.

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:18.678
And so they invented the scientific journal

00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:21.464
as a way of synchronizing the argument

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:24.018
across the community of natural scientists.

00:04:24.018 --> 00:04:27.516
The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press.

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:29.662
It was created by scientists,

00:04:29.662 --> 00:04:31.521
but it couldn't have been created if they didn't have

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.691
a printing press as a tool.

00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:35.931
So what about us? What about our generation,

00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:37.934
and our media revolution, the Internet?

00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:42.053
Well, predictions of world peace? Check. (Laughter)

00:04:42.053 --> 00:04:50.636
More arguing? Gold star on that one. (Laughter)

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:51.947
(Laughter)

00:04:51.947 --> 00:04:56.294
I mean, YouTube is just a gold mine. (Laughter)

00:04:56.294 --> 00:05:00.389
Better arguing? That's the question.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.433
So I study social media, which means,

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:05.044
to a first approximation, I watch people argue.

00:05:05.044 --> 00:05:09.151
And if I had to pick a group that I think is

00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:12.944
our Invisible College, is our generation's collection of people

00:05:12.944 --> 00:05:16.103
trying to take these tools and to press it into service,

00:05:16.103 --> 00:05:18.884
not for more arguments, but for better arguments,

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.279
I'd pick the open-source programmers.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.541
Programming is a three-way relationship

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.825
between a programmer, some source code,

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.439
and the computer it's meant to run on, but computers

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.141
are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions

00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:37.164
that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set

00:05:37.164 --> 00:05:40.202
of instructions that the computer knows how to execute,

00:05:40.202 --> 00:05:42.068
and that's if one person is writing it.

00:05:42.068 --> 00:05:44.167
Once you get more than one person writing it,

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:47.251
it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite

00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:49.912
each other's work if they're working on the same file,

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:52.094
or to send incompatible instructions

00:05:52.094 --> 00:05:54.535
that simply causes the computer to choke,

00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:57.494
and this problem grows larger

00:05:57.494 --> 00:06:00.263
the more programmers are involved.

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:03.610
To a first approximation, the problem of managing

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.336
a large software project is the problem

00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:09.992
of keeping this social chaos at bay.

00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:12.467
Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:14.121
to this problem, which is to use something called

00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:16.101
a "version control system,"

00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:18.310
and a version control system does what is says on the tin.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.704
It provides a canonical copy of the software

00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:23.256
on a server somewhere.

00:06:23.256 --> 00:06:26.162
The only programmers who can change it are people

00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:29.693
who've specifically been given permission to access it,

00:06:29.693 --> 00:06:33.460
and they're only allowed to access the sub-section of it

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.890
that they have permission to change.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.075
And when people draw diagrams of version control systems,

00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:41.440
the diagrams always look something like this.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.318
All right. They look like org charts.

00:06:44.318 --> 00:06:45.725
And you don't have to squint very hard

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:49.190
to see the political ramifications of a system like this.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.666
This is feudalism: one owner, many workers.

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:56.990
Now, that's fine for the commercial software industry.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.380
It really is Microsoft's Office. It's Adobe's Photoshop.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.212
The corporation owns the software.

00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:07.526
The programmers come and go.

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:10.899
But there was one programmer who decided

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:13.887
that this wasn't the way to work.

00:07:13.887 --> 00:07:15.149
This is Linus Torvalds.

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:17.301
Torvalds is the most famous open-source programmer,

00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:22.602
created Linux, obviously, and Torvalds looked at the way

00:07:22.602 --> 00:07:26.114
the open-source movement had been dealing with this problem.

00:07:26.114 --> 00:07:30.738
Open-source software, the core promise of the open-source license,

00:07:30.738 --> 00:07:34.484
is that everybody should have access to all the source code

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:37.737
all the time, but of course, this creates

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:41.044
the very threat of chaos you have to forestall

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.622
in order to get anything working.

00:07:42.622 --> 00:07:45.104
So most open-source projects just held their noses

00:07:45.104 --> 00:07:47.784
and adopted the feudal management systems.

00:07:47.784 --> 00:07:50.292
But Torvalds said, "No, I'm not going to do that."

00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:53.857
His point of view on this was very clear.

00:07:53.857 --> 00:07:56.390
When you adopt a tool, you also adopt

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.979
the management philosophy embedded in that tool,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:03.115
and he wasn't going to adopt anything that didn't work

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:05.424
the way the Linux community worked.

00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:07.956
And to give you a sense of how enormous

00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:11.624
a decision like this was, this is a map

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:15.113
of the internal dependencies within Linux,

00:08:15.113 --> 00:08:17.720
within the Linux operating system, which sub-parts

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.165
of the program rely on which other sub-parts to get going.

00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:25.743
This is a tremendously complicated process.

00:08:25.743 --> 00:08:28.535
This is a tremendously complicated program,

00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:31.200
and yet, for years, Torvalds ran this

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.104
not with automated tools but out of his email box.

00:08:35.104 --> 00:08:37.577
People would literally mail him changes

00:08:37.577 --> 00:08:41.696
that they'd agreed on, and he would merge them by hand.

00:08:41.696 --> 00:08:46.442
And then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:49.252
how the community worked, he said, "I think I know

00:08:49.252 --> 00:08:53.419
how to write a version control system for free people."

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:59.314
And he called it "Git." Git is distributed version control.

00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:02.338
It has two big differences

00:09:02.338 --> 00:09:04.401
with traditional version control systems.

00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:07.548
The first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise

00:09:07.548 --> 00:09:10.834
of open-source. Everybody who works on a project

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:14.505
has access to all of the source code all of the time.

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:17.179
And when people draw diagrams of Git workflow,

00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:20.116
they use drawings that look like this.

00:09:20.116 --> 00:09:22.434
And you don't have to understand what the circles

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:26.113
and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more

00:09:26.113 --> 00:09:29.208
complicated way of working than is supported

00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:31.929
by ordinary version control systems.

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:36.238
But this is also the thing that brings the chaos back,

00:09:36.238 --> 00:09:39.288
and this is Git's second big innovation.

00:09:39.288 --> 00:09:43.284
This is a screenshot from GitHub, the premier Git hosting service,

00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:46.634
and every time a programmer uses Git

00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:49.795
to make any important change at all,

00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:53.104
creating a new file, modifying an existing one,

00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:57.778
merging two files, Git creates this kind of signature.

00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:00.921
This long string of numbers and letters here

00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:05.996
is a unique identifier tied to every single change,

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:08.853
but without any central coordination.

00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:13.342
Every Git system generates this number the same way,

00:10:13.342 --> 00:10:16.684
which means this is a signature tied directly

00:10:16.684 --> 00:10:19.834
and unforgeably to a particular change.

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:21.770
This has the following effect:

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.448
A programmer in Edinburgh and a programmer in Entebbe

00:10:25.448 --> 00:10:29.150
can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.976
Each of them can make changes and they can merge them

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:35.911
after the fact even if they didn't know

00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:38.870
of each other's existence beforehand.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.369
This is cooperation without coordination.

00:10:42.369 --> 00:10:45.305
This is the big change.

00:10:45.305 --> 00:10:50.515
Now, I tell you all of this not to convince you that it's great

00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:54.212
that open-source programmers now have a tool

00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:57.305
that supports their philosophical way of working,

00:10:57.305 --> 00:10:59.409
although I think that is great.

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.177
I tell you all of this because of what I think it means

00:11:02.177 --> 00:11:04.371
for the way communities come together.

00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:10.690
Once Git allowed for cooperation without coordination,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.630
you start to see communities form

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.882
that are enormously large and complex.

00:11:17.882 --> 00:11:20.161
This is a graph of the Ruby community.

00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:21.690
It's an open-source programming language,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.688
and all of the interconnections between the people --

00:11:24.688 --> 00:11:27.087
this is now not a software graph, but a people graph,

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:29.189
all of the interconnections among the people

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.532
working on that project —

00:11:31.532 --> 00:11:34.522
and this doesn't look like an org chart.

00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:37.942
This looks like a dis-org chart, and yet,

00:11:37.942 --> 00:11:40.550
out of this community, but using these tools,

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.836
they can now create something together.

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:47.201
So there are two good reasons to think that

00:11:47.201 --> 00:11:51.374
this kind of technique can be applied

00:11:51.374 --> 00:11:55.907
to democracies in general and in particular to the law.

00:11:55.907 --> 00:11:57.765
When you make the claim, in fact,

00:11:57.765 --> 00:12:00.723
that something on the Internet is going to be good

00:12:00.723 --> 00:12:03.164
for democracy, you often get this reaction.

00:12:03.164 --> 00:12:09.088
(Music) (Laughter)

00:12:09.088 --> 00:12:11.614
Which is, are you talking about the thing

00:12:11.614 --> 00:12:14.025
with the singing cats? Like, is that the thing

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.654
you think is going to be good for society?

00:12:16.654 --> 00:12:18.789
To which I have to say, here's the thing

00:12:18.789 --> 00:12:22.150
with the singing cats. That always happens.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.883
And I don't just mean that always happens with the Internet,

00:12:23.883 --> 00:12:26.463
I mean that always happens with media, full stop.

00:12:26.463 --> 00:12:28.503
It did not take long after the rise

00:12:28.503 --> 00:12:31.179
of the commercial printing press before someone

00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:34.492
figured out that erotic novels were a good idea. (Laughter)

00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:37.534
You don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books

00:12:37.534 --> 00:12:40.555
very long before someone says, "Hey, you know what I bet

00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:42.723
people would pay for?" (Laughter)

00:12:42.723 --> 00:12:46.273
It took people another 150 years to even think

00:12:46.273 --> 00:12:53.033
of the scientific journal, right? So -- (Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:56.071
So the harnessing by the Invisible College

00:12:56.071 --> 00:12:58.456
of the printing press to create the scientific journal

00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:01.367
was phenomenally important, but it didn't happen big,

00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:04.126
and it didn't happen quick, and it didn't happen fast, so

00:13:04.126 --> 00:13:07.424
if you're going to look for where the change is happening,

00:13:07.424 --> 00:13:09.440
you have to look on the margins.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.904
So, the law is also dependency-related.

00:13:14.904 --> 00:13:18.313
This is a graph of the U.S. Tax Code,

00:13:18.313 --> 00:13:21.393
and the dependencies of one law on other laws

00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:23.791
for the overall effect.

00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:27.223
So there's that as a site for source code management.

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.125
But there's also the fact that law is another place

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:31.399
where there are many opinions in circulation,

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:34.907
but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy,

00:13:34.907 --> 00:13:37.484
and when you go onto GitHub, and you look around,

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.553
there are millions and millions of projects,

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:40.907
almost all of which are source code,

00:13:40.907 --> 00:13:43.592
but if you look around the edges, you can see people

00:13:43.592 --> 00:13:45.801
experimenting with the political ramifications

00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:47.414
of a system like that.

00:13:47.414 --> 00:13:49.224
Someone put up all the Wikileaked cables

00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:51.489
from the State Department, along with software used

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:54.678
to interpret them, including my favorite use ever

00:13:54.678 --> 00:13:57.049
of the Cablegate cables, which is a tool for detecting

00:13:57.049 --> 00:14:00.064
naturally occurring haiku in State Department prose.

00:14:00.064 --> 00:14:05.960
(Laughter)

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.032
Right. (Laughter)

00:14:09.032 --> 00:14:11.831
The New York Senate has put up something called

00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:14.238
Open Legislation, also hosting it on GitHub,

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:16.624
again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity.

00:14:16.624 --> 00:14:19.290
You can go and pick your Senator and then you can see

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.325
a list of bills they have sponsored.

00:14:21.325 --> 00:14:24.957
Someone going by Divegeek has put up the Utah code,

00:14:24.957 --> 00:14:27.722
the laws of the state of Utah, and they've put it up there

00:14:27.722 --> 00:14:29.171
not just to distribute the code,

00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:32.369
but with the very interesting possibility that this could

00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:36.924
be used to further the development of legislation.

00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:40.763
Somebody put up a tool during the copyright debate

00:14:40.763 --> 00:14:44.949
last year in the Senate, saying, "It's strange that Hollywood

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:48.073
has more access to Canadian legislators

00:14:48.073 --> 00:14:51.889
than Canadian citizens do. Why don't we use GitHub

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:56.365
to show them what a citizen-developed bill might look like?"

00:14:56.365 --> 00:15:00.117
And it includes this very evocative screenshot.

00:15:00.117 --> 00:15:03.095
This is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here.

00:15:03.095 --> 00:15:06.065
This shows you, for text that many people are editing,

00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:08.266
when a change was made, who made it,

00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:09.269
and what the change is.

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:10.724
The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted.

00:15:10.724 --> 00:15:13.416
The stuff in green is the stuff that got added.

00:15:13.416 --> 00:15:16.198
Programmers take this capability for granted.

00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:19.123
No democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature

00:15:19.123 --> 00:15:22.938
to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets,

00:15:22.938 --> 00:15:25.468
even though those are the things done

00:15:25.468 --> 00:15:28.607
with our consent and with our money.

00:15:28.607 --> 00:15:31.845
Now, I would love to tell you that the fact

00:15:31.845 --> 00:15:35.017
that the open-source programmers have worked out

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:38.688
a collaborative method that is large scale, distributed,

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:42.153
cheap, and in sync with the ideals of democracy, I would love

00:15:42.153 --> 00:15:44.324
to tell you that because those tools are in place,

00:15:44.324 --> 00:15:48.655
the innovation is inevitable. But it's not.

00:15:48.655 --> 00:15:51.648
Part of the problem, of course, is just a lack of information.

00:15:51.648 --> 00:15:53.551
Somebody put a question up on Quora saying,

00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:55.643
"Why is it that lawmakers don't use

00:15:55.643 --> 00:15:57.050
distributed version control?"

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.671
This, graphically, was the answer. (Laughter)

00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:02.762
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:16:02.762 --> 00:16:07.784
And that is indeed part of the problem, but only part.

00:16:07.784 --> 00:16:10.961
The bigger problem, of course, is power.

00:16:10.961 --> 00:16:14.131
The people experimenting with participation don't have

00:16:14.131 --> 00:16:16.700
legislative power, and the people who have legislative

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.663
power are not experimenting with participation.

00:16:20.663 --> 00:16:22.208
They are experimenting with openness.

00:16:22.208 --> 00:16:24.068
There's no democracy worth the name that doesn't have

00:16:24.068 --> 00:16:26.996
a transparency move, but transparency is openness

00:16:26.996 --> 00:16:30.901
in only one direction, and being given a dashboard

00:16:30.901 --> 00:16:34.071
without a steering wheel has never been the core promise

00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:37.482
a democracy makes to its citizens.

00:16:37.482 --> 00:16:39.832
So consider this.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.418
The thing that got Martha Payne's opinions

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:46.109
out into the public was a piece of technology,

00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:49.743
but the thing that kept them there was political will.

00:16:49.743 --> 00:16:52.017
It was the expectation of the citizens

00:16:52.017 --> 00:16:55.552
that she would not be censored.

00:16:55.552 --> 00:17:00.880
That's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.887
We have them. We've seen them. They work.

00:17:04.887 --> 00:17:05.938
Can we use them?

00:17:05.938 --> 00:17:11.064
Can we apply the techniques that worked here to this?

00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:14.781
T.S. Eliot once said, "One of the most momentous things

00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:16.861
that can happen to a culture

00:17:16.861 --> 00:17:20.504
is that they acquire a new form of prose."

00:17:20.504 --> 00:17:22.752
I think that's wrong, but -- (Laughter)

00:17:22.752 --> 00:17:26.411
I think it's right for argumentation. Right?

00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:29.766
A momentous thing that can happen to a culture

00:17:29.766 --> 00:17:32.580
is they can acquire a new style of arguing:

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:39.250
trial by jury, voting, peer review, now this. Right?

00:17:39.296 --> 00:17:42.365
A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes,

00:17:42.365 --> 00:17:44.252
in the last decade, in fact.

00:17:44.252 --> 00:17:48.305
It's large, it's distributed, it's low-cost,

00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:51.604
and it's compatible with the ideals of democracy.

00:17:51.604 --> 00:17:53.590
The question for us now is, are we going to let

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.116
the programmers keep it to themselves?

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.165
Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service

00:17:57.165 --> 00:17:59.317
for society at large?

00:17:59.317 --> 00:18:01.917
Thank you for listening. (Applause)

00:18:01.917 --> 00:18:06.055
(Applause)

00:18:06.055 --> 00:18:11.192
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
