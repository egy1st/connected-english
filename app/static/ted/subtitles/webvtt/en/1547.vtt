WEBVTT

00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:03.139
I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.354
you hope you're not going to meet at TED.

00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:07.690
First, I don't have a mobile,

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.521
so I'm on the safe side.

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.722
Secondly, a political theorist

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:14.187
who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:18.259
is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about.

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.742
And plus, I'm not going to give you any answers.

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:24.576
I'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about.

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:26.742
And one of the things that I want to question

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:29.459
is this very popular hope these days

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.393
that transparency and openness

00:00:31.393 --> 00:00:35.693
can restore the trust in democratic institutions.

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:39.409
There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.386
You people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community.

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:45.594
(Laughter)

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:50.511
Basically you believe in complexity, but not in ambiguity.

00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:53.426
As you have been told, I'm Bulgarian.

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:55.010
And according to the surveys,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.577
we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world.

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:00.361
(Laughter)

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:03.951
The Economist magazine recently wrote an article

00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.502
covering one of the recent studies on happiness,

00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:11.336
and the title was "The Happy, the Unhappy and the Bulgarians."

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:12.936
(Laughter)

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:16.783
So now when you know what to expect,

00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:18.219
let's give you the story.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.170
And this is a rainy election day in a small country --

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.502
that can be my country, but could be also your country.

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:30.302
And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon,

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:32.987
nobody went to the polling stations.

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:34.752
But then the rain stopped,

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:36.986
people went to vote.

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:40.136
And when the votes had been counted,

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:47.452
three-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:49.802
The government and the opposition,

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:52.736
they have been simply paralyzed.

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.853
Because you know what to do about the protests.

00:01:54.853 --> 00:01:56.837
You know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.

00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:02.185
But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:06.518
So the government decided to have the elections once again.

00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:09.068
And this time even a greater number,

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:14.251
83 percent of the people, voted with blank ballots.

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:17.002
Basically they went to the ballot boxes

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.068
to tell that they have nobody to vote for.

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:25.100
This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.583
called "Seeing."

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.833
But in my view it very well captures

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:33.217
part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days.

00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:35.885
On one level nobody's questioning

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:39.784
that democracy is the best form of government.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.520
Democracy is the only game in town.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.833
The problem is that many people start to believe

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.535
that it is not a game worth playing.

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:51.833
For the last 30 years, political scientists have observed

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:56.383
that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout,

00:02:56.383 --> 00:03:00.301
and the people who are least interested to vote

00:03:00.301 --> 00:03:04.938
are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:08.363
I mean the unemployed, the under-privileged.

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:10.055
And this is a major issue.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:12.786
Because especially now with the economic crisis,

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:15.237
you can see that the trust in politics,

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:17.819
that the trust in democratic institutions,

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.738
was really destroyed.

00:03:19.738 --> 00:03:23.354
According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission,

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:28.236
89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap

00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:34.562
between the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.

00:03:34.562 --> 00:03:38.570
Only 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.720
believe that their vote matters.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.786
Basically people start to understand that they can change governments,

00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:48.288
but they cannot change policies.

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:50.904
And the question which I want to ask is the following:

00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:54.820
How did it happen that we are living in societies

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.370
which are much freer than ever before --

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.054
we have more rights, we can travel easier,

00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:02.403
we have access to more information --

00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:05.787
at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.370
basically has collapsed?

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.806
So basically I want to ask:

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:14.655
What went right and what went wrong in these 50 years

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.456
when we talk about democracy?

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:20.339
And I'll start with what went right.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.401
And the first thing that went right was, of course,

00:04:23.401 --> 00:04:25.872
these five revolutions which, in my view,

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:30.456
very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:35.681
And the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s,

00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:38.496
which put the individual at the center of politics.

00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:40.914
It was the human rights moment.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:44.764
Basically this was also a major outbreak, a culture of dissent,

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:48.630
a culture of basically non-conformism,

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.931
which was not known before.

00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:53.280
So I do believe that even things like that

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.732
are very much the children of '68 --

00:04:56.732 --> 00:05:00.147
nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.

00:05:00.147 --> 00:05:03.196
But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.

00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:06.830
And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.447
the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message:

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:13.124
"The government does not know better."

00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:16.031
And you have more choice-driven societies.

00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:22.598
And of course, you have 1989 -- the end of Communism, the end of the Cold War.

00:05:22.598 --> 00:05:24.898
And it was the birth of the global world.

00:05:24.898 --> 00:05:27.030
And you have the Internet.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.997
And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.414
to what extent the Internet empowered people.

00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:35.247
It has changed the way we are communicating

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:36.997
and basically we are viewing politics.

00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:40.015
The very idea of political community totally has changed.

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:42.330
And I'm going to name one more revolution,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.163
and this is the revolution in brain sciences,

00:05:44.163 --> 00:05:46.064
which totally changed the way

00:05:46.064 --> 00:05:49.400
we understand how people are making decisions.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.364
So this is what went right.

00:05:52.364 --> 00:05:54.698
But if we're going to see what went wrong,

00:05:54.698 --> 00:05:58.130
we're going to end up with the same five revolutions.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.631
Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s,

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:03.497
cultural and social revolution,

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:07.064
which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.

00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:11.900
The very idea, all these collective nouns that we have been taught about --

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.697
nation, class, family.

00:06:14.697 --> 00:06:17.181
We start to like divorcing, if we're married at all.

00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.530
All this was very much under attack.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.881
And it is so difficult to engage people in politics

00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:27.580
when they believe that what really matters

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.749
is where they personally stand.

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:33.499
And you have the market revolution of the 1980s

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:39.460
and the huge increase of inequality in societies.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.366
Remember, until the 1970s,

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:45.106
the spread of democracy has always been accompanied

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:48.566
by the decline of inequality.

00:06:48.566 --> 00:06:50.732
The more democratic our societies have been,

00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:54.765
the more equal they have been becoming.

00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:57.099
Now we have the reverse tendency.

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:59.799
The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:01.683
by the increase in inequality.

00:07:01.683 --> 00:07:04.917
And I find this very much disturbing

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:08.865
when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:10.749
with democracy these days.

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.751
And if you go to 1989 --

00:07:12.751 --> 00:07:16.265
something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize --

00:07:16.265 --> 00:07:20.216
but many are going to tell you, "Listen, it was the end of the Cold War

00:07:20.216 --> 00:07:25.516
that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe."

00:07:25.516 --> 00:07:27.433
When the Soviet Union was still there,

00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:30.816
the rich and the powerful, they needed the people,

00:07:30.816 --> 00:07:33.099
because they feared them.

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.400
Now the elites basically have been liberated.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.565
They're very mobile. You cannot tax them.

00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:40.899
And basically they don't fear the people.

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:43.916
So as a result of it, you have this very strange situation

00:07:43.916 --> 00:07:48.433
in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.

00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:49.932
So this is not by accident

00:07:49.932 --> 00:07:52.918
that the voters are not interested to vote anymore.

00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:55.032
And when we talk about the Internet,

00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:57.533
yes, it's true, the Internet connected all of us,

00:07:57.533 --> 00:08:04.216
but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:09.318
in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:11.250
And it's becoming more and more difficult

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.016
to understand the people who are not like you.

00:08:14.016 --> 00:08:15.884
I know that many people here

00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:20.648
have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation,

00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:24.682
but [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days?

00:08:24.682 --> 00:08:28.533
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution.

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:31.199
This is the other side of the things that we like.

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:33.217
And when you go to the brain sciences,

00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:37.583
what political consultants learned from the brain scientists

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.935
is don't talk to me about ideas anymore,

00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:43.200
don't talk to me about policy programs.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.967
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:51.034
And you have this very strongly

00:08:51.034 --> 00:08:55.435
to the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days,

00:08:55.435 --> 00:09:01.434
these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas.

00:09:01.434 --> 00:09:03.900
Before, revolutions used to have ideological names.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.833
They could be communist, they could be liberal,

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:07.618
they could be fascist or Islamic.

00:09:07.618 --> 00:09:11.866
Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used.

00:09:11.866 --> 00:09:15.000
You have Facebook revolutions, Twitter revolutions.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.400
The content doesn't matter anymore, the problem is the media.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.935
I'm saying this because one of my major points

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:26.734
is what went right is also what went wrong.

00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:30.467
And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation,

00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:33.416
when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy,

00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:35.983
we should keep this ambiguity in mind.

00:09:35.983 --> 00:09:39.001
Because probably some of the things that we love most

00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:42.202
are going to be also the things that can hurt us most.

00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:45.386
These days it's very popular to believe

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:47.700
that this push for transparency,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:54.085
this kind of a combination between active citizens, new technologies

00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:57.749
and much more transparency-friendly legislation

00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:00.817
can restore trust in politics.

00:10:00.817 --> 00:10:04.500
You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.184
it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie,

00:10:08.184 --> 00:10:10.699
it's going to be more difficult for them to steal

00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:14.384
and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.

00:10:14.384 --> 00:10:16.400
This is probably true.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.450
But I do believe that we should be also very clear

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.717
that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics

00:10:24.717 --> 00:10:28.316
where the message is, "It's transparency, stupid."

00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:31.899
Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions.

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:36.618
Transparency is politics' management of mistrust.

00:10:36.618 --> 00:10:41.150
We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.976
And by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy.

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:46.116
This is why you have checks and balances.

00:10:46.116 --> 00:10:50.267
This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust

00:10:50.267 --> 00:10:53.351
between the representatives and those whom they represent.

00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:58.250
But when politics is only management of mistrust,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.333
then -- I'm very glad that "1984" has been mentioned --

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:05.083
now we're going to have "1984" in reverse.

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:07.200
It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.500
it's going to be we being the Big Brother

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.250
watching the political class.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.866
But is this the idea of a free society?

00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:16.400
For example, can you imagine

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.518
that decent, civic, talented people are going to run for office

00:11:22.518 --> 00:11:24.300
if they really do believe

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.100
that politics is also about managing mistrust?

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.134
Are you not afraid with all these technologies

00:11:31.134 --> 00:11:33.134
that are going to track down

00:11:33.134 --> 00:11:36.749
any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues,

00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:40.616
are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:45.250
to repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions,

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.267
because consistency is going to be more important than common sense?

00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:50.949
And the Americans who are in the room,

00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:54.001
are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern

00:11:54.001 --> 00:11:57.376
on the basis of what they said in the primary elections?

00:11:57.376 --> 00:11:59.367
I find this extremely important,

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:03.399
because democracy is about people changing their views

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:06.549
based on rational arguments and discussions.

00:12:06.549 --> 00:12:10.033
And we can lose this with the very noble idea

00:12:10.033 --> 00:12:12.049
to keep people accountable

00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:14.667
for showing the people that we're not going to tolerate

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:17.385
politicians the opportunism in politics.

00:12:17.385 --> 00:12:19.717
So for me this is extremely important.

00:12:19.717 --> 00:12:22.983
And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days,

00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:25.182
probably it makes sense

00:12:25.182 --> 00:12:28.584
to look also at this type of a story.

00:12:28.584 --> 00:12:32.134
But also don't forget, any unveiling is also veiling.

00:12:32.134 --> 00:12:35.899
[Regardless of] how transparent our governments want to be,

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:38.301
they're going to be selectively transparent.

00:12:38.301 --> 00:12:40.333
In a small country that could be my country,

00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:41.766
but could be also your country,

00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:43.951
they took a decision -- it is a real case story --

00:12:43.951 --> 00:12:46.566
that all of the governmental decisions,

00:12:46.566 --> 00:12:49.132
discussions of the council of ministers,

00:12:49.132 --> 00:12:52.433
were going to be published on the Internet

00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:56.833
24 hours after the council discussions took place.

00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:59.001
And the public was extremely all for it.

00:12:59.001 --> 00:13:01.452
So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister,

00:13:01.452 --> 00:13:03.050
why he made this decision.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.766
He said, "Listen, this is the best way

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:09.394
to keep the mouths of my ministers closed.

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:12.479
Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent

00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:14.661
knowing that 24 hours after

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.565
this is going to be on the public space,

00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:20.511
and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis."

00:13:20.511 --> 00:13:21.978
So when we talk about transparency,

00:13:21.978 --> 00:13:23.577
when we talk about openness,

00:13:23.577 --> 00:13:25.694
I really do believe that what we should keep in mind

00:13:25.694 --> 00:13:29.444
is that what went right is what went wrong.

00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:33.628
And this is Goethe, who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist,

00:13:33.628 --> 00:13:36.110
some centuries ago he said,

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.447
"There is a big shadow where there is much light."

00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:40.979
Thank you very much.

00:13:40.979 --> 00:13:42.629
(Applause)
