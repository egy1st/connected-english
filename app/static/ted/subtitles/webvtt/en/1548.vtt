00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:04.247
One of my favorite words in the whole
of the Oxford English Dictionary

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.114
is "snollygoster,"

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.784
just because it sounds so good.

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:11.197
And what snollygoster means
is "a dishonest politician."

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:14.646
Although there was a 19th-century
newspaper editor

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.703
who defined it rather better when he said,

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:19.243
"A snollygoster is a fellow
who seeks office

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:22.850
regardless of party,
platform or principle,

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:24.382
and who, when he wins,

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:29.630
gets there by the sheer force
of monumental talknophical assumnancy."

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.183
(Laughter)

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:33.305
Now, I have no idea
what "talknophical" is.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.131
Something to do with words, I assume.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:38.430
But it's very important that words
are at the center of politics,

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:41.659
and all politicians know
they have to try and control language.

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:44.711
It wasn't until, for example, 1771

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:49.158
that the British Parliament
allowed newspapers to report

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.954
the exact words that were said
in the debating chamber.

00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:54.751
And this was actually
all down to the bravery

00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:58.084
of a guy with the extraordinary
name of Brass Crosby,

00:00:58.108 --> 00:00:59.834
who took on Parliament.

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:01.936
And he was thrown into the Tower of London

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.054
and imprisoned,

00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:06.887
but he was brave enough,

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:09.390
he was brave enough
to take them on, and in the end,

00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:11.849
he had such popular support
in London that he won.

00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:13.636
And it was only a few years later

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.531
that we have the first recorded use
of the phrase "as bold as brass."

00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:21.085
Most people think
that's down to the metal.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.939
It's not; it's down to a campaigner
for the freedom of the press.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:29.737
But to really show you
how words and politics interact,

00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.381
I want to take you back
to the United States of America,

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.769
just after they'd achieved independence.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:36.957
And they had to face the question

00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:39.686
of what to call
George Washington, their leader.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.966
They didn't know.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.946
What do you call the leader
of a republican country?

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:47.202
And this was debated
in Congress for ages and ages.

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:49.758
And there were all sorts
of suggestions on the table,

00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:50.977
which might have made it.

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.238
I mean, some people
wanted him to be called

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:55.052
"Chief Magistrate Washington,"

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:57.565
and other people,
"His Highness, George Washington,"

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:58.823
and other people,

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:01.605
"Protector of the Liberties

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.680
of the People of the United States
of America Washington."

00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:06.040
Not that catchy.

00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:08.781
Some people just wanted
to call him king --

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:10.311
it was tried and tested.

00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:12.065
They weren't even being monarchical,

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.303
they had the idea that you could
be elected king for a fixed term.

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:17.591
And, you know, it could have worked.

00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:19.473
And everybody got insanely bored,

00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:21.571
because this debate
went on for three weeks.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:24.585
I read a diary of this poor senator
who just keeps coming back,

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:25.857
"Still on this subject."

00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.410
And the reason for the delay
and the boredom

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:32.049
was that the House of Representatives
were against the Senate.

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:36.290
The House of Representatives didn't want
Washington to get drunk on power.

00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:39.401
They didn't want to call him "king,"
in case that gave him ideas,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.765
or his successor ideas.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.936
So they wanted to give him
the humblest, meagerest,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.607
most pathetic title
that they could think of.

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:48.586
And that title ...

00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:50.839
was "President."

00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:52.927
(Laughter)

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:54.978
"President." They didn't invent the title.

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:56.324
I mean, it existed before,

00:02:56.348 --> 00:02:59.013
but it just meant somebody
who presides over a meeting.

00:02:59.037 --> 00:03:00.920
It was like the foreman of the jury.

00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:02.780
And it didn't have much more grandeur

00:03:02.804 --> 00:03:04.658
than the term "foreman" or "overseer."

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:07.555
There were occasional presidents
of little colonial councils

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:08.751
and bits of government,

00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:10.540
but it was really a nothing title.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.000
And that's why the Senate objected to it.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:16.773
They said, "That's ridiculous!
You can't call him 'President.'

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:20.216
This guy has to go and sign treaties
and meet foreign dignitaries.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.795
Who's going to take him seriously
if he's got a silly little title

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.460
like 'President of the United
States of America'?"

00:03:26.484 --> 00:03:27.495
(Laughter)

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.951
And after three weeks
of debate, in the end,

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:33.985
the Senate did not cave in.

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:40.226
Instead, they agreed to use
the title "President" for now.

00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:43.840
But they also wanted
it absolutely set down

00:03:43.864 --> 00:03:45.681
that they didn't agree with it,

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:52.418
from a decent respect for the opinions
and practice of civilized nations,

00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:56.246
whether under republican
or monarchical forms of government,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.384
whose custom it is to annex,

00:03:58.408 --> 00:04:00.424
through the office
of the Chief Magistrate,

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.579
titles of respectability --

00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:04.499
not bloody "President."

00:04:05.382 --> 00:04:08.104
And that, in the intercourse
with foreign nations,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.257
the majesty of the people
of the United States

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:16.264
may not be hazarded
by an appearance of singularity --

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:18.700
i.e., we don't want to look
like bloody weirdos.

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:23.090
Now, you can learn
three interesting things from this.

00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:25.311
First of all -- and this is my favorite --

00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:27.771
is that, so far as I've ever
been able to find out,

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:32.099
the Senate has never formally
endorsed the title of President.

00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:36.010
Barack Obama, President Obama,
is there on borrowed time,

00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:39.174
just waiting for the Senate
to spring into action.

00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:40.444
(Laughter)

00:04:40.468 --> 00:04:41.920
The second thing you can learn

00:04:41.944 --> 00:04:45.164
is that, when a government says
that this is a temporary measure --

00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:47.556
(Laughter)

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.951
you can still be waiting 223 years later.

00:04:52.854 --> 00:04:56.370
But the third thing you can learn --
and this is the really important one,

00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:58.118
the point I want to leave you on --

00:04:58.142 --> 00:05:02.074
is that the title, "President
of the United States of America,"

00:05:02.098 --> 00:05:05.403
doesn't sound that humble
at all these days, does it?

00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:09.443
Something to do
with the slightly over 5,000

00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:11.717
nuclear warheads he has at his disposal

00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:13.914
and the largest economy in the world

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.457
and a fleet of drones
and all that sort of stuff.

00:05:17.537 --> 00:05:23.506
Reality and history
have endowed that title with grandeur.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.109
And so the Senate won in the end.

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:28.561
They got their title of respectability.

00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:32.121
And also, the Senate's other worry,
the appearance of singularity --

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:34.269
well, it was a singularity back then.

00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:37.142
But now, do you know
how many nations have a president?

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:38.949
A hundred and forty-seven.

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:41.523
All because they want
to sound like the guy

00:05:41.547 --> 00:05:44.099
who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.

00:05:46.155 --> 00:05:49.034
And so, in the end, the Senate won

00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:51.515
and the House of Representatives lost ...

00:05:52.563 --> 00:05:55.079
because nobody's going to feel that humble

00:05:55.103 --> 00:05:56.790
when they're told that they are now

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:59.846
the President of the United
States of America.

00:06:01.243 --> 00:06:04.009
And that's the important lesson
I think you can take away,

00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:05.808
and the one I want to leave you with.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:09.626
Politicians try to pick and use words
to shape and control reality,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.308
but in fact,

00:06:11.332 --> 00:06:16.512
reality changes words far more
than words can ever change reality.

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:18.507
Thank you very much.
