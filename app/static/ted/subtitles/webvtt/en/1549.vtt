00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.756
I've got a great idea
that's going to change the world.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.174
It's fantastic, it's going
to blow your mind.

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:06.599
It's my beautiful baby.

00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:09.052
Here's the thing:
everybody loves a beautiful baby.

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.017
I mean, I was a beautiful baby.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:13.517
Here's me and my dad
a couple days after I was born.

00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:15.180
So in the world of product design,

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:17.572
the beautiful baby's like the concept car.

00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:19.482
It's the knockout.

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:22.645
You see it and you go, "Oh, my God.
I'd buy that in a second!"

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.040
So why is it that this year's new cars

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:28.328
look pretty much exactly
like last year's new cars?

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:30.124
(Laughter)

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:32.966
What went wrong between
the design studio and the factory?

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.394
Today, I don't want to talk
about beautiful babies,

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:38.159
I want to talk about the awkward
adolescence of design --

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:42.761
those sort of dorky teenage years

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.728
where you're trying to figure out
how the world works.

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:47.942
I'm going to start with an example

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.394
from some work that we did
on newborn health.

00:00:50.418 --> 00:00:52.050
So here's a problem:

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:56.089
four million babies around the world,
mostly in developing countries,

00:00:56.113 --> 00:00:58.474
die every year
before their first birthday,

00:00:58.498 --> 00:01:00.326
even before their first month of life.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.010
It turns out half of those kids,

00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:04.248
or about 1.8 million newborns
around the world,

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.160
would make it if you could
just keep them warm

00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:09.906
for the first three days,
maybe the first week.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.631
So this is a newborn intensive care unit
in Kathmandu, Nepal.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.364
All of these kids in blankets
belong in incubators --

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:18.037
something like this.

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.857
This is a donated Japanese Atom incubator

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.554
that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.291
This is what we want.

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:28.649
Probably what happened is a hospital
in Japan upgraded their equipment

00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:32.102
and donated their old stuff to Nepal.

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:35.191
The problem is, without technicians,
without spare parts,

00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:38.634
donations like this
very quickly turn into junk.

00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:42.491
So this seemed like a problem
that we could do something about.

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.732
Keeping a baby warm for a week --
that's not rocket science.

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:48.139
So we got started.

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:52.034
We partnered with a leading medical
research institution here in Boston.

00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:54.974
We conducted months
of user research overseas,

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:57.704
trying to think like designers,
human-centered design --

00:01:57.728 --> 00:01:59.801
"Let's figure out what people want."

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:02.668
We killed thousands of Post-it notes.

00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:06.115
We made dozens of prototypes
to get to this.

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.107
So this is the NeoNurture
infant incubator,

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.805
and this has a lot of smarts
built into it, and we felt great.

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.143
So the idea here is,
unlike the concept car,

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.021
we want to marry something beautiful

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:19.524
with something that actually works.

00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:21.635
And our idea is that this design

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.122
would inspire manufacturers
and other people of influence

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:27.655
to take this model and run with it.

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:31.173
Here's the bad news:

00:02:31.197 --> 00:02:35.171
the only baby ever actually put
inside the NeoNurture incubator

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:38.438
was this kid during a Time
magazine photo shoot.

00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:41.271
So recognition is fantastic.

00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:43.970
We want design to get out
for people to see it.

00:02:43.994 --> 00:02:45.860
It won lots of awards.

00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:48.146
But it felt like a booby prize.

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.606
We wanted to make beautiful things

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.767
that are going to make
the world a better place,

00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.445
and I don't think this kid was even
in it long enough to get warm.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:03.176
So it turns out that design 
for inspiration doesn't really ...

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.726
I guess what I would say is,
for us, for what I want to do,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.160
it's either too slow or it just
doesn't work, it's ineffective.

00:03:10.184 --> 00:03:13.221
So, really, I want to design for outcomes.

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:16.941
I don't want to make beautiful stuff;
I want to make the world a better place.

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:18.750
So when we were designing NeoNurture,

00:03:18.774 --> 00:03:22.215
we paid a lot of attention to the people
who are going to use this thing,

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.842
for example, poor families, rural doctors,

00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:28.022
overloaded nurses,
even repair technicians.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:31.258
We thought we had all our bases
covered, we'd done everything right.

00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:34.148
Well, it turns out there's this
whole constellation of people

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:37.035
who have to be involved
in a product for it to be successful:

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.749
manufacturing, financing,
distribution, regulation.

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:42.026
Michael Free at PATH
says you have to figure out

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.684
who will "choose, use and pay the dues"

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:45.998
for a product like this.

00:03:46.022 --> 00:03:48.466
And I have to ask the question
that VCs always ask:

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.340
"Sir, what is your business,
and who is your customer?"

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.637
Who is our customer?

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.297
Well, here's an example.

00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:57.592
This is a Bangladeshi hospital director
outside his facility.

00:03:57.616 --> 00:04:00.453
It turns out he doesn't buy
any of his equipment.

00:04:00.477 --> 00:04:03.243
Those decisions are made
by the Ministry of Health

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:04.591
or by foreign donors,

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:05.996
and it just kind of shows up.

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.830
Similarly, here's a multinational
medical-device manufacturer.

00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:12.764
It turns out they've got to fish
where the fish are.

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:16.125
So it turns out that in emerging
markets -- where the fish are --

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.244
are the emerging middle class
of these countries --

00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:22.722
diseases of affluence:
heart disease, infertility.

00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:27.224
So it turns out that design
for outcomes in one aspect

00:04:27.248 --> 00:04:30.772
really means thinking about design
for manufacture and distribution.

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:32.602
OK, that was an important lesson.

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:37.173
Second, we took that lesson and tried
to push it into our next project.

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:39.706
So we started by finding a manufacturer,

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.028
an organization called MTTS in Vietnam,

00:04:42.052 --> 00:04:45.450
that manufactures newborn-care
technologies for Southeast Asia.

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:47.358
Our other partner is East Meets West,

00:04:47.382 --> 00:04:50.008
an American foundation
that distributes that technology

00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:52.682
to poor hospitals around that region.

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:55.389
So we started with them, saying,
"Well, what do you want?

00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:57.142
What's a problem you want to solve?"

00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:59.671
And they said, "Let's work
on newborn jaundice."

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:03.757
So this is another one of these
mind-boggling global problems.

00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:07.520
Jaundice affects two-thirds
of newborns around the world.

00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:12.068
Of those newborns, one in 10 roughly,

00:05:12.092 --> 00:05:14.572
if it's not treated,
the jaundice gets so severe

00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:17.269
that it leads to either
a life-long disability,

00:05:17.293 --> 00:05:19.834
or the kids could even die.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.049
There's one way to treat jaundice,

00:05:22.073 --> 00:05:24.613
and that's what's called
an exchange transfusion.

00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:28.481
So as you can imagine, that's expensive
and a little bit dangerous.

00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:30.290
There is another cure.

00:05:30.314 --> 00:05:35.957
It's very technological,
it's very complex, a little daunting.

00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:38.203
You've got to shine blue light on the kid.

00:05:38.227 --> 00:05:39.289
(Laughter)

00:05:39.313 --> 00:05:42.764
Bright blue light on as much
of the skin as you can cover.

00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:44.669
How is this a hard problem?

00:05:44.693 --> 00:05:50.334
I went to MIT. OK, we'll figure that out.

00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:51.794
(Laughter)

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:52.985
So here's an example.

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.517
This is an overhead phototherapy device
that's designed for American hospitals,

00:05:57.541 --> 00:05:59.519
and here's how it's supposed to be used.

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:03.412
It's over the baby,
illuminating a single patient.

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.905
Take it out of an American hospital,

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:08.138
send it overseas
to a crowded facility in Asia,

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:09.614
here's how it's actually used.

00:06:09.638 --> 00:06:12.861
The effectiveness of phototherapy
is a function of light intensity.

00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:16.292
These dark blue squares show you
where it's effective phototherapy.

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:18.347
Here's what it looks
like under actual use.

00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:22.052
So those kids on the edges aren't actually
receiving effective phototherapy.

00:06:22.076 --> 00:06:25.502
But without training,
without some kind of light meter,

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:26.844
how would you know?

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:29.397
We see other examples
of problems like this.

00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:31.243
Here's a neonatal intensive care unit,

00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:33.229
where moms come in to visit their babies.

00:06:33.253 --> 00:06:35.748
And keep in mind that Mom
maybe just had a C-section,

00:06:35.772 --> 00:06:37.638
so that's already kind of a bummer.

00:06:37.662 --> 00:06:39.035
Mom's visiting her kid.

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:42.194
She sees her baby naked,
lying under some blue lights,

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:44.333
looking kind of vulnerable.

00:06:44.357 --> 00:06:47.369
It's not uncommon for Mom
to put a blanket over the baby.

00:06:48.214 --> 00:06:52.088
From a phototherapy standpoint,
maybe not the best behavior.

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:53.986
In fact, that sounds kind of dumb.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.800
Except, what we've learned is that
there's no such thing as a dumb user --

00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:01.486
there are only dumb products.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.348
We have to think like existentialists:

00:07:03.372 --> 00:07:05.436
it's not the painting
we would have painted,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.475
it's the painting
that we actually painted.

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.009
It's the use -- designed for actual use.

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:12.033
How are people actually going to use this?

00:07:12.477 --> 00:07:15.557
So, similarly, when we think
about our partner MTTS,

00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:19.009
they've made some amazing technologies
for treating newborn illnesses.

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:21.342
So here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP.

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:24.111
They're inexpensive, really rugged.

00:07:24.135 --> 00:07:26.972
They've treated 50,000 kids
in Vietnam with this technology.

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:28.353
But here's the problem:

00:07:28.377 --> 00:07:31.180
Every doctor in the world,
every hospital administrator,

00:07:31.204 --> 00:07:36.456
has seen TV -- curse those "ER" reruns!

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.129
Turns out they all know what a medical
device is supposed to look like.

00:07:40.637 --> 00:07:43.668
They want Buck Rogers,
they don't want effective.

00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:45.807
It sounds crazy, it sounds dumb,

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.998
but there are actually hospitals
who would rather have no equipment

00:07:49.022 --> 00:07:51.078
than something that looks
cheap and crummy.

00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:54.396
So again, if we want
people to trust a device,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.828
it has to look trustworthy.

00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:57.343
So thinking about outcomes,

00:07:57.367 --> 00:07:59.744
it turns out appearances matter.

00:07:59.768 --> 00:08:02.275
We took all that information together.

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:04.630
We tried, this time, to get it right.

00:08:04.654 --> 00:08:06.042
And here's what we developed.

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:08.002
This is the Firefly phototherapy device,

00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:10.878
except this time,
we didn't stop at the concept car.

00:08:11.687 --> 00:08:14.941
From the very beginning, we started
by talking to manufacturers.

00:08:14.965 --> 00:08:18.109
Our goal is to make
a state-of-the-art product

00:08:18.133 --> 00:08:20.815
that our partner MTTS
can actually manufacture.

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:24.926
Our goal is to study how they work,
the resources they have access to,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.156
so that they can make this product.

00:08:27.505 --> 00:08:29.996
So that's the design
for manufacture question.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.855
When we think about actual use,

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:34.188
you'll notice that Firefly
has a single bassinet.

00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:36.085
It only fits a single baby,

00:08:36.109 --> 00:08:40.143
and the idea here is it's obvious
how you ought to use this device.

00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:42.040
If you try to put more than one kid in,

00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:44.093
you're stacking them on top of each other.

00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:45.749
(Laughter)

00:08:45.773 --> 00:08:48.544
So the idea here is you want
to make it hard to use wrong.

00:08:48.568 --> 00:08:51.235
In other words, you want to make
the right way to use it

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.197
the easiest way to use it.

00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:56.233
Another example -- again, silly Mom.

00:08:56.257 --> 00:08:59.810
Silly Mom thinks her baby looks cold,
wants to put a blanket over the baby.

00:08:59.834 --> 00:09:02.756
That's why we have lights
above and below the baby in Firefly,

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.817
so if Mom does put a blanket
over the baby,

00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:07.792
it's still receiving effective
phototherapy from below.

00:09:08.636 --> 00:09:09.954
Last story here:

00:09:09.978 --> 00:09:11.873
I've got a friend in India who told me

00:09:11.897 --> 00:09:14.878
that you haven't really tested
a piece of electronic technology

00:09:14.902 --> 00:09:16.944
for distribution in Asia,

00:09:16.968 --> 00:09:19.413
until you've trained a cockroach
to climb in and pee

00:09:19.437 --> 00:09:21.889
on every single little
component on the inside.

00:09:21.913 --> 00:09:23.697
(Laughter)

00:09:23.721 --> 00:09:25.080
You think it's funny.

00:09:25.104 --> 00:09:27.318
I had a laptop in the Peace Corps,

00:09:27.342 --> 00:09:29.546
and the screen had all these
dead pixels on it.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.355
And one day I looked in --
they were all dead ants

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:34.443
that had gotten
into my laptop and perished.

00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:35.618
Those poor ants.

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:37.182
(Laughter)

00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:40.770
So with Firefly, what we did is --
the problem is electronics get hot,

00:09:40.794 --> 00:09:43.516
and you have to put in vents
or fans to keep them cool --

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.784
in most products.

00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:49.593
We decided we can't put a "Do not enter"
sign next to the vent.

00:09:49.617 --> 00:09:51.616
We actually got rid of all that stuff.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.004
So Firefly's totally sealed.

00:09:53.365 --> 00:09:54.957
These are the kinds of lessons --

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:57.617
as awkward as it was
to be a pretty goofy teenager,

00:09:57.641 --> 00:09:59.624
much worse to be a frustrated designer.

00:09:59.648 --> 00:10:02.758
So I was thinking, "What I really
want to do is change the world.

00:10:02.782 --> 00:10:05.525
I have to pay attention
to manufacturing and distribution.

00:10:05.549 --> 00:10:09.540
I have to pay attention to how people
are actually going to use a device.

00:10:09.564 --> 00:10:12.580
I actually have to pay attention.
There's no excuse for failure.

00:10:12.604 --> 00:10:14.478
I have to think like an existentialist.

00:10:14.502 --> 00:10:17.742
I have to accept that there
are no dumb users, only dumb products."

00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:20.136
We have to ask ourselves hard questions.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.486
Are we designing
for the world that we want?

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.518
Are we designing
for the world that we have?

00:10:25.906 --> 00:10:28.020
Are we designing
for the world that's coming,

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.338
whether we're ready or not?

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:32.381
I got into this business
designing products.

00:10:32.762 --> 00:10:36.425
I've since learned that if you really want
to make a difference in the world,

00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:38.212
you have to design outcomes.

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:39.777
And that's design that matters.

00:10:39.801 --> 00:10:40.953
Thank you.

00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:44.595
(Applause)
