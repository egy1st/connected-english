00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
if you've ever watched a James Bond movie --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It was great.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, I've got a little sheet of paper here,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'll talk for like two hours.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I just want to say good afternoon, good evening.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's been an incredible few days.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that you just see flitting around the whole place

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's really amazing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I've been in the audience.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Like, what have I got to say about all this?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and I thought it was really great, and I was watching

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
those incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?"

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
My first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But then I thought, "Why be rude to chimpanzees?"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I guess there goes my green card.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
(Laughter)

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And what's become increasingly clear to me is that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we're talking about news stories about Africa;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
we're not really talking about African narratives.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
40 percent of Americans can't -- either can't afford health insurance

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
or have the most inadequate health insurance,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and have a president who, despite the protest

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
of millions of his citizens -- even his own Congress --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
continues to prosecute a senseless war.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So if news is anything to go by,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Which it isn't really, is it?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The truth is, everything we know about America,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
everything Americans come to know about being American,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
isn't from the news.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I live there.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We don't go home at the end of the day and think,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
"Well, I really know who I am now

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
closed at this many points."

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It comes from popular culture.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In other words, it's the agents of our imagination

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
because in Africa

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the complicated questions we want to ask about

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
what all of this means has been asked

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
from the rock paintings of the San people,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
through the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If you want to know about Africa, read our literature --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
That's very important.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called "The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
He says, "When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
they were thought to be business records.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But what if they were poems and psalms?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
standing still in the morning light.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Giraffes are this desire in the dark."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This is important.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's important because misreading is really the chance

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
for complication and opportunity.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The first Igbo Bible was translated from English

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
in about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
who was a Yoruba.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe":

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
same spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven,"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and one means "bicycle" or "iron."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So "God is in heaven surrounded by His angels"

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
was translated as --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
[Igbo].

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
they chose the Igbo version.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And I'm not going to give you the patois translation;

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I'm going to make it standard English.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Basically, it ends up as "God is on a bicycle with his angels."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
This is good, because language complicates things.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You know, we often think that language mirrors

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the world in which we live, and I find that's not true.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The language actually makes the world in which we live.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Language is not -- I mean, things don't have

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And language can't be understood in its abstraction.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It can only be understood in the context of story,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and everything, all of this is story.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And it's important to remember that,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
because if we don't, then we become ahistorical.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But these are not new to Africa.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Nigeria got its independence in 1960.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The first time the possibility for independence was discussed

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
was in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
In 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Dr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So, you know, the thing is to remember that

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
because otherwise, 10 years from now,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
we'll be back here trying to tell this story again.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So, what it says to me then is that it's not really --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the problem isn't really the stories that are being told

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
or which stories are being told,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
the problem really is the terms of humanity

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that we're willing to bring to complicate every story,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and that's really what it's all about.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Let me tell you a Nigerian joke.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Well, it's just a joke, anyway.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and he goes on this rant about, "Twenty years,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
my wife has been packing rice for lunch.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
off this building and kill myself."

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And Dick and Harry repeat this.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
The next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
so he throws himself off and kills himself,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and Tom, Dick and Harry follow.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And now the inquest -- you know, Tom's wife

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and Dick's wife are distraught.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
They wished they'd not packed rice.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years."

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Laughter)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
This seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
was told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
with the Hausa being Harry.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
In fact, every time I read in Ireland,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
people get me all mistaken and they say,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork."

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But he was also in Oxford in the '50s,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
my father used to say to me, "You must never eat or drink

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It makes sense now when I think about it,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
because if you'd known my father,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
you would've wanted to poison him too.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
(Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So I was born in 1966, at the beginning

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And I was growing up in school and the federal government

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
didn't want us taught about the history of the war,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
because they thought it probably would make us

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
generate a new generation of rebels.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
who wanted to teach us about this.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I learned the melancholic history of my people

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
through the melancholic history of another people.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I mean, picture this -- really picture this.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
to young Igbo children.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Story is powerful.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And it should come as no surprise

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
that my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It makes perfect sense.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And they were to blow up strategic targets

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and take over the country, and they were foiled

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and a Jewish Nazi hunter.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And it happened over four continents.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I grew up very privileged, and it's important

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
to talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
A lot of us are very privileged.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I grew up -- servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I was completely terrified, completely broken,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and kept trying to find a new language,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
a new way to make sense of all of this.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Six months after that, with no explanation,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
they let me go.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:23.000
(Laughter)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
But I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and not just me -- millions of Nigerians

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
grew up with books and libraries.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
In fact, we were talking last night about how all

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
than any sex education programs ever had.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
All of those are gone.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We are squandering the most valuable resource

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
we have on this continent: the valuable resource

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
of the imagination.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
In the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend --

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
fellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi --

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
played by Fraser James.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and he's crying.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
He's sniveling.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's a pitiful sight.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And as we watch it, we are ashamed.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And we want to say to Idris, "Chop him up.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Shut him up."

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And as Idris moves, Fraser screams, "Stop!

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Please stop!"

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Idris pauses, then he moves again,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and Fraser says, "Please!

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Please stop!"

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us;

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
it's the look in Fraser's eyes.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
It's one that says, "Don't do this.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And I'm not saying this to save myself,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
because if you do this, you will be lost."

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
To be so afraid that you're standing in the face

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and crying, but to say in that moment,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
as Fraser says to Idris, "Tell my girlfriend I love her."

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
In that moment, Fraser says,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
"I am lost already, but not you ... not you."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
This is a redemption we can all aspire to.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
African narratives in the West, they proliferate.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
I really don't care anymore.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
how as a writer, I find that African writers

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
with narratives of wounds and self-loathing?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And this is the difficulty that I face.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
to a place of ethical questioning.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I am asking us to balance the idea

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
of transformation of what is possible.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
As a young middle-class Nigerian activist,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I launched myself along with a whole generation of us

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
into the campaign to stop the government.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I asked millions of people,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
without questioning my right to do so,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
to go up against the government.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Have I not myself been imprisoned?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Have I not myself been beaten?"

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that I understood the real meaning of torture,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and how easy your humanity can be taken from you,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
for the time I was engaged in war,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
righteous, righteous war.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Excuse me.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Sometimes I can stand before the world --

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and when I say this, transformation

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
is a difficult and slow process --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
sometimes I can stand before the world and say,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
"My name is Chris Abani.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I have been human six days, but only sometimes."

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
But this is a good thing.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
It's never going to be easy.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
There are no answers.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that I had challenged my students in America --

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots."

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And so they said, "Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani."

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
There are no essential Africans,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
about the continent we come from,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and yet we want to make profound statements about it.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
to approximate the truth of our own communities,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
it will make for a much more nuanced

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
and a much more interesting conversation.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
that we can rise above all of this.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
When I was 10, I read James Baldwin's "Another Country,"

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and that book broke me.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
for the first time, but because the way James wrote about it

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
"Here," Jimmy said.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
"Here is love, all of it."

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
The fact that it happens in "Another Country"

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
takes you quite by surprise.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
those who can count, and those who can't.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
(Laughter)

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
He also says that the cause of all our trouble

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
is the belief in an essential, pure identity:

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
religious, ethnic, historical, ideological.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that speaks to transformation.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
for how easy it is to be nailed to a board

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
weathered raw as white butcher paper.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Weeks ago, you broke me as a woman

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
once shattered me into a song beneath her weight,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
before you slouched into that grassy hush.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
shaped like five bowstrings.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
You've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Pressure can make everything whole again.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
your face has been carved five times.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I have to drive trouble in the hills.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Trouble in the valley,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and trouble by the river too.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
There is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Ka-doooom.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Now I have beaten a song back into you.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Rise and walk away like a panther."

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Thank you.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:20.000
(Applause)
