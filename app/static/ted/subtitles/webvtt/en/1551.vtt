00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.781
I'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor,

00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:06.836
and you may think that sculptors,

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:12.125
well, they deal with meta, they deal with objects,

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:15.083
they deal with bodies,

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:19.626
but I think, really, what I care about most

00:00:19.626 --> 00:00:23.674
is making space, and that's what I've called this talk:

00:00:23.674 --> 00:00:26.281
Making Space.

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:30.689
Space that exists within us,

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.758
and without us.

00:00:32.758 --> 00:00:36.927
So, when I was a child,

00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:38.938
I don't know how many of you grew up in the '50s,

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:44.350
but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest. (Laughter)

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.697
It's a really bad idea. I mean, after lunch, you're, you know,

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:50.777
you're six, and you want to go and climb a tree.

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:52.666
But I had to go upstairs, this tiny little room

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.441
that was actually made out of an old balcony,

00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:59.596
so it was incredibly hot, small and light,

00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:03.011
and I had to lie there. It was ridiculous.

00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:05.619
But anyway, for some reason, I promised myself

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.872
that I wasn't going to move,

00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:09.809
that I was going to do this thing that Mummy

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.736
wanted me to do.

00:01:11.736 --> 00:01:15.409
And there I was, lying there in this tiny space,

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.799
hot, dark, claustrophobic, matchbox-sized, behind my eyes,

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.864
but it was really weird, like, after this went on

00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:32.577
for days, weeks, months, that space would get bigger

00:01:32.577 --> 00:01:36.241
and darker and cooler

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:41.111
until I really looked forward to that half an hour

00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:45.218
of enforced immobility and rest,

00:01:45.218 --> 00:01:49.872
and I really looked forward to going to that place

00:01:49.872 --> 00:01:52.434
of darkness.

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:54.890
Do you mind if we do something completely different?

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.926
Can we all just close our eyes for a minute?

00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:58.574
Now, this isn't going to be freaky.

00:01:58.574 --> 00:02:00.196
It isn't some cultic thing. (Laughter)

00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:03.444
It's just, it's just, I just would like us all to go there.

00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:05.592
So I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:09.427
So close your eyes for a minute.

00:02:09.427 --> 00:02:12.537
Here we are, in a space,

00:02:12.537 --> 00:02:20.009
the subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body.

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:24.064
I think of this as the place of imagination,

00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:27.364
of potential,

00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:30.264
but what are its qualities?

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:35.561
It is objectless. There are no things in it.

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:41.512
It is dimensionless. It is limitless.

00:02:41.512 --> 00:02:46.102
It is endless.

00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:48.648
Okay, open your eyes.

00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:52.857
That's the space that I think sculpture --

00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:55.925
which is a bit of a paradox, sculpture that is about

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:59.269
making material propositions --

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.390
but I think that's the space

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.058
that sculpture can connect us with.

00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:10.243
So, imagine we're in the middle of America.

00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:13.115
You're asleep. You wake up,

00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:16.462
and without lifting your head from the earth

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:21.900
on your sleeping bag, you can see for 70 miles.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.151
This is a dry lake bed.

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:29.393
I was young. I'd just finished art school.

00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:31.565
I wanted to do something that was working

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:36.717
directly with the world, directly with place.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.780
This was a wonderful place, because it was a place

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.997
where you could imagine that you were the

00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:44.331
first person to be there.

00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:49.240
It was a place where nothing very much had happened.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.485
Anyway, bear with me.

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:56.270
I picked up a hand-sized stone,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.363
threw it as far as I was able,

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.434
it was about 22 meters.

00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:06.772
I then cleared all the stones within that radius

00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:10.574
and made a pile.

00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:12.978
And that was the pile, by the way.

00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:16.475
And then, I stood on the pile,

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:20.344
and threw all of those rocks out again,

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:25.562
and here is rearranged desert.

00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:27.540
You could say, well, it doesn't look very different

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.659
from when he started.

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:30.862
(Laughter)

00:04:30.862 --> 00:04:32.496
What's all the fuss about?

00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:33.864
In fact, Chris was worried and said,

00:04:33.864 --> 00:04:35.258
"Look, don't show them that slide,

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:37.217
because they're just going to think you're another one of

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:39.883
those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much.

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:42.253
(Laughter)

00:04:42.253 --> 00:04:48.962
But the fact is, this is evidence

00:04:48.962 --> 00:04:52.497
of a living body on other bodies,

00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:58.336
rocks that have been the subject of geological formation,

00:04:58.336 --> 00:05:03.350
erosion, the action of time on objects.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.872
This is a place, in a way, that I just

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.353
would like you to, in a way, look at differently

00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:13.024
because of this event that has happened in it,

00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:15.079
a human event,

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:18.631
and in general, it just asks us to look again

00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.190
at this world, so different from, in a way,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.461
the world that we have been sharing with each other,

00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:26.887
the technological world,

00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:31.581
to look again at the elemental world.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:37.290
The elemental world that we all live in is that space

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.678
that we all visited together, the darkness of the body.

00:05:41.678 --> 00:05:45.343
I wanted to start again with that environment,

00:05:45.343 --> 00:05:49.013
the environment of the intimate, subjective space

00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:52.839
that each of us lives in, but from the other side

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.447
of appearance.

00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:57.871
So here is a daily activity of the studio.

00:05:57.871 --> 00:06:01.510
You can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.237
again with my eyes closed, and other people

00:06:04.237 --> 00:06:08.764
are molding me, evidential.

00:06:08.764 --> 00:06:12.412
This is an indexical register of a lived moment

00:06:12.412 --> 00:06:15.595
of a body in time.

00:06:15.595 --> 00:06:21.318
Can we map that space, using the language of neutrinos

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:26.104
or cosmic rays, taking the bounding condition of the body

00:06:26.104 --> 00:06:31.579
as its limit, but in complete reversal of, in a way,

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:34.202
the most traditional Greek idea of pointing?

00:06:34.202 --> 00:06:37.990
In the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.648
and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin,

00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:44.100
the appearance,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.361
what Aristotle defined as the distinction

00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:49.384
between substance and appearance,

00:06:49.384 --> 00:06:52.451
the thing that makes things visible,

00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:55.506
but here we're working from the other side.

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:59.551
Or can we do it as an exclusive membrane?

00:06:59.551 --> 00:07:05.509
This is a lead case made around the space

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.974
that my body occupied, but it's now void.

00:07:08.974 --> 00:07:12.848
This is a work called "Learning To See."

00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:19.132
It's a bit of, well, we could call it night,

00:07:19.132 --> 00:07:23.582
we could call it the 96 percent of gravity

00:07:23.582 --> 00:07:27.143
that we don't know about, dark matter,

00:07:27.143 --> 00:07:30.688
placed in space, anyway, another version of a human space

00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:33.601
in space at large, but I don't know if you can see,

00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:39.670
the eyes are indicated, they're closed.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.133
It's called "Learning To See" because it's about an object

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:47.465
that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that

00:07:47.465 --> 00:07:51.284
vision or connection with the darkness of the body

00:07:51.284 --> 00:07:56.257
that I see as a space of potential.

00:07:56.257 --> 00:07:59.332
Can we do it another way, using the language

00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:02.518
of particles around a nucleus, and talk about the body

00:08:02.518 --> 00:08:04.448
as an energy center?

00:08:04.448 --> 00:08:07.506
No longer about statues, no longer having to take that

00:08:07.506 --> 00:08:10.567
duty of standing, the standing of a human body,

00:08:10.567 --> 00:08:13.897
or the standing of a statue, release it,

00:08:13.897 --> 00:08:18.155
allow it to be an energy field, a space in space

00:08:18.155 --> 00:08:24.976
that talks about human life, between becoming an entropy

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:29.720
as a sort of concentration of attention,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.789
a human place of possibility in space at large.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:38.565
Is there another way?

00:08:38.565 --> 00:08:44.664
Dark matter now placed against a horizon.

00:08:44.664 --> 00:08:48.699
If minds live in bodies, if bodies live in clothes,

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:51.829
and then in rooms, and then in buildings,

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:57.531
and then in cities, do they also have a final skin,

00:08:57.531 --> 00:09:00.164
and is that skin perceptual?

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:02.786
The horizon.

00:09:02.786 --> 00:09:05.287
And is art about

00:09:05.287 --> 00:09:11.215
trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon?

00:09:11.231 --> 00:09:19.852
Can we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst

00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:24.603
for a kind of empathy with the experience

00:09:24.603 --> 00:09:29.951
of space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here

00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:35.345
in front of you trying to feel and make a connection

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:38.651
in this space-time that we are sharing,

00:09:38.651 --> 00:09:42.207
can we use, at it were, the memory of a body,

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.031
of a human space in space to catalyze

00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:48.754
an experience, again, firsthand experience,

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:51.761
of elemental time.

00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:56.285
Human time, industrial time, tested against

00:09:56.285 --> 00:09:59.281
the time of the tides, in which these memories

00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:04.240
of a particular body, that could be any body,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.130
multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction,

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.515
many times, placed over three square miles,

00:10:13.515 --> 00:10:17.169
a mile out to sea,

00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:21.524
disappearing, in different conditions of day and night.

00:10:21.524 --> 00:10:24.793
You can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey,

00:10:24.793 --> 00:10:27.950
just outside Liverpool.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.415
And there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like

00:10:31.415 --> 00:10:34.241
on a typical afternoon.

00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:36.943
The pieces appear and disappear,

00:10:36.943 --> 00:10:39.006
but maybe more importantly --

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:42.939
this is just looking north from the center of the installation --

00:10:42.939 --> 00:10:47.276
they create a field, a field that involves

00:10:47.276 --> 00:10:53.038
living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation,

00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:57.999
a relation with each other and a relation with that limit,

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:01.745
the edge, the horizon.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.247
Just moving on, is it possible,

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:08.930
taking that idea of mind, body, body-building,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.335
to supplant the first body,

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:14.315
the biological body, with the second,

00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:17.233
the body of architecture and the built environment.

00:11:17.233 --> 00:11:21.824
This is a work called "Room for the Great Australian Desert."

00:11:21.824 --> 00:11:23.442
It's in an undefined location

00:11:23.442 --> 00:11:26.523
and I've never published where it is.

00:11:26.523 --> 00:11:28.413
It's an object for the mind.

00:11:28.413 --> 00:11:31.834
I think of it as a 21st-century Buddha.

00:11:31.834 --> 00:11:33.764
Again, the darkness of the body,

00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:36.827
now held within this bunker shape

00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:40.311
of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy,

00:11:40.311 --> 00:11:42.427
a crouching body.

00:11:42.427 --> 00:11:45.414
There's a hole at the anus, penis level.

00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:48.151
There are holes at ears. There are no holes at the eyes.

00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:52.405
There's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick,

00:11:52.405 --> 00:11:54.744
concrete with a void interior.

00:11:54.744 --> 00:11:58.927
Again, a site found with a completely flat

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:03.623
360-degree horizon.

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:07.947
This is just simply asking, again,

00:12:07.947 --> 00:12:12.535
as if we had arrived for the first time,

00:12:12.535 --> 00:12:16.671
what is the relationship of the human project

00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:20.784
to time and space?

00:12:20.784 --> 00:12:24.357
Taking that idiom of, as it were,

00:12:24.357 --> 00:12:29.350
the darkness of the body transferred to architecture,

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.925
can you use architectural space not for living

00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:34.638
but as a metaphor,

00:12:34.638 --> 00:12:38.415
and use its systolic, diastolic

00:12:38.415 --> 00:12:43.234
smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of

00:12:43.234 --> 00:12:48.906
firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space,

00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:52.202
light and darkness?

00:12:52.202 --> 00:12:57.724
This is a work of some proportion and some weight

00:12:57.724 --> 00:13:02.610
that makes the body into a city, an aggregation of cells

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.022
that are all interconnected

00:13:05.022 --> 00:13:09.854
and that allow certain visual access

00:13:09.854 --> 00:13:12.653
at certain places.

00:13:12.653 --> 00:13:19.356
The last work that I just wanted to share with you

00:13:19.356 --> 00:13:23.158
is "Blind Light," which is perhaps

00:13:23.158 --> 00:13:26.418
the most open work,

00:13:26.418 --> 00:13:28.553
and in a conference of radical openness,

00:13:28.553 --> 00:13:32.561
I think maybe this is as radical as I get,

00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:36.824
using light and water vapor as my materials.

00:13:36.824 --> 00:13:39.210
Here is a box

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.752
filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure,

00:13:42.752 --> 00:13:46.791
with a cloud and with very bright light.

00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:50.212
As you walk towards the ever-open threshold,

00:13:50.212 --> 00:13:58.124
you disappear, both to yourselves and to others.

00:13:58.124 --> 00:14:00.280
If you hold your hand out in front of you,

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.134
you can't see it.

00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:05.400
If you look down, you can't see your feet.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:12.402
You are now consciousness without an object,

00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:16.295
freed from the dimensionful

00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:22.181
and measured way in which life links us

00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:25.271
to the obligatory.

00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:30.248
But this is a space that is actually filled with people,

00:14:30.248 --> 00:14:32.218
disembodied voices,

00:14:32.218 --> 00:14:36.332
and out of that ambient environment,

00:14:36.332 --> 00:14:40.262
when people come close to your own body zone,

00:14:40.262 --> 00:14:44.325
very close, they appear to you as representations.

00:14:44.325 --> 00:14:46.545
When they appear close to the edge,

00:14:46.545 --> 00:14:51.129
they are representations, representations in which

00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:54.997
the viewers have become the viewed.

00:14:54.997 --> 00:15:00.848
For me, art is not about objects of high monetary exchange.

00:15:00.848 --> 00:15:06.253
It's about reasserting our firsthand experience

00:15:06.253 --> 00:15:09.144
in present time.

00:15:09.144 --> 00:15:12.585
As John Cage said,

00:15:12.585 --> 00:15:17.672
"We are not moving towards some kind of goal.

00:15:17.672 --> 00:15:22.353
We are at the goal, and it is changing with us.

00:15:22.353 --> 00:15:28.789
If art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact."

00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:30.826
Thank you very much.

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:34.993
