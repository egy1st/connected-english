00:00:00.748 --> 00:00:04.427
Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.

00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:07.474
I got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in,

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.253
and, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochure

00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:12.875
for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it,

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:16.016
and I came across a show called "Minto: Live."

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:19.648
The description read: "The suburban streets of Minto

00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:22.189
become the stage for performances

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.395
created by international artists

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:27.195
in collaboration with the people of Minto."

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:29.910
What was this place called Minto?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.271
Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs,

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:35.944
and Minto lies southwest, about an hour away.

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:39.303
I have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind

00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:40.900
for my first day down under.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.839
I mean, I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach,

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.795
but Minto? But still, I'm a producer,

00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:49.967
and the lure of a site-specific theater project

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.236
was more than I could resist. (Laughter)

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:54.720
So, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.125
and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:59.779
For the performance, the audience walked

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:02.569
around the neighborhood from house to house,

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:05.449
and the residents, who were the performers,

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.560
they came out of their houses, and they performed

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.399
these autobiographical dances on their lawns,

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.747
on their driveways. (Laughter)

00:01:13.747 --> 00:01:16.715
The show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:19.374
performance company called Lone Twin.

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:21.270
Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.394
with the residents, and they had created these dances.

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:28.232
This Australian-Indian girl, she came out and started

00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:30.253
to dance on her front lawn,

00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:33.191
and her father peered out the window to see

00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:35.698
what all the noise and commotion was about,

00:01:35.698 --> 00:01:37.906
and he soon joined her.

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:41.033
And he was followed by her little sister.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:44.091
And soon they were all dancing this joyous,

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:48.266
exuberant dance right there on their lawn. (Laughter)

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.458
And as I walked through the neighborhood,

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:54.679
I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.116
sense of ownership this community clearly felt

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.686
about this event.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.645
"Minto: Live" brought Sydneysiders into dialogue

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:05.975
with international artists, and really celebrated

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:09.463
the diversity of Sydney on its own terms.

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:13.176
The Sydney Festival which produced "Minto: Live" I think

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:16.951
represents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival.

00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:20.466
These festivals are radically open.

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:24.178
They can transform cities and communities.

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:26.858
To understand this, I think it kind of makes sense

00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:29.184
to look where we've come from.

00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:31.207
Modern arts festivals were born

00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:32.705
in the rubble of World War II.

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:35.307
Civic leaders created these annual events

00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:38.416
to celebrate culture as the highest

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:41.021
expression of the human spirit.

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:44.104
In 1947, the Edinburgh Festival was born

00:02:44.104 --> 00:02:46.761
and Avignon was born and hundreds of others

00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:48.662
would follow in their wake.

00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:51.914
The work they did was very, very high art,

00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:54.518
and stars came along like Laurie Anderson

00:02:54.518 --> 00:02:56.793
and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:58.213
who made work for this circuit,

00:02:58.213 --> 00:03:00.984
and you had these seminal shows like "The Mahabharata"

00:03:00.984 --> 00:03:03.969
and the monumental "Einstein on the Beach."

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.464
But as the decades passed,

00:03:06.464 --> 00:03:09.665
these festivals, they really became the establishment,

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:13.058
and as the culture and capital accelerated,

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:15.059
the Internet brought us all together,

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:17.991
high and low kind of disappeared,

00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:19.613
a new kind of festival emerged.

00:03:19.613 --> 00:03:22.752
The old festivals, they continued to thrive, but

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:27.100
from Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.044
and these festivals were really different.

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:32.939
They're open, these festivals, because, like in Minto,

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.155
they understand that the dialogue

00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:38.873
between the local and the global is essential.

00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:43.376
They're open because they ask the audience to be a player,

00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:47.786
a protagonist, a partner, rather than a passive spectator,

00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:51.365
and they're open because they know that imagination

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:53.524
cannot be contained in buildings,

00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:55.377
and so much of the work they do

00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:58.677
is site-specific or outdoor work.

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:02.065
So, the new festival, it asks the audience to play

00:04:02.065 --> 00:04:05.183
an essential role in shaping the performance.

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:10.279
Companies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunk

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.093
create these completely immersive experiences

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:16.288
that put the audience at the center of the action,

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:19.390
but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.677
takes this all to a whole new level.

00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:26.459
In a series of shows that includes "100 Percent Vancouver,"

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:30.456
"100 Percent Berlin," Rimini Protokoll makes shows

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:33.289
that actually reflect society.

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.826
Rimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:41.237
at that moment in terms of race and gender and class,

00:04:41.237 --> 00:04:44.511
through a careful process that begins three months before,

00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:47.738
and then those 100 people share stories about

00:04:47.738 --> 00:04:50.274
themselves and their lives, and the whole thing

00:04:50.274 --> 00:04:54.896
becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment.

00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:58.331
LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.742
They understand that theater and performance

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:02.060
can happen anywhere.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.269
You can do a show in a schoolroom,

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:07.654
in an airport, — (Laughter) —

00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:10.139
in a department store window.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.561
Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew?

00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:17.908
Artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city

00:05:17.908 --> 00:05:19.936
that we haven't explored, or they can take us into

00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:24.361
that building that we pass every day but we never went into.

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:28.524
An artist, I think, can really show us people

00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:31.663
that we might overlook in our lives.

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:35.058
Back to Back is an Australian company of people

00:05:35.058 --> 00:05:39.644
with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show

00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:42.813
in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal

00:05:42.813 --> 00:05:44.223
at rush hour.

00:05:44.223 --> 00:05:46.943
We, the audience, were given headsets and seated

00:05:46.943 --> 00:05:49.727
on one side of the terminal.

00:05:49.727 --> 00:05:51.719
The actors were right there in front of us,

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.129
right there among the commuters,

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:55.689
and we could hear them,

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.784
but we might not have otherwise seen them.

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:03.302
So Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses it

00:06:03.302 --> 00:06:06.576
to gently remind us about who and what we choose

00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:09.467
to edit out of our daily lives.

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:12.579
So, the dialogue with the local and the global,

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:16.489
the audience as participant and player and protagonist,

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:19.617
the innovative use of site, all of these things

00:06:19.617 --> 00:06:22.466
come to play in the amazing work

00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:26.523
of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe.

00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:30.263
Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city

00:06:30.263 --> 00:06:33.016
and they live there for a few days.

00:06:33.016 --> 00:06:36.590
For "The Sultan's Elephant," Royal de Luxe

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.613
came to central London and brought it to a standstill

00:06:39.613 --> 00:06:44.002
with their story of a giant little girl and her friend,

00:06:44.002 --> 00:06:46.514
a time-traveling elephant.

00:06:46.514 --> 00:06:51.183
For a few days, they transformed a massive city

00:06:51.183 --> 00:06:56.086
into a community where endless possibility reigned.

00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:59.677
The Guardian wrote, "If art is about transformation,

00:06:59.677 --> 00:07:03.667
then there can be no more transformative experience.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:07.567
What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less

00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:10.413
than an artistic occupation of the city

00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:15.290
and a reclamation of the streets for the people."

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.750
We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.056
on their cities, but I'm much [more] interested in many more things,

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:26.821
like how a festival helps a city to express itself,

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.092
how it lets it come into its own.

00:07:30.092 --> 00:07:32.217
Festivals promote diversity,

00:07:32.217 --> 00:07:34.203
they bring neighbors into dialogue,

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:36.648
they increase creativity,

00:07:36.648 --> 00:07:39.820
they offer opportunities for civic pride,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.479
they improve our general psychological well-being.

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:47.687
In short, they make cities better places to live.

00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:48.665
Case in point:

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:52.009
When "The Sultan's Elephant" came to London

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:56.365
just nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote,

00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:59.998
"For the first time since the London bombings,

00:07:59.998 --> 00:08:03.608
my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.350
She had gathered with others

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.538
to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant,' and, you know,

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:11.221
it just made all the difference."

00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:13.371
Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written

00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:17.834
that a great festival can show us a map of the world,

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:21.882
a map of the city and a map of ourselves,

00:08:21.882 --> 00:08:25.088
but there is no one fixed festival model.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.924
I think what's so brilliant about the festivals,

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:32.990
the new festivals, is that they are really fully capturing

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.178
the complexity and the excitement

00:08:36.178 --> 00:08:38.203
of the way we all live today.

00:08:38.203 --> 00:08:46.148
Thank you very much. (Applause)
