00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.284
There are a lot of ways
the people around us

00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:06.411
can help improve our lives.

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.055
We don't bump into every neighbor,

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.126
so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.602
though we do share the same public spaces.

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:16.863
So over the past few years,
I've tried ways to share more

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:19.203
with my neighbors in public space,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.187
using simple tools like
stickers, stencils and chalk.

00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:26.170
And these projects came
from questions I had, like:

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:28.885
How much are my neighbors
paying for their apartments?

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.099
(Laughter)

00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:32.377
How can we lend and borrow more things,

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.400
without knocking on each
other's doors at a bad time?

00:00:36.718 --> 00:00:40.771
How can we share more memories
of our abandoned buildings,

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:43.210
and gain a better understanding
of our landscape?

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:48.869
How can we share more of our hopes
for our vacant storefronts,

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:52.346
so our communities can reflect
our needs and dreams today?

00:00:54.774 --> 00:00:56.705
Now, I live in New Orleans,

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.046
and I am in love with New Orleans.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.908
My soul is always soothed
by the giant live oak trees,

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:08.304
shading lovers, drunks and dreamers
for hundreds of years,

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:11.590
and I trust a city that always
makes way for music.

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:14.032
I feel like every time someone sneezes,

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:15.295
New Orleans has a parade.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:16.604
(Laughter)

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:20.144
The city has some of the most
beautiful architecture in the world,

00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:24.088
but it also has one of the highest amounts
of abandoned properties in America.

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:26.230
I live near this house,

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:30.095
and I thought about how I could
make it a nicer space for my neighborhood,

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.833
and I also thought about something
that changed my life forever.

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:39.860
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.598
Her name was Joan,
and she was a mother to me.

00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:47.336
And her death was sudden and unexpected.

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:53.037
And I thought about death a lot.

00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:03.632
And ... this made me feel deep
gratitude for the time I've had.

00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:11.187
And ... brought clarity to the things
that are meaningful to my life now.

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:18.718
But I struggle to maintain
this perspective in my daily life.

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:22.273
I feel like it's easy to get
caught up in the day-to-day,

00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:24.187
and forget what really matters to you.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.110
So with help from old and new friends,

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:30.988
I turned the side of this abandoned
house into a giant chalkboard,

00:02:31.012 --> 00:02:33.919
and stenciled it with
a fill-in-the-blank sentence:

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:36.931
"Before I die, I want to ..."

00:02:38.463 --> 00:02:41.542
So anyone walking by
can pick up a piece of chalk,

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.964
reflect on their life,

00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:45.732
and share their personal
aspirations in public space.

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:50.580
I didn't know what to expect
from this experiment,

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:53.925
but by the next day,
the wall was entirely filled out,

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:55.360
and it kept growing.

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:59.283
And I'd like to share a few things
that people wrote on this wall.

00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:05.377
"Before I die, I want
to be tried for piracy."

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:11.845
(Laughter)

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:16.391
"Before I die, I want to straddle
the International Dateline."

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:21.470
"Before I die, I want
to sing for millions."

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.702
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."

00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:31.631
"Before I die, I want
to live off the grid."

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.822
"Before I die, I want
to hold her one more time."

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.359
"Before I die, I want
to be someone's cavalry."

00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:50.093
"Before I die, I want
to be completely myself."

00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:57.946
So this neglected space
became a constructive one,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.842
and people's hopes and dreams
made me laugh out loud, tear up,

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.755
and they consoled me
during my own tough times.

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:08.520
It's about knowing you're not alone;

00:04:08.544 --> 00:04:12.226
it's about understanding our neighbors
in new and enlightening ways;

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.599
it's about making space
for reflection and contemplation,

00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:20.579
and remembering what really matters
most to us as we grow and change.

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.396
I made this last year,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.815
and started receiving hundreds
of messages from passionate people

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:29.256
who wanted to make a wall
with their community.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.456
So, my civic center colleagues
and I made a tool kit,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.298
and now walls have been made
in countries around the world,

00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:38.735
including Kazakhstan,

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.470
South Africa,

00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:43.946
Australia,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.962
Argentina, and beyond.

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:49.311
Together, we've shown how powerful
our public spaces can be

00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:52.036
if we're given the opportunity
to have a voice,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.135
and share more with one another.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:04:59.779
Two of the most valuable things we have

00:04:59.803 --> 00:05:03.230
are time, and our relationships
with other people.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.786
In our age of increasing distractions,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.286
it's more important than ever
to find ways to maintain perspective,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.514
and remember that life
is brief and tender.

00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:17.308
Death is something that we're
often discouraged to talk about,

00:05:17.332 --> 00:05:18.602
or even think about,

00:05:18.626 --> 00:05:20.950
but I've realized that preparing for death

00:05:20.974 --> 00:05:23.728
is one of the most empowering
things you can do.

00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:26.759
Thinking about death clarifies your life.

00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.600
Our shared spaces can better
reflect what matters to us,

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.913
as individuals and as a community,

00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:39.873
and with more ways to share
our hopes, fears and stories,

00:05:39.897 --> 00:05:43.817
the people around us can not only
help us make better places,

00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:45.912
they can help us lead better lives.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:47.437
Thank you.

00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:52.034
(Applause)

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:53.214
Thank you.

00:05:53.238 --> 00:05:58.677
(Applause)
