00:00:00.794 --> 00:00:03.210
Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.739
who make the things we use every day:

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:09.499
our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.945
Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:17.536
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:20.392
a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes,

00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:23.090
or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.130
after working overtime assembling your iPad.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.738
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit

00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:33.441
these victims with every purchase we make,

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.074
and the injustice

00:00:35.074 --> 00:00:38.163
feels embedded in the products themselves.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.723
After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker

00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:44.499
on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.149
It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive,

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.880
and that it's our desire for cheap goods

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.241
that makes them so.

00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:56.056
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.868
and Chinese suffering is appealing,

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:01.503
especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:04.081
about our impact on the world,

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.864
but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:10.848
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:14.016
have the power to drive tens of millions of people

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:16.728
on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:19.523
in such terrible ways.

00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:22.341
In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world,

00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:25.929
including its own, thanks to a combination of factors:

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.335
its low costs, its large and educated workforce,

00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:31.801
and a flexible manufacturing system

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.952
that responds quickly to market demands.

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:38.001
By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets,

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.464
we have rendered the individuals on the other end

00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:43.824
into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:46.879
as the parts of a mobile phone.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:49.544
Chinese workers are not forced into factories

00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:52.023
because of our insatiable desire for iPods.

00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:55.095
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money,

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:59.048
to learn new skills, and to see the world.

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:01.441
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's

00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:04.872
been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.

00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:07.177
Here are a few.

00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:10.926
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:14.650
and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.735
developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker,

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:21.238
so I'm not in a rush."

00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:24.280
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.536
everyone said I had changed. They asked me,

00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:30.633
what did you do that you have changed so much?

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:33.911
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them

00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:37.279
more, they won't understand anyway."

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.664
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money,

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:42.815
it won't satisfy me.

00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:47.184
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life."

00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:51.896
Xiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English,

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:53.685
because in the future, our customers won't

00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:57.547
be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."

00:02:57.547 --> 00:03:00.318
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women,

00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:03.400
18 or 19 years old.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.342
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:10.271
like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.

00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.791
Certain subjects came up over and over:

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.695
how much money they made,

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.074
what kind of husband they hoped to marry,

00:03:17.074 --> 00:03:19.199
whether they should jump to another factory

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.399
or stay where they were.

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:23.592
Other subjects came up almost never, including

00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:27.039
living conditions that to me looked close to prison life:

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.322
10 or 15 workers in one room,

00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:32.681
50 people sharing a single bathroom,

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.015
days and nights ruled by the factory clock.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:39.503
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances,

00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:42.264
and it was still better than the dormitories and homes

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:44.832
of rural China.

00:03:44.832 --> 00:03:47.558
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made,

00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:49.902
and they often had great difficulty explaining

00:03:49.902 --> 00:03:52.344
what exactly they did.

00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:54.055
When I asked Lu Qingmin,

00:03:54.055 --> 00:03:56.157
the young woman I got to know best,

00:03:56.157 --> 00:03:58.624
what exactly she did on the factory floor,

00:03:58.624 --> 00:04:01.029
she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:02.806
"qiu xi."

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:05.775
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:08.999
"QC," or quality control.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.862
She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.

00:04:12.862 --> 00:04:15.319
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.313
in a language she didn't even understand.

00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:22.935
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism,

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:26.978
the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.

00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:30.602
Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets,

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:33.849
the worker in an industrial factory has no control,

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.106
no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding

00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:39.297
in her own work.

00:04:39.297 --> 00:04:41.713
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at

00:04:41.713 --> 00:04:44.532
sitting in the reading room of the British Museum,

00:04:44.532 --> 00:04:47.358
he got this one wrong.

00:04:47.358 --> 00:04:49.657
Just because a person spends her time

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:52.425
making a piece of something does not mean

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.977
that she becomes that, a piece of something.

00:04:54.977 --> 00:04:58.080
What she does with the money she earns,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.585
what she learns in that place, and how it changes her,

00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:04.346
these are the things that matter.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.646
What a factory makes is never the point, and

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:10.730
the workers could not care less who buys their products.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.218
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories,

00:05:13.218 --> 00:05:15.330
on the other hand, plays up this relationship

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.159
between the workers and the products they make.

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.248
Many articles calculate: How long would it take

00:05:21.248 --> 00:05:24.092
for this worker to work in order to earn enough money

00:05:24.092 --> 00:05:26.552
to buy what he's making?

00:05:26.552 --> 00:05:29.040
For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.312
in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out

00:05:32.312 --> 00:05:35.857
two and a half months' wages for an iPhone.

00:05:35.857 --> 00:05:39.194
But how meaningful is this calculation, really?

00:05:39.194 --> 00:05:41.184
For example, I recently wrote an article

00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:42.162
in The New Yorker magazine,

00:05:42.162 --> 00:05:45.401
but I can't afford to buy an ad in it.

00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.457
But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker,

00:05:47.457 --> 00:05:50.322
and most of these workers don't really want iPhones.

00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:53.082
Their calculations are different.

00:05:53.082 --> 00:05:54.896
How long should I stay in this factory?

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.359
How much money can I save?

00:05:57.359 --> 00:05:59.929
How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car,

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:04.519
to get married, or to put my child through school?

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:07.210
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.968
relationship with the product of their labor.

00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:14.110
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.144
she invited me home to her family village

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:18.367
for the Chinese New Year.

00:06:18.367 --> 00:06:20.753
On the train home, she gave me a present:

00:06:20.753 --> 00:06:25.144
a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.

00:06:25.144 --> 00:06:26.817
I thanked her, assuming it was fake,

00:06:26.817 --> 00:06:30.294
like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.

00:06:30.294 --> 00:06:34.103
After we got home, Min gave her mother another present:

00:06:34.103 --> 00:06:36.288
a pink Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag,

00:06:36.288 --> 00:06:38.711
and a few nights later, her sister was showing off

00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:42.215
a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.

00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:46.015
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags

00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:48.032
were made by their factory,

00:06:48.032 --> 00:06:51.198
and every single one of them was authentic.

00:06:51.198 --> 00:06:53.663
Min's sister said to her parents,

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:57.025
"In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."

00:06:57.025 --> 00:07:00.064
Her parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.

00:07:00.064 --> 00:07:02.623
"And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line,

00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:07.424
2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."

00:07:07.424 --> 00:07:11.671
She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or

00:07:11.671 --> 00:07:17.318
6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000." (Laughter)

00:07:17.318 --> 00:07:19.913
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her

00:07:19.913 --> 00:07:22.030
for the new year, said,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.863
"It doesn't look like it's worth that much."

00:07:24.863 --> 00:07:27.688
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually

00:07:27.688 --> 00:07:31.232
understand these things. You don't understand shit."

00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:35.887
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:35.887 --> 00:07:39.927
In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:42.247
They weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing

00:07:42.247 --> 00:07:44.957
close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew

00:07:44.957 --> 00:07:48.887
wanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.

00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:52.242
Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married,

00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:55.070
she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.238
Another time, after Min had already left

00:07:57.238 --> 00:08:00.380
the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit,

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.491
bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.

00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:06.566
I looked in the zippered pocket of one,

00:08:06.566 --> 00:08:10.805
and I found a printed card in English, which read,

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:14.063
"An American classic.

00:08:14.063 --> 00:08:16.573
In 1941, the burnished patina

00:08:16.573 --> 00:08:18.935
of an all-American baseball glove

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:21.135
inspired the founder of Coach to create

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:23.544
a new collection of handbags from the same

00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:26.753
luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.

00:08:26.753 --> 00:08:30.928
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags

00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:35.064
with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.

00:08:35.064 --> 00:08:37.344
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere

00:08:37.344 --> 00:08:42.680
adored them. A new American classic was born."

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.006
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min

00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:46.914
and her sisters.

00:08:46.914 --> 00:08:49.521
Their relationship with the product of their labor

00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:51.816
was more complicated, surprising and funny

00:08:51.816 --> 00:08:54.074
than he could have imagined.

00:08:54.074 --> 00:08:56.897
And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency

00:08:56.897 --> 00:08:59.506
to see the workers as faceless masses,

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:03.380
to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.781
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18

00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:09.436
and quit her first job on the assembly line

00:09:09.436 --> 00:09:11.751
of an electronics factory.

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:14.397
Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs

00:09:14.397 --> 00:09:17.473
five times, eventually landing a lucrative post

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:21.047
in the purchasing department of a hardware factory.

00:09:21.047 --> 00:09:23.572
Later, she married a fellow migrant worker,

00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:25.714
moved with him to his village,

00:09:25.714 --> 00:09:27.917
gave birth to two daughters,

00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:30.105
and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick

00:09:30.105 --> 00:09:34.511
for herself and an apartment for her parents.

00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:37.644
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:41.260
to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes,

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.460
temporarily leaving her husband and children

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.443
back in the village.

00:09:45.443 --> 00:09:48.024
In a recent email to me, she explained,

00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:52.070
"A person should have some ambition while she is young

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.732
so that in old age she can look back on her life

00:09:54.732 --> 00:09:59.515
and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:03.911
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her,

00:10:03.911 --> 00:10:06.664
one third of them women, who have left their villages

00:10:06.664 --> 00:10:10.207
to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants

00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:12.812
and the construction sites of the big cities.

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:16.556
Together, they make up the largest migration in history,

00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:19.556
and it is globalization, this chain that begins

00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:22.075
in a Chinese farming village

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:25.852
and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet

00:10:25.852 --> 00:10:28.276
and Coach handbags on our arms

00:10:28.276 --> 00:10:30.565
that has changed the way these millions of people

00:10:30.565 --> 00:10:35.478
work and marry and live and think.

00:10:35.478 --> 00:10:37.427
Very few of them would want to go back

00:10:37.427 --> 00:10:39.984
to the way things used to be.

00:10:39.984 --> 00:10:43.164
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:47.539
it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:50.310
I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.939
or that they would have nothing to say to me.

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:55.589
Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:58.436
and brave and generous.

00:10:58.436 --> 00:11:00.767
By opening up their lives to me,

00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:02.973
they taught me so much about factories

00:11:02.973 --> 00:11:07.179
and about China and about how to live in the world.

00:11:09.486 --> 00:11:12.198
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me

00:11:12.198 --> 00:11:14.608
on the train home to visit her family.

00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:17.251
I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me

00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:19.975
to the young women I wrote about,

00:11:19.975 --> 00:11:24.245
ties that are not economic but personal in nature,

00:11:24.245 --> 00:11:27.812
measured not in money but in memories.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:31.231
This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine,

00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:34.773
sitting in your office or in the library,

00:11:34.773 --> 00:11:37.176
are not how you find them when you actually go out

00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:38.683
into the world.

00:11:38.683 --> 00:11:40.671
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:47.343
(Applause)

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:49.412
Chris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight

00:11:49.412 --> 00:11:52.009
that a lot of us haven't had before.

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:55.496
But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say,

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:59.217
with Apple's head of manufacturing,

00:11:59.217 --> 00:12:01.577
what would you say?

00:12:01.577 --> 00:12:02.705
Leslie Chang: One minute?

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:04.218
CA: One minute. (Laughter)

00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:06.144
LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers

00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:09.370
is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven,

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.987
resourceful, and the thing that struck me,

00:12:11.987 --> 00:12:14.952
what they want most is education, to learn,

00:12:14.952 --> 00:12:16.499
because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.

00:12:16.499 --> 00:12:19.443
They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.

00:12:19.443 --> 00:12:21.682
Their parents are often illiterate,

00:12:21.682 --> 00:12:24.322
and then they come to the city, and they, on their own,

00:12:24.322 --> 00:12:26.447
at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class,

00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:28.715
they'll take an English class, and learn

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:30.839
really, really rudimentary things, you know,

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:32.578
like how to type a document in Word,

00:12:32.578 --> 00:12:35.242
or how to say really simple things in English.

00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:37.370
So, if you really want to help these workers,

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.593
start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.722
in these schools, and what's going to happen is,

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.141
all your workers are going to move on,

00:12:45.141 --> 00:12:48.548
but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple,

00:12:48.548 --> 00:12:51.489
and you can help their social mobility

00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:52.486
and their self-improvement.

00:12:52.486 --> 00:12:54.264
When you talk to workers, that's what they want.

00:12:54.264 --> 00:12:56.938
They do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.

00:12:56.938 --> 00:12:58.923
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."

00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:00.546
I mean, it would be nice to have those things,

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:01.704
but that's not why they're in the city,

00:13:01.704 --> 00:13:03.793
and that's not what they care about.

00:13:03.793 --> 00:13:07.343
CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that

00:13:07.343 --> 00:13:10.755
things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative

00:13:10.755 --> 00:13:13.768
of some kind of level of growth, that things over time

00:13:13.768 --> 00:13:15.391
were getting better?

00:13:15.391 --> 00:13:17.298
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know,

00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:19.664
it was interesting, because I spent basically two years

00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:21.658
hanging out in this city, Dongguan,

00:13:21.658 --> 00:13:23.769
and over that time, you could see immense change

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:26.564
in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways,

00:13:26.564 --> 00:13:28.385
but generally upward.

00:13:28.385 --> 00:13:30.172
If you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people

00:13:30.172 --> 00:13:32.467
who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now

00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:34.574
basically urban middle class people,

00:13:34.574 --> 00:13:36.595
so the trajectory is definitely upward.

00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:38.530
It's just hard to see when you're suddenly

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.651
sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and

00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:42.389
desperate, but that's not really how it is.

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:44.543
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough,

00:13:44.543 --> 00:13:46.860
and it's nothing you or I would want to do,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.005
but from their perspective, where they're coming from

00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:52.002
is much worse, and where they're going

00:13:52.002 --> 00:13:54.010
is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.371
that context of what's going on in their minds,

00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.734
not what necessarily is going on in yours.

00:13:58.734 --> 00:14:00.230
CA: Thanks so much for your talk.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.599
Thank you very much. (Applause)
