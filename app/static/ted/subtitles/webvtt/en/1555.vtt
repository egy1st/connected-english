00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:02.930
In System D, this

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.977
is a store,

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:07.304
and what I mean by that is that this is a photograph

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:12.619
I took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.002
It's built over the lagoon, and there are no streets

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:16.818
where there can be stores to shop,

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:18.708
and so the store comes to you.

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.493
And in the same community,

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.245
this is business synergy.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.351
This is the boat that that lady was paddling around in,

00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:29.091
and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:30.396
and sells directly

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.560
to the people who need the boat and the paddles.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.742
And this is a global business.

00:00:34.742 --> 00:00:38.868
Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos,

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:41.829
and I asked her, "Where does the fish come from?"

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.555
And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know,

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:47.456
up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa,"

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:48.887
but you'll be happy to know she said

00:00:48.887 --> 00:00:50.944
it came from here, it comes from the North Sea.

00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:53.270
It's caught here, frozen, shipped down to Lagos,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.357
smoked, and sold for a tiny increment of profit

00:00:56.357 --> 00:00:57.879
on the streets of Lagos.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.730
And this is a business incubator.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.432
This is Olusosun dump, the largest garbage dump in Lagos,

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:06.503
and 2,000 people work here, and I found this out

00:01:06.503 --> 00:01:08.921
from this fellow, Andrew Saboru.

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:13.081
Andrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump,

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.309
earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler,

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.919
which meant he carried a scale and went around and

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:21.143
weighed all the materials that people had scavenged

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:24.166
from the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.567
That's his little depot behind him,

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:31.078
and he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage.

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:33.340
This is a shopping mall.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.515
This is Oshodi Market in Lagos.

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:37.861
Jorge Luis Borges had a story called "The Aleph,"

00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:39.684
and the Aleph is a point in the world

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:41.979
where absolutely everything exists,

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.324
and for me, this image is a point in the world

00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:46.788
where absolutely everything exists.

00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:49.637
So, what am I talking about when I talk about System D?

00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:51.936
It's traditionally called the informal economy,

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:55.564
the underground economy, the black market.

00:01:55.564 --> 00:01:57.857
I don't conceive of it that way.

00:01:57.857 --> 00:02:00.614
I think it's really important to understand that something like

00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:05.094
this is totally open. It's right there for you to find.

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:07.821
All of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.

00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:10.343
There's nothing underground about it.

00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:13.725
It's our prejudgment that it's underground.

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:18.230
I've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.326
There's a word in French that is débrouillardise,

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:23.446
that means to be self-reliant,

00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:26.809
and the former French colonies have turned that into

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.366
System D for the economy of self-reliance,

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:32.624
or the DIY economy.

00:02:32.624 --> 00:02:35.753
But governments hate the DIY economy,

00:02:35.753 --> 00:02:38.997
and that's why -- I took this picture in 2007,

00:02:38.997 --> 00:02:43.549
and this is the same market in 2009 --

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.855
and I think, when the organizers of this conference

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.282
were talking about radical openness,

00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:49.838
they didn't mean that the streets should be open

00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:51.581
and the people should be gone.

00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:55.524
I think what we have is a pickle problem.

00:02:55.524 --> 00:02:58.464
I had a friend who worked at a pickle factory,

00:02:58.464 --> 00:03:00.365
and the cucumbers would come flying down

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:04.368
this conveyer belt, and his job was to pick off the ones

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:06.717
that didn't look so good and throw them in the bin

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:08.623
labeled "relish" where they'd be crushed and mixed

00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:11.949
with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit.

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.260
This is the pickle economy.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.765
We're all focusing on — this is a statistic from

00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:19.344
earlier this month in the Financial Times —

00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:22.887
we're all focusing on the luxury economy.

00:03:22.887 --> 00:03:25.630
It's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year, and that's

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.374
a vast amount of money, right?

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.622
That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland.

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:35.420
So it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.613
and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:40.666
of the world.

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:44.055
1.8 billion people around the world work

00:03:44.055 --> 00:03:49.591
in the economy that is unregulated and informal.

00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:52.871
That's a huge number, and what does that mean?

00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:57.624
Well, it means if it were united in a single political system,

00:03:57.624 --> 00:04:01.879
one country, call it

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.880
"The United Street Sellers Republic," the U.S.S.R.,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.713
or "Bazaaristan,"

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:10.989
it would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year,

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.045
and that would make it the second largest economy

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:15.526
in the world, after the United States.

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:18.366
And given that projections are that the bulk

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:22.031
of economic growth over the next 15 years will come

00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:25.403
from emerging economies in the developing world,

00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:27.534
it could easily overtake the United States

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:30.900
and become the largest economy in the world.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.435
So the implications of that are vast, because it means

00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:37.958
that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people —

00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:42.580
and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.551
because people are actually able to earn money and live

00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:49.546
and thrive, as Andrew Saboru did.

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:51.707
Big businesses have recognized this,

00:04:51.707 --> 00:04:53.686
and what's fascinating about this slide,

00:04:53.686 --> 00:04:55.944
it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads

00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:58.459
and run around without dropping them off.

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:01.554
it's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made

00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:04.264
by a global company called UAC foods

00:05:04.264 --> 00:05:06.831
that's active throughout Africa and the Middle East,

00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:10.520
but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.857
UAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores.

00:05:13.857 --> 00:05:17.962
It's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers

00:05:17.962 --> 00:05:20.775
who run around the streets of Lagos at bus stations

00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:25.248
and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack,

00:05:25.248 --> 00:05:28.270
and it's been sold that way for 40 years.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.440
It's a business plan for a corporation.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.933
And it's not just in Africa.

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:36.046
Here's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:37.966
Procter &amp; Gamble products,

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:40.414
and Procter &amp; Gamble, you know,

00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:42.991
the statistic always cited is that Wal-Mart

00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:47.832
is their largest customer, and it's true, as one store,

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.034
Wal-Mart buys 15 percent, thus 15 percent

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:54.134
of Procter &amp; Gamble's business is with Wal-Mart,

00:05:54.134 --> 00:05:57.695
but their largest market segment is something that they call

00:05:57.695 --> 00:06:00.615
"high frequency stores," which is all these tiny kiosks

00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:03.926
and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:09.273
that exist in System D, the informal economy,

00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:12.671
and Procter &amp; Gamble makes 20 percent of its money

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:14.720
from that market segment,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.156
and it's the only market segment that's growing.

00:06:18.156 --> 00:06:21.264
So Procter &amp; Gamble says, "We don't care whether a store

00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:24.158
is incorporated or registered or anything like that.

00:06:24.158 --> 00:06:27.991
We want our products in that store."

00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:30.163
And then there's mobile phones.

00:06:30.163 --> 00:06:32.003
This is an ad for MTN,

00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:34.645
which is a South African multinational

00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:37.394
active in about 25 countries,

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:38.955
and when they came into Nigeria —

00:06:38.955 --> 00:06:40.912
Nigeria is the big dog in Africa.

00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:43.236
One in seven Africans is a Nigerian,

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.938
and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:47.972
in Nigeria. And when MTN came in, they wanted

00:06:47.972 --> 00:06:50.932
to sell the mobile service like I get in the United States

00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:54.706
or like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe --

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:58.595
expensive monthly plans, you get a phone,

00:06:58.595 --> 00:07:00.595
you pay overages,

00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:02.723
you're killed with fees --

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.527
and their plan crashed and burned.

00:07:04.527 --> 00:07:06.567
And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled,

00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:08.071
and they came up with another plan:

00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:10.257
We don't sell you the phone,

00:07:10.257 --> 00:07:12.087
we don't sell you the monthly plan.

00:07:12.087 --> 00:07:15.223
We only sell you airtime.

00:07:15.223 --> 00:07:17.136
And where's the airtime sold?

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:21.229
It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets,

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:24.953
where people are unregistered, unlicensed,

00:07:24.953 --> 00:07:27.658
but MTN makes most of its profits,

00:07:27.658 --> 00:07:30.345
perhaps 90 percent of its profits,

00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:35.007
from selling through System D, the informal economy.

00:07:35.007 --> 00:07:36.843
And where do the phones come from?

00:07:36.843 --> 00:07:39.717
Well, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China,

00:07:39.717 --> 00:07:43.153
and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking

00:07:43.153 --> 00:07:47.779
electronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatou

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.652
second-hand trade center,

00:07:50.652 --> 00:07:53.836
and if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscles

00:07:53.836 --> 00:07:56.498
who are carrying the boxes, and where are they going?

00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:59.315
They're going to Eddy in Lagos.

00:07:59.315 --> 00:08:02.019
Now, most of the phones there are not second-hand at all.

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:03.326
The name is a misnomer.

00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:06.234
Most of them are pirated. They have the name brand

00:08:06.234 --> 00:08:09.315
on them, but they're not manufactured by the name brand.

00:08:09.315 --> 00:08:11.971
Now, are there downsides to that?

00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:15.219
Well, I guess. You know, China has no —

00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:18.511
(Laughter) — no intellectual property, right?

00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:20.412
Versace without the vowels.

00:08:20.412 --> 00:08:22.474
Zhuomani instead of Armani.

00:08:22.474 --> 00:08:27.481
S. Guuuci, and -- (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:27.481 --> 00:08:30.610
All around the world this is how products

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.130
are being distributed, so, for instance,

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.289
in one street market on Rua 25 de Março

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.258
in São Paulo, Brazil,

00:08:38.258 --> 00:08:41.554
you can buy fake designer glasses.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.617
You can buy cloned cologne.

00:08:43.617 --> 00:08:46.392
You can buy pirated DVDs, of course.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:49.249
You can buy New York Yankees caps

00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:52.455
in all sorts of unauthorized patterns.

00:08:52.455 --> 00:08:55.544
You can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwear

00:08:55.544 --> 00:08:57.841
that isn't really manufactured by a designer,

00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.215
and even pirated evangelical mixtapes. (Laughter)

00:09:02.215 --> 00:09:04.969
Now, businesses tend to complain about this,

00:09:04.969 --> 00:09:08.508
and their, they, I don't want to take away from their

00:09:08.508 --> 00:09:10.546
entire validity of complaining about it,

00:09:10.546 --> 00:09:15.044
but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year

00:09:15.044 --> 00:09:17.941
what they thought about piracy,

00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:19.288
and they told me, "Well, you can't quote me on this,

00:09:19.288 --> 00:09:21.388
because if you quote me on this, I have to kill you,"

00:09:21.388 --> 00:09:27.092
but they use piracy as market research.

00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:30.316
The sneaker manufacturer told me that if

00:09:30.316 --> 00:09:34.003
they find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidas

00:09:34.003 --> 00:09:37.289
are being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated,

00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:40.174
they know they've done something wrong. (Laughter)

00:09:40.174 --> 00:09:43.251
So it's very important to them to track piracy

00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:45.615
exactly because of this, and the people who are buying,

00:09:45.615 --> 00:09:47.735
the pirates, are not their customers anyway,

00:09:47.735 --> 00:09:50.467
because their customers want the real deal.

00:09:50.467 --> 00:09:51.960
Now, there's another problem.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.292
This is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:09:55.292 --> 00:09:58.356
All of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?

00:09:58.356 --> 00:10:00.161
And when I think about that, first of all I think that

00:10:00.161 --> 00:10:03.875
government is a social contract between the people and

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:06.391
the government, and if the government isn't transparent,

00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:08.612
then the people aren't going to be transparent either,

00:10:08.612 --> 00:10:11.660
but also that we're blaming the little guy

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.597
who doesn't pay his taxes, and we're not recognizing

00:10:13.597 --> 00:10:16.370
that everyone's fudging things all over the world,

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.403
including some extremely respected businesses,

00:10:20.403 --> 00:10:21.543
and I'll give you one example.

00:10:21.543 --> 00:10:25.694
There was one company that paid 4,000 bribes

00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:28.092
in the first decade of this millennium, and

00:10:28.092 --> 00:10:32.993
a million dollars in bribes every business day, right?

00:10:32.993 --> 00:10:35.288
All over the world. And that company

00:10:35.288 --> 00:10:38.194
was the big German electronics giant Siemens.

00:10:38.194 --> 00:10:42.072
So this goes on in the formal economy

00:10:42.072 --> 00:10:44.270
as well as the informal economy,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.400
so it's wrong of us to blame — and I'm not singling out

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.119
Siemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay?

00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:53.568
I just want to end by saying that if Adam Smith

00:10:53.568 --> 00:10:56.408
had framed out a theory of the flea market

00:10:56.408 --> 00:10:59.719
instead of the free market, what would be some

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:01.728
of the principles?

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:05.488
First, it would be to understand that it could be

00:11:05.488 --> 00:11:07.679
considered a cooperative, and this is a thought

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:12.264
from the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger.

00:11:12.264 --> 00:11:14.857
Cooperative development is a way forward.

00:11:14.857 --> 00:11:19.535
Secondly, from the [Austrian] anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend,

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:23.823
facts are relative, and what is a massive right

00:11:23.823 --> 00:11:26.808
of self-reliance to a Nigerian businessperson

00:11:26.808 --> 00:11:30.819
is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people,

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:32.836
and we have to recognize that there are differences

00:11:32.836 --> 00:11:34.893
in how people define things and what their facts are.

00:11:34.893 --> 00:11:37.993
And third is, and I'm taking this from

00:11:37.993 --> 00:11:41.273
the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg,

00:11:41.273 --> 00:11:44.425
that alternate economies barter and

00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:47.176
different kinds of currency, alternate currencies

00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:50.018
are also very important, and he talked about

00:11:50.018 --> 00:11:53.009
buying what he needed just with his good looks.

00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:56.640
And so I just want to leave you there, and say that

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.856
this economy is a tremendous force for global development

00:12:00.856 --> 00:12:02.823
and we need to think about it that way.

00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:05.839
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:08.964
(Applause)
