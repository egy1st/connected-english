00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:03.068
I'd like to tell you about two games of chess.

00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:06.932
The first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov,

00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:10.648
a human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine.

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:12.888
To many, this was the dawn of a new era,

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.667
one where man would be dominated by machine.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:19.001
But here we are, 20 years on, and the greatest change

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.691
in how we relate to computers is the iPad,

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:23.736
not HAL.

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:26.384
The second game was a freestyle chess tournament

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.353
in 2005, in which man and machine could enter together

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:34.019
as partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose.

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.870
At first, the results were predictable.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.367
Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.679
with a relatively weak laptop.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.664
The surprise came at the end. Who won?

00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:46.440
Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.933
but actually two American amateurs

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.755
using three relatively weak laptops.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.351
Their ability to coach and manipulate their computers

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.786
to deeply explore specific positions

00:00:56.786 --> 00:00:59.176
effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:01.785
of the grandmasters and the superior computational power

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:03.694
of other adversaries.

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:06.599
This is an astonishing result: average men,

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.680
average machines beating the best man, the best machine.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.879
And anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine?

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:18.031
Instead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.888
We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's

00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:24.130
vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.392
It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.

00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:29.145
It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science.

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.217
But as we enter the era of big data, of network systems,

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:34.915
of open platforms, and embedded technology,

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:38.307
I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision

00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:41.377
that was actually developed around the same time.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:44.709
I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis,

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.517
perhaps better termed "intelligence augmentation," I.A.

00:01:48.517 --> 00:01:51.157
Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound

00:01:51.157 --> 00:01:54.163
effect on the development of technology and the Internet.

00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:57.031
His vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate

00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.621
in making decisions, controlling complex situations

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.391
without the inflexible dependence

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.924
on predetermined programs.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.422
Note that word "cooperate."

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:10.169
Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.453
and make it Data from "Star Trek,"

00:02:12.453 --> 00:02:15.988
but to take a human and make her more capable.

00:02:15.988 --> 00:02:17.899
Humans are so amazing -- how we think,

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.517
our non-linear approaches, our creativity,

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:22.648
iterative hypotheses, all very difficult if possible at all

00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:23.993
for computers to do.

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:26.445
Licklider intuitively realized this, contemplating humans

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.772
setting the goals, formulating the hypotheses,

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:32.148
determining the criteria, and performing the evaluation.

00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:33.923
Of course, in other ways, humans are so limited.

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:37.158
We're terrible at scale, computation and volume.

00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:38.994
We require high-end talent management

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:41.058
to keep the rock band together and playing.

00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:43.262
Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:46.538
that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making.

00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:48.762
Silently, without much fanfare,

00:02:48.762 --> 00:02:52.116
this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:55.472
Protein folding, a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess —

00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:58.514
there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe.

00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:00.867
This is a world-changing problem with huge implications

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:03.175
for our ability to understand and treat disease.

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:07.423
And for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough.

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:09.807
Foldit, a game created by computer scientists,

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:12.309
illustrates the value of the approach.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.350
Non-technical, non-biologist amateurs play a video game

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.423
in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein,

00:03:18.423 --> 00:03:19.922
allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces

00:03:19.922 --> 00:03:22.879
and interactions and identify structural issues.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.902
This approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time

00:03:25.902 --> 00:03:28.486
and tied 30 percent of the time.

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:31.623
Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:34.783
by deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:37.798
A protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years

00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:40.424
was solved was by three players in a matter of days,

00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:42.449
perhaps the first major scientific advance

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.772
to come from playing a video game.

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:46.953
Last year, on the site of the Twin Towers,

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:48.426
the 9/11 memorial opened.

00:03:48.426 --> 00:03:51.147
It displays the names of the thousands of victims

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.210
using a beautiful concept called "meaningful adjacency."

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.376
It places the names next to each other based on their

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:58.589
relationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers.

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.617
When you put it all together, it's quite a computational

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:05.840
challenge: 3,500 victims, 1,800 adjacency requests,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.932
the importance of the overall physical specifications

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:11.069
and the final aesthetics.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.684
When first reported by the media, full credit for such a feat

00:04:13.684 --> 00:04:15.576
was given to an algorithm from the New York City

00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:19.577
design firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced.

00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:22.448
While an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework,

00:04:22.448 --> 00:04:25.456
humans used that framework to design the final result.

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:27.681
So in this case, a computer had evaluated millions

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:31.016
of possible layouts, managed a complex relational system,

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:33.430
and kept track of a very large set of measurements

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.840
and variables, allowing the humans to focus

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.642
on design and compositional choices.

00:04:38.642 --> 00:04:39.678
So the more you look around you,

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.640
the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.944
Whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car,

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:47.914
human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable.

00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:49.569
So if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis,

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:50.998
what can you do?

00:04:50.998 --> 00:04:53.450
You can start by designing the human into the process.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.654
Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem,

00:04:55.654 --> 00:04:59.523
design the solution around what the human will do as well.

00:04:59.523 --> 00:05:01.460
When you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.339
all of your time on the interface between man and machine,

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.438
specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction.

00:05:07.438 --> 00:05:10.204
In fact, this friction is more important than the power

00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:12.256
of the man or the power of the machine

00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:14.187
in determining overall capability.

00:05:14.187 --> 00:05:16.164
That's why two amateurs with a few laptops

00:05:16.164 --> 00:05:18.620
handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.625
What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.026
The better the process, the less the friction.

00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:28.282
And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable.

00:05:28.282 --> 00:05:30.525
Or take another example: big data.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.431
Every interaction we have in the world is recorded

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:35.490
by an ever growing array of sensors: your phone,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.863
your credit card, your computer. The result is big data,

00:05:37.863 --> 00:05:39.605
and it actually presents us with an opportunity

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.267
to more deeply understand the human condition.

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:44.572
The major emphasis of most approaches to big data

00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:46.787
focus on, "How do I store this data? How do I search

00:05:46.787 --> 00:05:49.063
this data? How do I process this data?"

00:05:49.063 --> 00:05:51.267
These are necessary but insufficient questions.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.738
The imperative is not to figure out how to compute,

00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:55.922
but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.713
on data at this scale?

00:05:57.713 --> 00:06:01.212
Again, we start by designing the human into the process.

00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:04.024
When PayPal was first starting as a business, their biggest

00:06:04.024 --> 00:06:06.828
challenge was not, "How do I send money back and forth online?"

00:06:06.828 --> 00:06:10.700
It was, "How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?"

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.788
Why so challenging? Because while computers can learn

00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:15.932
to detect and identify fraud based on patterns,

00:06:15.932 --> 00:06:17.411
they can't learn to do that based on patterns

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:19.527
they've never seen before, and organized crime

00:06:19.527 --> 00:06:22.236
has a lot in common with this audience: brilliant people,

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:25.876
relentlessly resourceful, entrepreneurial spirit — (Laughter) —

00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:28.588
and one huge and important difference: purpose.

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:31.420
And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.673
fraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference

00:06:33.673 --> 00:06:36.218
between success and failure.

00:06:36.218 --> 00:06:38.439
There's a whole class of problems like this, ones with

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.014
adaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a

00:06:41.014 --> 00:06:43.750
repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.743
Instead, there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption,

00:06:47.743 --> 00:06:50.478
and increasingly these problems are buried in big data.

00:06:50.478 --> 00:06:52.978
For example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting

00:06:52.978 --> 00:06:55.030
in minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.124
what you might see on TV, these adaptations,

00:06:58.124 --> 00:07:00.417
and the detection of them, are fundamentally human.

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:03.534
Computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors,

00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:06.769
but humans do. Humans, using technology, testing hypotheses,

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:11.389
searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.709
Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence.

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.262
He was caught by dedicated, resourceful, brilliant people

00:07:16.262 --> 00:07:20.531
in partnerships with various technologies.

00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:23.349
As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:24.950
data mine your way to the answer.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.805
There is no "Find Terrorist" button, and the more data

00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:30.107
we integrate from a vast variety of sources

00:07:30.107 --> 00:07:32.240
across a wide variety of data formats from very

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.549
disparate systems, the less effective data mining can be.

00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:37.573
Instead, people will have to look at data

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:41.029
and search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago,

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:43.714
the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation,

00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:45.238
and as Kasparov realized,

00:07:45.238 --> 00:07:48.269
that means minimizing friction at the interface.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:51.027
Now this approach makes possible things like combing

00:07:51.027 --> 00:07:54.413
through all available data from very different sources,

00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:57.205
identifying key relationships and putting them in one place,

00:07:57.205 --> 00:08:00.133
something that's been nearly impossible to do before.

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:02.075
To some, this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties

00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:05.485
implications. To others it foretells of an era of greater

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.394
privacy and civil liberties protections,

00:08:07.394 --> 00:08:10.330
but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.523
That must be acknowledged, and they can't be swept aside,

00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:15.053
even with the best of intents.

00:08:15.053 --> 00:08:17.571
So let's explore, through a couple of examples, the impact

00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:19.977
that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis

00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:22.896
have had in recent time.

00:08:22.896 --> 00:08:26.312
In October, 2007, U.S. and coalition forces raided

00:08:26.312 --> 00:08:28.728
an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar

00:08:28.728 --> 00:08:30.662
on the Syrian border of Iraq.

00:08:30.662 --> 00:08:33.038
They found a treasure trove of documents:

00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:35.373
700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters.

00:08:35.373 --> 00:08:37.957
These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf,

00:08:37.957 --> 00:08:41.103
the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq.

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:42.719
These records were human resource forms.

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:45.574
The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization.

00:08:45.574 --> 00:08:46.785
It turns out that al Qaeda, too,

00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:49.382
is not without its bureaucracy. (Laughter)

00:08:49.382 --> 00:08:51.480
They answered questions like, "Who recruited you?"

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.334
"What's your hometown?" "What occupation do you seek?"

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:57.503
In that last question, a surprising insight was revealed.

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.903
The vast majority of foreign fighters

00:08:59.903 --> 00:09:02.303
were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom --

00:09:02.303 --> 00:09:06.641
hugely important, since between 2003 and 2007, Iraq

00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:10.885
had 1,382 suicide bombings, a major source of instability.

00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:12.943
Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets

00:09:12.943 --> 00:09:15.685
of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.

00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:17.877
The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful

00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:21.227
results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.445
and tenacity alone.

00:09:23.445 --> 00:09:25.398
The researchers had to lever up their human minds

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.743
with technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious

00:09:27.743 --> 00:09:30.961
hypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged.

00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:33.605
Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya,

00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:36.573
50 percent of those from a single town in Libya,

00:09:36.573 --> 00:09:39.023
hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at

00:09:39.023 --> 00:09:41.406
three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure

00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:44.383
of rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi,

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:47.014
a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group.

00:09:47.014 --> 00:09:49.678
In March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was

00:09:49.678 --> 00:09:53.144
a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters.

00:09:53.144 --> 00:09:56.250
Perhaps most clever of all, though, and least obvious,

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.323
by flipping the data on its head, the researchers were

00:09:58.323 --> 00:10:01.223
able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria

00:10:01.223 --> 00:10:03.740
that were ultimately responsible for receiving and

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.204
transporting the foreign fighters to the border.

00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:08.837
These were networks of mercenaries, not ideologues,

00:10:08.837 --> 00:10:11.235
who were in the coordination business for profit.

00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:13.139
For example, they charged Saudi foreign fighters

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:15.338
substantially more than Libyans, money that would have

00:10:15.338 --> 00:10:17.658
otherwise gone to al Qaeda.

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.703
Perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:22.738
if they knew they cheating would-be jihadists.

00:10:22.738 --> 00:10:26.483
In January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti,

00:10:26.483 --> 00:10:29.399
third deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people,

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.983
10 percent of the population, homeless.

00:10:31.983 --> 00:10:35.120
One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.296
became increasingly important as the delivery of food

00:10:37.296 --> 00:10:39.456
and water started rolling.

00:10:39.456 --> 00:10:40.914
January and February are the dry months in Haiti,

00:10:40.914 --> 00:10:43.856
yet many of the camps had developed standing water.

00:10:43.856 --> 00:10:45.978
The only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's

00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:47.275
floodplains had been leveled

00:10:47.275 --> 00:10:50.283
in the earthquake, leadership inside.

00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:52.858
So the question is, which camps are at risk,

00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:54.779
how many people are in these camps, what's the

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.090
timeline for flooding, and given very limited resources

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.474
and infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation?

00:11:00.474 --> 00:11:02.818
The data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had

00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:05.747
detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country.

00:11:05.747 --> 00:11:08.258
There was data online from a 2006 environmental risk

00:11:08.258 --> 00:11:10.922
conference, other geospatial data, none of it integrated.

00:11:10.922 --> 00:11:13.880
The human goal here was to identify camps for relocation

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.275
based on priority need.

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:18.715
The computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial

00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:21.299
information, social media data and relief organization

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:24.779
information to answer this question.

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:27.194
By implementing a superior process, what was otherwise

00:11:27.194 --> 00:11:29.802
a task for 40 people over three months became

00:11:29.802 --> 00:11:32.978
a simple job for three people in 40 hours,

00:11:32.978 --> 00:11:35.606
all victories for human-computer symbiosis.

00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:37.660
We're more than 50 years into Licklider's vision

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.902
for the future, and the data suggests that we should be

00:11:39.902 --> 00:11:42.932
quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems,

00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:45.879
man and machine in cooperation together.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:48.076
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:48.076 --> 00:11:50.581
