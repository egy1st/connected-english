00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:03.204
I want you to imagine this for a moment.

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:06.099
Two men, Rahul and Rajiv,

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:07.957
living in the same neighborhood,

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:11.252
from the same educational background, similar occupation,

00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:14.020
and they both turn up at their local accident emergency

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.836
complaining of acute chest pain.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:19.960
Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.771
but Rajiv is sent home.

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.281
What might explain the difference in the experience

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:28.533
of these two nearly identical men?

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:32.020
Rajiv suffers from a mental illness.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.119
The difference in the quality of medical care

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:37.980
received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.895
why they live shorter lives

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:41.478
than people without mental illness.

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:44.148
Even in the best-resourced countries in the world,

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:48.918
this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years.

00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:50.843
In the developing countries of the world, this gap

00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:53.468
is even larger.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:56.327
But of course, mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:59.688
as well. The most obvious example is suicide.

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:02.343
It might surprise some of you here, as it did me,

00:01:02.343 --> 00:01:05.280
when I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.845
of the leading causes of death in young people

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:09.493
in all countries in the world,

00:01:09.493 --> 00:01:12.885
including the poorest countries of the world.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.719
But beyond the impact of a health condition

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.089
on life expectancy, we're also concerned

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:20.783
about the quality of life lived.

00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:23.032
Now, in order for us to examine the overall impact

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:25.405
of a health condition both on life expectancy

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:28.563
as well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:29.949
a metric called the DALY,

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:34.236
which stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year.

00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:36.757
Now when we do that, we discover some startling things

00:01:36.757 --> 00:01:39.579
about mental illness from a global perspective.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.843
We discover that, for example, mental illnesses are

00:01:42.843 --> 00:01:47.431
amongst the leading causes of disability around the world.

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:50.166
Depression, for example, is the third-leading cause

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.138
of disability, alongside conditions such as

00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:56.490
diarrhea and pneumonia in children.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.594
When you put all the mental illnesses together,

00:01:58.594 --> 00:02:00.856
they account for roughly 15 percent

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:04.062
of the total global burden of disease.

00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:08.573
Indeed, mental illnesses are also very damaging

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:14.018
to people's lives, but beyond just the burden of disease,

00:02:14.018 --> 00:02:16.730
let us consider the absolute numbers.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.789
The World Health Organization estimates

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.894
that there are nearly four to five hundred million people

00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:24.077
living on our tiny planet

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.738
who are affected by a mental illness.

00:02:25.738 --> 00:02:27.457
Now some of you here

00:02:27.457 --> 00:02:30.055
look a bit astonished by that number,

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:32.548
but consider for a moment the incredible diversity

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:35.702
of mental illnesses, from autism and intellectual disability

00:02:35.702 --> 00:02:38.383
in childhood, through to depression and anxiety,

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:40.664
substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood,

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:42.300
all the way through to dementia in old age,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.254
and I'm pretty sure that each and every one us

00:02:45.254 --> 00:02:48.606
present here today can think of at least one person,

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:51.928
at least one person, who's affected by mental illness

00:02:51.928 --> 00:02:56.359
in our most intimate social networks.

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.564
I see some nodding heads there.

00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:02.534
But beyond the staggering numbers,

00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:05.543
what's truly important from a global health point of view,

00:03:05.543 --> 00:03:08.088
what's truly worrying from a global health point of view,

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:11.256
is that the vast majority of these affected individuals

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:13.265
do not receive the care

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:15.731
that we know can transform their lives, and remember,

00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.792
we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions,

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:21.244
medicines, psychological interventions,

00:03:21.244 --> 00:03:24.732
and social interventions, can make a vast difference.

00:03:24.732 --> 00:03:26.983
And yet, even in the best-resourced countries,

00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:29.918
for example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.035
of affected people don't receive these interventions.

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:35.352
In the sorts of countries I work in,

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:37.502
that so-called treatment gap

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:42.389
approaches an astonishing 90 percent.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.601
It isn't surprising, then, that if you should speak

00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.032
to anyone affected by a mental illness,

00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:50.844
the chances are that you will hear stories

00:03:50.844 --> 00:03:54.894
of hidden suffering, shame and discrimination

00:03:54.894 --> 00:03:57.843
in nearly every sector of their lives.

00:03:57.843 --> 00:04:00.553
But perhaps most heartbreaking of all

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:03.242
are the stories of the abuse

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.774
of even the most basic human rights,

00:04:05.774 --> 00:04:08.631
such as the young woman shown in this image here

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:10.695
that are played out every day,

00:04:10.695 --> 00:04:14.639
sadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.474
for people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:21.502
It's this injustice that has really driven my mission

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:23.894
to try to do a little bit to transform the lives

00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:26.640
of people affected by mental illness, and a particularly

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.489
critical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf

00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:33.275
between the knowledge we have that can transform lives,

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:35.717
the knowledge of effective treatments, and how we actually

00:04:35.717 --> 00:04:39.139
use that knowledge in the everyday world.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.298
And an especially important challenge that I've had to face

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:45.223
is the great shortage of mental health professionals,

00:04:45.223 --> 00:04:46.895
such as psychiatrists and psychologists,

00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:49.683
particularly in the developing world.

00:04:49.683 --> 00:04:52.368
Now I trained in medicine in India, and after that

00:04:52.368 --> 00:04:55.787
I chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay

00:04:55.787 --> 00:04:58.015
of my mother and all my family members who

00:04:58.015 --> 00:04:59.718
kind of thought neurosurgery would be

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:02.887
a more respectable option for their brilliant son.

00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:05.621
Any case, I went on, I soldiered on with psychiatry,

00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:07.916
and found myself training in Britain in some of

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:10.291
the best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged.

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:13.834
I worked in a team of incredibly talented, compassionate,

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:17.085
but most importantly, highly trained, specialized

00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:19.276
mental health professionals.

00:05:19.276 --> 00:05:21.248
Soon after my training, I found myself working

00:05:21.248 --> 00:05:23.691
first in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:26.551
by an altogether new reality.

00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:29.897
This was a reality of a world in which there were almost no

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:32.262
mental health professionals at all.

00:05:32.262 --> 00:05:34.296
In Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about

00:05:34.296 --> 00:05:37.356
a dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:39.482
in Harare city, leaving only a couple

00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:41.875
to address the mental health care needs

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:45.543
of nine million people living in the countryside.

00:05:45.543 --> 00:05:49.160
In India, I found the situation was not a lot better.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.583
To give you a perspective, if I had to translate

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.791
the proportion of psychiatrists in the population

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:56.173
that one might see in Britain to India,

00:05:56.173 --> 00:06:01.782
one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in India.

00:06:01.782 --> 00:06:04.813
In reality, take a guess.

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:07.378
The actual number is about 3,000,

00:06:07.378 --> 00:06:09.842
about two percent of that number.

00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:12.339
It became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.400
the sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.339
one that relied heavily on specialized, expensive

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.871
mental health professionals to provide mental health care

00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:23.331
in countries like India and Zimbabwe.

00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:25.984
I had to think out of the box about some other model

00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:27.607
of care.

00:06:27.607 --> 00:06:30.720
It was then that I came across these books,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.963
and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting

00:06:33.963 --> 00:06:36.031
in global health.

00:06:36.031 --> 00:06:38.307
The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is,

00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:41.321
when you're short of specialized health care professionals,

00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:44.370
use whoever is available in the community,

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.307
train them to provide a range of health care interventions,

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:50.175
and in these books I read inspiring examples,

00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:53.111
for example of how ordinary people had been trained

00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:54.464
to deliver babies,

00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:58.095
diagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect.

00:06:58.095 --> 00:07:00.846
And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people

00:07:00.846 --> 00:07:03.070
to deliver such complex health care interventions,

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.143
then perhaps they could also do the same

00:07:05.143 --> 00:07:07.135
with mental health care.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.004
Well today, I'm very pleased to report to you

00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:13.116
that there have been many experiments in task shifting

00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:15.887
in mental health care across the developing world

00:07:15.887 --> 00:07:17.950
over the past decade, and I want to share with you

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.647
the findings of three particular such experiments,

00:07:20.647 --> 00:07:22.734
all three of which focused on depression,

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:25.169
the most common of all mental illnesses.

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:28.511
In rural Uganda, Paul Bolton and his colleagues,

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:32.355
using villagers, demonstrated that they could deliver

00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:34.710
interpersonal psychotherapy for depression

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.382
and, using a randomized control design,

00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:39.627
showed that 90 percent of the people receiving

00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:41.587
this intervention recovered as compared

00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:45.128
to roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages.

00:07:45.128 --> 00:07:49.268
Similarly, using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan,

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.608
Atif Rahman and his colleagues showed

00:07:51.608 --> 00:07:54.343
that lady health visitors, who are community maternal

00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:57.132
health workers in Pakistan's health care system,

00:07:57.132 --> 00:07:59.349
could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:01.857
who were depressed, again showing dramatic differences

00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:04.704
in the recovery rates. Roughly 75 percent of mothers

00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:07.269
recovered as compared to about 45 percent

00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:09.553
in the comparison villages.

00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:12.639
And in my own trial in Goa, in India, we again showed

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.167
that lay counselors drawn from local communities

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:17.851
could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions

00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:20.433
for depression, anxiety, leading to 70 percent

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.516
recovery rates as compared to 50 percent

00:08:22.516 --> 00:08:25.722
in the comparison primary health centers.

00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:27.691
Now, if I had to draw together all these different

00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:30.223
experiments in task shifting, and there have of course

00:08:30.223 --> 00:08:32.597
been many other examples, and try and identify

00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:34.615
what are the key lessons we can learn that makes

00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:37.693
for a successful task shifting operation,

00:08:37.693 --> 00:08:41.549
I have coined this particular acronym, SUNDAR.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.783
What SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is "attractive."

00:08:45.783 --> 00:08:47.998
It seems to me that there are five key lessons

00:08:47.998 --> 00:08:50.597
that I've shown on this slide that are critically important

00:08:50.597 --> 00:08:52.780
for effective task shifting.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.806
The first is that we need to simplify the message

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:58.190
that we're using, stripping away all the jargon

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.511
that medicine has invented around itself.

00:09:01.511 --> 00:09:04.468
We need to unpack complex health care interventions

00:09:04.468 --> 00:09:06.696
into smaller components that can be more easily

00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:09.351
transferred to less-trained individuals.

00:09:09.351 --> 00:09:11.918
We need to deliver health care, not in large institutions,

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.144
but close to people's homes, and we need to deliver

00:09:14.144 --> 00:09:16.916
health care using whoever is available and affordable

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:19.297
in our local communities.

00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:22.177
And importantly, we need to reallocate the few specialists

00:09:22.177 --> 00:09:24.245
who are available to perform roles

00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:27.723
such as capacity-building and supervision.

00:09:27.723 --> 00:09:30.055
Now for me, task shifting is an idea

00:09:30.055 --> 00:09:33.014
with truly global significance,

00:09:33.014 --> 00:09:35.547
because even though it has arisen out of the

00:09:35.547 --> 00:09:39.045
situation of the lack of resources that you find

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:42.004
in developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance

00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:44.885
for better-resourced countries as well. Why is that?

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:48.405
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world,

00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:50.880
the health care costs in the [developed] world,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.457
are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk

00:09:53.457 --> 00:09:56.877
of those costs are human resource costs.

00:09:56.877 --> 00:09:59.363
But equally important is because health care has become

00:09:59.363 --> 00:10:03.200
so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.955
and removed from local communities.

00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:09.677
For me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting,

00:10:09.677 --> 00:10:11.323
though, isn't that it simply makes health care

00:10:11.323 --> 00:10:14.481
more accessible and affordable but that

00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:17.037
it is also fundamentally empowering.

00:10:17.037 --> 00:10:20.669
It empowers ordinary people to be more effective

00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:23.492
in caring for the health of others in their community,

00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:24.981
and in doing so, to become better guardians

00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:28.263
of their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting

00:10:28.263 --> 00:10:30.950
is the ultimate example of the democratization

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:36.199
of medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.

00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:39.650
Just over 30 years ago, the nations of the world assembled

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.623
at Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration.

00:10:42.623 --> 00:10:44.228
Well, I think all of you can guess

00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:47.943
that 12 years on, we're still nowhere near that goal.

00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:50.608
Still, today, armed with that knowledge

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.264
that ordinary people in the community

00:10:53.264 --> 00:10:56.427
can be trained and, with sufficient supervision and support,

00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:59.699
can deliver a range of health care interventions effectively,

00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:03.580
perhaps that promise is within reach now.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.224
Indeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All,

00:11:07.224 --> 00:11:09.010
we will need to involve all

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.669
in that particular journey,

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:13.615
and in the case of mental health, in particular we would

00:11:13.615 --> 00:11:16.518
need to involve people who are affected by mental illness

00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:17.972
and their caregivers.

00:11:17.972 --> 00:11:20.508
It is for this reason that, some years ago,

00:11:20.508 --> 00:11:22.426
the Movement for Global Mental Health was founded

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:26.449
as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals

00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:29.256
like myself and people affected by mental illness

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:31.968
could stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder,

00:11:31.968 --> 00:11:34.454
and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness

00:11:34.454 --> 00:11:37.671
to receive the care that we know can transform their lives,

00:11:37.671 --> 00:11:40.680
and to live a life with dignity.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.197
And in closing, when you have a moment of peace or quiet

00:11:44.197 --> 00:11:47.023
in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards,

00:11:47.023 --> 00:11:49.777
spare a thought for that person you thought about

00:11:49.777 --> 00:11:52.354
who has a mental illness, or persons that you thought about

00:11:52.354 --> 00:11:53.942
who have mental illness,

00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:57.746
and dare to care for them. Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:57.746 --> 00:12:01.810
