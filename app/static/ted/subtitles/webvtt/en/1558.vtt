00:00:00.795 --> 00:00:02.615
So when the White House was built

00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:05.608
in the early 19th century, it was an open house.

00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:08.744
Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams,

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:10.113
a local dentist happened by.

00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:12.704
He wanted to shake the President's hand.

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:14.854
The President dismissed the Secretary of State,

00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:16.772
whom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:18.582
if he would remove a tooth.

00:00:18.582 --> 00:00:21.640
Later, in the 1850s, under President Pierce,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.228
he was known to have remarked

00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:25.797
— probably the only thing he's known for —

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:28.548
when a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:30.813
the beautiful house," and Pierce said to him,

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:33.428
"Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.

00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:37.153
This isn't my house. It is the people's house."

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:39.225
Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.445
of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration,

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.317
the White House was anything but open.

00:00:45.317 --> 00:00:47.845
Bomb blast curtains covered my windows.

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:50.024
We were running Windows 2000.

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:52.207
Social media were blocked at the firewall.

00:00:52.207 --> 00:00:54.747
We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts

00:00:54.747 --> 00:00:56.770
like we have today.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.383
I came in to become the head of Open Government,

00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:02.181
to take the values and the practices of transparency,

00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.594
participation and collaboration, and instill them

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:08.420
into the way that we work, to open up government,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.940
to work with people.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.634
Now one of the things that we know

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:15.650
is that companies are very good at getting people to work

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.898
together in teams and in networks to make

00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:21.540
very complex products, like cars and computers,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.228
and the more complex the products are a society creates,

00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:28.083
the more successful the society is over time.

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:30.828
Companies make goods, but governments,

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:33.948
they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:36.756
and educating our children and making roads,

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:40.397
but we don't have institutions that are particularly good

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:42.933
at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:46.050
that are good at bringing our talents to bear,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.512
at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.

00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:52.773
So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy,

00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:55.349
what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.293
employees how we should open up government.

00:01:58.293 --> 00:02:01.525
Turns out that had never been done before.

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:04.144
We wanted to ask members of the public to help us

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:07.422
come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:10.805
on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case,

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:14.125
but in advance. There was no legal precedent,

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:17.267
no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:20.108
In fact, many people told us it was illegal.

00:02:20.108 --> 00:02:23.221
Here's the crux of the obstacle.

00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.822
Governments exist to channel the flow of two things,

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:29.316
really, values and expertise to and from government

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:33.165
and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.

00:02:33.165 --> 00:02:35.558
But the way that our institutions are designed,

00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:38.609
in our rather 18th-century, centralized model,

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.293
is to channel the flow of values through voting,

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:44.493
once every four years, once every two years, at best,

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:48.054
once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this

00:02:48.054 --> 00:02:52.059
era of social media, for us to actually express our values.

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.671
Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves

00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:57.675
a great deal, perhaps a little too much.

00:02:57.675 --> 00:02:59.949
Then in the 19th century, we layer on

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.356
the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state

00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:05.499
to help us govern complex and large societies.

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.731
But we've centralized these bureaucracies.

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:11.176
We've entrenched them. And we know that

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:13.888
the smartest person always works for someone else.

00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:16.568
We need to only look around this room to know that

00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:20.165
expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society,

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:24.336
and not limited simply to our institutions.

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:26.602
Scientists have been studying in recent years

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:29.136
the phenomenon that they often describe as flow,

00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:32.400
that the design of our systems, whether natural or social,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.083
channel the flow of whatever runs through them.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:38.360
So a river is designed to channel the flow of water,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.830
and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.334
the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:46.354
the flow of nutrients to the tree,

00:03:46.354 --> 00:03:49.358
sometimes even having to route around an obstacle,

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:52.078
but to get that nutrition flowing.

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.415
The same can be said for our social systems, for our

00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:56.903
systems of government, where, at the very least,

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.918
flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding

00:03:59.918 --> 00:04:02.574
what the problem is, what's really broken,

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:06.259
and the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today,

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.539
to redesign the flow of our institutions.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:14.062
We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks,

00:04:14.062 --> 00:04:18.331
and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions

00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:21.216
that are actually quite recent.

00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:24.456
Think about it: What other business do you know,

00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:26.856
what other sector of the economy, and especially one

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:30.643
as big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent

00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:33.547
its business model on a regular basis?

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:36.638
Sure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest

00:04:36.638 --> 00:04:40.602
in broadband and science education and science grants,

00:04:40.602 --> 00:04:43.953
but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:46.553
the institutions that we have.

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.889
Now, it's very easy to complain, of course, about

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.353
partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love

00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:55.269
to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime,

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:57.921
especially around election time, but

00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:01.307
the world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people,

00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:04.180
many of whom will lack basic resources.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.498
So complain as we might, what actually can replace

00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:09.809
what we have today?

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.916
What comes the day after the Arab Spring?

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:17.802
Well, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself

00:05:17.802 --> 00:05:20.562
to us is that of networks. Right? Networks

00:05:20.562 --> 00:05:23.274
like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean.

00:05:23.274 --> 00:05:25.778
You've got 3,000 employees at Facebook

00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:28.724
governing 900 million inhabitants.

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:31.467
We might even call them citizens, because they've recently

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:34.842
risen up to fight against legislative incursion,

00:05:34.842 --> 00:05:37.377
and the citizens of these networks work together

00:05:37.377 --> 00:05:40.618
to serve each other in great ways.

00:05:40.618 --> 00:05:43.410
But private communities, private, corporate,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.550
privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.560
They cannot replace government.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.662
Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough

00:05:51.662 --> 00:05:54.315
to do the hard work of you and I collaborating

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:58.207
with each other and doing the hard work of governance.

00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:01.145
But social media do teach us something.

00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:05.619
Why is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:08.556
It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:12.027
of new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can

00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:16.361
read and process information in new and exciting ways.

00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:18.698
We need to think about how to open up the API

00:06:18.698 --> 00:06:22.759
of government, and the way that we're going to do that,

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.007
the next great superpower is going to be the one

00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:31.990
who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution --

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.343
because we have to maintain those public values,

00:06:34.343 --> 00:06:37.262
we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity

00:06:37.262 --> 00:06:39.927
and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement

00:06:39.927 --> 00:06:43.023
of networks, all of us working together to build

00:06:43.023 --> 00:06:46.724
these new innovations on top of our institutions,

00:06:46.724 --> 00:06:48.942
to engage in the practice of governance.

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:52.075
We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here,

00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:55.927
in the 12th century, invented the jury.

00:06:55.927 --> 00:07:00.152
Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:02.853
from government to citizens.

00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:06.241
Today we have the opportunity, and we have

00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:09.742
the imperative, to create thousands of new ways

00:07:09.742 --> 00:07:12.981
of interconnecting between networks and institutions,

00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:15.645
thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury,

00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:19.322
the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning

00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:22.376
to invent the models by which we can cocreate

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:24.124
the process of governance.

00:07:24.124 --> 00:07:26.739
Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:29.361
yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution

00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:32.343
emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution,

00:07:32.343 --> 00:07:36.152
I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern.

00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:37.636
Some of it's very high-tech,

00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:39.690
and some of it is extremely low-tech,

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.060
such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.604
India, where they take the spending data of the state

00:07:46.604 --> 00:07:50.047
and paint it on 100,000 village walls,

00:07:50.047 --> 00:07:52.342
and then invite the villagers to come and comment

00:07:52.342 --> 00:07:54.830
who is on the government payroll, who's actually died,

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.454
what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere,

00:07:57.454 --> 00:07:59.798
and to work together through civic engagement to save

00:07:59.798 --> 00:08:03.561
real money and participate and have access to that budget.

00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:05.959
But it's not just about policing government.

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:07.686
It's also about creating government.

00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:10.804
Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding,

00:08:10.804 --> 00:08:13.489
getting you and me to raise the money to build

00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:16.147
the goalposts and the park benches that will actually

00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:19.709
allow us to deliver better services in our communities.

00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:23.347
No one is better at this activity of actually getting us

00:08:23.347 --> 00:08:26.587
to engage in delivering services,

00:08:26.587 --> 00:08:29.738
sometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.

00:08:29.738 --> 00:08:34.091
Created after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008,

00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:38.027
this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able

00:08:38.027 --> 00:08:40.672
to crowdsource and target the delivery of

00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:43.763
better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble,

00:08:43.763 --> 00:08:46.219
whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti,

00:08:46.219 --> 00:08:48.744
or more recently in Italy.

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:51.875
And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter

00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:54.743
is certifying them, not simply to supplement existing

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:58.779
government institutions, but in many cases, to replace them.

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:01.787
Now what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously,

00:09:01.787 --> 00:09:03.474
is the opening up of government data,

00:09:03.474 --> 00:09:06.474
not enough examples of this yet, but we're starting

00:09:06.474 --> 00:09:10.003
to see this practice of people creating and generating

00:09:10.003 --> 00:09:13.472
innovative applications on top of government data.

00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:15.803
There's so many examples I could have picked, and I

00:09:15.803 --> 00:09:18.969
selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you

00:09:18.969 --> 00:09:21.235
may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen

00:09:21.235 --> 00:09:23.996
in New Jersey, where he caters to and serves the homeless

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:25.689
and particularly homeless veterans.

00:09:25.689 --> 00:09:28.467
In February, he approached the White House, and said,

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:32.312
"I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national

00:09:32.312 --> 00:09:35.839
applications, apps, that will help not only the homeless

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:39.274
but those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."

00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:42.514
February 2012 to June of 2012,

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:45.502
the finalists are announced in the competition.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:48.491
Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear,

00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:51.237
getting anything done in a four-month period of time?

00:09:51.237 --> 00:09:53.373
You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time,

00:09:53.373 --> 00:09:56.237
let alone generate real, palpable innovations

00:09:56.237 --> 00:09:58.128
that improve people's lives.

00:09:58.128 --> 00:10:01.361
And I want to be clear to mention that this open government

00:10:01.361 --> 00:10:05.138
revolution is not about privatizing government,

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:08.036
because in many cases what it can do when we have

00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:11.132
the will to do so is to deliver more progressive

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:15.255
and better policy than the regulations and the legislative

00:10:15.255 --> 00:10:18.215
and litigation-oriented strategies

00:10:18.215 --> 00:10:20.815
by which we make policy today.

00:10:20.815 --> 00:10:24.542
In the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions,

00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:26.606
from well-driller to florist.

00:10:26.606 --> 00:10:29.829
Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas,

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:32.988
but do not make a flower arrangement without a license,

00:10:32.988 --> 00:10:35.604
because that will land you in jail.

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:39.621
So what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me,

00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:43.709
using online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:47.270
burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.269
but to replace those regulations with more innovative

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:53.133
alternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation

00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:55.115
of new iPhone apps that will allows us

00:10:55.115 --> 00:10:57.388
both to protect consumers and the public

00:10:57.388 --> 00:11:00.899
and to encourage economic development.

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:04.053
That is a nice sideline of open government.

00:11:04.053 --> 00:11:06.764
It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard

00:11:06.764 --> 00:11:10.221
to development. It's the economic benefits and the

00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:14.847
job creation that's coming from this open innovation work.

00:11:14.847 --> 00:11:17.667
Sberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia,

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:19.467
largely owned by the Russian government,

00:11:19.467 --> 00:11:22.467
has started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging

00:11:22.467 --> 00:11:25.819
its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:30.239
Last year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles,

00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:32.996
from open innovation, and they're pushing radically

00:11:32.996 --> 00:11:35.655
the extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking,

00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:37.698
but into the public sector.

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:40.439
And we see lots of examples of these innovators using

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:43.289
open government data, not simply to make apps,

00:11:43.289 --> 00:11:45.351
but then to make companies and to hire people

00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:47.652
to build them working with the government.

00:11:47.652 --> 00:11:49.782
So a lot of these innovations are local.

00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:52.888
In San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app

00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:56.445
in which they allow you or me to say we are certified

00:11:56.445 --> 00:12:00.012
CPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack,

00:12:00.012 --> 00:12:02.252
a notification goes out so that you

00:12:02.252 --> 00:12:06.208
can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.512
The victim who receives bystander CPR

00:12:08.512 --> 00:12:10.977
is more than twice as likely to survive.

00:12:10.977 --> 00:12:14.652
"There is a hero in all of us," is their slogan.

00:12:14.652 --> 00:12:17.195
But it's not limited to the local.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.856
British Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue

00:12:19.856 --> 00:12:22.940
of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.658
with the state in the cocreation of governance.

00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:29.719
Let me be very clear,

00:12:29.719 --> 00:12:31.188
and perhaps controversial,

00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:33.977
that open government is not

00:12:33.977 --> 00:12:35.950
about transparent government.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.868
Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change

00:12:38.868 --> 00:12:40.280
how government works.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.847
It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data

00:12:42.847 --> 00:12:46.556
to change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change

00:12:46.556 --> 00:12:47.828
government.

00:12:47.828 --> 00:12:50.847
What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship

00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:52.575
between civil society and government

00:12:52.575 --> 00:12:55.618
over the control and ownership of information.

00:12:55.618 --> 00:12:58.202
And transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow

00:12:58.202 --> 00:13:00.614
of money into politics, and arguably,

00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:03.347
it's not even producing accountability as well as it might

00:13:03.347 --> 00:13:06.810
if we took the next step of combining participation and

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.921
collaboration with transparency to transform how we work.

00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:13.658
We're going to see this evolution really in two phases,

00:13:13.658 --> 00:13:16.947
I think. The first phase of the open government revolution

00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:20.723
is delivering better information from the crowd

00:13:20.723 --> 00:13:22.117
into the center.

00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:25.064
Starting in 2005, and this is how this open government

00:13:25.064 --> 00:13:27.018
work in the U.S. really got started,

00:13:27.018 --> 00:13:29.274
I was teaching a patent law class to my students and

00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:33.045
explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.176
has the power to make a decision

00:13:35.176 --> 00:13:39.661
about which patent application becomes the next patent,

00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:42.403
and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights

00:13:42.403 --> 00:13:45.410
over an entire field of inventive activity.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.322
Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website,

00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:50.715
we can make an expert network, a social network,

00:13:50.715 --> 00:13:52.987
that would connect the network to the institution

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:55.368
to allow scientists and technologists to get

00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:58.003
better information to the patent office

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.466
to aid in making those decisions.

00:14:00.466 --> 00:14:03.098
We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan

00:14:03.098 --> 00:14:05.891
and Australia, and now I'm pleased to report

00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:08.147
that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:12.612
universal, complete, and total openness,

00:14:12.612 --> 00:14:15.658
so that all patent applications will now be open

00:14:15.658 --> 00:14:19.326
for citizen participation, beginning this year.

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:22.262
The second phase of this evolution — Yeah. (Applause)

00:14:22.262 --> 00:14:25.215
They deserve a hand. (Applause)

00:14:25.215 --> 00:14:27.750
The first phase is in getting better information in.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.607
The second phase is in getting decision-making power out.

00:14:31.607 --> 00:14:34.222
Participatory budgeting has long been practiced

00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:35.641
in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:38.623
They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago.

00:14:38.623 --> 00:14:42.159
Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together,

00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:44.511
as is Lithuania. When we start to see

00:14:44.511 --> 00:14:46.815
power over the core functions of government

00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:50.435
— spending, legislation, decision-making —

00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:54.496
then we're well on our way to an open government revolution.

00:14:54.496 --> 00:14:58.327
There are many things that we can do to get us there.

00:14:58.327 --> 00:15:00.990
Obviously opening up the data is one,

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.353
but the important thing is to create lots more --

00:15:03.353 --> 00:15:07.583
create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities.

00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:10.281
Hackathons and mashathons and working with data

00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:13.990
to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.490
and participate, like the jury is,

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.514
but we're going to need lots more things like it.

00:15:19.514 --> 00:15:24.165
And that's why we need to start with our youngest people.

00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:26.781
We've heard talk here at TED about people

00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:30.850
biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.894
and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting

00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:37.253
young people to build websites and make videos.

00:15:37.253 --> 00:15:39.989
When we start by teaching young people that we live,

00:15:39.989 --> 00:15:43.507
not in a passive society, a read-only society,

00:15:43.507 --> 00:15:46.074
but in a writable society, where we have the power

00:15:46.074 --> 00:15:49.698
to change our communities, to change our institutions,

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:52.834
that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway

00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:56.045
towards this open government innovation,

00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:57.754
towards this open government movement,

00:15:57.754 --> 00:16:00.277
towards this open government revolution.

00:16:00.277 --> 00:16:02.523
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing

00:16:02.523 --> 00:16:08.382
for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.

00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:11.677
We don't have words, really, to describe it yet.

00:16:11.677 --> 00:16:13.902
Words like equality and fairness and the traditional

00:16:13.902 --> 00:16:18.269
elections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.017
They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough

00:16:21.017 --> 00:16:24.336
to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity

00:16:24.336 --> 00:16:27.744
that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see

00:16:27.744 --> 00:16:30.447
the kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:33.111
innovations that we hear talked about here at TED,

00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:35.288
in clean energy, in clean education,

00:16:35.288 --> 00:16:37.879
in development, if we want to see those adopted

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:40.135
and we want to see those scaled,

00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:42.927
we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow,

00:16:42.927 --> 00:16:44.632
then we must all participate,

00:16:44.632 --> 00:16:46.130
then we must get involved.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.340
We must open up our institutions, and like the leaf,

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.534
we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic,

00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:56.734
throughout our culture, to create open institutions

00:16:56.734 --> 00:16:59.403
to create a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.

00:16:59.403 --> 00:17:02.306
Thank you. (Applause)
