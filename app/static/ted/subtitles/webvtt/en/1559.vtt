00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.016
I thought I would start
with a very brief history of cities.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.616
Settlements typically began
with people clustered around a well,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.974
and the size of that settlement
was roughly the distance you could walk

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:15.936
with a pot of water on your head.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.456
In fact, if you fly
over Germany, for example,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
and you look down and you see
these hundreds of little villages,

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:24.240
they're all about a mile apart.

00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:27.056
You needed easy access to the fields.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.456
And for hundreds, even thousands of years,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.056
the home was really the center of life.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.656
Life was very small for most people.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.776
It was a center of entertainment,
of energy production, of work,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.016
a center of health care.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.336
That's where babies were born
and people died.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.216
Then, with industrialization,
everything started to become centralized.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.256
You had dirty factories that were moved
to the outskirts of cities.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.616
Production was centralized
in assembly plants.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.216
You had centralized energy production.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.935
Learning took place in schools.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.920
Health care took place in hospitals.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.016
And then you had networks that developed.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.656
You had water, sewer networks

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.536
that allowed for this
kind of unchecked expansion.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.176
You had separated functions, increasingly.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.936
You had rail networks

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.776
that connected residential,
industrial, commercial areas.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.416
You had auto networks.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.696
In fact, the model was really,
give everybody a car,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.056
build roads to everything,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.536
and give people a place to park
when they get there.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.256
It was not a very functional model.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.656
And we still live in that world,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.816
and this is what we end up with.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.896
So you have the sprawl of LA,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.096
the sprawl of Mexico City.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.216
You have these unbelievable
new cities in China,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.576
which you might call tower sprawl.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.936
They're all building cities

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.896
on the model that we invented
in the '50s and '60s,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.936
which is really obsolete, I would argue,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.246
and there are hundreds
and hundreds of new cities

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.326
that are being planned all over the world.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.376
In China alone, 300 million people,
some say 400 million people,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.736
will move to the city
over the next 15 years.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.256
That means building the equivalent

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.096
of the entire built infrastructure
of the US in 15 years.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.336
Imagine that.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.016
And we should all care about this
whether you live in cities or not.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.616
Cities will account for 90 percent
of the population growth,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.416
80 percent of the global CO2,
75 percent of energy use,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.936
but at the same time
it's where people want to be,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.536
increasingly.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.376
More than half the people
now in the world live in cities,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.096
and that will just continue to escalate.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.736
Cities are places of celebration,
personal expression.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.056
You have the flash mobs
of pillow fights that --

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.176
I've been to a couple. They're quite fun.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.416
You have --

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.696
(Laughter)

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.536
Cities are where most
of the wealth is created,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.256
and particularly in the developing world,
it's where women find opportunities.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.696
That's a lot of the reason
why cities are growing very quickly.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.336
Now there's some trends
that will impact cities.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.256
First of all, work is becoming
distributed and mobile.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.896
The office building is basically obsolete
for doing private work.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.296
The home, once again,
because of distributed computation --

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.336
Communication is becoming
a center of life,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.536
so it's a center of production
and learning and shopping and health care

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.336
and all of these things
that we used to think of

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.176
as taking place outside of the home.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.176
And increasingly,
everything that people buy,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.536
every consumer product,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.496
in one way or another,
can be personalized.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.936
And that's a very important
trend to think about.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.576
So this is my image
of the city of the future.

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.416
(Laughter)

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.696
In that it's a place for people, you know.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.416
Maybe not the way people dress, but --

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.869
You know, the question now is,

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:49.336
how can we have all the good things
that we identify with cities

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.176
without all the bad things?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.416
This is Bangalore.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.496
It took me a couple of hours
to get a few miles in Bangalore last year.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.056
So with cities, you also have
congestion and pollution

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.736
and disease and all these negative things.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.976
How can we have the good stuff
without the bad?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.572
So we went back and started looking
at the great cities

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:08.696
that evolved before the cars.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.056
Paris was a series of these
little villages that came together,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.976
and you still see that structure today.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.953
The 20 arrondissements of Paris
are these little neighborhoods.

00:04:17.977 --> 00:04:22.696
Most of what people need in life
can be within a five- or 10-minute walk.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.936
And if you look at the data,
when you have that kind of a structure,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.656
you get a very even distribution

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.056
of the shops and the physicians
and the pharmacies

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.976
and the cafes in Paris.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.936
And then you look at cities
that evolved after the automobile,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.696
and it's not that kind of a pattern.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.736
There's very little
that's within a five-minute walk

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.056
of most areas of places like Pittsburgh.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.336
Not to pick on Pittsburgh,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.896
but most American cities
really have evolved this way.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.096
So we said, well,
let's look at new cities,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.336
and we're involved in a couple
of new city projects in China.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.816
So we said, let's start
with that neighborhood cell.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.736
We think of it as a compact urban cell.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.336
So provide most of what most people want
within that 20-minute walk.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.896
This can also be
a resilient electrical microgrid,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.496
community heating, power,
communication networks, etc.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.296
can be concentrated there.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.176
Stewart Brand would put
a micronuclear reactor

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.176
right in the center, probably.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.656
And he might be right.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.216
And then we can form,
in effect, a mesh network.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.856
It's something of an Internet
typology pattern,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.376
so you can have a series
of these neighborhoods.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.856
You can dial up the density --

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.376
about 20,000 people per cell,
if it's Cambridge.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.936
Go up to 50,000 if it's Manhattan density.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.056
You connect everything with mass transit

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.336
and you provide most of what most people
need within that neighborhood.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.576
You can begin to develop
a whole typology of streetscapes

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.656
and the vehicles that can go on them.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.096
I won't go through all of them.
I'll just show one.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.016
This is Boulder. It's a great example
of kind of a mobility parkway,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.776
a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.324
where you can go from one end
of the city to the other

00:05:59.348 --> 00:06:01.096
without crossing the street,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.896
and they also have bike-sharing,
which I'll get into in a minute.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.096
This is even a more interesting solution

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.336
in Seoul, Korea.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.776
They took the elevated highway,
they got rid of it,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.416
they reclaimed the street,
the river down below,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.816
below the street,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.176
and you can go from one end
of Seoul to the other

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.856
without crossing a pathway for cars.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.200
The High Line in Manhattan
is very similar.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.536
You have these rapidly emerging
bike lanes all over the world.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.216
I lived in Manhattan for 15 years.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.496
I went back a couple of weekends ago,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.096
took this photograph of these fabulous
new bike lanes that they have installed.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.936
They're still not to where Copenhagen is,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.376
where something like 42 percent
of the trips within the city

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.616
are by bicycle.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.416
It's mostly just because they have
fantastic infrastructure there.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.136
We actually did exactly
the wrong thing in Boston.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.216
The Big Dig --

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.736
(Laughter)

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.776
So we got rid of the highway
but we created a traffic island,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.496
and it's certainly not a mobility pathway
for anything other than cars.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.256
Mobility on demand is something
we've been thinking about,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.576
so we think we need an ecosystem
of these shared-use vehicles

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.696
connected to mass transit.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.776
These are some of the vehicles
that we've been working on.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.456
But shared use is really key.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.376
If you share a vehicle, you can have
at least four people use one vehicle,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.256
as opposed to one.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.200
We have Hubway here in Boston,
the Vélib' system in Paris.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.016
We've been developing,
at the Media Lab, this little city car

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.216
that is optimized
for shared use in cities.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.616
We got rid of all the useless things
like engines and transmissions.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.616
We moved everything to the wheels,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.016
so you have the drive motor,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.536
the steering motor, the breaking --
all in the wheel.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.736
That left the chassis unencumbered,
so you can do things like fold,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.416
so you can fold this little vehicle up
to occupy a tiny little footprint.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.896
This was a video that was
on European television last week

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.536
showing the Spanish Minister of Industry
driving this little vehicle,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.376
and when it's folded, it can spin.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.656
You don't need reverse.
You don't need parallel parking.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.296
You just spin and go directly in.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.896
(Laughter)

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.696
So we've been working
with a company to commercialize this.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.816
My PhD student Ryan Chin
presented these early ideas

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.496
two years ago at a TEDx conference.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.016
So what's interesting is,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.856
then if you begin to add
new things to it, like autonomy,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.655
you get out of the car,
you park at your destination,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.496
you pat it on the butt, it goes
and it parks itself, it charges itself,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.096
and you can get something
like seven times as many vehicles

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.456
in a given area as conventional cars,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.056
and we think this is the future.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.776
Actually, we could do this today.
It's not really a problem.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.336
We can combine shared use
and folding and autonomy

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.656
and we get something
like 28 times the land utilization

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.336
with that kind of strategy.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.218
One of our graduate students then says,

00:09:00.242 --> 00:09:04.376
well, how does a driverless car
communicate with pedestrians?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.576
You have nobody to make eye contact with.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.736
You don't know
if it's going to run you over.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.336
So he's developing strategies

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.936
so the vehicle can communicate
with pedestrians, so --

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.376
(Laughter)

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.336
So the headlights are eyeballs,
the pupils can dilate,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.536
we have directional audio,
we can throw sound directly at people.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.016
What I love about this project

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.656
is he solved a problem
that doesn't exist yet, so --

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.616
(Laughter)

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.496
We also think that we can
democratize access to bike lanes.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.416
You know, bike lanes are mostly used
by young guys in stretchy pants. So --

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.816
(Laughter)

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.656
We think we can develop a vehicle
that operates on bike lanes,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.656
accessible to elderly and disabled,
women in skirts, businesspeople,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.256
and address the issues
of energy congestion, mobility,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.536
aging and obesity simultaneously.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.776
That's our challenge.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.656
This is an early design
for this little three-wheel.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.176
It's an electronic bike.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.936
You have to pedal
to operate it in a bike lane,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.576
but if you're an older person,
that's a switch.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.376
If you're a healthy person, you might
have to work really hard to go fast.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.696
You can dial in 40 calories
going into work

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.376
and 500 going home,
when you can take a shower.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.656
We hope to have that built this fall.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.056
Housing is another area
where we can really improve.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.256
Mayor Menino in Boston says

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.216
lack of affordable housing
for young people

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.976
is one of the biggest
problems the city faces.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.736
Developers say, OK,
we'll build little teeny apartments.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.016
People say, we don't really want to live
in a little teeny conventional apartment.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.096
So we're saying, let's build
a standardized chassis,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.456
much like our car.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.576
Let's bring advanced technology
into the apartment,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.136
technology-enabled infill,

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.136
give people the tools
within this open-loft chassis

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.976
to go through a process of defining

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.936
what their needs
and values and activities are,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.536
and then a matching algorithm
will match a unique assembly

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.536
of integrated infill components,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.656
furniture, and cabinetry,
that are personalized to that individual,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.056
and they give them the tools

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.096
to go through the process
and to refine it,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.496
and it's something like working
with an architect,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.776
where the dialogue starts

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.480
when you give an alternative
to a person to react to.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.496
Now, the most interesting
implementation of that for us

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.576
is when you can begin
to have robotic walls,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.416
so your space can convert
from exercise to a workplace,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.176
if you run a virtual company.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.350
You have guests over,

00:11:36.374 --> 00:11:40.056
you have two guest rooms
that are developed.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.936
You have a conventional
one-bedroom arrangement

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.164
when you need it.

00:11:45.188 --> 00:11:46.716
Maybe that's most of the time.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.896
You have a dinner party.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.976
The table folds out to fit 16 people
in otherwise a conventional one-bedroom,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.616
or maybe you want a dance studio.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.056
I mean, architects have been thinking
about these ideas for a long time.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.296
What we need to do now,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.816
develop things that can scale
to those 300 million Chinese people

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.976
that would like to live in the city,
and very comfortably.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.296
We think we can make
a very small apartment

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.656
that functions as if it's twice as big
by utilizing these strategies.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.216
I don't believe in smart homes.
That's sort of a bogus concept.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.456
I think you have to build dumb homes
and put smart stuff in it.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.736
(Laughter)

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.176
And so we've been working
on a chassis of the wall itself.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.736
You know, standardized platform

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.536
with the motors and the battery
when it operates,

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.096
little solenoids that will lock it
in place and get low-voltage power.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.936
We think this can all be standardized,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.896
and then people can personalize the stuff
that goes into that wall,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.616
and like the car, we can integrate
all kinds of sensing

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.016
to be aware of human activity,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.336
so if there's a baby
or a puppy in the way,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.576
you won't have a problem.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.616
(Laughter)

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.376
So the developers say,
well, this is great.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.456
OK, so if we have a conventional building,
we have a fixed envelope,

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.536
maybe we can put in 14 units.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.656
If they function
as if they're twice as big,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.216
we can get 28 units in.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.265
That means twice as much parking, though.

00:13:11.289 --> 00:13:12.596
Parking's really expensive.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.256
It's about 70,000 dollars per space

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.056
to build a conventional parking spot
inside a building.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.656
So if you can have folding and autonomy,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.096
you can do that
in one-seventh of the space.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.296
That goes down to 10,000 dollars per car,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.896
just for the cost of the parking.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.856
You add shared use,
and you can even go further.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.936
We can also integrate
all kinds of advanced technology

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.176
through this process.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.336
There's a path to market
for innovative companies

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.016
to bring technology into the home.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.616
In this case, a project
we're doing with Siemens.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.216
We have sensors on all
the furniture, all the infill,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.936
that understands where people are
and what they're doing.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.656
Blue light is very efficient,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.816
so we have these tunable
24-bit LED lighting fixtures.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.976
It recognizes where the person is,
what they're doing,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.216
fills out the light when necessary
to full spectrum white light,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.456
and saves maybe 30, 40 percent
in energy consumption, we think,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.936
over even conventional
state-of-the-art lighting systems.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.376
This just shows you the data
that comes from the sensors

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.096
that are embedded in the furniture.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.936
We don't really believe in cameras
to do things in homes.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.936
We think these little wireless sensors
are more effective.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.216
We think we can also personalize sunlight.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.907
That's sort of the ultimate
personalization in some ways.

00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:35.896
So we've looked at articulating
mirrors of the facade

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.816
that can throw shafts of sunlight
anywhere into the space,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.216
therefore allowing you
to shade most of the glass

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.456
on a hot day like today.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.336
In this case, she picks up her phone,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.936
she can map food preparation
at the kitchen island

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.376
to a particular location of sunlight.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.576
An algorithm will keep it in that location
as long as she's engaged in that activity.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.517
This can be combined
with LED lighting as well.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.856
We think workplaces should be shared.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.690
I mean, this is really
the workplace of the future, I think.

00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:09.210
This is Starbucks, you know.

00:15:09.234 --> 00:15:10.416
Maybe a third --

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.696
And you see everybody
has their back to the wall

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.720
and they have food and coffee down the way

00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:17.176
and they're in their own
little personal bubble.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.896
We need shared spaces
for interaction and collaboration.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.136
We're not doing a very good job with that.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.216
At the Cambridge Innovation Center,
you can have shared desks.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.936
I've spent a lot of time in Finland
at the design factory of Aalto University,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.656
where the they have a shared shop
and shared fab lab, shared quiet spaces,

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.816
electronics spaces, recreation places.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.296
We think ultimately,
all of this stuff can come together,

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.016
a new model for mobility,
a new model for housing,

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.336
a new model for how we live and work,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.176
a path to market
for advanced technologies.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.105
But in the end, the main thing
we need to focus on are people.

00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:56.696
Cities are all about people.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.736
They're places for people.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.216
There's no reason
why we can't dramatically improve

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.536
the livability and creativity of cities

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.456
like they've done in Melbourne
with the laneways

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.056
while at the same time
dramatically reducing CO2 and energy.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.416
It's a global imperative.
We have to get this right.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.656
Thank you.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.200
(Applause)
