00:00:02.097 --> 00:00:06.569
The murder happened a little over 21 years ago,

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.848
January the 18th, 1991,

00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:13.109
in a small

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.483
bedroom community

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:18.318
of Lynwood, California, just a few miles

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.816
southeast of Los Angeles.

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:23.651
A father came out of his house

00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:27.058
to tell his teenage son and his five friends

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:29.837
that it was time for them to stop horsing around

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:32.747
on the front lawn and on the sidewalk,

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:35.655
to get home, finish their schoolwork,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:38.401
and prepare themselves for bed.

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:41.971
And as the father was administering these instructions,

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:45.309
a car drove by, slowly,

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.211
and just after it passed the father and the teenagers,

00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:52.199
a hand went out from the front passenger window,

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.461
and -- "Bam, Bam!" -- killing the father.

00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.620
And the car sped off.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.461
The police,

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.291
investigating officers, were amazingly efficient.

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:08.721
They considered all the usual culprits,

00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:13.288
and in less than 24 hours, they had selected their suspect:

00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:16.866
Francisco Carrillo, a 17-year-old kid

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.903
who lived about two or three blocks away

00:01:18.903 --> 00:01:21.638
from where the shooting occurred.

00:01:21.638 --> 00:01:26.286
They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array,

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.870
and the day after the shooting,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.763
they showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said,

00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:35.082
"That's the picture.

00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:40.469
That's the shooter I saw that killed the father."

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.046
That was all a preliminary hearing judge had

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:48.155
to listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:50.842
for a first-degree murder.

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:54.049
In the investigation that followed before the actual trial,

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.460
each of the other five teenagers was shown

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.508
photographs, the same photo array.

00:02:01.508 --> 00:02:04.332
The picture that we best can determine was probably

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.604
the one that they were shown in the photo array

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:10.301
is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots.

00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:13.737
The reason we're not sure absolutely is because

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:18.170
of the nature of evidence preservation

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.454
in our judicial system,

00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:25.202
but that's another whole TEDx talk for later. (Laughter)

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:28.108
So at the actual trial,

00:02:28.108 --> 00:02:31.108
all six of the teenagers testified,

00:02:31.108 --> 00:02:34.866
and indicated the identifications they had made

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:38.342
in the photo array.

00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:43.123
He was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment,

00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:48.582
and transported to Folsom Prison.

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:50.671
So what's wrong?

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:55.437
Straightforward, fair trial, full investigation.

00:02:55.437 --> 00:02:58.978
Oh yes, no gun was ever found.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:03.132
No vehicle was ever identified as being the one

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:06.356
in which the shooter had extended his arm,

00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:09.641
and no person was ever charged with being the driver

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.883
of the shooter's vehicle.

00:03:12.883 --> 00:03:16.764
And Mr. Carrillo's alibi?

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:22.058
Which of those parents here in the room might not lie

00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:24.877
concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:28.774
in an investigation of a killing?

00:03:30.874 --> 00:03:33.596
Sent to prison,

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:37.094
adamantly insisting on his innocence,

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:41.831
which he has consistently for 21 years.

00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:45.302
So what's the problem?

00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:48.026
The problems, actually, for this kind of case

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:51.935
come manyfold from decades of scientific research

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:55.837
involving human memory.

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:58.651
First of all, we have all the statistical analyses

00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:00.858
from the Innocence Project work,

00:04:00.858 --> 00:04:03.555
where we know that we have, what,

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:07.336
250, 280 documented cases now where people have

00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:11.408
been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated,

00:04:11.408 --> 00:04:17.754
some from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis,

00:04:17.754 --> 00:04:21.415
and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases

00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:27.686
of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification

00:04:27.686 --> 00:04:31.333
testimony during the trial that convicted them.

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:36.508
We know that eyewitness identifications are fallible.

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:38.728
The other comes from an interesting aspect

00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:41.931
of human memory that's related to various brain functions

00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:44.497
but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here

00:04:44.497 --> 00:04:46.881
in a simple line:

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:51.629
The brain abhors a vacuum.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.539
Under the best of observation conditions,

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.411
the absolute best,

00:04:57.411 --> 00:05:01.124
we only detect, encode and store in our brains

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:04.819
bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us,

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.148
and they're stored in different parts of the brain.

00:05:07.148 --> 00:05:11.303
So now, when it's important for us to be able to recall

00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:14.324
what it was that we experienced,

00:05:14.324 --> 00:05:19.602
we have an incomplete, we have a partial store,

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:22.055
and what happens?

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.879
Below awareness, with no requirement for any kind of

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:30.050
motivated processing, the brain fills in information

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.475
that was not there,

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:34.925
not originally stored,

00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:37.469
from inference, from speculation,

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.281
from sources of information that came to you,

00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:43.416
as the observer, after the observation.

00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:45.490
But it happens without awareness such that

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.124
you don't, aren't even cognizant of it occurring.

00:05:49.124 --> 00:05:51.391
It's called reconstructed memories.

00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:55.690
It happens to us in all the aspects of our life, all the time.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.954
It was those two considerations, among others --

00:05:58.954 --> 00:06:03.459
reconstructed memory, the fact about the eyewitness fallibility --

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:06.515
that was part of the instigation

00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:08.964
for a group of appeal attorneys

00:06:08.964 --> 00:06:12.436
led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers

00:06:12.436 --> 00:06:16.564
to pool their experience and their talents together

00:06:16.564 --> 00:06:18.401
and petition a superior court

00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:23.471
for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo.

00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:27.859
They retained me, as a forensic neurophysiologist,

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:30.001
because I had expertise

00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:32.121
in eyewitness memory identification,

00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:35.316
which obviously makes sense for this case, right?

00:06:35.316 --> 00:06:38.660
But also because I have expertise and testify about

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.037
the nature of human night vision.

00:06:43.037 --> 00:06:46.070
Well, what's that got to do with this?

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.372
Well, when you read through the case materials

00:06:49.372 --> 00:06:52.094
in this Carrillo case,

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:54.924
one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that

00:06:54.924 --> 00:06:58.414
the investigating officers said the lighting was good

00:06:58.414 --> 00:07:01.948
at the crime scene, at the shooting.

00:07:01.948 --> 00:07:05.405
All the teenagers testified during the trial

00:07:05.405 --> 00:07:08.884
that they could see very well.

00:07:08.884 --> 00:07:11.724
But this occurred in mid-January,

00:07:11.724 --> 00:07:17.723
in the Northern Hemisphere, at 7 p.m. at night.

00:07:17.723 --> 00:07:20.748
So when I did the calculations

00:07:20.748 --> 00:07:22.960
for the lunar data and the solar data

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.139
at that location on Earth at the time of the incident

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.187
of the shooting, all right,

00:07:28.187 --> 00:07:30.804
it was well past the end of civil twilight

00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:33.060
and there was no moon up that night.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.339
So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:37.923
is what you see on the screen right here.

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:40.837
The only lighting in that area had to come

00:07:40.837 --> 00:07:44.107
from artificial sources,

00:07:44.107 --> 00:07:46.875
and that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:49.672
of the scene with photometers, with various measures

00:07:49.672 --> 00:07:51.646
of illumination and various other measures of

00:07:51.646 --> 00:07:56.113
color perception, along with special cameras

00:07:56.113 --> 00:07:58.242
and high-speed film, right?

00:07:58.242 --> 00:08:01.171
Take all the measurements and record them, right?

00:08:01.171 --> 00:08:03.328
And then take photographs, and this is what the scene

00:08:03.328 --> 00:08:04.763
looked like at the time of the shooting

00:08:04.763 --> 00:08:07.229
from the position of the teenagers

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:11.051
looking at the car going by and shooting.

00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:13.356
This is looking directly across the street

00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:15.684
from where they were standing.

00:08:15.684 --> 00:08:18.037
Remember, the investigating officers' report said

00:08:18.037 --> 00:08:20.270
the lighting was good.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.704
The teenagers said they could see very well.

00:08:22.704 --> 00:08:25.955
This is looking down to the east,

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:29.651
where the shooting vehicle sped off,

00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:34.543
and this is the lighting directly behind the father

00:08:34.543 --> 00:08:36.884
and the teenagers.

00:08:36.884 --> 00:08:40.795
As you can see, it is at best poor.

00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:44.668
No one's going to call this well-lit, good lighting,

00:08:44.668 --> 00:08:47.862
and in fact, as nice as these pictures are,

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:51.323
and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court,

00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:54.515
and a picture is worth more than a thousand words

00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:56.915
when you're trying to communicate numbers,

00:08:56.915 --> 00:09:00.187
abstract concepts like lux, the international measurement

00:09:00.187 --> 00:09:05.363
of illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values.

00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:08.524
When you present those to people who are not well-versed

00:09:08.524 --> 00:09:11.640
in those aspects of science and that, they become

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.019
salamanders in the noonday sun. It's like

00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:16.933
talking about the tangent of the visual angle, all right?

00:09:16.933 --> 00:09:19.718
Their eyes just glaze over, all right?

00:09:19.718 --> 00:09:24.077
A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator,

00:09:24.077 --> 00:09:26.236
a good communicator, and that's part of the reason

00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:28.531
why we take the pictures, to show not only

00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:31.331
where the light sources are, and what we call the spill,

00:09:31.331 --> 00:09:33.960
the distribution, but also so that it's easier

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.995
for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances.

00:09:37.995 --> 00:09:40.868
So these are some of the pictures that, in fact,

00:09:40.868 --> 00:09:43.283
I used when I testified,

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.148
but more importantly were, to me as a scientist,

00:09:45.148 --> 00:09:47.131
are those readings, the photometer readings,

00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:51.731
which I can then convert into actual predictions

00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:55.251
of the visual capability of the human eye

00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:57.627
under those circumstances,

00:09:57.627 --> 00:10:01.275
and from my readings that I recorded at the scene

00:10:01.275 --> 00:10:03.515
under the same solar and lunar conditions

00:10:03.515 --> 00:10:06.507
at the same time, so on and so forth, right,

00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:07.913
I could predict

00:10:07.913 --> 00:10:10.105
that there would be no reliable color perception,

00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:12.419
which is crucial for face recognition,

00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:14.731
and that there would be only scotopic vision,

00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:16.691
which means there would be very little resolution,

00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:18.939
what we call boundary or edge detection,

00:10:18.939 --> 00:10:21.254
and that furthermore, because the eyes would have been

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:25.059
totally dilated under this light, the depth of field,

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:28.217
the distance at which you can focus and see details,

00:10:28.217 --> 00:10:33.611
would have been less than 18 inches away.

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:36.115
I testified to that to the court,

00:10:36.115 --> 00:10:38.548
and while the judge was very attentive,

00:10:38.548 --> 00:10:41.155
it had been a very, very long hearing

00:10:41.155 --> 00:10:45.899
for this petition for a retrial, and as a result,

00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:47.659
I noticed out of the corner of my eye

00:10:47.659 --> 00:10:51.804
that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need

00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:53.867
a little more of a nudge

00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:56.375
than just more numbers.

00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:58.667
And here I became a bit audacious,

00:10:58.667 --> 00:11:00.187
and I turned

00:11:00.187 --> 00:11:02.579
and I asked the judge,

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.987
I said, "Your Honor, I think you should go out

00:11:04.987 --> 00:11:07.691
and look at the scene yourself."

00:11:07.691 --> 00:11:10.832
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare

00:11:10.832 --> 00:11:13.236
than a request — (Laughter) —

00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:17.683
but nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage

00:11:17.683 --> 00:11:21.299
that he said, "Yes, I will."

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:25.291
A shocker in American jurisprudence.

00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:27.763
So in fact, we found the same identical conditions,

00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:29.804
we reconstructed the entire thing again,

00:11:29.804 --> 00:11:33.814
he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers

00:11:33.814 --> 00:11:38.971
to protect him in this community, all right? (Laughter)

00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:44.025
We had him stand actually slightly in the street,

00:11:44.025 --> 00:11:47.205
so closer to the suspect vehicle, the shooter vehicle,

00:11:47.205 --> 00:11:49.947
than the actual teenagers were,

00:11:49.947 --> 00:11:52.171
so he stood a few feet from the curb

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:54.783
toward the middle of the street.

00:11:54.783 --> 00:11:57.700
We had a car that came by,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.651
same identical car as described by the teenagers, right?

00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:04.588
It had a driver and a passenger,

00:12:04.588 --> 00:12:08.411
and after the car had passed the judge by,

00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.925
the passenger extended his hand,

00:12:11.925 --> 00:12:16.499
pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on,

00:12:16.499 --> 00:12:18.718
just as the teenagers had described it, right?

00:12:18.718 --> 00:12:21.571
Now, he didn't use a real gun in his hand,

00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:23.989
so he had a black object in his hand that was similar

00:12:23.989 --> 00:12:25.968
to the gun that was described.

00:12:25.968 --> 00:12:28.814
He pointed by, and this is what the judge saw.

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:35.913
This is the car 30 feet away from the judge.

00:12:35.913 --> 00:12:38.825
There's an arm sticking out of the passenger side

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:41.198
and pointed back at you.

00:12:41.198 --> 00:12:43.163
That's 30 feet away.

00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:45.355
Some of the teenagers said that in fact the car

00:12:45.355 --> 00:12:47.931
was 15 feet away when it shot.

00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:51.595
Okay. There's 15 feet.

00:12:51.595 --> 00:12:55.765
At this point, I became a little concerned.

00:12:55.765 --> 00:13:00.499
This judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with.

00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:04.787
He was totally stoic. I couldn't see a twitch of his eyebrow.

00:13:04.787 --> 00:13:08.056
I couldn't see the slightest bend of his head.

00:13:08.056 --> 00:13:11.557
I had no sense of how he was reacting to this,

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:14.597
and after he looked at this reenactment,

00:13:14.597 --> 00:13:15.677
he turned to me and he says,

00:13:15.677 --> 00:13:18.935
"Is there anything else you want me to look at?"

00:13:18.935 --> 00:13:23.430
I said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.387
emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had

00:13:26.387 --> 00:13:30.083
in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate,

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:32.338
or whether it was just sheer stupidity,

00:13:32.338 --> 00:13:35.163
which is what the defense lawyers thought — (Laughter) —

00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:36.915
when they heard me say,

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:39.619
"Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:43.955
and I want the car to go around the block again

00:13:43.955 --> 00:13:47.309
and I want it to come and I want it to stop

00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:51.499
right in front of you, three to four feet away,

00:13:51.499 --> 00:13:54.955
and I want the passenger to extend his hand

00:13:54.955 --> 00:13:56.971
with a black object and point it right at you,

00:13:56.971 --> 00:14:02.691
and you can look at it as long as you want."

00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:07.118
And that's what he saw. (Laughter)

00:14:07.118 --> 00:14:10.958
You'll notice, which was also in my test report,

00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.603
all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side,

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:15.346
which means that the shooter's face would

00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:17.962
have been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit.

00:14:17.962 --> 00:14:19.864
Furthermore, the roof of the car

00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:24.138
is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car

00:14:24.138 --> 00:14:27.468
which is making it darker.

00:14:27.468 --> 00:14:31.580
And this is three to four feet away.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.708
Why did I take the risk?

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:38.937
I knew that the depth of field was 18 inches or less.

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:40.604
Three to four feet, it might as well have been

00:14:40.604 --> 00:14:45.076
a football field away.

00:14:45.076 --> 00:14:47.284
This is what he saw.

00:14:47.284 --> 00:14:51.084
He went back, there was a few more days of evidence

00:14:51.084 --> 00:14:53.388
that was heard. At the end of it,

00:14:53.388 --> 00:14:56.016
he made the judgment that he was going to grant

00:14:56.016 --> 00:14:59.094
the petition for a retrial.

00:14:59.094 --> 00:15:01.572
And furthermore, he released Mr. Carrillo

00:15:01.572 --> 00:15:04.559
so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:10.578
if the prosecution decided to retry him.

00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:12.888
Which they decided not to.

00:15:12.888 --> 00:15:17.949
He is now a freed man. (Applause)

00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:21.892
(Applause)

00:15:21.892 --> 00:15:26.996
This is him embracing his grandmother-in-law.

00:15:26.996 --> 00:15:31.071
He -- His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial,

00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:35.156
right? And she had a little baby boy.

00:15:35.156 --> 00:15:37.837
He and his son are both attending Cal State, Long Beach

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:44.025
right now taking classes. (Applause)

00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:47.988
And what does this example --

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:52.332
what's important to keep in mind for ourselves?

00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:56.028
First of all, there's a long history of antipathy

00:15:56.028 --> 00:15:58.108
between science and the law

00:15:58.108 --> 00:16:00.508
in American jurisprudence.

00:16:00.508 --> 00:16:03.956
I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance

00:16:03.956 --> 00:16:08.292
over decades of experience as a forensic expert

00:16:08.292 --> 00:16:12.798
of just trying to get science into the courtroom.

00:16:12.798 --> 00:16:17.732
The opposing council always fight it and oppose it.

00:16:17.732 --> 00:16:21.119
One suggestion is that all of us become much more

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:23.988
attuned to the necessity, through policy,

00:16:23.988 --> 00:16:26.044
through procedures,

00:16:26.044 --> 00:16:29.228
to get more science in the courtroom,

00:16:29.228 --> 00:16:31.539
and I think one large step toward that

00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:33.381
is more requirements,

00:16:33.381 --> 00:16:35.940
with all due respect to the law schools,

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:41.051
of science, technology, engineering, mathematics

00:16:41.051 --> 00:16:43.028
for anyone going into the law,

00:16:43.028 --> 00:16:46.652
because they become the judges.

00:16:46.652 --> 00:16:49.700
Think about how we select our judges in this country.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.060
It's very different than most other cultures. All right?

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.470
The other one that I want to suggest,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.900
the caution that all of us have to have,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.740
I constantly have to remind myself,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.843
about just how accurate are the memories

00:17:02.843 --> 00:17:08.212
that we know are true, that we believe in?

00:17:08.212 --> 00:17:11.596
There is decades of research,

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:15.764
examples and examples of cases like this,

00:17:15.764 --> 00:17:17.732
where individuals

00:17:17.732 --> 00:17:21.244
really, really believe. None of those teenagers

00:17:21.244 --> 00:17:23.076
who identified him

00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:26.352
thought that they were picking the wrong person.

00:17:26.352 --> 00:17:29.706
None of them thought they couldn't see the person's face.

00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:31.838
We all have to be very careful.

00:17:31.838 --> 00:17:35.478
All our memories are reconstructed memories.

00:17:35.478 --> 00:17:37.876
They are the product of what we originally experienced

00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:40.609
and everything that's happened afterwards.

00:17:40.609 --> 00:17:42.660
They're dynamic.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.148
They're malleable. They're volatile,

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:49.172
and as a result, we all need to remember to be cautious,

00:17:49.172 --> 00:17:52.492
that the accuracy of our memories

00:17:52.492 --> 00:17:55.996
is not measured in how vivid they are

00:17:55.996 --> 00:18:01.127
nor how certain you are that they're correct.

00:18:01.127 --> 00:20:30.217
Thank you. (Applause)
