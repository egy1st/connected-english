WEBVTT

00:00:00.657 --> 00:00:03.159
Some years ago, I set out to try to understand

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.887
if there was a possibility to develop biofuels

00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:10.589
on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.273
but not compete with agriculture for water,

00:00:14.273 --> 00:00:16.711
fertilizer or land.

00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.241
So here's what I came up with.

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.849
Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.127
just underwater, and we fill it with wastewater

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:25.255
and some form of microalgae that produces oil,

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:27.415
and we make it out of some kind of flexible material

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:29.487
that moves with waves underwater,

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.527
and the system that we're going to build, of course,

00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:33.847
will use solar energy to grow the algae,

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:36.058
and they use CO2, which is good,

00:00:36.058 --> 00:00:38.423
and they produce oxygen as they grow.

00:00:38.423 --> 00:00:42.087
The algae that grow are in a container that

00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:44.879
distributes the heat to the surrounding water,

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.143
and you can harvest them and make biofuels

00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:49.823
and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed,

00:00:49.823 --> 00:00:52.663
and of course you'd have to make a large area of this,

00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:55.215
so you'd have to worry about other stakeholders

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:59.407
like fishermen and ships and such things, but hey,

00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:01.670
we're talking about biofuels,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.872
and we know the importance of potentially getting

00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:06.351
an alternative liquid fuel.

00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:09.032
Why are we talking about microalgae?

00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:12.719
Here you see a graph showing you the different types

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.571
of crops that are being considered for making biofuels,

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.134
so you can see some things like soybean,

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:21.451
which makes 50 gallons per acre per year,

00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:26.508
or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and that

00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:31.002
tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute.

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.533
That is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.325
and 5,000 gallons per acre per year,

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:39.677
compared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.

00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:42.941
So what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro --

00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:45.389
that is, they're extremely small, as you can see here

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:48.357
a picture of those single-celled organisms

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:50.667
compared to a human hair.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.493
Those small organisms have been around

00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:55.533
for millions of years and there's thousands

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.757
of different species of microalgae in the world,

00:01:57.757 --> 00:02:00.781
some of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet,

00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.973
and produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:07.261
Now, why do we want to do this offshore?

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:10.109
Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.705
if you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice,

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:17.504
because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested,

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.415
and if you look at where most of the waste water

00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:22.984
treatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.

00:02:22.984 --> 00:02:26.667
This is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 miles

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.322
of sewer pipes under the city already,

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:33.298
and it releases its waste water offshore.

00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:37.210
So different cities around the world treat their waste water

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.578
differently. Some cities process it.

00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:41.224
Some cities just release the water.

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:43.882
But in all cases, the water that's released is

00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:46.842
perfectly adequate for growing microalgae.

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:48.507
So let's envision what the system might look like.

00:02:48.507 --> 00:02:50.609
We call it OMEGA, which is an acronym for

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.040
Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.592
At NASA, you have to have good acronyms.

00:02:57.592 --> 00:03:00.435
So how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.

00:03:00.435 --> 00:03:04.155
We put waste water and some source of CO2

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:07.202
into our floating structure,

00:03:07.202 --> 00:03:10.843
and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow,

00:03:10.843 --> 00:03:13.561
and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:16.171
into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:18.499
They of course use solar energy to grow,

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.050
and the wave energy on the surface provides energy

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.354
for mixing the algae, and the temperature

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:25.914
is controlled by the surrounding water temperature.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.268
The algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned,

00:03:29.268 --> 00:03:32.556
and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and

00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:35.997
other bi-algal products of interest.

00:03:35.997 --> 00:03:39.414
And the system is contained. What do I mean by that?

00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:41.540
It's modular. Let's say something happens that's

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.734
totally unexpected to one of the modules.

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:45.933
It leaks. It's struck by lightning.

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:48.542
The waste water that leaks out is water that already now

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:50.930
goes into that coastal environment, and

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.178
the algae that leak out are biodegradable,

00:03:53.178 --> 00:03:54.264
and because they're living in waste water,

00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:57.333
they're fresh water algae, which means they can't

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:59.130
live in salt water, so they die.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.290
The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.922
well-known plastic that we have good experience with, and

00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:08.773
we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.

00:04:08.773 --> 00:04:12.345
So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:14.822
this system that I'm showing you, and that is to say

00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:17.656
we need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water,

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:20.022
which is also going to be an issue in the future,

00:04:20.022 --> 00:04:21.859
and we're working on methods now

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.381
for recovering the waste water.

00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:27.173
The other thing to consider is the structure itself.

00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:30.224
It provides a surface for things in the ocean,

00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:33.467
and this surface, which is covered by seaweeds

00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:35.961
and other organisms in the ocean,

00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:39.948
will become enhanced marine habitat

00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:41.611
so it increases biodiversity.

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:43.611
And finally, because it's an offshore structure,

00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:46.513
we can think in terms of how it might contribute

00:04:46.513 --> 00:04:50.267
to an aquaculture activity offshore.

00:04:50.267 --> 00:04:51.856
So you're probably thinking, "Gee, this sounds

00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:56.427
like a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real?"

00:04:56.427 --> 00:05:00.242
Well, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz

00:05:00.242 --> 00:05:03.404
at the California Fish and Game facility,

00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:06.453
and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks

00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:08.176
to test some of these ideas.

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:10.798
We also set up experiments in San Francisco

00:05:10.798 --> 00:05:13.629
at one of the three waste water treatment plants,

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.125
again a facility to test ideas.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:19.429
And finally, we wanted to see where we could look at

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:22.133
what the impact of this structure would be

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:25.790
in the marine environment, and we set up a field site

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.253
at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab

00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:30.613
in Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor

00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:35.459
to see what impact this would have on marine organisms.

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:38.549
The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:41.447
It was a place where we were growing algae

00:05:41.447 --> 00:05:44.112
and welding plastic and building tools

00:05:44.112 --> 00:05:45.635
and making a lot of mistakes,

00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:47.566
or, as Edison said, we were

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:51.016
finding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:55.262
Now, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools

00:05:55.262 --> 00:05:58.694
that allowed us to get into the lives of algae

00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:00.416
so that we could monitor the way they grow,

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:03.118
what makes them happy, how do we make sure that

00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:07.020
we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.109
So the most important feature that we needed to develop were these

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:12.837
so-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.

00:06:12.837 --> 00:06:14.180
These were the structures that would be floating at the

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.605
surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material

00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:20.262
that'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lots

00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:23.391
of designs, most of which were horrible failures,

00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.726
and when we finally got to a design that worked,

00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:28.013
at about 30 gallons, we scaled it up

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:31.629
to 450 gallons in San Francisco.

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:33.823
So let me show you how the system works.

00:06:33.823 --> 00:06:37.535
We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it,

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:40.241
and we circulate it through this floating structure,

00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:42.973
this tubular, flexible plastic structure,

00:06:42.973 --> 00:06:44.466
and it circulates through this thing,

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:47.178
and there's sunlight of course, it's at the surface,

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:49.583
and the algae grow on the nutrients.

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:52.005
But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.

00:06:52.005 --> 00:06:55.247
The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2,

00:06:55.262 --> 00:06:56.101
as we would.

00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.760
They suffocate because they produce oxygen, and they

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.936
don't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produce

00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:04.040
is problematic, and they use up all the CO2.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.472
So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could

00:07:06.472 --> 00:07:09.701
remove the oxygen, which we did by building this column

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:11.178
which circulated some of the water,

00:07:11.178 --> 00:07:14.548
and put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the system

00:07:14.548 --> 00:07:17.000
before we recirculated the water.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.704
And what you see here is the prototype,

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:22.502
which was the first attempt at building this type of column.

00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:24.942
The larger column that we then installed in San Francisco

00:07:24.942 --> 00:07:26.570
in the installed system.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.968
So the column actually had another very nice feature,

00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:33.085
and that is the algae settle in the column,

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:36.659
and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.626
in a context where we could easily harvest it.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.401
So we would remove the algaes that concentrated

00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:44.969
in the bottom of this column, and then we could

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:48.792
harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae

00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:52.688
to the surface and can skim it off with a net.

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:56.325
So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact

00:07:56.325 --> 00:07:59.256
of this system in the marine environment,

00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:02.736
and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:04.976
in Moss Landing Marine Lab.

00:08:04.976 --> 00:08:07.816
Well, we found of course that this material became

00:08:07.816 --> 00:08:10.728
overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop

00:08:10.728 --> 00:08:13.136
a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how

00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:16.073
seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you

00:08:16.073 --> 00:08:19.096
see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting,

00:08:19.096 --> 00:08:22.200
and would periodically work its way across this little

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.088
floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.177
or train him to be able to clean the surface

00:08:27.177 --> 00:08:29.584
of these things, but that's for the future.

00:08:29.584 --> 00:08:30.905
Now really what we were doing,

00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:32.677
we were working in four areas.

00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:35.560
Our research covered the biology of the system,

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.728
which included studying the way algae grew,

00:08:37.728 --> 00:08:41.377
but also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.

00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:43.556
We did engineering to understand what we would need

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:45.849
to be able to do to build this structure,

00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:48.552
not only on the small scale, but how we would build it

00:08:48.552 --> 00:08:51.868
on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.

00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:55.068
I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.597
and looked at basically the environmental impact

00:08:57.597 --> 00:09:00.748
of the system, and finally we looked at the economics,

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:02.395
and what I mean by economics is,

00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:05.500
what is the energy required to run the system?

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.922
Do you get more energy out of the system

00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:08.503
than you have to put into the system

00:09:08.503 --> 00:09:10.516
to be able to make the system run?

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.262
And what about operating costs?

00:09:12.262 --> 00:09:14.320
And what about capital costs?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.478
And what about, just, the whole economic structure?

00:09:18.478 --> 00:09:21.196
So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy,

00:09:21.196 --> 00:09:23.756
and there's lots more work to do in all four

00:09:23.756 --> 00:09:27.348
of those areas to be able to really make the system work.

00:09:27.348 --> 00:09:30.268
But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you

00:09:30.268 --> 00:09:33.770
the artist's conception of how this system might look

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.450
if we find ourselves in a protected bay

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.634
somewhere in the world, and we have in the background

00:09:39.634 --> 00:09:42.402
in this image, the waste water treatment plant

00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:45.275
and a source of flue gas for the CO2,

00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:48.010
but when you do the economics of this system,

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.082
you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.

00:09:51.082 --> 00:09:55.652
Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water,

00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:59.380
sequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.860
or wave energy or even wind energy,

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.131
and if you start thinking in terms of

00:10:04.131 --> 00:10:07.172
integrating all of these different activities,

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:11.819
you could also include in such a facility aquaculture.

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:14.747
So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:16.841
where we're growing mussels or scallops.

00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:19.833
We'd be growing oysters and things

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:22.671
that would be producing high value products and food,

00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:25.441
and this would be a market driver as we build the system

00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:28.755
to larger and larger scales so that it becomes, ultimately,

00:10:28.755 --> 00:10:34.556
competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels.

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:37.253
So there's always a big question that comes up,

00:10:37.253 --> 00:10:40.597
because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation

00:10:40.597 --> 00:10:43.586
right now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.

00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:46.303
What are we going to do with all this plastic that we're

00:10:46.303 --> 00:10:49.044
going to need to use in our marine environment?

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:50.562
Well, I don't know if you know about this,

00:10:50.562 --> 00:10:53.324
but in California, there's a huge amount of plastic

00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:56.669
that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch,

00:10:56.669 --> 00:10:59.893
and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:02.644
right along the surface of the soil, and this provides

00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:05.902
warming the soil to increase the growing season,

00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:08.445
it allows us to control weeds,

00:11:08.445 --> 00:11:12.037
and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.

00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:14.350
So the OMEGA system will be part

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.429
of this type of an outcome, and that when we're finished

00:11:17.429 --> 00:11:20.118
using it in the marine environment, we'll be using it,

00:11:20.118 --> 00:11:22.671
hopefully, on fields.

00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:23.991
Where are we going to put this,

00:11:23.991 --> 00:11:26.502
and what will it look like offshore?

00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:29.493
Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.

00:11:29.493 --> 00:11:32.173
San Francisco produces 65 million gallons a day

00:11:32.173 --> 00:11:34.933
of waste water. If we imagine a five-day retention time

00:11:34.933 --> 00:11:37.302
for this system, we'd need 325 million gallons

00:11:37.302 --> 00:11:41.328
to accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acres

00:11:41.328 --> 00:11:44.947
of these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.

00:11:44.947 --> 00:11:46.741
Well, that's less than one percent

00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.492
of the surface area of the bay.

00:11:48.492 --> 00:11:52.234
It would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year,

00:11:52.234 --> 00:11:55.230
it would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel,

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.430
which is about 20 percent of the biodiesel,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.438
or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco,

00:12:00.438 --> 00:12:03.628
and that's without doing anything about efficiency.

00:12:03.628 --> 00:12:06.598
Where else could we potentially put this system?

00:12:06.598 --> 00:12:09.498
There's lots of possibilities.

00:12:09.498 --> 00:12:11.550
There's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.366
San Diego Bay is another example,

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:16.279
Mobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay, but the reality is,

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:18.371
as sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lots

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:22.278
of new opportunities to consider. (Laughter)

00:12:22.278 --> 00:12:25.846
So what I'm telling you about is a system

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:29.478
of integrated activities.

00:12:29.478 --> 00:12:32.088
Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy

00:12:32.088 --> 00:12:34.890
is integrated with aquaculture.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.814
I set out to find a pathway

00:12:38.814 --> 00:12:44.460
to innovative production of sustainable biofuels,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.708
and en route I discovered that what's really required

00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:54.985
for sustainability is integration more than innovation.

00:12:54.985 --> 00:12:58.415
Long term, I have great faith

00:12:58.415 --> 00:13:03.560
in our collective and connected ingenuity.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.876
I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish

00:13:07.876 --> 00:13:10.078
if we are radically open

00:13:10.078 --> 00:13:13.808
and we don't care who gets the credit.

00:13:13.808 --> 00:13:18.024
Sustainable solutions for our future problems

00:13:18.024 --> 00:13:20.424
are going to be diverse

00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:22.889
and are going to be many.

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:25.680
I think we need to consider everything,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.712
everything from alpha to OMEGA.

00:13:28.712 --> 00:13:31.592
Thank you. (Applause)

00:13:31.592 --> 00:13:36.942
(Applause)

00:13:37.347 --> 00:13:40.559
Chris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:42.767
Can this project continue to move forward within

00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:46.732
NASA or do you need some very ambitious

00:13:46.732 --> 00:13:50.808
green energy fund to come and take it by the throat?

00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:52.111
Jonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage now

00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:55.125
in NASA where they would like to spin it out into something

00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:57.516
which would go offshore, and there are a lot of issues

00:13:57.516 --> 00:13:59.743
with doing it in the United States because of limited

00:13:59.743 --> 00:14:02.237
permitting issues and the time required to get permits

00:14:02.237 --> 00:14:03.751
to do things offshore.

00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:06.549
It really requires, at this point, people on the outside,

00:14:06.549 --> 00:14:08.853
and we're being radically open with this technology

00:14:08.853 --> 00:14:10.565
in which we're going to launch it out there

00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:12.841
for anybody and everybody who's interested

00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:14.681
to take it on and try to make it real.

00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:17.158
CA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.

00:14:17.158 --> 00:14:18.833
You're publishing it.

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:19.596
JT: Absolutely.

00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:21.487
CA: All right. Thank you so much.

00:14:21.487 --> 00:14:25.062
JT: Thank you. (Applause)
