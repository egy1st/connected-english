WEBVTT

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:04.110
So, embryonic stem cells

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.410
are really incredible cells.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.198
They are our body's own repair kits,

00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:13.162
and they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:15.594
all of the cells in our bodies.

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:18.282
Soon, we actually will be able to use stem cells

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:21.267
to replace cells that are damaged or diseased.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.698
But that's not what I want to talk to you about,

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:26.376
because right now there are some really

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:30.322
extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:31.929
that are completely changing

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.828
the way we look and model disease,

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:37.347
our ability to understand why we get sick,

00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:39.778
and even develop drugs.

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:44.091
I truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow

00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:48.596
our children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes

00:00:48.596 --> 00:00:52.987
and other major diseases the way we view polio today,

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:56.188
which is as a preventable disease.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:59.411
So here we have this incredible field, which has

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:03.798
enormous hope for humanity,

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:07.318
but much like IVF over 35 years ago,

00:01:07.318 --> 00:01:09.652
until the birth of a healthy baby, Louise,

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:14.721
this field has been under siege politically and financially.

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:18.993
Critical research is being challenged instead of supported,

00:01:18.993 --> 00:01:23.353
and we saw that it was really essential to have

00:01:23.353 --> 00:01:26.884
private safe haven laboratories where this work

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:29.714
could be advanced without interference.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:32.245
And so, in 2005,

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:34.857
we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:38.446
so that we would have a small organization that could

00:01:38.446 --> 00:01:41.758
do this work and support it.

00:01:41.758 --> 00:01:45.143
What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical

00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:48.519
research, but also developing drugs and treatments,

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:52.232
is dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations,

00:01:52.232 --> 00:01:55.351
but in a new field, sometimes large organizations

00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:57.519
really have trouble getting out of their own way,

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:59.955
and sometimes they can't ask the right questions,

00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:03.311
and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger

00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:06.522
between academic research on the one hand

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:09.223
and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:12.489
that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.879
and many of our treatments, and so we knew that

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.825
to really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:21.632
to have to address this with two things:

00:02:21.632 --> 00:02:24.854
new technologies and also a new research model.

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:28.613
Because if you don't close that gap, you really are

00:02:28.613 --> 00:02:30.220
exactly where we are today.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.887
And that's what I want to focus on.

00:02:31.887 --> 00:02:35.437
We've spent the last couple of years pondering this,

00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:37.828
making a list of the different things that we had to do,

00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:40.459
and so we developed a new technology,

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.710
It's software and hardware,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.213
that actually can generate thousands and thousands of

00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:48.383
genetically diverse stem cell lines to create

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:52.170
a global array, essentially avatars of ourselves.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.604
And we did this because we think that it's actually going

00:02:55.604 --> 00:02:59.019
to allow us to realize the potential, the promise,

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.099
of all of the sequencing of the human genome,

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.603
but it's going to allow us, in doing that,

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:09.611
to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells,

00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:13.770
not animal cells, to generate drugs and treatments

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.019
that are much more effective, much safer,

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.275
much faster, and at a much lower cost.

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:22.659
So let me put that in perspective for you

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.075
and give you some context.

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:28.907
This is an extremely new field.

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:31.739
In 1998, human embryonic stem cells

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.251
were first identified, and just nine years later,

00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:39.556
a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells

00:03:39.556 --> 00:03:42.751
and reprogram them with very powerful viruses

00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:46.993
to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.083
called an induced pluripotent stem cell,

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:52.091
or what we refer to as an IPS cell.

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.289
This was really an extraordinary advance, because

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.833
although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells,

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.627
which still remain the gold standard,

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:03.097
they are terrific to use for modeling disease

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:05.827
and potentially for drug discovery.

00:04:05.827 --> 00:04:08.867
So a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists

00:04:08.867 --> 00:04:12.067
built on that research. He took skin biopsies,

00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:14.095
this time from people who had a disease,

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:17.009
ALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.707
He turned them into the IPS cells

00:04:18.707 --> 00:04:21.393
that I've just told you about, and then he turned those

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:24.097
IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.558
were dying in the disease.

00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:28.577
So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell

00:04:28.577 --> 00:04:30.291
and turn it into a sick cell,

00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:33.849
and he recapitulated the disease over and over again

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.209
in the dish, and this was extraordinary,

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.457
because it was the first time that we had a model

00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:43.645
of a disease from a living patient in living human cells.

00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:46.765
And as he watched the disease unfold, he was able

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:49.776
to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying

00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:51.903
in the disease in a different way than the field

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.397
had previously thought. There was another kind of cell

00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:56.598
that actually was sending out a toxin

00:04:56.598 --> 00:04:59.109
and contributing to the death of these motor neurons,

00:04:59.109 --> 00:05:00.467
and you simply couldn't see it

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.257
until you had the human model.

00:05:02.257 --> 00:05:04.924
So you could really say that

00:05:04.924 --> 00:05:08.830
researchers trying to understand the cause of disease

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.982
without being able to have human stem cell models

00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:15.742
were much like investigators trying to figure out

00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:18.983
what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash

00:05:18.983 --> 00:05:22.980
without having a black box, or a flight recorder.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.582
They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong,

00:05:25.582 --> 00:05:28.694
but they really had no way of knowing what led

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:30.866
to the terrible events.

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:35.049
And stem cells really have given us the black box

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:39.017
for diseases, and it's an unprecedented window.

00:05:39.017 --> 00:05:42.262
It really is extraordinary, because you can recapitulate

00:05:42.262 --> 00:05:45.509
many, many diseases in a dish, you can see

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.045
what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation

00:05:49.045 --> 00:05:51.469
well before you would ever see

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.005
symptoms appear in a patient.

00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:56.528
And this opens up the ability,

00:05:56.528 --> 00:05:59.342
which hopefully will become something that

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:01.989
is routine in the near term,

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:06.135
of using human cells to test for drugs.

00:06:06.135 --> 00:06:11.599
Right now, the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic.

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.917
To bring a successful drug to market, it takes, on average,

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:17.103
13 years — that's one drug —

00:06:17.103 --> 00:06:20.491
with a sunk cost of 4 billion dollars,

00:06:20.491 --> 00:06:25.358
and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road

00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:27.606
are actually going to get there.

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:29.731
You can't imagine other businesses

00:06:29.731 --> 00:06:31.180
that you would think of going into

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.935
that have these kind of numbers.

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:34.737
It's a terrible business model.

00:06:34.737 --> 00:06:38.726
But it is really a worse social model because of

00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:42.054
what's involved and the cost to all of us.

00:06:42.054 --> 00:06:45.806
So the way we develop drugs now

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:49.006
is by testing promising compounds on --

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:50.886
We didn't have disease modeling with human cells,

00:06:50.886 --> 00:06:54.350
so we'd been testing them on cells of mice

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.017
or other creatures or cells that we engineer,

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:01.078
but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases

00:07:01.078 --> 00:07:03.414
that we're actually trying to cure.

00:07:03.414 --> 00:07:06.460
You know, we're not mice, and you can't go into

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.878
a living person with an illness

00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:11.806
and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:14.095
and then start fooling around in a lab to test

00:07:14.095 --> 00:07:17.656
for, you know, a promising drug.

00:07:17.656 --> 00:07:21.241
But what you can do with human stem cells, now,

00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:25.578
is actually create avatars, and you can create the cells,

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:27.545
whether it's the live motor neurons

00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:30.555
or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells

00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:34.664
or other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs,

00:07:34.664 --> 00:07:37.789
promising compounds, on the actual cells

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:41.420
that you're trying to affect, and this is now,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.234
and it's absolutely extraordinary,

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:47.390
and you're going to know at the beginning,

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.134
the very early stages of doing your assay development

00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:54.523
and your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years

00:07:54.523 --> 00:07:57.842
until you've brought a drug to market, only to find out

00:07:57.842 --> 00:08:02.898
that actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.

00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:07.238
But it isn't really enough just to look at

00:08:07.238 --> 00:08:11.020
the cells from a few people or a small group of people,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.664
because we have to step back.

00:08:12.664 --> 00:08:14.515
We've got to look at the big picture.

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:17.651
Look around this room. We are all different,

00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:20.391
and a disease that I might have,

00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:23.268
if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease,

00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:27.034
it probably would affect me differently than if

00:08:27.034 --> 00:08:28.675
one of you had that disease,

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:33.020
and if we both had Parkinson's disease,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.288
and we took the same medication,

00:08:35.288 --> 00:08:38.035
but we had different genetic makeup,

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:40.320
we probably would have a different result,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.051
and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully

00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:47.630
for me was actually ineffective for you,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.322
and similarly, it could be that a drug that is harmful for you

00:08:52.322 --> 00:08:56.624
is safe for me, and, you know, this seems totally obvious,

00:08:56.624 --> 00:08:59.352
but unfortunately it is not the way

00:08:59.352 --> 00:09:02.538
that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs

00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:06.524
because, until now, it hasn't had the tools.

00:09:06.524 --> 00:09:08.816
And so we need to move away

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:11.770
from this one-size-fits-all model.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.947
The way we've been developing drugs is essentially

00:09:14.947 --> 00:09:16.326
like going into a shoe store,

00:09:16.326 --> 00:09:18.609
no one asks you what size you are, or

00:09:18.609 --> 00:09:20.819
if you're going dancing or hiking.

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:23.627
They just say, "Well, you have feet, here are your shoes."

00:09:23.627 --> 00:09:27.227
It doesn't work with shoes, and our bodies are

00:09:27.227 --> 00:09:30.699
many times more complicated than just our feet.

00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:33.240
So we really have to change this.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.424
There was a very sad example of this in the last decade.

00:09:38.424 --> 00:09:41.072
There's a wonderful drug, and a class of drugs actually,

00:09:41.072 --> 00:09:43.752
but the particular drug was Vioxx, and

00:09:43.752 --> 00:09:48.128
for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain,

00:09:48.128 --> 00:09:51.520
the drug was an absolute lifesaver,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.600
but unfortunately, for another subset of those people,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.369
they suffered pretty severe heart side effects,

00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:04.097
and for a subset of those people, the side effects were

00:10:04.097 --> 00:10:07.994
so severe, the cardiac side effects, that they were fatal.

00:10:07.994 --> 00:10:12.036
But imagine a different scenario,

00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:16.338
where we could have had an array, a genetically diverse array,

00:10:16.338 --> 00:10:19.964
of cardiac cells, and we could have actually tested

00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:25.045
that drug, Vioxx, in petri dishes, and figured out,

00:10:25.045 --> 00:10:28.789
well, okay, people with this genetic type are going to have

00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:33.789
cardiac side effects, people with these genetic subgroups

00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:38.933
or genetic shoes sizes, about 25,000 of them,

00:10:38.933 --> 00:10:41.693
are not going to have any problems.

00:10:41.693 --> 00:10:44.308
The people for whom it was a lifesaver

00:10:44.308 --> 00:10:45.985
could have still taken their medicine.

00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:50.371
The people for whom it was a disaster, or fatal,

00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:52.462
would never have been given it, and

00:10:52.462 --> 00:10:55.045
you can imagine a very different outcome for the company,

00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:57.813
who had to withdraw the drug.

00:10:57.813 --> 00:11:00.629
So that is terrific,

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:02.463
and we thought, all right,

00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:05.222
as we're trying to solve this problem,

00:11:05.222 --> 00:11:07.419
clearly we have to think about genetics,

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:10.253
we have to think about human testing,

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.832
but there's a fundamental problem,

00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:14.531
because right now, stem cell lines,

00:11:14.531 --> 00:11:16.241
as extraordinary as they are,

00:11:16.241 --> 00:11:17.985
and lines are just groups of cells,

00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:22.317
they are made by hand, one at a time,

00:11:22.317 --> 00:11:24.541
and it takes a couple of months.

00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:28.907
This is not scalable, and also when you do things by hand,

00:11:28.907 --> 00:11:30.450
even in the best laboratories,

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.611
you have variations in techniques,

00:11:33.611 --> 00:11:36.792
and you need to know, if you're making a drug,

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:38.690
that the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.130
on Monday is the same as the Aspirin

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.211
that's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday.

00:11:43.211 --> 00:11:47.002
So we looked at this, and we thought, okay,

00:11:47.002 --> 00:11:50.154
artisanal is wonderful in, you know, your clothing

00:11:50.154 --> 00:11:53.098
and your bread and crafts, but

00:11:53.098 --> 00:11:56.081
artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells,

00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.471
so we have to deal with this.

00:11:58.471 --> 00:12:02.391
But even with that, there still was another big hurdle,

00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:05.955
and that actually brings us back to

00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:08.339
the mapping of the human genome, because

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:11.050
we're all different.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.882
We know from the sequencing of the human genome

00:12:13.882 --> 00:12:16.439
that it's shown us all of the A's, C's, G's and T's

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:18.907
that make up our genetic code,

00:12:18.907 --> 00:12:23.176
but that code, by itself, our DNA,

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:27.775
is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code

00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:30.600
without having a computer that can read it.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.888
It's like having an app without having a smartphone.

00:12:33.888 --> 00:12:37.772
We needed to have a way of bringing the biology

00:12:37.772 --> 00:12:39.981
to that incredible data,

00:12:39.981 --> 00:12:43.096
and the way to do that was to find

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.783
a stand-in, a biological stand-in,

00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:49.808
that could contain all of the genetic information,

00:12:49.808 --> 00:12:52.336
but have it be arrayed in such a way

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:55.200
as it could be read together

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.456
and actually create this incredible avatar.

00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:02.160
We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.112
that represent who we are.

00:13:05.112 --> 00:13:07.872
So this is what we've built.

00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:11.192
It's an automated robotic technology.

00:13:11.192 --> 00:13:13.800
It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.039
of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed.

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:21.788
It has massively parallel processing capability,

00:13:21.788 --> 00:13:25.108
and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered,

00:13:25.108 --> 00:13:28.943
we hope, and I think eventually what's going to happen

00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:31.142
is that we're going to want to re-screen drugs,

00:13:31.142 --> 00:13:33.633
on arrays like this, that already exist,

00:13:33.633 --> 00:13:35.504
all of the drugs that currently exist,

00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:38.415
and in the future, you're going to be taking drugs

00:13:38.415 --> 00:13:41.287
and treatments that have been tested for side effects

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:43.590
on all of the relevant cells,

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.743
on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:50.072
It really has brought us to the threshold

00:13:50.072 --> 00:13:52.286
of personalized medicine.

00:13:52.286 --> 00:13:56.727
It's here now, and in our family,

00:13:56.727 --> 00:13:59.665
my son has type 1 diabetes,

00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:02.313
which is still an incurable disease,

00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:05.755
and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer,

00:14:05.755 --> 00:14:09.488
but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you,

00:14:09.488 --> 00:14:13.718
because probably a version of it is your story.

00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:17.662
At some point in our lives, all of us,

00:14:17.662 --> 00:14:20.398
or people we care about, become patients,

00:14:20.398 --> 00:14:23.007
and that's why I think that stem cell research

00:14:23.007 --> 00:14:26.390
is incredibly important for all of us.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.058
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:30.058 --> 00:14:37.166
