00:00:00.688 --> 00:00:03.577
Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:05.627
that the vast majority of brain development

00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:08.606
takes place in the first few years of life.

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:11.318
Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:13.939
to look inside the living human brain

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.977
and track development across the lifespan.

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:20.138
In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:21.943
in brain imaging technology

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:24.886
such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:28.013
neuroscientists have started to look inside the living

00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:30.432
human brain of all ages, and to track changes

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:33.303
in brain structure and brain function,

00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:36.980
so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.042
a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:43.262
of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:45.702
how much gray matter does the brain contain,

00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:47.505
and how does that change with age?

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:51.217
And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.612
to take a video, a movie, of brain activity

00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:57.480
when participants are taking part in some kind of task

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.372
like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.138
So many labs around the world are involved in this kind

00:01:03.138 --> 00:01:05.368
of research, and we now have a really rich

00:01:05.368 --> 00:01:08.892
and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:11.960
and this picture has radically changed the way

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.593
we think about human brain development

00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:17.361
by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood,

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.072
and instead, the brain continues to develop

00:01:20.072 --> 00:01:24.118
right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:28.097
So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts

00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:32.493
with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty

00:01:32.493 --> 00:01:35.778
and ends at the age at which an individual attains

00:01:35.778 --> 00:01:39.229
a stable, independent role in society.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.019
(Laughter)

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:43.784
It can go on a long time. (Laughter)

00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:46.803
One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically

00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:50.067
during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.

00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:53.044
So this is a model of the human brain,

00:01:53.044 --> 00:01:55.924
and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:58.433
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:01.547
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than

00:02:01.547 --> 00:02:05.174
in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.462
high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.552
planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:13.292
or next week or next year, inhibiting

00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:15.958
inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying

00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.883
something really rude or doing something really stupid.

00:02:18.883 --> 00:02:20.661
It's also involved in social interaction,

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.785
understanding other people, and self-awareness.

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:26.835
So MRI studies looking at the development of this region

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:29.305
have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.238
during the period of adolescence.

00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:35.196
So if you look at gray matter volume, for example,

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:40.045
gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years

00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:42.367
increases during childhood, which is what you can see

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:46.120
on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.685
The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:52.151
in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:55.661
a couple of years later in boys relative to girls,

00:02:55.661 --> 00:02:57.500
and that's probably because boys go through puberty

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.752
a couple of years later than girls on average,

00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:03.187
and then during adolescence, there's a significant decline

00:03:03.187 --> 00:03:05.872
in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:07.897
Now that might sound bad, but actually this is

00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:11.047
a really important developmental process, because

00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:15.153
gray matter contains cell bodies and connections

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:18.607
between cells, the synapses, and this decline

00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:21.352
in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex

00:03:21.352 --> 00:03:24.244
is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:26.567
the elimination of unwanted synapses.

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:29.700
This is a really important process. It's partly dependent

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.834
on the environment that the animal or the human is in,

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:36.278
and the synapses that are being used are strengthened,

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:38.211
and synapses that aren't being used

00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:40.543
in that particular environment are pruned away.

00:03:40.543 --> 00:03:43.049
You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.889
You prune away the weaker branches so that

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.927
the remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:52.853
and this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue

00:03:52.853 --> 00:03:55.520
according to the species-specific environment,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.435
is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions

00:03:58.435 --> 00:04:01.989
during the period of human adolescence.

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.690
So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.942
in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI

00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:12.215
to look at changes in brain activity across age.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:13.857
So I'll just give you an example from my lab.

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:17.418
So in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is

00:04:17.418 --> 00:04:21.002
the network of brain regions that we use to understand

00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:23.435
other people and to interact with other people.

00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:27.201
So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:31.608
to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.

00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:33.041
So this is a soccer game. (Laughter)

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:35.683
Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying

00:04:35.683 --> 00:04:38.485
on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:41.444
that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic

00:04:41.444 --> 00:04:44.494
and instinctive social emotional responses are,

00:04:44.494 --> 00:04:47.458
so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.268
everyone is doing the same thing with their arms

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:51.071
and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen

00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.895
as he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing

00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:55.164
with his arms, and presumably has a similar

00:04:55.164 --> 00:04:57.138
facial expression, and the only people who don't

00:04:57.138 --> 00:05:00.599
are the guys in yellow at the back — (Laughs) —

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.142
and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium,

00:05:03.142 --> 00:05:05.437
and they're doing another social emotional response

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:08.072
that we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect

00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:11.708
of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:15.090
how good we are at reading other people's behavior,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.767
their actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,

00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:21.583
in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:23.360
So you don't have to ask any of these guys.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.901
You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling

00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.489
and thinking at this precise moment in time.

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:30.245
So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.

00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:33.817
So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.218
to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task

00:05:36.218 --> 00:05:39.512
that involves thinking about other people, their minds,

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:42.406
their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings

00:05:42.406 --> 00:05:45.252
that we've found several times now, as have other labs

00:05:45.252 --> 00:05:48.470
around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.688
medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,

00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:54.444
and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex

00:05:54.444 --> 00:05:56.842
in the midline of your head.

00:05:56.842 --> 00:06:00.125
This region is more active in adolescents when they make

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.252
these social decisions and think about other people

00:06:02.252 --> 00:06:05.053
than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis

00:06:05.053 --> 00:06:08.293
of nine different studies in this area from labs around

00:06:08.293 --> 00:06:10.993
the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity

00:06:10.993 --> 00:06:14.363
in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases

00:06:14.363 --> 00:06:16.810
during the period of adolescence.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.454
And we think that might be because adolescents and adults

00:06:19.454 --> 00:06:21.820
use a different mental approach, a different

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.238
cognitive strategy, to make social decisions,

00:06:25.238 --> 00:06:28.754
and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies

00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:30.731
whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them

00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:33.275
some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:36.485
another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.

00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:39.133
So imagine that you're the participant in one of our

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:40.858
experiments. You come into the lab,

00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:43.532
you see this computerized task.

00:06:43.532 --> 00:06:46.322
In this task, you see a set of shelves.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.139
Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.110
and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.695
of shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.

00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:57.974
They're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of

00:06:57.974 --> 00:07:00.618
gray piece of wood.

00:07:00.618 --> 00:07:04.102
This is the same set of shelves from his point of view.

00:07:04.102 --> 00:07:07.595
Notice that there are only some objects that he can see,

00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:10.047
whereas there are many more objects that you can see.

00:07:10.047 --> 00:07:12.243
Now your task is to move objects around.

00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:14.605
The director, standing behind the set of shelves,

00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:17.350
is going to direct you to move objects around,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.244
but remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects

00:07:19.244 --> 00:07:22.964
that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting

00:07:22.964 --> 00:07:25.157
condition whereby there's a kind of conflict

00:07:25.157 --> 00:07:28.325
between your perspective and the director's perspective.

00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:31.565
So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.

00:07:31.565 --> 00:07:33.596
There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively

00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:35.761
go for the white truck, because that's the top truck

00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:38.579
from your perspective, but then you have to remember,

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:40.638
"Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean

00:07:40.638 --> 00:07:43.395
me to move the blue truck," which is the top truck

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:46.040
from his perspective. Now believe it or not,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.991
normal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors

00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:52.131
about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.

00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:54.974
They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:58.290
So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.844
and we also have a control condition

00:07:59.844 --> 00:08:03.905
where there's no director and instead we give people a rule.

00:08:03.905 --> 00:08:05.819
We tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.656
but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:11.863
ignore objects with the dark gray background.

00:08:11.863 --> 00:08:14.563
You'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only

00:08:14.563 --> 00:08:17.409
in the no-director condition they just have to remember

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:20.480
to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.160
in the director condition, they have to remember

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.701
to take into account the director's perspective

00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:29.998
in order to guide their ongoing behavior.

00:08:29.998 --> 00:08:32.608
Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors

00:08:32.608 --> 00:08:35.174
in a large developmental study we did,

00:08:35.174 --> 00:08:38.728
this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,

00:08:38.728 --> 00:08:39.938
and what you're going to see is the percentage errors

00:08:39.938 --> 00:08:41.912
in the adult group in both conditions,

00:08:41.927 --> 00:08:45.198
so the gray is the director condition, and you see

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:47.771
that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent

00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:50.486
of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:52.514
when there's no director present, when they just have

00:08:52.514 --> 00:08:55.595
to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.

00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:58.263
Developmentally, these two conditions develop

00:08:58.263 --> 00:09:01.186
in exactly the same way. Between late childhood

00:09:01.186 --> 00:09:03.427
and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement,

00:09:03.427 --> 00:09:06.778
in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,

00:09:06.778 --> 00:09:07.898
in both of these conditions.

00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:10.183
But it's when you compare the last two groups,

00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:12.135
the mid-adolescent group and the adult group

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:15.295
where things get really interesting, because there, there is

00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:18.333
no continued improvement in the no-director condition.

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:21.263
In other words, everything you need to do in order to

00:09:21.263 --> 00:09:23.969
remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed

00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:26.500
by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.897
if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still

00:09:28.897 --> 00:09:32.047
a significant improvement in the director condition

00:09:32.047 --> 00:09:34.488
between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what

00:09:34.488 --> 00:09:37.864
this means is that the ability to take into account someone

00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:41.149
else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:43.408
which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all

00:09:43.408 --> 00:09:48.014
the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.

00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:50.554
So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you

00:09:50.554 --> 00:09:52.963
sometimes think they have problems taking other people's

00:09:52.963 --> 00:09:56.719
perspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.

00:09:56.719 --> 00:10:00.232
So we sometimes laugh about teenagers.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:04.095
They're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media

00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:07.622
for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,

00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:10.393
they're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.

00:10:10.393 --> 00:10:12.886
I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine

00:10:12.886 --> 00:10:15.373
who said that the thing he noticed most

00:10:15.373 --> 00:10:18.354
about his teenage daughters before and after puberty

00:10:18.354 --> 00:10:20.598
was their level of embarrassment in front of him.

00:10:20.614 --> 00:10:23.103
So, he said, "Before puberty, if my two daughters

00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:25.357
were messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey,

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.106
stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,'

00:10:27.106 --> 00:10:29.007
and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing

00:10:29.007 --> 00:10:32.478
their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.

00:10:32.478 --> 00:10:34.295
(Laughter)

00:10:34.295 --> 00:10:37.772
The very notion of their dad singing in public

00:10:37.772 --> 00:10:40.135
was enough to make them behave.

00:10:40.135 --> 00:10:41.563
So people often ask,

00:10:41.563 --> 00:10:44.196
"Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?

00:10:44.196 --> 00:10:46.318
Is it something we've invented recently in the West?"

00:10:46.318 --> 00:10:48.986
And actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots

00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:52.409
of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound

00:10:52.409 --> 00:10:54.566
very similar to the descriptions we use today.

00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:58.799
So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from "The Winter's Tale"

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:01.574
where he describes adolescence as follows:

00:11:01.574 --> 00:11:04.420
"I would there were no age between ten and

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.660
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.751
for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches

00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:15.974
with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting." (Laughter)

00:11:15.974 --> 00:11:20.508
He then goes on to say, "Having said that, would any

00:11:20.508 --> 00:11:23.653
but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty

00:11:23.653 --> 00:11:26.151
hunt in this weather?" (Laughter)

00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:29.077
So almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying

00:11:29.077 --> 00:11:31.801
adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we

00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:35.260
portray them in today, but today we try to understand

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.347
their behavior in terms of the underlying changes

00:11:38.347 --> 00:11:40.285
that are going on in their brain.

00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:43.893
So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents

00:11:43.893 --> 00:11:46.218
have a tendency to take risks. They do.

00:11:46.218 --> 00:11:48.850
They take more risks than children or adults,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.310
and they are particularly prone to taking risks

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.278
when they're with their friends. There's an important drive

00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:56.764
to become independent from one's parents

00:11:56.764 --> 00:11:59.588
and to impress one's friends in adolescence.

00:11:59.588 --> 00:12:02.187
But now we try to understand that in terms of

00:12:02.187 --> 00:12:05.180
the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.723
so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red

00:12:07.723 --> 00:12:09.588
in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.

00:12:09.588 --> 00:12:12.697
So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,

00:12:12.697 --> 00:12:16.430
and it's involved in things like emotion processing

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.580
and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.876
out of doing fun things, including taking risks.

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:25.241
It gives you the kick out of taking risks.

00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:28.289
And this region, the regions within the limbic system,

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.708
have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:35.477
feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,

00:12:35.477 --> 00:12:39.179
and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:41.453
which you can see in blue in the slide here,

00:12:41.453 --> 00:12:44.320
which stops us taking excessive risks,

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.718
is still very much in development in adolescents.

00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:51.385
So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain

00:12:51.385 --> 00:12:54.727
undergoes really quite profound development,

00:12:54.727 --> 00:12:58.683
and this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,

00:12:58.683 --> 00:13:02.703
and intervention. The environment, including teaching,

00:13:02.703 --> 00:13:06.112
can and does shape the developing adolescent brain,

00:13:06.112 --> 00:13:08.914
and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been

00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:11.419
routinely educating teenagers in the West.

00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:15.172
All four of my grandparents, for example, left school

00:13:15.172 --> 00:13:19.006
in their early adolescence. They had no choice.

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:21.780
And that's still the case for many, many teenagers

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.947
around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers

00:13:24.947 --> 00:13:29.169
don't have access to secondary school education.

00:13:29.169 --> 00:13:31.808
And yet, this is a period of life where the brain is

00:13:31.808 --> 00:13:34.655
particularly adaptable and malleable.

00:13:34.655 --> 00:13:38.425
It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.

00:13:38.425 --> 00:13:40.658
So what's sometimes seen as the problem

00:13:40.658 --> 00:13:43.134
with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse

00:13:43.134 --> 00:13:47.076
control, self-consciousness — shouldn't be stigmatized.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.913
It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:52.827
an excellent opportunity for education

00:13:52.827 --> 00:13:57.257
and social development. Thank you. (Applause)

00:13:57.257 --> 00:14:05.027
