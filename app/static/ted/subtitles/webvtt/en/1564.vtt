WEBVTT

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.841
It's time to start designing for our ears.

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:06.921
Architects and designers tend to focus

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:08.447
exclusively on these.

00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:11.561
They use these to design with and they design for them,

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.889
which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.686
like this — (loud crowd noise) — and sound like this,

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:18.233
shouting from a foot away to try and be heard

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:19.535
by our dinner companion,

00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:22.758
or why we get on airplanes -- (flight attendant announcements) -- which cost 200 million pounds,

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:26.601
with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.137
on a cheap stereo system,

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:30.790
making us jump out of our skins.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.174
We're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter)

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:36.886
And it's not just our quality of life which suffers.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.661
It's our health,

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.672
our social behavior, and our productivity as well.

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:44.314
How does this work? Well, two ways.

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:47.753
First of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this.

00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:51.184
Sound affects us physiologically, psychologically,

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.384
cognitively and behaviorally all the time.

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:55.121
The sound around us is affecting us

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.443
even though we're not conscious of it.

00:00:57.443 --> 00:00:59.199
There's a second way though, as well.

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.576
That's interference. Communication requires sending

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:06.476
and receiving, and I have another whole TEDTalk

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:08.940
about the importance of conscious listening,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.974
but I can send as well as I like,

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:13.388
and you can be brilliant conscious listeners.

00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:16.888
If the space I'm sending it in is not effective,

00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:19.382
that communication can't happen.

00:01:19.382 --> 00:01:21.912
Spaces tend to include noise and acoustics.

00:01:21.912 --> 00:01:25.612
A room like this has acoustics, this one very good acoustics.

00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:27.780
Many rooms are not so good.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.811
Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas

00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:33.284
which I think we all care about: health and education.

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:35.516
(Hospital noises) When I was visiting my terminally ill father

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:37.548
in a hospital, I was asking myself,

00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:41.685
how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this?

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.993
Hospital sound is getting worse all the time.

00:01:43.993 --> 00:01:45.999
Noise levels in hospitals have doubled

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.603
in the last few years, and it affects not just the patients

00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:51.419
but also the people working there.

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:55.296
I think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero,

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:58.761
wouldn't we? And yet, as noise levels go up, so do

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.315
the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals.

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:05.370
Most of all, though, it affects the patients,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.578
and that could be you, it could be me.

00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:09.917
Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery.

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:12.957
It's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves,

00:02:12.957 --> 00:02:15.341
and with threatening noise like this going on,

00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:18.493
your body, even if you are able to sleep, your body

00:02:18.493 --> 00:02:21.536
is telling you, "I'm under threat. This is dangerous."

00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:24.765
And the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery.

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:26.917
There are just huge benefits to come

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:29.954
from designing for the ears in our health care.

00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:32.861
This is an area I intend to take on this year.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.826
Education.

00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:36.422
When I see a classroom that looks like this,

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.299
can you imagine how this sounds?

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.630
I am forced to ask myself a question.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.207
("Do architects have ears?") (Laughter)

00:02:43.207 --> 00:02:45.874
Now, that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.763
are architects. (Laughter) And they definitely do have ears.

00:02:48.763 --> 00:02:50.828
But I think sometimes they don't use them

00:02:50.828 --> 00:02:53.491
when they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point.

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:57.182
This is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school

00:02:57.182 --> 00:02:59.187
which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed

00:02:59.187 --> 00:03:02.334
by one of Britain's top architects.

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:04.159
Unfortunately, it was designed like a corporate

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.558
headquarters, with a vast central atrium

00:03:06.558 --> 00:03:10.832
and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all.

00:03:10.832 --> 00:03:12.758
The children couldn't hear their teachers.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.479
They had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.559
putting the walls in. Let's stop this madness

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:22.621
of open plan classrooms right now, please.

00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:26.149
It's not just these modern buildings which suffer.

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.486
Old-fashioned classrooms suffer too.

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:30.680
A study in Florida just a few years ago found

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.357
that if you're sitting where this photograph was taken

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:35.557
in the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility

00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:38.008
is just 50 percent.

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:40.208
Children are losing one word in two.

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:42.853
Now that doesn't mean they only get half their education,

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:44.565
but it does mean they have to work very hard

00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:47.541
to join the dots and understand what's going on.

00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:50.314
This is affected massively by reverberation time,

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:52.214
how reverberant a room is.

00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:55.772
In a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds,

00:03:55.772 --> 00:03:59.468
which is pretty common, this is what it sounds like.

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:11.772
(Inaudible echoing voice)

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:13.589
Not so good, is it?

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:18.048
If you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:20.996
by installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials

00:04:20.996 --> 00:04:23.704
and so forth, this is what you get.

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:27.565
Voice: In language, infinitely many words can be written

00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:30.437
with a small set of letters. In arithmetic,

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.791
infinitely many numbers can be composed

00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:36.393
from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero.

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:37.957
Julian Treasure: What a difference.

00:04:37.957 --> 00:04:39.797
Now that education you would receive,

00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:42.727
and thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James

00:04:42.727 --> 00:04:45.416
for those simulations. The signal was the same,

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.815
the background noise was the same.

00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:49.258
All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom

00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:50.932
in those two examples.

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:53.352
If education can be likened to watering a garden,

00:04:53.352 --> 00:04:57.519
which is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.575
is evaporating before it reaches the flowers,

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:02.607
especially for some groups,

00:05:02.607 --> 00:05:05.983
for example, those with hearing impairment.

00:05:05.983 --> 00:05:08.735
Now that's not just deaf children. That could be any child

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:11.170
who's got a cold, glue ear, an ear infection,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.546
even hay fever. On a given day, one in eight children

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.362
fall into that group, on any given day.

00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:19.538
Then you have children for whom English is a second language,

00:05:19.538 --> 00:05:22.474
or whatever they're being taught in is a second language.

00:05:22.474 --> 00:05:26.058
In the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population.

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:29.718
And finally, after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February,

00:05:29.718 --> 00:05:32.934
we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:35.631
when they're in a noisy environment doing group work.

00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:38.292
Add those up. That is a lot of children

00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:40.704
who are not receiving their education properly.

00:05:40.704 --> 00:05:42.940
It's not just the children who are affected, though.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.523
(Noisy conversation) This study in Germany found

00:05:44.523 --> 00:05:48.078
the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels.

00:05:48.078 --> 00:05:52.304
I have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels

00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:56.088
of sound, and teachers are not just raising their voices.

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:58.896
This chart maps the teacher's heart rate

00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:01.320
against the noise level.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.027
Noise goes up, heart rate goes up.

00:06:04.027 --> 00:06:06.176
That is not good for you.

00:06:06.176 --> 00:06:10.256
In fact, 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey

00:06:10.256 --> 00:06:13.784
of all the evidence on noise and health found that, that is

00:06:13.784 --> 00:06:18.491
the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction.

00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:21.340
To you and me, that's a heart attack.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.059
It may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:28.359
that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:32.631
by teaching in environments like that day after day.

00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:34.687
What does it cost to treat a classroom

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:37.457
down to that 0.4-second reverberation time?

00:06:37.457 --> 00:06:40.191
Two and a half thousand pounds.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.367
And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K.,

00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:45.708
which incidentally showed that when you do this,

00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:48.071
you do not just make a room that's suitable

00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:49.668
for hearing-impaired children, you make a room

00:06:49.668 --> 00:06:54.952
where behavior improves, and results improve significantly,

00:06:54.952 --> 00:06:58.944
this found that sending a child out of area to a school

00:06:58.944 --> 00:07:01.575
that does have such a room, if you don't have one,

00:07:01.575 --> 00:07:05.037
costs 90,000 pounds a year.

00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:07.424
I think the economics are pretty clear on this.

00:07:07.424 --> 00:07:09.443
I'm glad that debate is happening on this.

00:07:09.443 --> 00:07:12.009
I just moderated a major conference in London

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.058
a few weeks ago called Sound Education,

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:15.855
which brought together top acousticians,

00:07:15.855 --> 00:07:17.876
government people, teachers, and so forth.

00:07:17.876 --> 00:07:22.075
We're at last starting to debate this issue, and the benefits

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:24.775
that are available for designing for the ears in education,

00:07:24.775 --> 00:07:26.586
unbelievable.

00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:29.655
Out of that conference, incidentally, also came

00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:32.657
a free app which is designed to help children study

00:07:32.657 --> 00:07:35.028
if they're having to work at home, for example,

00:07:35.028 --> 00:07:36.620
in a noisy kitchen.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.858
And that's free out of that conference.

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:42.809
Let's broaden the perspective a little bit

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:44.220
and look at cities.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.712
We have urban planners.

00:07:46.712 --> 00:07:49.857
Where are the urban sound planners?

00:07:49.857 --> 00:07:53.064
I don't know of one in the world, and the opportunity is there

00:07:53.064 --> 00:07:55.600
to transform our experience in our cities.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.707
The World Health Organization estimates

00:07:57.707 --> 00:08:00.291
that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep

00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:04.224
degraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that.

00:08:04.224 --> 00:08:07.053
And in our offices, we spend a lot of time at work.

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.712
Where are the office sound planners?

00:08:09.712 --> 00:08:11.599
People who say, don't sit that team next to this team,

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.932
because they like noise and they need quiet.

00:08:13.932 --> 00:08:16.671
Or who say, don't spend all your budget on a huge screen

00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:17.614
in the conference room,

00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:19.623
and then place one tiny microphone

00:08:19.623 --> 00:08:22.860
in the middle of a table for 30 people. (Laughter)

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.979
If you can hear me, you can understand me

00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:28.104
without seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me,

00:08:28.104 --> 00:08:30.208
that does not work.

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:33.424
So office sound is a huge area, and incidentally,

00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:35.560
noise in offices has been shown to make people

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.183
less helpful, less enjoy their teamwork,

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:40.704
and less productive at work.

00:08:40.704 --> 00:08:43.757
Finally, we have homes. We use interior designers.

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:45.992
Where are the interior sound designers?

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:49.332
Hey, let's all be interior sound designers,

00:08:49.332 --> 00:08:52.149
take on listening to our rooms and designing sound

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:53.667
that's effective and appropriate.

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:56.208
My friend Richard Mazuch, an architect in London,

00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:59.094
coined the phrase "invisible architecture."

00:08:59.094 --> 00:09:00.644
I love that phrase.

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:05.724
It's about designing, not appearance, but experience,

00:09:05.724 --> 00:09:09.332
so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look,

00:09:09.332 --> 00:09:12.842
that are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life,

00:09:12.842 --> 00:09:16.083
