00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:03.717
The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal

00:00:03.717 --> 00:00:06.735
started for me when I was 15 years old.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.256
I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.

00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:11.639
And I started to feed them in the most traditional

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.610
and environmentally friendly way.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.935
I went to my school kitchen, and I said,

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:17.481
"Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:18.347
their noses up at."

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:21.011
I went to the local baker and took their stale bread.

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:23.743
I went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:25.581
who was throwing away potatoes because they were

00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:28.767
the wrong shape or size for supermarkets.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.856
This was great. My pigs turned that food waste

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:34.513
into delicious pork. I sold that pork

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:36.500
to my school friends' parents, and I made

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.137
a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.

00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:44.019
But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.402
was in fact fit for human consumption,

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:48.671
and that I was only scratching the surface,

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:51.533
and that right the way up the food supply chain,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.751
in supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes,

00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:58.011
in factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.

00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:00.608
Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me

00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:01.982
about how much food they were wasting.

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:04.466
I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.217
being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites,

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:10.238
and I thought, surely there is something more sensible

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:13.405
to do with food than waste it.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.710
One morning, when I was feeding my pigs,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.397
I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.472
that used to crop up from time to time.

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:22.874
I grabbed hold of it,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.420
sat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs. (Laughter)

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.540
That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.795
really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste,

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:36.145
and the provision of the solution to food waste,

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:38.799
which is simply to sit down and eat food,

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.287
rather than throwing it away.

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:43.566
That became, as it were, a way of confronting

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:46.553
large businesses in the business of wasting food,

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:49.074
and exposing, most importantly, to the public,

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:51.244
that when we're talking about food being thrown away,

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.383
we're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about

00:01:53.383 --> 00:01:56.095
stuff that's beyond the pale.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.211
We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted

00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:00.749
on a colossal scale.

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.606
Eventually, I set about writing my book,

00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:04.660
really to demonstrate the extent of this problem

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.056
on a global scale. What this shows is

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:11.535
a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:14.637
of food waste in each country in the world.

00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:18.525
Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist,

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:21.007
and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.160
some proxy way of uncovering

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.405
how much food was being wasted.

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.961
So I took the food supply of every single country

00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.003
and I compared it to what was actually likely

00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.035
to be being consumed in each country.

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:36.922
That's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:39.588
levels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors

00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:40.930
that gives you an approximate guess

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.157
as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths.

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:46.886
That black line in the middle of that table

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:49.882
is the likely level of consumption

00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:54.244
with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste.

00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:56.163
There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:58.143
that I think we can live in a waste-free world.

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:02.016
But that black line shows what a food supply should be

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:06.470
in a country if they allow for a good, stable, secure,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.219
nutritional diet for every person in that country.

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.626
Any dot above that line, and you'll quickly notice that

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:15.327
that includes most countries in the world,

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:19.616
represents unnecessary surplus, and is likely to reflect

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.238
levels of waste in each country.

00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:25.507
As a country gets richer, it invests more and more

00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:26.798
in getting more and more surplus

00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:29.608
into its shops and restaurants,

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.664
and as you can see, most European

00:03:31.664 --> 00:03:33.076
and North American countries

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:36.216
fall between 150 and 200 percent

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.596
of the nutritional requirements of their populations.

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:42.004
So a country like America has twice as much food

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.608
on its shop shelves and in its restaurants

00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:48.176
than is actually required to feed the American people.

00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:49.736
But the thing that really struck me,

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:53.951
when I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers,

00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:57.617
was that you can see how it levels off.

00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:00.685
Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark,

00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:03.973
and then they level off, and they don't really go on rising

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:05.519
as you might expect.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.064
So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.349
to see if that was true or false.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.843
And that's what I came up with.

00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:13.770
If you include not just the food that ends up

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.894
in shops and restaurants, but also the food

00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:18.050
that people feed to livestock,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.553
the maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.034
but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:25.965
increasing amounts of meat and dairy products,

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.632
what you find is that most rich countries

00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:31.955
have between three and four times the amount of food

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:35.039
that their population needs to feed itself.

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.322
A country like America has four times the amount of food

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:41.284
that it needs.

00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:44.246
When people talk about the need to increase global

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:46.906
food production to feed those nine billion people

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:49.418
that are expected on the planet by 2050,

00:04:49.418 --> 00:04:51.139
I always think of these graphs.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.090
The fact is, we have an enormous buffer

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.971
in rich countries between ourselves and hunger.

00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:02.647
We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.

00:05:02.647 --> 00:05:05.313
In many ways, this is a great success story

00:05:05.313 --> 00:05:09.452
of human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses

00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:12.805
that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.

00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:16.362
It is a success story. It has been a success story.

00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:18.899
But what we have to recognize now is that we are

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:22.531
reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear,

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:25.168
and when we chop down forests, as we are every day,

00:05:25.168 --> 00:05:26.516
to grow more and more food,

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:30.264
when we extract water from depleting water reserves,

00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:33.652
when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest

00:05:33.652 --> 00:05:34.944
to grow more and more food,

00:05:34.944 --> 00:05:37.795
and then we throw away so much of it,

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:40.731
we have to think about what we can start saving.

00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:44.456
And yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets

00:05:44.456 --> 00:05:46.672
that I often visit to

00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:50.853
inspect, if you like, what they're throwing away.

00:05:50.853 --> 00:05:53.256
I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:54.883
all the fruit and vegetables and everything else

00:05:54.883 --> 00:05:55.830
that was in there.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.270
And I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.705
So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits

00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:04.233
that I found in the bin represent the global food supply,

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:05.834
okay? We start out with nine.

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:09.317
That's what's in fields around the world every single year.

00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:11.078
The first biscuit we're going to lose

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:12.837
before we even leave the farm.

00:06:12.837 --> 00:06:16.102
That's a problem primarily associated with

00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:17.766
developing work agriculture, whether it's

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:20.271
a lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization,

00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.184
grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:26.933
that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.

00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:30.429
The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:34.169
to feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.013
Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals,

00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:43.188
and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat,

00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:45.806
so we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:48.040
in meat and dairy products.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.624
Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins.

00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:53.177
This is what most of us think of when we think

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:55.688
of food waste, what ends up in the garbage,

00:06:55.688 --> 00:06:57.536
what ends up in supermarket bins,

00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:00.266
what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two,

00:07:00.266 --> 00:07:04.024
and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on.

00:07:04.024 --> 00:07:07.823
That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources,

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:10.283
especially when you think of the billion hungry people

00:07:10.283 --> 00:07:12.423
that exist already in the world.

00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:14.406
Having gone through the data, I then needed

00:07:14.406 --> 00:07:18.084
to demonstrate where that food ends up.

00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:19.703
Where does it end up? We're used to seeing the stuff

00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:21.606
on our plates, but what about all the stuff

00:07:21.606 --> 00:07:23.546
that goes missing in between?

00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:25.958
Supermarkets are an easy place to start.

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.549
This is the result of my hobby,

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:33.025
which is unofficial bin inspections. (Laughter)

00:07:33.025 --> 00:07:35.622
Strange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.730
to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.214
we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back,

00:07:41.214 --> 00:07:43.770
opening up bins and having a look at what's inside.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.730
But this is what you can see more or less on

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.242
every street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.

00:07:49.242 --> 00:07:52.308
It represents a colossal waste of food,

00:07:52.308 --> 00:07:54.810
but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.154
was that this very evident abundance of waste

00:07:58.154 --> 00:08:01.098
was actually the tip of the iceberg.

00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:03.154
When you start going up the supply chain,

00:08:03.154 --> 00:08:06.140
you find where the real food waste is happening

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.127
on a gargantuan scale.

00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:09.600
Can I have a show of hands

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.058
if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house?

00:08:14.058 --> 00:08:15.977
Who lives in a household where that crust --

00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:19.170
that slice at the first and last end of each loaf --

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.614
who lives in a household where it does get eaten?

00:08:21.614 --> 00:08:23.981
Okay, most people, not everyone, but most people,

00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:26.437
and this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world,

00:08:26.437 --> 00:08:29.226
and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop

00:08:29.226 --> 00:08:31.462
anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches

00:08:31.462 --> 00:08:33.236
with crusts on it? (Laughter)

00:08:33.236 --> 00:08:34.819
I certainly haven't.

00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:39.987
So I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go? (Laughter)

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.202
This is the answer, unfortunately:

00:08:42.202 --> 00:08:44.114
13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of

00:08:44.114 --> 00:08:49.715
this one single factory every single day, day-fresh bread.

00:08:49.715 --> 00:08:51.224
In the same year that I visited this factory,

00:08:51.224 --> 00:08:55.674
I went to Pakistan, where people in 2008 were going hungry

00:08:55.674 --> 00:08:59.451
as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies.

00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:01.635
We contribute to that squeeze

00:09:01.635 --> 00:09:04.627
by depositing food in bins here in Britain

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.834
and elsewhere in the world. We take food

00:09:06.834 --> 00:09:09.940
off the market shelves that hungry people depend on.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.490
Go one step up, and you get to farmers,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.650
who throw away sometimes a third or even more

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.695
of their harvest because of cosmetic standards.

00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:19.618
This farmer, for example, has invested 16,000 pounds

00:09:19.618 --> 00:09:23.042
in growing spinach, not one leaf of which he harvested,

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:25.496
because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it.

00:09:25.496 --> 00:09:27.976
Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect,

00:09:27.976 --> 00:09:29.509
all going for pigs.

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:33.547
Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications,

00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:35.563
tomatoes in Tenerife,

00:09:35.563 --> 00:09:37.368
oranges in Florida,

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:40.372
bananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year,

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.787
all being discarded. This is one day's waste

00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:45.324
from one banana plantation in Ecuador.

00:09:45.324 --> 00:09:47.532
All being discarded, perfectly edible,

00:09:47.532 --> 00:09:50.020
because they're the wrong shape or size.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.600
If we do that to fruit and vegetables,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.415
you bet we can do it to animals too.

00:09:54.415 --> 00:09:57.154
Liver, lungs, heads, tails,

00:09:57.154 --> 00:09:59.132
kidneys, testicles,

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:00.845
all of these things which are traditional,

00:10:00.845 --> 00:10:03.660
delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.156
go to waste. Offal consumption has halved

00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:09.691
in Britain and America in the last 30 years.

00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.331
As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best,

00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:14.100
or is incinerated.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.947
This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China,

00:10:17.947 --> 00:10:19.862
is serving up his national dish.

00:10:19.862 --> 00:10:21.577
It's called sheep's organs.

00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:23.244
It's delicious, it's nutritious,

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:25.652
and as I learned when I went to Kashgar,

00:10:25.652 --> 00:10:28.721
it symbolizes their taboo against food waste.

00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:30.917
I was sitting in a roadside cafe.

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:33.521
A chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl,

00:10:33.521 --> 00:10:35.286
and halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking

00:10:35.286 --> 00:10:37.852
and he started frowning into my bowl.

00:10:37.852 --> 00:10:39.731
I thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken?

00:10:39.731 --> 00:10:41.325
How have I insulted my host?"

00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:43.063
He pointed at three grains of rice

00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:47.347
at the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean." (Laughter)

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:49.259
I thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:50.675
telling people to stop wasting food.

00:10:50.675 --> 00:10:55.724
This guy has thrashed me at my own game." (Laughter)

00:10:55.724 --> 00:10:58.947
But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people,

00:10:58.947 --> 00:11:03.983
do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources

00:11:03.983 --> 00:11:06.183
if we regard it as socially unacceptable

00:11:06.183 --> 00:11:07.687
to waste food on a colossal scale,

00:11:07.687 --> 00:11:10.240
if we make noise about it, tell corporations about it,

00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:12.875
tell governments we want to see an end to food waste,

00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:15.371
we do have the power to bring about that change.

00:11:15.371 --> 00:11:18.083
Fish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:21.164
are discarded at sea, they don't even get landed.

00:11:21.164 --> 00:11:23.856
In our homes, we've lost touch with food.

00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:26.773
This is an experiment I did on three lettuces.

00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:29.411
Who keeps lettuces in their fridge?

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:32.987
Most people. The one on the left

00:11:32.987 --> 00:11:34.440
was kept in a fridge for 10 days.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.659
The one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference.

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:39.234
The one on the right I treated like cut flowers.

00:11:39.234 --> 00:11:41.416
It's a living organism, cut the slice off,

00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:42.859
stuck it in a vase of water,

00:11:42.859 --> 00:11:46.407
it was all right for another two weeks after this.

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:48.366
Some food waste, as I said at the beginning,

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:50.198
will inevitably arise, so the question is,

00:11:50.198 --> 00:11:52.396
what is the best thing to do with it?

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:53.902
I answered that question when I was 15.

00:11:53.902 --> 00:11:59.312
In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago:

00:11:59.312 --> 00:12:01.524
We domesticated pigs

00:12:01.524 --> 00:12:04.296
to turn food waste back into food.

00:12:04.296 --> 00:12:08.027
And yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:11.314
since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.215
It's unscientific. It's unnecessary.

00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:15.898
If you cook food for pigs, just as if

00:12:15.898 --> 00:12:18.867
you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.

00:12:18.867 --> 00:12:21.427
It's also a massive saving of resources.

00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:24.322
At the moment, Europe depends on importing

00:12:24.322 --> 00:12:25.988
millions of tons of soy from South America,

00:12:25.988 --> 00:12:28.874
where its production contributes to global warming,

00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:31.474
to deforestation, to biodiversity loss,

00:12:31.474 --> 00:12:33.921
to feed livestock here in Europe.

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:36.223
At the same time we throw away millions of tons

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:39.442
of food waste which we could and should be feeding them.

00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:42.304
If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save

00:12:42.304 --> 00:12:44.655
that amount of carbon.

00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:47.747
If we feed our food waste which is the current

00:12:47.747 --> 00:12:50.042
government favorite way of getting rid of food waste,

00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:52.843
to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste

00:12:52.843 --> 00:12:55.147
into gas to produce electricity,

00:12:55.147 --> 00:12:58.880
you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.362
per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.

00:13:01.362 --> 00:13:04.622
We knew that during the war. (Laughter)

00:13:04.622 --> 00:13:08.896
A silver lining: It has kicked off globally,

00:13:08.896 --> 00:13:10.666
the quest to tackle food waste.

00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:14.520
Feeding the 5,000 is an event I first organized in 2009.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.776
We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise

00:13:16.776 --> 00:13:18.174
would have been wasted.

00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:20.474
Since then, it's happened again in London,

00:13:20.474 --> 00:13:22.607
it's happening internationally, and across the country.

00:13:22.607 --> 00:13:24.950
It's a way of organizations coming together

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.692
to celebrate food, to say the best thing to do with food

00:13:28.692 --> 00:13:31.499
is to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it.

00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:34.092
For the sake of the planet we live on,

00:13:34.092 --> 00:13:37.372
for the sake of our children,

00:13:37.372 --> 00:13:38.942
for the sake of all the other

00:13:38.942 --> 00:13:41.390
organisms that share our planet with us,

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.431
we are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land

00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:47.053
for food. At the moment, we are trashing our land

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:49.567
to grow food that no one eats.

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:52.663
Stop wasting food. Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:13:52.663 --> 00:13:55.222
(Applause)
