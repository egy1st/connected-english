WEBVTT

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:06.615
You know, we wake up in the morning,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.135
you get dressed, put on your shoes,

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:11.647
you head out into the world.

00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:15.898
You plan on coming back, getting undressed,

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:18.123
going to bed,

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:19.877
waking up, doing it again,

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:23.025
and that anticipation, that rhythm,

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:25.295
helps give us a structure

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:28.883
to how we organize ourselves and our lives,

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:32.363
and gives it a measure of predictability.

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:34.751
Living in New York City, as I do,

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:41.990
it's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.340
at the same time in such close quarters,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.579
it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.105
out of that deck.

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:54.773
You're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:59.776
that just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen.

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:02.119
And you never think you're going to be the guy

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.749
who's walking down the street

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.171
and, because you choose to go down one side or the other,

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.331
the rest of your life is changed forever.

00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:16.059
And one night, I'm riding the uptown local train.

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:19.555
I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:21.672
when I get on the subway.

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:24.718
I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:26.101
or a book.

00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:28.907
And I get on the car, and I look, and I

00:01:28.907 --> 00:01:31.491
notice this couple,

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.979
college-aged, student-looking kids,

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.776
a guy and a girl, and they're sitting next to each other,

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:39.425
and she's got her leg draped over his knee,

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:43.585
and they're doing -- they have this little contraption,

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:45.343
and they're tying these knots,

00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:47.180
and they're doing it with one hand,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.144
they're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly,

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.392
and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it.

00:01:53.392 --> 00:01:54.593
I've never seen anything like this.

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:57.977
It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks.

00:01:57.977 --> 00:02:02.296
And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car,

00:02:02.296 --> 00:02:06.274
and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him.

00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:08.394
He's got the overstuffed leather satchel

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.704
and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:14.216
and the tweed jacket with the leather patches,

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:16.193
and — (Laughter) —

00:02:16.193 --> 00:02:19.016
he looks at them, and then

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:22.032
in a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them,

00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:23.697
and he starts to say,

00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:25.766
"You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look,

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:28.385
if you do this -- " and he takes the laces out of their hand,

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:31.696
and instantly, he starts tying these knots,

00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:36.357
and even better than they were doing it, remarkably.

00:02:36.357 --> 00:02:39.437
And it turns out they are medical students

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:41.549
on their way to a lecture about the latest

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.775
suturing techniques, and he's the guy giving the lecture.

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:46.383
(Laughter)

00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.797
So he starts to tell them, and he's like,

00:02:48.797 --> 00:02:51.305
"No, this is very important here. You know,

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:53.585
when you're needing these knots,

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:55.177
it's going to be, you know, everything's

00:02:55.177 --> 00:02:58.930
going to be happening at the same time, it's going to be --

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.567
you're going to have all this information coming at you,

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:04.063
there's going to be organs getting in the way,

00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:06.098
it's going to be slippery,

00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:07.408
and

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:10.166
it's just very important that you be able to do these

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:13.536
beyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand,

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.364
you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers."

00:03:16.364 --> 00:03:18.734
And at that moment, when I heard that,

00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:25.806
I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:28.940
when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.431
from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed

00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:37.750
to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.739
and what had happened was

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.948
a gang had come in from Brooklyn.

00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:45.571
As part of an initiation for three of their members,

00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:47.275
they had to kill somebody,

00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:50.662
and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street

00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:51.959
that night,

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.396
and they jumped on me without a word.

00:03:56.396 --> 00:03:58.721
One of the very lucky things,

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.729
when I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team,

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:06.377
so I put my hands up right away, instinctively.

00:04:06.377 --> 00:04:09.929
The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade,

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.222
and he went in under my elbow,

00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:17.689
and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava.

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.409
If you know anything about anatomy,

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.117
that's not a good thing to get cut,

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:24.275
and everything, of course, on the way up,

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.165
and then — I still had my hands up —

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.654
he pulled it out and went for my neck,

00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:32.859
and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck,

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:35.583
and I got one straight right punch

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:37.354
and knocked the middle guy out.

00:04:37.354 --> 00:04:39.567
The other guy was still working on me,

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:41.432
collapsing my other lung,

00:04:41.432 --> 00:04:47.412
and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.505
I ran down the street and collapsed,

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:52.552
and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk

00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:55.025
and let the trauma room know

00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:56.643
they had an incoming.

00:04:56.643 --> 00:04:59.642
And one of the

00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:03.583
side effects of having major massive blood loss

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:05.430
is you get tunnel vision,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.243
so I remember being on the stretcher

00:05:07.243 --> 00:05:11.248
and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision,

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:12.797
and I was moving my head around

00:05:12.797 --> 00:05:14.153
and we got to St. Vincent's,

00:05:14.153 --> 00:05:15.796
and we're racing down this hallway,

00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:18.064
and I see the lights going,

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:24.792
and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that.

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:28.971
They don't really go to the usual place that memories go.

00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:34.175
They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def,

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:38.660
and George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter)

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.156
So sometimes, remembering them, it's like,

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:46.880
it's not like any other kind of memories.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.552
And I get into the trauma room,

00:05:49.552 --> 00:05:52.574
and they're waiting for me, and the lights are there,

00:05:52.574 --> 00:05:57.869
and I'd been able to breathe a little more now,

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:01.348
because the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs

00:06:01.348 --> 00:06:03.314
and I was having a very hard time breathing,

00:06:03.314 --> 00:06:06.356
but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher.

00:06:06.356 --> 00:06:09.660
And I said, "Is there anything I can do to help?"

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.432
and — (Laughter) —

00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:14.746
the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and

00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:16.994
I'm turning my head trying to see everybody,

00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:20.810
and I had this weird memory of being in college

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.722
and raising,

00:06:23.722 --> 00:06:27.779
raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh,

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.236
and then I look over and my anesthesiologist

00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:31.769
is clamping the mask on me, and I think,

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:33.830
"He looks Bangladeshi," — (Laughter) —

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.315
and I just have those two facts, and I just think,

00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:41.029
"This could work somehow." (Laughter)

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:43.307
And then I go out, and

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:45.083
they work on me for the rest of the night,

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:50.096
and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there

00:06:50.096 --> 00:06:53.141
while they did their work,

00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:57.365
and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines,

00:06:57.365 --> 00:07:00.784
my cecum, organs I didn't know that I had,

00:07:00.784 --> 00:07:03.155
and he later told me one of the last things he did

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:06.500
while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.723
which I thought was great, you know,

00:07:08.723 --> 00:07:11.886
just a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter)

00:07:11.886 --> 00:07:16.204
And I came to in the morning.

00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:18.020
Out of anesthetic, he had let them know

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.508
that he wanted to be there, and he had given me

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:24.703
about a two percent chance of living.

00:07:24.703 --> 00:07:26.615
So he was there when I woke up,

00:07:26.615 --> 00:07:28.776
and it was, waking up was like

00:07:28.776 --> 00:07:34.993
breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain.

00:07:34.993 --> 00:07:37.096
It was that enveloping,

00:07:37.096 --> 00:07:41.268
and there was only one spot that didn't hurt

00:07:41.268 --> 00:07:42.741
worse than anything I'd ever felt,

00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:44.147
and it was my instep,

00:07:44.147 --> 00:07:47.893
and he was holding the arch of my foot

00:07:47.893 --> 00:07:51.761
and rubbing the instep with his thumb.

00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:54.697
And I looked up, and he's like,

00:07:54.697 --> 00:07:55.818
"Good to see you,"

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:59.754
and I was trying to remember what had happened

00:07:59.754 --> 00:08:01.472
and trying to get my head around everything,

00:08:01.472 --> 00:08:05.529
and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said,

00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:08.905
"You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:13.277
you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson,

00:08:13.277 --> 00:08:16.060
and you're going to need all the strength you can get."

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.769
And in those days, my hair was down to my waist,

00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:22.641
I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried,

00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:27.950
I owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter)

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.210
But

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.182
I had three days of life support,

00:08:33.182 --> 00:08:36.963
and everybody was expecting,

00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:41.456
due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do

00:08:41.456 --> 00:08:43.284
that I wasn't going to make it,

00:08:43.284 --> 00:08:45.329
so it was three days of

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:48.156
everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop,

00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:49.752
and — (Laughter) —

00:08:49.752 --> 00:08:52.711
when I finally pooped, then that somehow,

00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:56.118
surgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line,

00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:57.158
and, um — (Laughter) —

00:08:57.158 --> 00:09:00.423
on that day, the surgeon came in

00:09:00.423 --> 00:09:03.615
and whipped the sheet off of me.

00:09:03.615 --> 00:09:05.276
He had three or four friends with him,

00:09:05.276 --> 00:09:07.678
and he does that, and they all look,

00:09:07.678 --> 00:09:09.559
and there was no infection,

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:12.429
and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding,

00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:14.526
and they're like, "There's no hematomas, blah blah,

00:09:14.526 --> 00:09:17.396
look at the color," and they're talking amongst themselves

00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:20.319
and I'm, like, this restored automobile

00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:23.510
that he's just going, "Yeah, I did that." (Laughter)

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.534
And it was just,

00:09:26.534 --> 00:09:29.670
it was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.730
over how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter)

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.251
And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in

00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:36.487
and everything.

00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:38.702
And

00:09:38.702 --> 00:09:41.313
later on, when I got out

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:46.925
and the flashbacks and the

00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:51.430
nightmares were giving me a hard time,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.112
I went back to him

00:09:53.112 --> 00:09:57.005
and I was sort of asking him,

00:09:57.005 --> 00:09:59.186
you know, what am I gonna do?

00:09:59.186 --> 00:10:03.794
And I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said,

00:10:03.794 --> 00:10:05.520
"Kid, I saved your life.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.170
Like, now you can do whatever you want, like,

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.836
you gotta get on with that.

00:10:09.836 --> 00:10:11.668
It's like I gave you a new car

00:10:11.668 --> 00:10:13.960
and you're complaining about not finding parking.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.561
Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best.

00:10:17.561 --> 00:10:22.367
But you're alive. That's what it's about."

00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:28.148
And then I hear, "Bing-bong," and the subway doors

00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:34.387
are closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids,

00:10:34.387 --> 00:10:36.256
and I go, I think to myself,

00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:37.818
"I'm going to lift my shirt up

00:10:37.818 --> 00:10:39.435
and show them," — (Laughter) —

00:10:39.435 --> 00:10:41.664
and then I think, "No, this is the New York City subway,

00:10:41.664 --> 00:10:45.295
that's going to lead to other things." (Laughter)

00:10:45.295 --> 00:10:49.337
And so I just think, they got their lecture to go to.

00:10:49.337 --> 00:10:53.298
I step off, I'm standing on the platform,

00:10:53.298 --> 00:10:56.162
and I feel my index finger

00:10:56.162 --> 00:10:58.341
in

00:10:58.341 --> 00:11:02.044
the first scar that I ever got,

00:11:02.044 --> 00:11:05.158
from my umbilical cord,

00:11:05.158 --> 00:11:08.396
and then around that, is traced

00:11:08.396 --> 00:11:10.892
the last scar that I got

00:11:10.892 --> 00:11:13.269
from my surgeon,

00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:18.583
and I think that, that chance encounter

00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:22.472
with those kids on the street with their knives

00:11:22.472 --> 00:11:24.905
led me

00:11:24.905 --> 00:11:28.030
to my surgical team,

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.105
and their training

00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:34.221
and their skill

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:37.641
and, always, a little bit of luck

00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:40.612
pushed back against chaos.

00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:44.666
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:53.610
(Applause)

00:11:53.610 --> 00:12:00.030
Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you. (Applause)
