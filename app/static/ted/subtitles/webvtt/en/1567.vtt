WEBVTT

00:00:01.147 --> 00:00:03.086
I want to talk to you today

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.373
about a difficult topic
that is close to me,

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:09.482
and closer than you might realize to you.

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:16.335
I came to the UK 21 years ago,
as an asylum-seeker.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.339
I was 21.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.805
I was forced to leave
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.947
my home, where I was a student activist.

00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:32.674
I would love my children to be able
to meet my family in the Congo.

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:39.830
But I want to tell you
what the Congo has got to do with you.

00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.949
But first of all,
I want you to do me a favor.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.566
Can you all please reach into your pockets
and take out your mobile phone?

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.748
Feel that familiar weight ...

00:00:58.423 --> 00:01:01.590
how naturally your finger
slides towards the buttons.

00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:03.806
(Laughter)

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.993
Can you imagine your world without it?

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:09.501
It connects us to our loved ones,

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.144
our family, friends and colleagues,

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:15.761
at home and overseas.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:18.523
It is a symbol of an interconnected world.

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:26.180
But what you hold in your hand
leaves a bloody trail,

00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:28.962
and it all boils down to a mineral:

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:34.100
tantalum, mined in the Congo as coltan.

00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:37.313
It is an anticorrosive heat conductor.

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:44.197
It stores energy in our mobile phones,
PlayStations and laptops.

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:50.531
It is used in aerospace
and medical equipment as an alloy.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.232
It is so powerful
that we only need tiny amounts.

00:01:56.343 --> 00:01:59.424
It would be great
if the story ended there.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.863
Unfortunately, what you hold in your hand

00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:09.600
has not only enabled incredible
technological development

00:02:09.624 --> 00:02:12.457
and industrial expansion,

00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:17.223
but it has also contributed
to unimaginable human suffering.

00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:20.795
Since 1996,

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.489
over five million people have died
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:33.835
Countless women, men and children
have been raped, tortured or enslaved.

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:37.879
Rape is used as a weapon of war,

00:02:37.903 --> 00:02:42.712
instilling fear
and depopulating whole areas.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.326
The quest for extracting this mineral

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.009
has not only aided, but it has fueled

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:55.690
the ongoing war in the Congo.

00:02:57.275 --> 00:02:59.626
But don't throw away your phones yet.

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:04.755
Thirty thousand children are enlisted

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.929
and are made to fight in armed groups.

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:14.115
The Congo consistently scores dreadfully

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.175
in global health and poverty rankings.

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.120
But remarkably,

00:03:20.144 --> 00:03:25.840
the UN Environmental Programme
has estimated the wealth of the country

00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:30.907
to be over 24 trillion dollars.

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:39.885
The state-regulated mining
industry has collapsed,

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.574
and control over mines has splintered.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:47.046
Coltan is easily controlled
by armed groups.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:53.230
One well-known illicit trade route
is that across the border to Rwanda,

00:03:53.254 --> 00:03:57.060
where Congolese tantalum
is disguised as Rwandan.

00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.857
But don't throw away your phones yet,

00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:03.714
because the incredible irony

00:04:03.738 --> 00:04:07.082
is that the technology
that has placed such unsustainable,

00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:10.111
devastating demands on the Congo

00:04:10.135 --> 00:04:16.381
is the same technology that has brought
this situation to our attention.

00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:21.721
We only know so much about the situation
in the Congo and in the mines

00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:26.464
because of the kind of communication
the mobile phone allows.

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:30.503
As with the Arab Spring,

00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:33.864
during the recent elections in the Congo,

00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:39.937
voters were able to send text messages
of local polling stations

00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:43.429
to the headquarters
in the capital, Kinshasa.

00:04:44.673 --> 00:04:48.006
And in the wake of the result,

00:04:50.027 --> 00:04:53.724
the diaspora has joined
with the Carter Center,

00:04:53.748 --> 00:04:57.105
the Catholic Church and other observers,

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.644
to draw attention
to the undemocratic result.

00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:07.647
The mobile phone has given
people around the world

00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:11.948
an important tool towards gaining
their political freedom.

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:17.952
It has truly revolutionized the way
we communicate on the planet.

00:05:18.856 --> 00:05:23.136
It has allowed momentous
political change to take place.

00:05:24.572 --> 00:05:28.673
So, we are faced with a paradox.

00:05:30.503 --> 00:05:34.546
The mobile phone
is an instrument of freedom

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.667
and an instrument of oppression.

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:46.386
TED has always celebrated
what technology can do for us,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.941
technology in its finished form.

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:54.807
It is time to be asking questions
about technology.

00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:56.442
Where does it come from?

00:05:57.164 --> 00:05:58.418
Who makes it?

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:00.969
And for what?

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:05.982
Here, I am speaking directly to you,

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:07.745
the TED community,

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:11.561
and to all those who might
be watching on a screen,

00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:14.938
on your phone, across the world,

00:06:14.962 --> 00:06:16.318
in the Congo.

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:21.747
All the technology is in place
for us to communicate,

00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:25.434
and all the technology is in place
to communicate this.

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.635
At the moment,

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:34.147
there is no clear fair-trade solution.

00:06:35.287 --> 00:06:38.155
But there has been
a huge amount of progress.

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:42.295
The US has recently passed legislation

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.143
to target bribery
and misconduct in the Congo.

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:50.076
Recent UK legislation
could be used in the same way.

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:57.981
In February, Nokia unveiled its new policy
on sourcing minerals in the Congo,

00:06:58.005 --> 00:07:04.873
and there is a petition to Apple
to make a conflict-free iPhone.

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:10.853
There are campaigns spreading
across university campuses

00:07:10.877 --> 00:07:13.636
to make their colleges conflict-free.

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:15.795
But we're not there yet.

00:07:16.493 --> 00:07:22.512
We need to continue
mounting pressure on phone companies

00:07:22.536 --> 00:07:25.097
to change their sourcing processes.

00:07:26.506 --> 00:07:30.250
When I first came to the UK, 21 years ago,

00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:31.588
I was homesick.

00:07:32.643 --> 00:07:36.716
I missed my family
and the friends I left behind.

00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:40.842
Communication was extremely difficult.

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:45.171
Sending and receiving
letters took months --

00:07:45.195 --> 00:07:46.701
if you were lucky.

00:07:46.725 --> 00:07:48.454
Often, they never arrived.

00:07:50.172 --> 00:07:55.515
Even if I could have afforded
the phone bills home,

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:57.931
like most people in the Congo,

00:07:57.955 --> 00:08:00.970
my parents did not own a phone line.

00:08:01.986 --> 00:08:04.835
Today, my two sons --

00:08:08.408 --> 00:08:10.462
David and Daniel,

00:08:10.486 --> 00:08:15.052
can talk to my parents
and get to know them.

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:20.703
Why should we allow

00:08:20.727 --> 00:08:27.622
such a wonderful, brilliant
and necessary product

00:08:27.646 --> 00:08:31.581
to be the cause of unnecessary suffering

00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:32.795
for human beings?

00:08:34.732 --> 00:08:39.196
We demand fair-trade food
and fair-trade clothes.

00:08:39.632 --> 00:08:43.679
It is time to demand fair-trade phones.

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:47.194
This is an idea worth spreading.

00:08:47.853 --> 00:08:49.011
Thank you.

00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:55.467
(Applause)
