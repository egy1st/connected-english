WEBVTT

00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:03.994
It's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter)

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:06.876
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier

00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:08.408
and cheaper.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.578
By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence

00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:12.282
the three million bits of information

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.252
in your genome in less than a day

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.662
and for less than 1,000 euros.

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:20.492
Biotech is probably the most powerful

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:23.516
and the fastest-growing technology sector.

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:26.818
It has the power, potentially,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.035
to replace our fossil fuels,

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:31.252
to revolutionize medicine,

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:35.463
and to touch every aspect of our daily lives.

00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:39.295
So who gets to do it?

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:41.790
I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.062
this guy doing it.

00:00:45.062 --> 00:00:46.977
But what about

00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:49.849
that guy? (Laughter)

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.719
(Laughter)

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.193
In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.

00:00:57.193 --> 00:01:01.306
It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:03.387
accessible to everyone,

00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:07.026
not just scientists and people in government labs.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:10.566
The idea is that if you open up the science

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.369
and you allow diverse groups to participate,

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.062
it could really stimulate innovation.

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:17.868
Putting technology in the hands of the end user

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:21.057
is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:23.160
of what their needs are.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.297
And here's this really sophisticated technology

00:01:26.297 --> 00:01:29.041
coming down the road, all these associated

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:31.738
social, moral, ethical questions,

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:35.129
and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:39.011
just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.

00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:41.739
So wouldn't it be nice

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:44.175
if there was a place in your local neighborhood

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:46.755
where you could go and learn about this stuff,

00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:49.078
do it hands-on?

00:01:49.078 --> 00:01:50.593
I thought so.

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:52.473
So, three years ago, I got together

00:01:52.473 --> 00:01:56.010
with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.145
and we founded Genspace.

00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:01.601
It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:02.955
in Brooklyn, New York,

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:04.724
and the idea was people could come,

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:08.697
they could take classes and putter around in the lab

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:12.809
in a very open, friendly atmosphere.

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.450
None of my previous experience prepared me

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.795
for what came next. Can you guess?

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:21.523
The press started calling us.

00:02:21.523 --> 00:02:24.641
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.313
science literacy, the more they wanted to talk

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.441
about us creating the next Frankenstein,

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.446
and as a result, for the next six months,

00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:35.223
when you Googled my name,

00:02:35.223 --> 00:02:39.276
instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.

00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:40.854
["Am I a biohazard?"]

00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:42.987
(Laughter)

00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:44.778
It was pretty depressing.

00:02:44.778 --> 00:02:47.738
The only thing that got us through that period

00:02:47.738 --> 00:02:49.599
was that we knew that all over the world,

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.185
there were other people that were trying to do

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:53.121
the same thing that we were.

00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:55.625
They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.266
were facing much greater challenges than we did,

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:02.383
more regulations, less resources.

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:06.582
But now, three years later, here's where we stand.

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:11.000
It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.902
and this is just the beginning.

00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:14.963
These are some of the biggest ones,

00:03:14.963 --> 00:03:17.027
and there are others opening every day.

00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:19.898
There's one probably going to open up in Moscow,

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:21.197
one in South Korea,

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:23.523
and the cool thing is they each have their own

00:03:23.523 --> 00:03:25.306
individual flavor

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:27.630
that grew out of the community they came out of.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.769
Let me take you on a little tour.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.217
Biohackers work alone.

00:03:33.217 --> 00:03:35.777
We work in groups,

00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:40.162
in big cities — (Laughter) —

00:03:40.162 --> 00:03:42.832
and in small villages.

00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:45.600
We reverse engineer lab equipment.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.136
We genetically engineer bacteria.

00:03:48.136 --> 00:03:50.363
We hack hardware,

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.608
software,

00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:55.032
wetware,

00:03:55.032 --> 00:03:57.968
and, of course, the code of life.

00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:00.903
We like to build things.

00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:07.290
Then we like to take things apart.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.406
We make things grow.

00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:11.208
We make things glow.

00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:15.175
And we make cells dance.

00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:18.966
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive,

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.407
but, you know, sometimes when people think of us,

00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:25.434
the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety,

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:28.511
bio-security, all the dark side stuff.

00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:31.119
I'm not going to minimize those concerns.

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:34.916
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use,

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:36.133
and, you know, you get something like

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:39.983
synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology,

00:04:39.983 --> 00:04:42.607
it really compels you, you have to look at both

00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:46.020
the amateur groups but also the professional groups,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.471
because they have better infrastructure,

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:50.019
they have better facilities,

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:52.518
and they have access to pathogens.

00:04:52.518 --> 00:04:55.798
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently

00:04:55.798 --> 00:04:58.406
issued a report on this whole area,

00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:01.478
and what they concluded was the power of this technology

00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:05.330
for positive was much greater than the risk for negative,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.859
and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community,

00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:12.404
and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press

00:05:12.404 --> 00:05:16.428
had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:18.963
and underestimate our ethics.

00:05:18.963 --> 00:05:22.492
As a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world,

00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:25.222
America, Europe, got together last year,

00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:27.771
and we hammered out a common code of ethics.

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:31.131
That's a lot more than conventional science has done.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:34.779
Now, we follow state and local regulations.

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.775
We dispose of our waste properly, we follow

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:40.116
safety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.

00:05:40.116 --> 00:05:42.819
You know, if you're working with a pathogen,

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.363
you're not part of the biohacker community,

00:05:45.363 --> 00:05:48.516
you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.

00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:50.439
And sometimes people ask me,

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:52.326
"Well, what about an accident?"

00:05:52.326 --> 00:05:55.884
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally

00:05:55.884 --> 00:05:59.243
work with, the chance of an accident happening

00:05:59.243 --> 00:06:01.571
with somebody accidentally creating, like,

00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:03.217
some sort of superbug,

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:07.467
that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.539
in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.893
Now, it could happen,

00:06:10.893 --> 00:06:15.049
but I'm not going to plan my life around it.

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:17.979
I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.091
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.

00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:23.563
It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study,

00:06:23.563 --> 00:06:26.331
they're going to take my entire genomic sequence,

00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:30.003
all of my medical information, and my identity,

00:06:30.003 --> 00:06:34.145
and they're going to post it online for everyone to see.

00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:37.075
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about

00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:38.851
during the informed consent portion.

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:40.734
The one I liked the best is,

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:44.579
someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab,

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:46.873
synthesize some fake Ellen DNA,

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:50.947
and plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter)

00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:55.477
But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and

00:06:55.477 --> 00:06:58.623
the potential for good for a study like that

00:06:58.623 --> 00:07:00.675
far outweighs the risk.

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:03.076
Now, you might be asking yourself,

00:07:03.076 --> 00:07:06.513
"Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:09.842
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well,

00:07:09.842 --> 00:07:12.907
what would anyone do with a personal computer?"

00:07:12.907 --> 00:07:14.871
So this stuff is just beginning.

00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:18.747
We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.

00:07:18.747 --> 00:07:21.832
Let me show you what you could do right now.

00:07:21.832 --> 00:07:25.667
A biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:28.901
whose dog was leaving little presents on his street?

00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:31.811
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:34.517
Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls

00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:37.779
to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva,

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:41.673
identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.

00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:47.949
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:51.253
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.

00:07:51.253 --> 00:07:53.193
Looked like a ladybug, right?

00:07:53.193 --> 00:07:55.241
It actually is a Japanese beetle.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.152
And the same kind of technology --

00:07:57.152 --> 00:07:59.236
it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool --

00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:04.102
You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga,

00:08:04.102 --> 00:08:07.335
if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese

00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:10.749
that you paid so much for is really goat's.

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:14.650
In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.942
for mutations.

00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:19.166
You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's,

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:22.084
and you can explore your ancestry.

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:24.441
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere,

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:28.063
collect microbes, see what's up there.

00:08:28.063 --> 00:08:30.494
You can make a biocensor out of yeast

00:08:30.494 --> 00:08:32.681
to detect pollutants in water.

00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:36.313
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell.

00:08:36.313 --> 00:08:38.606
You can do a lot of things.

00:08:38.606 --> 00:08:41.996
You can also do an art science project. Some of these

00:08:41.996 --> 00:08:45.637
are really spectacular, and they look at social,

00:08:45.637 --> 00:08:48.323
ecological problems from a completely different perspective.

00:08:48.323 --> 00:08:49.885
It's really cool.

00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:52.903
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved?

00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:56.998
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.

00:08:56.998 --> 00:08:59.526
The thing is, there's something in these labs

00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:02.185
that they have to offer society that you can't find

00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:04.152
anywhere else.

00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:06.830
There's something sacred about a space where

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.342
you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify

00:09:09.342 --> 00:09:12.216
to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money,

00:09:12.216 --> 00:09:15.471
that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:18.398
It just has to follow safety guidelines.

00:09:18.398 --> 00:09:21.254
If you had spaces like this all over the world,

00:09:21.254 --> 00:09:23.486
it could really change the perception

00:09:23.486 --> 00:09:26.018
of who's allowed to do biotech.

00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:29.710
It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.126
Why not personal biotech?

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:34.503
If everyone in this room got involved,

00:09:34.503 --> 00:09:36.251
who knows what we could do?

00:09:36.251 --> 00:09:40.011
This is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn,

00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:43.291
you ain't seen nothin' yet. (Laughter)

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:47.261
(Applause)
