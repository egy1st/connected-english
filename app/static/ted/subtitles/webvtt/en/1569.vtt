WEBVTT

00:00:00.707 --> 00:00:06.105
So I want to start by offering you
a free no-tech life hack,

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.726
and all it requires of you is this:

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.913
that you change your posture
for two minutes.

00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:16.337
But before I give it away,
I want to ask you to right now

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.930
do a little audit of your body
and what you're doing with your body.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.645
So how many of you are
sort of making yourselves smaller?

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.990
Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,
maybe wrapping your ankles.

00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:29.729
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.

00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:33.400
Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:35.672
I see you.

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:38.687
So I want you to pay attention
to what you're doing right now.

00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:41.045
We're going to come back
to that in a few minutes,

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:43.993
and I'm hoping that if you learn
to tweak this a little bit,

00:00:44.017 --> 00:00:47.429
it could significantly change
the way your life unfolds.

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:51.953
So, we're really fascinated
with body language,

00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:55.876
and we're particularly interested
in other people's body language.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.097
You know, we're interested in,
like, you know — (Laughter) —

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:04.495
an awkward interaction, or a smile,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.727
or a contemptuous glance,
or maybe a very awkward wink,

00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:11.965
or maybe even something like a handshake.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.314
Narrator: Here they are
arriving at Number 10.

00:01:15.338 --> 00:01:19.807
This lucky policeman gets to shake hands
with the President of the United States.

00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:24.734
Here comes the Prime Minister --
No. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:27.409
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:31.116
Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,
or the lack of a handshake,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.640
can have us talking for weeks
and weeks and weeks.

00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:35.780
Even the BBC and The New York Times.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:39.731
So obviously when we think
about nonverbal behavior,

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:43.119
or body language -- but we call it
nonverbals as social scientists --

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:45.999
it's language, so we think
about communication.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:49.026
When we think about communication,
we think about interactions.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.465
So what is your body language
communicating to me?

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.531
What's mine communicating to you?

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:59.503
And there's a lot of reason to believe
that this is a valid way to look at this.

00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:01.771
So social scientists
have spent a lot of time

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:03.876
looking at the effects
of our body language,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.185
or other people's body language,
on judgments.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.624
And we make sweeping judgments
and inferences from body language.

00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:13.614
And those judgments can predict
really meaningful life outcomes

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:17.407
like who we hire or promote,
who we ask out on a date.

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:22.092
For example, Nalini Ambady,
a researcher at Tufts University,

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:26.564
shows that when people watch
30-second soundless clips

00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:29.588
of real physician-patient interactions,

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:32.421
their judgments
of the physician's niceness

00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:35.058
predict whether or not
that physician will be sued.

00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:36.740
So it doesn't have to do so much

00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:39.263
with whether or not that physician
was incompetent,

00:02:39.287 --> 00:02:42.093
but do we like that person
and how they interacted?

00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:45.028
Even more dramatic,
Alex Todorov at Princeton

00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:48.705
has shown us that judgments
of political candidates' faces

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:52.673
in just one second predict 70 percent

00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:56.523
of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial
race outcomes,

00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:58.745
and even, let's go digital,

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.890
emoticons used well in online negotiations

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:05.722
can lead you to claim more value
from that negotiation.

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:08.945
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.042
So when we think of nonverbals,
we think of how we judge others,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.944
how they judge us
and what the outcomes are.

00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:17.064
We tend to forget, though,
the other audience

00:03:17.088 --> 00:03:20.499
that's influenced by our nonverbals,
and that's ourselves.

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:23.712
We are also influenced by our nonverbals,

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.075
our thoughts and our feelings
and our physiology.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.138
So what nonverbals am I talking about?

00:03:29.162 --> 00:03:32.081
I'm a social psychologist.
I study prejudice,

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:34.808
and I teach at a competitive
business school,

00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:39.292
so it was inevitable that I would become
interested in power dynamics.

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:43.104
I became especially interested
in nonverbal expressions

00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:45.107
of power and dominance.

00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:47.846
And what are nonverbal expressions
of power and dominance?

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.929
Well, this is what they are.

00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:52.807
So in the animal kingdom,
they are about expanding.

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:55.817
So you make yourself big, you stretch out,

00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:58.758
you take up space,
you're basically opening up.

00:03:58.782 --> 00:04:00.704
It's about opening up.

00:04:00.728 --> 00:04:03.459
And this is true
across the animal kingdom.

00:04:03.483 --> 00:04:05.508
It's not just limited to primates.

00:04:06.244 --> 00:04:08.928
And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)

00:04:08.952 --> 00:04:12.639
So they do this both when they have
power sort of chronically,

00:04:12.663 --> 00:04:15.640
and also when they're feeling
powerful in the moment.

00:04:15.664 --> 00:04:18.712
And this one is especially interesting
because it really shows us

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:22.734
how universal and old these
expressions of power are.

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.333
This expression, which is known as pride,

00:04:25.357 --> 00:04:27.586
Jessica Tracy has studied.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.493
She shows that people
who are born with sight

00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:33.434
and people who are congenitally
blind do this

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:35.748
when they win at a physical competition.

00:04:35.772 --> 00:04:38.226
So when they cross
the finish line and they've won,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.727
it doesn't matter if they've never
seen anyone do it.

00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:42.044
They do this.

00:04:42.068 --> 00:04:44.566
So the arms up in the V,
the chin is slightly lifted.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.653
What do we do when we feel powerless?

00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.432
We do exactly the opposite.

00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:50.960
We close up.
We wrap ourselves up.

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:52.328
We make ourselves small.

00:04:52.352 --> 00:04:54.708
We don't want to bump
into the person next to us.

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:57.465
So again, both animals and humans
do the same thing.

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:01.445
And this is what happens
when you put together high and low power.

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.571
So what we tend to
do when it comes to power

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:07.224
is that we complement
the other's nonverbals.

00:05:07.248 --> 00:05:09.655
So if someone is being
really powerful with us,

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:12.299
we tend to make ourselves smaller.
We don't mirror them.

00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:13.913
We do the opposite of them.

00:05:13.937 --> 00:05:17.112
So I'm watching this behavior
in the classroom,

00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:19.649
and what do I notice?

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:26.902
I notice that MBA students really exhibit
the full range of power nonverbals.

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.450
So you have people
who are like caricatures of alphas,

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:32.855
really coming into the room, they get
right into the middle of the room

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.292
before class even starts,
like they really want to occupy space.

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:38.555
When they sit down,
they're sort of spread out.

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:40.313
They raise their hands like this.

00:05:40.337 --> 00:05:42.948
You have other people
who are virtually collapsing

00:05:42.972 --> 00:05:45.472
when they come in.
As soon they come in, you see it.

00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:47.765
You see it on their faces
and their bodies,

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.583
and they sit in their chair
and they make themselves tiny,

00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:52.945
and they go like this
when they raise their hand.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.827
I notice a couple of things about this.

00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.661
One, you're not going to be surprised.

00:05:56.685 --> 00:05:58.703
It seems to be related to gender.

00:05:58.727 --> 00:06:04.168
So women are much more likely
to do this kind of thing than men.

00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:06.754
Women feel chronically
less powerful than men,

00:06:06.778 --> 00:06:08.636
so this is not surprising.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.709
But the other thing I noticed

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:13.375
is that it also seemed
to be related to the extent

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:17.235
to which the students were participating,
and how well they were participating.

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.817
And this is really important
in the MBA classroom,

00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:22.498
because participation
counts for half the grade.

00:06:22.522 --> 00:06:26.971
So business schools have been struggling
with this gender grade gap.

00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:30.243
You get these equally qualified
women and men coming in

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:32.410
and then you get
these differences in grades,

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:35.499
and it seems to be partly
attributable to participation.

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:38.522
So I started to wonder, you know, okay,

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:42.164
so you have these people coming in
like this, and they're participating.

00:06:42.188 --> 00:06:44.717
Is it possible that we could
get people to fake it

00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:46.741
and would it lead them
to participate more?

00:06:46.765 --> 00:06:51.354
So my main collaborator
Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:54.909
and I really wanted to know,
can you fake it till you make it?

00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:57.460
Like, can you do this
just for a little while

00:06:57.484 --> 00:07:00.136
and actually experience
a behavioral outcome

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.862
that makes you seem more powerful?

00:07:01.886 --> 00:07:05.314
So we know that our nonverbals
govern how other people

00:07:05.338 --> 00:07:07.719
think and feel about us.
There's a lot of evidence.

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:09.165
But our question really was,

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:13.229
do our nonverbals govern
how we think and feel about ourselves?

00:07:13.253 --> 00:07:15.919
There's some evidence that they do.

00:07:15.943 --> 00:07:20.555
So, for example, we smile
when we feel happy,

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:22.733
but also, when we're forced to smile

00:07:22.757 --> 00:07:27.148
by holding a pen in our teeth
like this, it makes us feel happy.

00:07:27.172 --> 00:07:29.090
So it goes both ways.

00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:32.896
When it comes to power,
it also goes both ways.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.444
So when you feel powerful,

00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:37.239
you're more likely to do this,

00:07:37.263 --> 00:07:43.441
but it's also possible
that when you pretend to be powerful,

00:07:43.465 --> 00:07:46.864
you are more likely
to actually feel powerful.

00:07:46.888 --> 00:07:49.924
So the second question
really was, you know,

00:07:49.948 --> 00:07:52.507
so we know that our minds
change our bodies,

00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:56.924
but is it also true
that our bodies change our minds?

00:07:56.948 --> 00:07:59.651
And when I say minds,
in the case of the powerful,

00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:01.023
what am I talking about?

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:03.189
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings

00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:06.785
and the sort of physiological things
that make up our thoughts and feelings,

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:09.852
and in my case, that's hormones.
I look at hormones.

00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:14.186
So what do the minds of the powerful
versus the powerless look like?

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.482
So powerful people tend to be,
not surprisingly,

00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:22.706
more assertive and more confident,
more optimistic.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.016
They actually feel they're going to win
even at games of chance.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.884
They also tend to be able
to think more abstractly.

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:32.528
So there are a lot of differences.
They take more risks.

00:08:32.552 --> 00:08:35.791
There are a lot of differences
between powerful and powerless people.

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.635
Physiologically,
there also are differences

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.700
on two key hormones: testosterone,
which is the dominance hormone,

00:08:42.724 --> 00:08:46.394
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.

00:08:46.418 --> 00:08:53.539
So what we find is that high-power
alpha males in primate hierarchies

00:08:53.563 --> 00:08:56.737
have high testosterone and low cortisol,

00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:59.669
and powerful and effective leaders

00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:02.518
also have high testosterone
and low cortisol.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.923
So what does that mean?
When you think about power,

00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:07.246
people tended to think
only about testosterone,

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.034
because that was about dominance.

00:09:09.058 --> 00:09:12.504
But really, power is also about
how you react to stress.

00:09:12.528 --> 00:09:15.633
So do you want the high-power
leader that's dominant,

00:09:15.657 --> 00:09:18.375
high on testosterone,
but really stress reactive?

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.940
Probably not, right?

00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:22.994
You want the person who's powerful
and assertive and dominant,

00:09:23.018 --> 00:09:26.682
but not very stress reactive,
the person who's laid back.

00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:31.832
So we know that in primate hierarchies,

00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:34.924
if an alpha needs to take over,

00:09:34.948 --> 00:09:39.162
if an individual needs to take over
an alpha role sort of suddenly,

00:09:39.186 --> 00:09:42.273
within a few days,
that individual's testosterone has gone up

00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:45.778
significantly and his cortisol
has dropped significantly.

00:09:45.802 --> 00:09:48.819
So we have this evidence,
both that the body can shape

00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:51.185
the mind, at least at the facial level,

00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:55.314
and also that role changes
can shape the mind.

00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:58.096
So what happens, okay,
you take a role change,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.680
what happens if you do that
at a really minimal level,

00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:03.133
like this tiny manipulation,
this tiny intervention?

00:10:03.157 --> 00:10:05.967
"For two minutes," you say,
"I want you to stand like this,

00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:08.527
and it's going to make you feel
more powerful."

00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:11.481
So this is what we did.

00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:16.096
We decided to bring people into the lab
and run a little experiment,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.645
and these people adopted, for two minutes,

00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:23.129
either high-power poses
or low-power poses,

00:10:23.153 --> 00:10:25.470
and I'm just going to show
you five of the poses,

00:10:25.494 --> 00:10:27.055
although they took on only two.

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:28.559
So here's one.

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:31.098
A couple more.

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:36.545
This one has been dubbed
the "Wonder Woman" by the media.

00:10:36.646 --> 00:10:37.944
Here are a couple more.

00:10:37.968 --> 00:10:40.298
So you can be standing
or you can be sitting.

00:10:40.322 --> 00:10:42.283
And here are the low-power poses.

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:45.037
So you're folding up,
you're making yourself small.

00:10:46.644 --> 00:10:48.085
This one is very low-power.

00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:52.068
When you're touching your neck,
you're really protecting yourself.

00:10:52.092 --> 00:10:54.089
So this is what happens.

00:10:54.207 --> 00:10:56.413
They come in, they spit into a vial,

00:10:56.437 --> 00:10:59.586
for two minutes, we say,
"You need to do this or this."

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.651
They don't look at pictures of the poses.

00:11:01.675 --> 00:11:04.202
We don't want to prime them
with a concept of power.

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:05.859
We want them to be feeling power.

00:11:05.883 --> 00:11:07.218
So two minutes they do this.

00:11:07.242 --> 00:11:10.427
We then ask them, "How powerful
do you feel?" on a series of items,

00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:12.794
and then we give them
an opportunity to gamble,

00:11:12.818 --> 00:11:15.559
and then we take another saliva sample.

00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:17.441
That's it. That's the whole experiment.

00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:19.026
So this is what we find.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.930
Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,

00:11:20.954 --> 00:11:25.068
we find that when you are
in the high-power pose condition,

00:11:25.092 --> 00:11:27.226
86 percent of you will gamble.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.346
When you're in the low-power
pose condition,

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.346
only 60 percent, and that's
a whopping significant difference.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.826
Here's what we find on testosterone.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.363
From their baseline when they come in,

00:11:38.387 --> 00:11:41.693
high-power people experience
about a 20-percent increase,

00:11:41.717 --> 00:11:46.314
and low-power people experience
about a 10-percent decrease.

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:49.131
So again, two minutes,
and you get these changes.

00:11:49.155 --> 00:11:51.132
Here's what you get on cortisol.

00:11:51.156 --> 00:11:54.930
High-power people experience
about a 25-percent decrease,

00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:59.062
and the low-power people experience
about a 15-percent increase.

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:01.794
So two minutes lead
to these hormonal changes

00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:03.438
that configure your brain

00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:07.739
to basically be either assertive,
confident and comfortable,

00:12:07.763 --> 00:12:12.816
or really stress-reactive,
and feeling sort of shut down.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.603
And we've all had the feeling, right?

00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:20.811
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern
how we think and feel about ourselves,

00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:23.267
so it's not just others,
but it's also ourselves.

00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.694
Also, our bodies change our minds.

00:12:25.718 --> 00:12:28.100
But the next question, of course,

00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:29.944
is, can power posing for a few minutes

00:12:29.968 --> 00:12:32.005
really change your life
in meaningful ways?

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:36.322
This is in the lab, it's this little task,
it's just a couple of minutes.

00:12:36.346 --> 00:12:38.087
Where can you actually apply this?

00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:39.922
Which we cared about, of course.

00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:46.687
And so we think where you want to use this
is evaluative situations,

00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:49.164
like social threat situations.

00:12:49.188 --> 00:12:51.744
Where are you being evaluated,
either by your friends?

00:12:51.768 --> 00:12:53.825
For teenagers,
it's at the lunchroom table.

00:12:53.849 --> 00:12:58.122
For some people it's speaking
at a school board meeting.

00:12:58.146 --> 00:13:01.910
It might be giving a pitch
or giving a talk like this

00:13:01.934 --> 00:13:04.708
or doing a job interview.

00:13:04.732 --> 00:13:07.400
We decided that the one
that most people could relate to

00:13:07.424 --> 00:13:10.319
because most people had been through,
was the job interview.

00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:13.074
So we published these findings,

00:13:13.098 --> 00:13:14.659
and the media are all over it,

00:13:14.683 --> 00:13:16.758
and they say, Okay, so this is what you do

00:13:16.782 --> 00:13:18.855
when you go in
for the job interview, right?

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.886
(Laughter)

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.357
You know, so we were of course
horrified, and said,

00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:24.653
Oh my God, no,
that's not what we meant at all.

00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:26.917
For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.

00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:29.508
Again, this is not about you
talking to other people.

00:13:29.532 --> 00:13:31.093
It's you talking to yourself.

00:13:31.117 --> 00:13:34.176
What do you do before you go
into a job interview? You do this.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.742
You're sitting down.
You're looking at your iPhone --

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:39.028
or your Android, not trying
to leave anyone out.

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:40.922
You're looking at your notes,

00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:42.946
you're hunching up, making yourself small,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.399
when really what you should
be doing maybe is this,

00:13:45.423 --> 00:13:48.460
like, in the bathroom, right?
Do that. Find two minutes.

00:13:48.484 --> 00:13:50.246
So that's what we want to test. Okay?

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.064
So we bring people into a lab,

00:13:52.088 --> 00:13:55.441
and they do either high-
or low-power poses again,

00:13:55.465 --> 00:13:58.073
they go through
a very stressful job interview.

00:13:58.097 --> 00:14:01.689
It's five minutes long.
They are being recorded.

00:14:01.713 --> 00:14:03.670
They're being judged also,

00:14:03.694 --> 00:14:08.175
and the judges are trained
to give no nonverbal feedback,

00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:09.758
so they look like this.

00:14:09.985 --> 00:14:12.066
Imagine this is the person
interviewing you.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.689
So for five minutes, nothing,
and this is worse than being heckled.

00:14:16.713 --> 00:14:18.353
People hate this.

00:14:18.377 --> 00:14:22.093
It's what Marianne LaFrance calls
"standing in social quicksand."

00:14:22.117 --> 00:14:23.902
So this really spikes your cortisol.

00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:26.212
So this is the job interview
we put them through,

00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:28.433
because we really wanted
to see what happened.

00:14:28.457 --> 00:14:31.540
We then have these coders look
at these tapes, four of them.

00:14:31.564 --> 00:14:34.712
They're blind to the hypothesis.
They're blind to the conditions.

00:14:34.736 --> 00:14:37.497
They have no idea
who's been posing in what pose,

00:14:37.521 --> 00:14:42.587
and they end up looking
at these sets of tapes,

00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:44.759
and they say,
"We want to hire these people,"

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.284
all the high-power posers.

00:14:46.308 --> 00:14:48.081
"We don't want to hire these people.

00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:51.922
We also evaluate these people
much more positively overall."

00:14:51.946 --> 00:14:53.586
But what's driving it?

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.602
It's not about the content of the speech.

00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:58.478
It's about the presence
that they're bringing to the speech.

00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:00.979
Because we rate them
on all these variables

00:15:01.003 --> 00:15:04.542
related to competence,
like, how well-structured is the speech?

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:06.800
How good is it?
What are their qualifications?

00:15:06.824 --> 00:15:09.450
No effect on those things.
This is what's affected.

00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:11.173
These kinds of things.

00:15:11.197 --> 00:15:13.588
People are bringing
their true selves, basically.

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:15.002
They're bringing themselves.

00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:17.125
They bring their ideas, but as themselves,

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:19.361
with no, you know, residue over them.

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:24.292
So this is what's driving the effect,
or mediating the effect.

00:15:24.316 --> 00:15:27.660
So when I tell people about this,

00:15:27.684 --> 00:15:31.039
that our bodies change our minds
and our minds can change our behavior,

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:33.815
and our behavior can change
our outcomes, they say to me,

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.382
"It feels fake." Right?

00:15:35.406 --> 00:15:37.284
So I said, fake it till you make it.

00:15:37.308 --> 00:15:39.161
It's not me.

00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:42.336
I don't want to get there
and then still feel like a fraud.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.170
I don't want to feel like an impostor.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:48.267
I don't want to get there only to feel
like I'm not supposed to be here.

00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:50.454
And that really resonated with me,

00:15:50.478 --> 00:15:53.700
because I want to tell you
a little story about being an impostor

00:15:53.724 --> 00:15:55.922
and feeling like
I'm not supposed to be here.

00:15:55.946 --> 00:15:58.863
When I was 19, I was
in a really bad car accident.

00:15:58.887 --> 00:16:02.268
I was thrown out of a car,
rolled several times.

00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:04.150
I was thrown from the car.

00:16:04.174 --> 00:16:07.138
And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,

00:16:07.162 --> 00:16:09.371
and I had been withdrawn from college,

00:16:09.395 --> 00:16:15.083
and I learned that my IQ had dropped
by two standard deviations,

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.671
which was very traumatic.

00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:20.542
I knew my IQ because
I had identified with being smart,

00:16:20.566 --> 00:16:22.554
and I had been called gifted as a child.

00:16:22.578 --> 00:16:25.754
So I'm taken out of college,
I keep trying to go back.

00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:27.978
They say, "You're not going
to finish college.

00:16:28.002 --> 00:16:30.555
Just, you know, there are other
things for you to do,

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:32.579
but that's not going to work out for you."

00:16:32.603 --> 00:16:36.137
So I really struggled
with this, and I have to say,

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.911
having your identity taken
from you, your core identity,

00:16:38.935 --> 00:16:40.770
and for me it was being smart,

00:16:40.794 --> 00:16:42.433
having that taken from you,

00:16:42.457 --> 00:16:45.556
there's nothing that leaves you feeling
more powerless than that.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.359
So I felt entirely powerless.

00:16:47.383 --> 00:16:49.245
I worked and worked, and I got lucky,

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:51.115
and worked, and got lucky, and worked.

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:53.367
Eventually I graduated from college.

00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:55.391
It took me four years
longer than my peers,

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:59.732
and I convinced someone,
my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,

00:16:59.756 --> 00:17:02.676
to take me on,
and so I ended up at Princeton,

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.527
and I was like,
I am not supposed to be here.

00:17:05.551 --> 00:17:06.821
I am an impostor.

00:17:06.845 --> 00:17:08.750
And the night before my first-year talk,

00:17:08.774 --> 00:17:12.273
and the first-year talk at Princeton
is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.475
That's it.

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.962
I was so afraid of being
found out the next day

00:17:15.986 --> 00:17:18.775
that I called her
and said, "I'm quitting."

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:20.631
She was like, "You are not quitting,

00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:23.189
because I took a gamble
on you, and you're staying.

00:17:23.213 --> 00:17:25.980
You're going to stay, and this is
what you're going to do.

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.337
You are going to fake it.

00:17:27.361 --> 00:17:30.517
You're going to do every talk
that you ever get asked to do.

00:17:30.541 --> 00:17:32.780
You're just going to do it
and do it and do it,

00:17:32.804 --> 00:17:35.225
even if you're terrified
and just paralyzed

00:17:35.249 --> 00:17:37.598
and having an out-of-body experience,

00:17:37.622 --> 00:17:40.968
until you have this moment where you say,
'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.

00:17:40.992 --> 00:17:43.934
Like, I have become this.
I am actually doing this.'"

00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.053
So that's what I did.

00:17:45.077 --> 00:17:46.461
Five years in grad school,

00:17:46.485 --> 00:17:48.585
a few years, you know,
I'm at Northwestern,

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:50.672
I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,

00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:54.672
I'm not really thinking about it anymore,
but for a long time I had been thinking,

00:17:54.696 --> 00:17:56.478
"Not supposed to be here."

00:17:56.502 --> 00:17:59.195
So at the end of my first year at Harvard,

00:17:59.219 --> 00:18:03.520
a student who had not talked
in class the entire semester,

00:18:03.544 --> 00:18:07.211
who I had said, "Look, you've gotta
participate or else you're going to fail,"

00:18:07.235 --> 00:18:09.759
came into my office.
I really didn't know her at all.

00:18:09.783 --> 00:18:13.211
She came in totally defeated,
and she said,

00:18:13.235 --> 00:18:16.361
"I'm not supposed to be here."

00:18:20.111 --> 00:18:22.068
And that was the moment for me.

00:18:22.092 --> 00:18:23.684
Because two things happened.

00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:24.978
One was that I realized,

00:18:25.002 --> 00:18:28.112
oh my gosh,
I don't feel like that anymore.

00:18:28.136 --> 00:18:31.136
I don't feel that anymore,
but she does, and I get that feeling.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.431
And the second was,
she is supposed to be here!

00:18:33.455 --> 00:18:35.408
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.

00:18:35.432 --> 00:18:38.975
So I was like, "Yes, you are!
You are supposed to be here!

00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:40.761
And tomorrow you're going to fake it,

00:18:40.785 --> 00:18:43.474
you're going to make yourself
powerful, and, you know --

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:48.891
(Applause)

00:18:48.915 --> 00:18:52.969
And you're going to go
into the classroom,

00:18:52.993 --> 00:18:55.393
and you are going to give
the best comment ever."

00:18:55.417 --> 00:18:58.398
You know? And she gave
the best comment ever,

00:18:58.422 --> 00:19:00.361
and people turned around and were like,

00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:03.305
oh my God, I didn't even notice her
sitting there. (Laughter)

00:19:03.329 --> 00:19:05.122
She comes back to me months later,

00:19:05.146 --> 00:19:08.186
and I realized that she had not just
faked it till she made it,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.584
she had actually faked it
till she became it.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.407
So she had changed.

00:19:12.431 --> 00:19:16.491
And so I want to say to you,
don't fake it till you make it.

00:19:16.515 --> 00:19:19.288
Fake it till you become it.

00:19:19.312 --> 00:19:22.929
Do it enough until you actually
become it and internalize.

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.584
The last thing I'm going
to leave you with is this.

00:19:25.608 --> 00:19:30.056
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.553
So, this is two minutes.

00:19:32.577 --> 00:19:34.387
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.

00:19:34.411 --> 00:19:37.535
Before you go into the next stressful
evaluative situation,

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:40.241
for two minutes, try doing this,
in the elevator,

00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:43.480
in a bathroom stall, at your desk
behind closed doors.

00:19:43.504 --> 00:19:44.907
That's what you want to do.

00:19:44.931 --> 00:19:47.742
Configure your brain
to cope the best in that situation.

00:19:47.766 --> 00:19:50.707
Get your testosterone up.
Get your cortisol down.

00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:54.673
Don't leave that situation feeling
like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.

00:19:54.697 --> 00:19:56.397
Leave that situation feeling like,

00:19:56.421 --> 00:19:59.393
I really feel like I got to say
who I am and show who I am.

00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:05.184
So I want to ask you first, you know,
both to try power posing,

00:20:05.208 --> 00:20:10.298
and also I want to ask you to share
the science, because this is simple.

00:20:10.322 --> 00:20:12.475
I don't have ego involved in this.
(Laughter)

00:20:12.499 --> 00:20:14.262
Give it away. Share it with people,

00:20:14.286 --> 00:20:16.706
because the people who can use it the most

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.081
are the ones with no resources
and no technology

00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:22.279
and no status and no power.

00:20:22.303 --> 00:20:24.851
Give it to them
because they can do it in private.

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:27.319
They need their bodies,
privacy and two minutes,

00:20:27.343 --> 00:20:30.469
and it can significantly change
the outcomes of their life.

00:20:30.493 --> 00:20:31.624
Thank you.

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:34.679
(Applause)
