00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
given away most everything that I owned,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and arrived with all the essentials --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because I was going to save the world,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I thought I would just start with the African continent.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
thank you very much, least of all not by me.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I was too young, unmarried, I had no children,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
meaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that was run by 20 prostitutes.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and how what we call people so often distances us from them,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and makes them little.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
who essentially spent 600 dollars a month

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and we run this as a business and I'll help you."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
things are always harder than you think they're going to be.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and we clearly aren't the A-Team here,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
so let's -- I did all this training.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and I sold all these little doughnuts to people,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and I came back, and I was like, "You see?"

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
(Laughter) -- it's a good point.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So then I went the whole American way,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And they started listening to the marketplace,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and sorghum bread, and before you knew it,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
we had cornered the Kigali market,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and the women were earning three to four times the national average.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
"Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine."

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But they wouldn't give me an answer.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?"

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So, blue, blue, everything became blue.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The walls were blue, the windows were blue,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the sidewalk out front was painted blue.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the women's hips were swaying

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And at the end of it, we stood across the street

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And the women said, "It really is."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And I said, "And I think the color is perfect,"

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and I said, "What?"

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
(Laughter)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
-- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
it's really hard to say what you mean.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And, mostly because people never really ask you,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
but it's also learning how better to ask questions.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and it was an extraordinary time in my life.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And it taught me three lessons

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that I think are so important for us today,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and certainly in the work that I do.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and that is fundamental to dignity.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But as human beings, we also want to see each other,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The second is that traditional charity and aid

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
are never going to solve the problems of poverty.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
which is that markets alone also

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
are not going to solve the problems of poverty.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Yes, we ran this as a business,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and, maybe most important of all,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of investment and philanthropy.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
even health should be privatized.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But, having had a father with heart disease,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and realizing that what our family could afford

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
was not what he should have gotten,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and having a good friend step in to help,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I really believe that all people deserve access to health

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
at prices they can afford.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I think the market can help us figure that out,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but there's got to be a charitable component,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
build Acumen Fund about six years ago.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
a few oxymorons in one sentence.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
in both for-profit and nonprofit entities

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
to low income people in South Asia and Africa,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
so that they can make their own choices.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and delivered tens of millions of services to people

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
who otherwise would not be able to afford them.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
who are committed to service, and who really know the markets.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and both of them, because they're manufacturers,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
because they're in the malaria sector,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
These are old-hand farmers

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
in Kenya over the last 30 years.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant;

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
it's the basic component for artemisinin,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which is the best-known treatment for malaria.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It's indigenous to China and the Far East,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
because it's a high value-add product."

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that actually got below market returns

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and was willing to go the long haul and be combined

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
with management assistance, strategic assistance --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So that's about 50,000 people affected.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And I think some of you may have visited --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
who help them become more self-sufficient.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
who has a real interest in getting the powder

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
so that they can make Coartem.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
both on looking at a new business plan,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and what does expansion look like, helping with management support

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and helping to do term sheets and raise capital.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
in the last month or so. Because the company was literally

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
10 days away from proving that the product they produced

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And we called all of the social investors we know.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and understand the importance of agriculture,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and they even helped the farmers.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And even when we explained that if ABE goes away,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
all those 7,500 jobs go away too,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
This is Samuel. He's a farmer.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
He was actually living in the Kibera slums

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
they now have seven acres under cultivation.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Samuel's kids are in private school,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
dignity being more important than wealth.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
The next one, many of you know.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And this is really a story about a public-private solution

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that has really worked.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
so you could create a bed net,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Acumen came in with the patient capital,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
that we would all partner with here in Africa,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and Exxon provided the initial resin.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in A to Z manufacturing company.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
to work with malaria.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And, long story short, again, they've been so successful.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
because it's not long-term sustainable.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It's a company with one big customer.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And so, Anuj and Acumen

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
have been talking about testing the private sector,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
look, in a country like Tanzania,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And we said, "Well, there's another option.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We can start building local distribution,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and actually, it can cost the public sector much less."

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
One, that people will pay different prices,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and make a decision to buy it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
about what they like and what they don't like.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
because of the patient capital,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
we have a choice.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
costing the public sector another six dollars a net,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
that might, over time, start sustaining itself.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
We've got to start having conversations like this,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
but also to bring other people to the table around it.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
didn't have very much education.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
who was a cement hauler,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
worked hard every day, understood what suffering was,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
had a deep faith in God, loved her children

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and would never have accepted a handout.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and she lived in a society that provided the safety

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
of having access to affordable health and education,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
her children and their children were able to live

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
there are a lot of us --

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and I think about all the people across this continent

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
who are working hard every day,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and that they also can believe and get access to services,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
It shouldn't be that difficult.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
to essentially refuse trite assumptions,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
get out of our ideological boxes.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
to service as well as to success.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It takes opening your arms, both, wide,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and expecting very little love in return,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
but demanding accountability,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and bringing the accountability to the table as well.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And most of all, most of all,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
local or diaspora, left or right,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
to really start listening to each other.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Thank you.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:05.000
(Applause)
