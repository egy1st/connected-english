00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:06.612
So, this is my grandfather,

00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:08.113
Salman Schocken,

00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:12.550
who was born into a poor and uneducated family

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.987
with six children to feed,

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:19.683
and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:23.643
drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:27.063
He never went back to school.

00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:31.210
Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.318
of department stores.

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:36.571
Salman was the consummate perfectionist,

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.135
and every one of his stores was a jewel

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:41.064
of Bauhaus architecture.

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:44.254
He was also the ultimate self-learner,

00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:47.157
and like everything else, he did it in grand style.

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:49.845
He surrounded himself with an entourage

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:53.232
of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:56.371
and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka,

00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.296
and he paid each one of them a monthly salary

00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:02.347
so that they could write in peace.

00:01:02.347 --> 00:01:07.284
And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming.

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:10.598
He fled Germany, together with his family,

00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:12.687
leaving everything else behind.

00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:15.897
His department stores confiscated,

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:18.986
he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit

00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:21.455
of art and culture.

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:23.394
This high school dropout

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:25.674
died at the age of 82,

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:29.803
a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO

00:01:29.803 --> 00:01:31.948
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:33.712
and founder of Schocken Books,

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:37.083
an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:38.753
by Random House.

00:01:38.753 --> 00:01:42.729
Such is the power of self-study.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.245
And these are my parents.

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:49.292
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:53.263
They were too busy building a family and a country.

00:01:53.263 --> 00:01:57.291
And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong,

00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.049
tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.212
with thousands of books, records and artwork.

00:02:05.212 --> 00:02:07.608
I remember quite vividly my father telling me

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:12.440
that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.058
then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio. (Laughter)

00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:20.087
And that's me,

00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:21.811
I was going to say holding my first abacus,

00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:24.822
but actually holding what my father would consider

00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:27.774
an ample substitute to an iPad. (Laughter)

00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:31.436
So one thing that I took from home is this notion

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:34.277
that educators don't necessarily have to teach.

00:02:34.277 --> 00:02:37.506
Instead, they can provide an environment and resources

00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:42.654
that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own.

00:02:42.654 --> 00:02:46.748
Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment:

00:02:46.748 --> 00:02:50.068
these are the virtues of a great education.

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:54.263
So I'd like to share with you a story about a self-study,

00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:56.817
self-empowering computer science course

00:02:56.817 --> 00:03:01.003
that I built, together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.

00:03:01.003 --> 00:03:03.760
As you can see from the pictures, both Noam and I

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.178
had an early fascination with first principles,

00:03:07.178 --> 00:03:08.700
and over the years, as our knowledge of

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.275
science and technology became more sophisticated,

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.471
this early awe with the basics

00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:17.571
has only intensified.

00:03:17.571 --> 00:03:21.270
So it's not surprising that, about 12 years ago, when

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.752
Noam and I were already computer science professors,

00:03:24.752 --> 00:03:28.504
we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon.

00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:31.322
As computers became increasingly more complex,

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:34.526
our students were losing the forest for the trees,

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:37.613
and indeed, it is impossible to connect

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:40.255
with the soul of the machine if you interact

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:43.664
with a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded

00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:47.040
by numerous layers of closed, proprietary software.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.730
So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.749
to understand how computers work,

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.837
and understand it in the marrow of their bones,

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:57.398
then perhaps the best way to go about it

00:03:57.398 --> 00:04:01.992
is to have them build a complete, working,

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:05.704
general-purpose, useful computer, hardware and software,

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:09.234
from the ground up, from first principles.

00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:13.442
Now, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I

00:04:13.442 --> 00:04:16.932
decided to base our cathedral, so to speak,

00:04:16.932 --> 00:04:20.071
on the simplest possible building block,

00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:22.872
which is something called NAND.

00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:26.810
It is nothing more than a trivial logic gate

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.848
with four input-output states.

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:32.514
So we now start this journey by telling our students

00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:34.582
that God gave us NAND — (Laughter) —

00:04:34.582 --> 00:04:38.567
and told us to build a computer, and when we asked how,

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:41.751
God said, "One step at a time."

00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:44.844
And then, following this advice, we start

00:04:44.844 --> 00:04:47.803
with this lowly, humble NAND gate,

00:04:47.803 --> 00:04:49.743
and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence

00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:53.480
of projects in which they gradually build a chip set,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.592
a hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine,

00:04:57.592 --> 00:05:01.169
a basic operating system and a compiler

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:07.358
for a simple, Java-like language that we call "JACK."

00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:09.906
The students celebrate the end of this tour de force

00:05:09.906 --> 00:05:12.740
by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.732
like Pong, Snake and Tetris.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:19.347
You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing

00:05:19.347 --> 00:05:22.371
with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:25.161
and then compiled into machine language in a compiler

00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:27.569
that you wrote also, and then seeing the result

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.452
running on a machine that you built starting

00:05:30.452 --> 00:05:33.736
with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates.

00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:36.926
It's a tremendous personal triumph of going

00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:41.651
from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex

00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:44.002
and useful system.

00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:48.399
Noam and I worked five years to facilitate

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.607
this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure

00:05:51.607 --> 00:05:54.780
that will enable students to build it in one semester.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.819
And this is the great team that helped us make it happen.

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.066
The trick was to decompose the computer's construction

00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:06.020
into numerous stand-alone modules,

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.920
each of which could be individually specified,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.155
built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project.

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:18.144
And from day one, Noam and I decided to put

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:21.680
all these building blocks freely available in open source

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.160
on the Web.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.631
So chip specifications, APIs, project descriptions,

00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:31.535
software tools, hardware simulators, CPU emulators,

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:35.237
stacks of hundreds of slides, lectures --

00:06:35.237 --> 00:06:37.464
we laid out everything on the Web

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:40.491
and invited the world to come over,

00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:42.027
take whatever they need,

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.417
and do whatever they want with it.

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:48.316
And then something fascinating happened.

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:49.899
The world came.

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:53.057
And in short order, thousands of people

00:06:53.057 --> 00:06:54.601
were building our machine.

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:58.525
And NAND2Tetris became one of the first

00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:01.755
massive, open, online courses,

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.499
although seven years ago we had no idea that what

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.660
we were doing is called MOOCs.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.518
We just observed how self-organized courses

00:07:10.518 --> 00:07:13.600
were kind of spontaneously spawning

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.983
out of our materials.

00:07:14.983 --> 00:07:18.074
For example, Pramode C.E.,

00:07:18.074 --> 00:07:19.983
an engineer from Kerala, India,

00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:21.792
has organized groups of self-learners

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:24.836
who build our computer under his good guidance.

00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:27.858
And Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai,

00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:30.703
has unbundled our projects into smaller,

00:07:30.703 --> 00:07:32.725
more manageable bites that he now serves

00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:36.527
in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program.

00:07:36.527 --> 00:07:39.938
The people who are attracted to these courses

00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:42.358
typically have a hacker mentality.

00:07:42.358 --> 00:07:44.463
They want to figure out how things work,

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:46.223
and they want to do it in groups,

00:07:46.223 --> 00:07:49.034
like this hackers club in Washington, D.C.,

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:52.699
that uses our materials to offer community courses.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:55.645
And because these materials are widely available

00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:58.339
and open-source, different people take them

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.282
to very different and unpredictable directions.

00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:04.195
For example, Yu Fangmin, from Guangzhou,

00:08:04.195 --> 00:08:07.041
has used FPGA technology

00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:10.766
to build our computer and show others how to do the same

00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:14.129
using a video clip, and Ben Craddock developed

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:17.730
a very nice computer game that unfolds

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.699
inside our CPU architecture, which is quite a complex

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:25.184
3D maze that Ben developed

00:08:25.184 --> 00:08:29.092
using the Minecraft 3D simulator engine.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:32.110
The Minecraft community went bananas over this project,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.494
and Ben became an instant media celebrity.

00:08:35.494 --> 00:08:38.396
And indeed, for quite a few people,

00:08:38.396 --> 00:08:42.473
taking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will,

00:08:42.473 --> 00:08:45.185
has turned into a life-changing experience.

00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:48.374
For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music

00:08:48.374 --> 00:08:51.143
and math major from East Lansing, Michigan.

00:08:51.143 --> 00:08:54.587
A few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post

00:08:54.587 --> 00:08:57.207
on our website, and I'd like to read it to you.

00:08:57.207 --> 00:09:00.665
So here's what Dan said.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:03.477
"I did the coursework because understanding computers

00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:06.823
is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy,

00:09:06.823 --> 00:09:09.840
and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.549
never been challenged to this degree.

00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:14.936
But given what I now feel capable of doing,

00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:17.094
I would certainly do it again.

00:09:17.094 --> 00:09:19.344
To anyone considering NAND2Tetris,

00:09:19.344 --> 00:09:23.090
it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.990
So Dan demonstrates the many self-learners

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.636
who take this course off the Web, on their own traction,

00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:37.225
on their own initiative, and it's quite amazing because

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:41.812
these people cannot care less about

00:09:41.812 --> 00:09:43.054
grades.

00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:46.959
They are doing it because of one motivation only.

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:50.445
They have a tremendous passion to learn.

00:09:50.445 --> 00:09:52.369
And with that in mind,

00:09:52.369 --> 00:09:56.973
I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.

00:09:56.973 --> 00:09:59.333
I'm sick of it.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:00.766
We are obsessed with grades

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.632
because we are obsessed with data,

00:10:02.632 --> 00:10:07.219
and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing,

00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:09.695
and a huge part of education

00:10:09.695 --> 00:10:11.286
is about failing.

00:10:11.286 --> 00:10:13.761
Courage, according to Churchill,

00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:16.707
is the ability to go from one defeat to another

00:10:16.707 --> 00:10:19.321
without losing enthusiasm. (Laughter)

00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.151
And [Joyce] said that mistakes

00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:24.620
are the portals of discovery.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.966
And yet we don't tolerate mistakes,

00:10:27.966 --> 00:10:29.275
and we worship grades.

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:33.063
So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses

00:10:33.063 --> 00:10:35.900
and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.811
which is stamped on your forehead

00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:40.254
and sums up who you are.

00:10:40.254 --> 00:10:43.537
Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense,

00:10:43.537 --> 00:10:46.218
and grading became degrading.

00:10:46.218 --> 00:10:51.119
So with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading,

00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:55.544
and share with you a glimpse from my current project,

00:10:55.544 --> 00:10:57.574
which is different from the previous one,

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.588
but it shares exactly the same characteristics

00:10:59.588 --> 00:11:03.415
of self-learning, learning by doing,

00:11:03.415 --> 00:11:06.190
self-exploration and community-building,

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:12.050
and this project deals with K-12 math education,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.954
beginning with early age math,

00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:18.447
and we do it on tablets because we believe that

00:11:18.447 --> 00:11:22.852
math, like anything else, should be taught hands on.

00:11:22.852 --> 00:11:26.007
So here's what we do. Basically, we developed

00:11:26.007 --> 00:11:29.765
numerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining

00:11:29.765 --> 00:11:31.262
a particular concept in math.

00:11:31.262 --> 00:11:34.703
So for example, let's take area.

00:11:34.703 --> 00:11:37.175
When you deal with a concept like area --

00:11:37.175 --> 00:11:42.419
well, we also provide a set of tools that the child

00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:45.050
is invited to experiment with in order to learn.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.003
So if area is what interests us, then one thing

00:11:49.003 --> 00:11:53.141
which is natural to do is to tile the area

00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:56.791
of this particular shape and simply count

00:11:56.791 --> 00:12:00.654
how many tiles it takes to cover it completely.

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:03.136
And this little exercise here gives you a first

00:12:03.136 --> 00:12:06.565
good insight of the notion of area.

00:12:06.565 --> 00:12:09.355
Moving along, what about the area of this figure?

00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:14.012
Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it.

00:12:14.012 --> 00:12:16.316
So instead, you can experiment

00:12:16.316 --> 00:12:18.996
with these different tools here by some process

00:12:18.996 --> 00:12:21.035
of guided trial and error,

00:12:21.035 --> 00:12:23.873
and at some point you will discover that one thing

00:12:23.873 --> 00:12:26.961
that you can do among several legitimate transformations

00:12:26.961 --> 00:12:29.792
is the following one. You can cut the figure,

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:33.408
you can rearrange the parts, you can glue them

00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:36.525
and then proceed to tile just like we did before.

00:12:36.525 --> 00:12:41.800
(Applause)

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.523
Now this particular transformation

00:12:44.523 --> 00:12:48.507
did not change the area of the original figure,

00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:50.694
so a six-year-old who plays with this

00:12:50.694 --> 00:12:53.578
has just discovered a clever algorithm

00:12:53.578 --> 00:12:57.618
to compute the area of any given parallelogram.

00:12:57.618 --> 00:12:59.474
We don't replace teachers, by the way.

00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:02.603
We believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced.

00:13:02.603 --> 00:13:05.898
Moving along, what about the area of a triangle?

00:13:05.898 --> 00:13:08.693
So after some guided trial and error,

00:13:08.693 --> 00:13:12.628
the child will discover, with or without help,

00:13:12.628 --> 00:13:16.486
that he or she can duplicate the original figure

00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:19.894
and then take the result, transpose it,

00:13:19.894 --> 00:13:23.642
glue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before:

00:13:23.642 --> 00:13:31.370
cut, rearrange, paste — oops— paste and glue,

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.966
and tile.

00:13:32.966 --> 00:13:36.793
Now this transformation has doubled the area

00:13:36.793 --> 00:13:40.643
of the original figure, and therefore we have just learned

00:13:40.643 --> 00:13:44.409
that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle

00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:46.863
divided by two.

00:13:46.863 --> 00:13:50.311
But we discovered it by self-exploration.

00:13:50.311 --> 00:13:56.391
So, in addition to learning some useful geometry,

00:13:56.391 --> 00:14:00.778
the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated

00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:03.805
science strategies, like reduction,

00:14:03.805 --> 00:14:06.719
which is the art of

00:14:06.719 --> 00:14:10.305
transforming a complex problem into a simple one,

00:14:10.305 --> 00:14:12.674
or generalization, which is at the heart

00:14:12.674 --> 00:14:15.517
of any scientific discipline,

00:14:15.517 --> 00:14:18.107
or the fact that some properties are invariant

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:21.131
under some transformations.

00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:24.416
And all this is something that a very young child

00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:28.725
can pick up using such mobile apps.

00:14:28.725 --> 00:14:31.819
So presently, we are doing the following:

00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:36.128
First of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum

00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:39.019
into numerous such apps.

00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:41.596
And because we cannot do it on our own,

00:14:41.596 --> 00:14:44.690
we've developed a very fancy authoring tool

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.965
that any author, any parent or actually anyone

00:14:47.965 --> 00:14:50.318
who has an interest in math education,

00:14:50.318 --> 00:14:53.590
can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.995
on tablets without programming.

00:14:56.995 --> 00:15:00.215
And finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem

00:15:00.215 --> 00:15:03.043
that will match different learners

00:15:03.043 --> 00:15:08.420
with different apps according to their evolving learning style.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.941
The driving force behind this project

00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:13.888
is my colleague Shmulik London,

00:15:13.888 --> 00:15:16.532
and, you see, just like

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:20.605
Salman did about 90 years ago,

00:15:20.605 --> 00:15:24.576
the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people,

00:15:24.576 --> 00:15:27.332
because at the end,

00:15:27.332 --> 00:15:29.235
it's all about people.

00:15:29.235 --> 00:15:32.654
And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv

00:15:32.654 --> 00:15:35.484
and I saw this graffiti on a wall,

00:15:35.484 --> 00:15:37.275
and I found it so compelling

00:15:37.275 --> 00:15:39.418
that by now I preach it to my students,

00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:41.684
and I'd like to try to preach it to you.

00:15:41.684 --> 00:15:43.424
Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar

00:15:43.424 --> 00:15:45.252
with the term "mensch."

00:15:45.252 --> 00:15:47.860
It basically means to be human

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.795
and to do the right thing.

00:15:49.795 --> 00:15:52.224
And with that, what this graffiti says is,

00:15:52.224 --> 00:15:54.310
"High-tech schmigh-tech.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.873
The most important thing is to be a mensch." (Laughter)

00:15:56.873 --> 00:16:00.268
Thank you. (Applause)

00:16:00.268 --> 00:16:05.051
(Applause)
