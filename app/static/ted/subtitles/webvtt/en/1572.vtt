00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:02.079
So if someone asked you

00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:04.841
for the three words that would sum up

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:08.723
your reputation, what would you say?

00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:11.118
How would people describe your judgment,

00:00:11.118 --> 00:00:14.875
your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:17.242
Today I'd like to explore with you

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.914
why the answer to this question

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.055
will become profoundly important

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:25.652
in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.

00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:28.235
I'd like to start by introducing you to someone

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:31.837
whose life has been changed by a marketplace

00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:33.940
fueled by reputation.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.030
Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.569
on Airbnb since 2008.

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:42.500
I caught up with him recently, where, over the course

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.364
of several cups of tea, he told me how

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:47.747
hosting guests from all over the world

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:49.214
has enriched his life.

00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:52.587
More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century

00:00:52.587 --> 00:00:55.619
watchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:00.051
Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest

00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:04.002
happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen,

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.595
and she promised that she would refrain from leaving

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:10.017
a bad review on one condition: he got a cat.

00:01:10.017 --> 00:01:14.084
And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.

00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:17.243
Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:21.194
marketplace that matches people who have space to rent

00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:23.979
with people who are looking for a place to stay

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.666
in over 192 countries.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.356
The places being rented out are things that you might

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:32.188
expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes,

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:34.761
but part of the magic is the unique places

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.699
that you can now access: treehouses, teepees,

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:40.791
airplane hangars, igloos.

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:44.250
If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.083
that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:50.431
It's a fantastic example of how technology

00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.147
is creating a market

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:54.646
for things that never had a marketplace before.

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:57.777
Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris

00:01:57.777 --> 00:02:00.335
to see how insanely fast it's growing.

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:02.999
This image here is from 2008.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.718
The pink dots represent host properties.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:10.711
Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:13.203
seemed like a crazy idea.

00:02:13.203 --> 00:02:15.424
Now the same view in 2010.

00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:18.226
And now, 2012.

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:23.365
There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:27.996
Now, what's happening here is people are realizing

00:02:27.996 --> 00:02:32.357
the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity

00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:35.275
and value of all kinds of assets,

00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:38.733
from skills to spaces to material possessions,

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:42.212
in ways and on a scale never possible before.

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:45.436
It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption,

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.228
and, through it, people like Sebastian

00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:50.299
are becoming micro-entrepreneurs.

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.997
They're empowered to make money and save money

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:55.696
from their existing assets.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:58.215
But the real magic and the secret source behind

00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:00.984
collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb

00:03:00.984 --> 00:03:03.619
isn't the inventory or the money.

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:07.136
It's using the power of technology to build trust

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:08.627
between strangers.

00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:12.159
This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.434
during the London riots.

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:16.140
He woke up around 9, and he checked his email

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.317
and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him

00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:20.839
if he was okay.

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.011
Former guests from around the world had seen that

00:03:23.011 --> 00:03:25.104
the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.405
to check if he needed anything.

00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:30.590
Sebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guests

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.753
contacted me before my own mother rang." (Laughter)

00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:39.130
Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.034
I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption,

00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:44.584
and why, after I finished my book, I decided

00:03:44.584 --> 00:03:48.274
I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.

00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:51.931
Because at its core, it's about empowerment.

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:56.092
It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections,

00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:59.014
connections that are enabling us to rediscover

00:03:59.014 --> 00:04:02.413
a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way,

00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:06.733
by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter,

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:09.966
like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:12.993
versus empty transactions.

00:04:12.993 --> 00:04:16.321
Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back

00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:19.614
to old market principles and collaborative behaviors

00:04:19.614 --> 00:04:21.326
that are hard-wired in all of us.

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:24.015
They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant

00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:25.703
for the Facebook age.

00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:29.255
We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired

00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:33.470
our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.204
just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar,

00:04:37.204 --> 00:04:40.406
our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes,

00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:43.205
our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:46.102
money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.

00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:48.620
We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.206
to coding on Skillshare,

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:54.264
and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.

00:04:54.264 --> 00:04:58.719
Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.940
that's enabling us to match wants with haves

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.910
in more democratic ways.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.580
Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.904
of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand,

00:05:10.904 --> 00:05:14.815
but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway,

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:18.005
where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses,

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:21.557
people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.

00:05:21.557 --> 00:05:25.850
But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.884
is because every new advancement of technology

00:05:28.884 --> 00:05:32.958
increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.343
to make sharing easier and easier.

00:05:36.343 --> 00:05:39.311
Now, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces,

00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:44.023
and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.

00:05:44.023 --> 00:05:46.015
Let me give you an example.

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:50.433
Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet,

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.841
the best job title here of SuperRabbit.

00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:58.421
Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately,

00:05:58.421 --> 00:06:01.811
as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people,

00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:04.663
he struggled to find a new one during the recession.

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:08.050
And then he happened to stumble across a post about

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.514
TaskRabbit.

00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:12.884
Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many

00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:16.971
great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:20.218
Now what happened was, in February 2008,

00:06:20.218 --> 00:06:22.882
Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:26.323
out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:28.683
and he was salivating with saliva.

00:06:28.683 --> 00:06:31.376
They realized they'd run out of dog food.

00:06:31.376 --> 00:06:34.620
Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.934
Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks

00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:41.723
starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of

00:06:41.723 --> 00:06:43.763
eBay for errands existed.

00:06:43.763 --> 00:06:46.418
Six months later, Leah quit her job,

00:06:46.418 --> 00:06:49.007
and TaskRabbit was born.

00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:52.872
At the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting

00:06:52.872 --> 00:06:57.460
on a bigger idea she later called service networking.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.993
It's essentially about how we use our online relationships

00:07:00.993 --> 00:07:04.310
to get things done in the real world.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.919
Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.486
the tasks that they want doing, name the price

00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:12.125
they're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:13.658
bid to run the errand.

00:07:13.658 --> 00:07:18.151
Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process

00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:19.939
that's designed to find the people that would make

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.597
great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.

00:07:23.597 --> 00:07:28.566
Now, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States

00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:31.583
and 5,000 more on the waiting list.

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:34.350
Now the tasks being posted are things that you might

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.711
expect, like help with household chores

00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:39.892
or doing some supermarket runs.

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:42.734
I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand

00:07:42.734 --> 00:07:45.757
loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.469
through TaskRabbit.

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:51.281
But I love that the number one task posted,

00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:54.558
over a hundred times a day, is something that many of us

00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:57.126
have felt the pain of doing:

00:07:57.126 --> 00:08:03.586
yes, assembling Ikea furniture. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:03.586 --> 00:08:07.303
It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here

00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:09.903
is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month

00:08:09.903 --> 00:08:13.054
running errands around his life.

00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:16.389
And 70 percent of this new labor force

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:19.853
were previously unemployed or underemployed.

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:23.247
I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption

00:08:23.247 --> 00:08:26.686
are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:30.711
Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right,

00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:33.910
that over the past 20 years, we've evolved

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.422
from trusting people online to share information

00:08:37.422 --> 00:08:40.285
to trusting to handing over our credit card information,

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:43.583
and now we're entering the third trust wave:

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:47.311
connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds

00:08:47.311 --> 00:08:49.838
of people-powered marketplaces.

00:08:49.838 --> 00:08:51.553
I actually came across this fascinating study

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:53.993
by the Pew Center this week that revealed

00:08:53.993 --> 00:08:57.525
that an active Facebook user is three times as likely

00:08:57.525 --> 00:09:02.560
as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.937
Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another

00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:08.342
face to face.

00:09:08.342 --> 00:09:11.637
Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist,

00:09:11.637 --> 00:09:15.357
comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need

00:09:15.357 --> 00:09:19.798
to address some pressing, complex questions.

00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:22.384
How to ensure our digital identities reflect our

00:09:22.384 --> 00:09:25.847
real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?

00:09:25.847 --> 00:09:29.527
How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.410
How do we stop people who've behaved badly

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.104
in one community doing so under a different guise?

00:09:35.104 --> 00:09:38.199
In a similar way that companies often use some kind of

00:09:38.199 --> 00:09:41.662
credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan,

00:09:41.662 --> 00:09:44.710
or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.455
on transactions between relative strangers

00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:50.399
need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.360
and Chris are good eggs,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.480
and that device is reputation.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.478
Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.

00:10:00.478 --> 00:10:02.113
Let's just take a look at Chris.

00:10:02.113 --> 00:10:05.406
You can see that over 200 people have given him

00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:08.645
an average rating over 4.99 out of 5.

00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:10.925
There are over 20 pages of reviews of his work

00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:13.309
describing him as super-friendly and fast,

00:10:13.309 --> 00:10:17.031
and he's reached level 25, the highest level,

00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:18.988
making him a SuperRabbit.

00:10:18.988 --> 00:10:21.886
Now — (Laughter) -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.

00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:25.545
And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation

00:10:25.545 --> 00:10:28.704
has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid

00:10:28.704 --> 00:10:30.657
and how much he can charge.

00:10:30.657 --> 00:10:33.395
In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation

00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:35.464
has a real world value.

00:10:35.464 --> 00:10:37.500
Now, I know what you might be thinking.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.043
Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers

00:10:40.043 --> 00:10:43.599
on eBay or star ratings on Amazon.

00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:46.839
The difference today is that, with every trade we make,

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:50.239
comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn,

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:52.181
we leave a reputation trail

00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:55.727
of how well we can and can't be trusted.

00:10:55.727 --> 00:10:58.312
And it's not just the breadth but the volume

00:10:58.312 --> 00:11:00.950
of reputation data out there that is staggering.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.254
Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked

00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:07.213
on Airbnb in the past six months alone.

00:11:07.213 --> 00:11:11.176
30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.

00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:14.063
This year, two billion dollars worth of loans

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:16.291
will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.

00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:20.645
This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data

00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:24.017
on how well we behave or misbehave.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:27.606
Now, capturing and correlating the trails of information

00:11:27.606 --> 00:11:30.859
that we leave in different places is a massive challenge,

00:11:30.859 --> 00:11:33.461
but one we're being asked to figure out.

00:11:33.461 --> 00:11:36.745
What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask

00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:39.710
is, shouldn't they own their reputation data?

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.584
Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested

00:11:42.584 --> 00:11:45.991
on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him

00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:48.057
from one community to another?

00:11:48.057 --> 00:11:50.769
What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:54.525
books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?

00:11:54.525 --> 00:11:58.200
It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.388
It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:05.191
because my credit history didn't travel with me.

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:08.135
I was essentially a ghost in the system.

00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:11.150
Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.046
of the reputation economy is about

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:17.415
adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.

00:12:17.415 --> 00:12:20.877
People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?

00:12:20.877 --> 00:12:23.324
I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up

00:12:23.324 --> 00:12:26.925
tweets and likes and friends in a Klout-like fashion.

00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:30.205
Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviors

00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:32.092
that indicate our trustworthiness.

00:12:32.092 --> 00:12:35.692
But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind

00:12:35.692 --> 00:12:39.633
is that reputation is largely contextual.

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:42.367
Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host

00:12:42.367 --> 00:12:46.316
does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.

00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:49.649
The big challenge is figuring out what data

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:52.414
makes sense to pull, because the future's

00:12:52.414 --> 00:12:55.802
going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation,

00:12:55.802 --> 00:12:58.614
not a single algorithm.

00:12:58.614 --> 00:13:02.365
It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:04.764
a Facebook- or Google-like search

00:13:04.764 --> 00:13:07.686
and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:10.566
in different contexts over time.

00:13:10.566 --> 00:13:14.201
I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you,

00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:18.356
when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit,

00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:20.336
your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb,

00:13:20.336 --> 00:13:23.784
the knowledge that you display on Quora or Tripovo,

00:13:23.784 --> 00:13:26.367
they'll all live together in one place,

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:29.838
and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard

00:13:29.838 --> 00:13:34.395
that will paint a picture of your reputation capital.

00:13:34.395 --> 00:13:37.227
Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching

00:13:37.227 --> 00:13:39.809
and writing my next book on, and currently define

00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:43.584
as the worth of your reputation, your intentions,

00:13:43.584 --> 00:13:47.965
capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.

00:13:47.965 --> 00:13:50.873
This isn't some far-off frontier.

00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:53.907
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me

00:13:53.907 --> 00:13:57.410
and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:02.393
you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.

00:14:02.393 --> 00:14:06.106
Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little

00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:09.672
Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some

00:14:09.672 --> 00:14:13.072
enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve,

00:14:13.072 --> 00:14:16.944
but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation,

00:14:16.944 --> 00:14:19.857
we can actually control it more, and extract

00:14:19.857 --> 00:14:22.577
the immense value that will flow from it.

00:14:22.577 --> 00:14:25.308
Also, more so than our credit history,

00:14:25.308 --> 00:14:27.944
we can actually shape our reputation.

00:14:27.944 --> 00:14:29.263
Just think of Sebastian

00:14:29.263 --> 00:14:32.110
and how he bought the cat to influence his.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.624
Now privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue

00:14:36.624 --> 00:14:39.378
I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts,

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:42.774
people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online,

00:14:42.774 --> 00:14:45.538
but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?

00:14:45.538 --> 00:14:48.954
How do we take their contributions to their jobs,

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.958
their communities and their families,

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.866
and convert that value into reputation capital?

00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:58.650
Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.488
could create a massive positive disruption

00:15:01.488 --> 00:15:05.233
in who has power, trust and influence.

00:15:05.233 --> 00:15:08.873
A three-digit score, your traditional credit history,

00:15:08.873 --> 00:15:11.570
that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is,

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.514
will no longer be the determining factor

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:17.882
in how much things cost, what we can access,

00:15:17.882 --> 00:15:20.802
and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.

00:15:20.802 --> 00:15:25.210
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:30.457
more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.

00:15:30.457 --> 00:15:33.154
Reputation will be the currency that says

00:15:33.154 --> 00:15:35.338
that you can trust me.

00:15:35.338 --> 00:15:38.642
Now the interesting thing is, reputation

00:15:38.642 --> 00:15:40.653
is the socioeconomic lubricant

00:15:40.653 --> 00:15:45.451
that makes collaborative consumption work and scale,

00:15:45.451 --> 00:15:47.261
but the sources it will be generated from,

00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:51.746
and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.

00:15:51.746 --> 00:15:54.685
Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting,

00:15:54.685 --> 00:15:58.739
where reputation data will make the résumé seem

00:15:58.739 --> 00:16:02.817
like an archaic relic of the past.

00:16:02.817 --> 00:16:06.840
Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.938
Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:14.482
called Stack Overflow.

00:16:14.482 --> 00:16:17.906
Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where

00:16:17.906 --> 00:16:20.424
experienced programmers can ask

00:16:20.424 --> 00:16:24.937
other good programmers highly detailed technical questions

00:16:24.937 --> 00:16:28.929
on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.

00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:32.825
This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day,

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:36.424
and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.

00:16:36.424 --> 00:16:39.474
Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways,

00:16:39.474 --> 00:16:42.107
but it's basically by convincing their peers

00:16:42.107 --> 00:16:44.481
they know what they're talking about.

00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:47.258
Now a few months after this site launched, the founders

00:16:47.258 --> 00:16:49.680
heard about something interesting,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.363
and it actually didn't surprise them.

00:16:51.363 --> 00:16:54.951
What they heard was that users were putting

00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:58.395
their reputation scores on the top of their résumés,

00:16:58.395 --> 00:17:01.204
and that recruiters were searching the platform

00:17:01.204 --> 00:17:03.450
to find people with unique talents.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.357
Now thousands of programmers today are finding

00:17:06.357 --> 00:17:09.744
better jobs this way, because Stack Overflow

00:17:09.744 --> 00:17:12.965
and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.660
into how someone really behaves,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.980
and what their peers think of them.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.484
But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow,

00:17:20.484 --> 00:17:23.031
I think, is incredibly exciting.

00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:26.325
People are starting to realize that the reputation

00:17:26.325 --> 00:17:29.501
they generate in one place has value

00:17:29.501 --> 00:17:32.395
beyond the environments from which it was built.

00:17:32.395 --> 00:17:34.431
You know, it's very interesting.

00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:37.480
When you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.954
or super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts,

00:17:41.954 --> 00:17:45.001
they all talk about how having a high reputation

00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:48.316
unlocks a sense of their own power.

00:17:48.316 --> 00:17:51.242
On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field,

00:17:51.242 --> 00:17:54.169
enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.

00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:57.321
On Airbnb, the people often become more important

00:17:57.321 --> 00:17:59.914
than the spaces. On TaskRabbit,

00:17:59.914 --> 00:18:03.107
it gives people control of their economic activity.

00:18:03.107 --> 00:18:06.440
Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how,

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.081
on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer

00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:13.307
in his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around

00:18:13.307 --> 00:18:16.145
the world who've said something wonderful about him,

00:18:16.145 --> 00:18:18.816
and what that says about him as a person.

00:18:18.816 --> 00:18:22.264
He's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced

00:18:22.264 --> 00:18:25.872
that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb

00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:28.623
will lead him to doing something interesting

00:18:28.623 --> 00:18:31.180
with the rest of his life.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.160
You know, there are only a few windows in history

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.384
where the opportunity exists to reinvent

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:41.719
part of how our socioeconomic system works.

00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:44.184
We're living through one of those moments.

00:18:44.184 --> 00:18:47.815
I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution

00:18:47.815 --> 00:18:51.595
that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.

00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:55.204
In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit

00:18:55.204 --> 00:18:58.448
transformed our consumer system, and in many ways

00:18:58.448 --> 00:19:01.233
controlled who had access to what.

00:19:01.233 --> 00:19:04.248
In the 21st century, new trust networks,

00:19:04.248 --> 00:19:07.622
and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent

00:19:07.622 --> 00:19:11.888
the way we think about wealth, markets, power

00:19:11.888 --> 00:19:16.472
and personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.

00:19:16.472 --> 00:19:19.439
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:24.930
(Applause)
