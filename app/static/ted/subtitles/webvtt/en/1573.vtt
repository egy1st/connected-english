WEBVTT

00:00:00.474 --> 00:00:03.283
Other people. Everyone is interested in other people.

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:05.406
Everyone has relationships with other people,

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:06.998
and they're interested in these relationships

00:00:06.998 --> 00:00:08.853
for a variety of reasons.

00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:10.865
Good relationships, bad relationships,

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.011
annoying relationships, agnostic relationships,

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:17.435
and what I'm going to do is focus on the central piece

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:20.738
of an interaction that goes on in a relationship.

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:23.074
So I'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we're all

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.499
interested in interacting with other people,

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.331
I'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features,

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:33.225
and I'm going to turn that object, that simplified object,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.375
into a scientific probe, and provide the early stages,

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:39.824
embryonic stages of new insights into what happens

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:43.474
in two brains while they simultaneously interact.

00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:45.767
But before I do that, let me tell you a couple of things

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.466
that made this possible.

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.247
The first is we can now eavesdrop safely

00:00:50.247 --> 00:00:52.958
on healthy brain activity.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.535
Without needles and radioactivity,

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:58.398
without any kind of clinical reason, we can go down the street

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:01.525
and record from your friends' and neighbors' brains

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:04.063
while they do a variety of cognitive tasks, and we use

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.797
a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging.

00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:10.122
You've probably all read about it or heard about in some

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:14.500
incarnation. Let me give you a two-sentence version of it.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.984
So we've all heard of MRIs. MRIs use magnetic fields

00:01:17.984 --> 00:01:20.013
and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.374
or your knee or your stomach,

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.419
grayscale images that are frozen in time.

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:26.740
In the 1990s, it was discovered you could use

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.399
the same machines in a different mode,

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.745
and in that mode, you could make microscopic blood flow

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:35.045
movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:38.245
Okay, so what? In fact, the so what is, in the brain,

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:42.077
changes in neural activity, the things that make your brain work,

00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:44.087
the things that make your software work in your brain,

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:46.576
are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow.

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:48.549
You make a blood flow movie, you have an independent

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.888
proxy of brain activity.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:53.922
This has literally revolutionized cognitive science.

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:55.913
Take any cognitive domain you want, memory,

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:58.054
motor planning, thinking about your mother-in-law,

00:01:58.054 --> 00:02:01.769
getting angry at people, emotional response, it goes on and on,

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:04.858
put people into functional MRI devices, and

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:08.241
image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity.

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:11.090
It's in its early stages, and it's crude by some measures,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.658
but in fact, 20 years ago, we were at nothing.

00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:16.017
You couldn't do people like this. You couldn't do healthy people.

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:18.505
That's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.323
to a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists,

00:02:21.323 --> 00:02:25.083
as you well know, have lots of experimental preps,

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:28.224
worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this.

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:31.621
And now, we have a new experimental prep: human beings.

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:35.382
We can now use human beings to study and model

00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:38.332
the software in human beings, and we have a few

00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:41.167
burgeoning biological measures.

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:45.054
Okay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do,

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:47.731
and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation.

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:49.866
Valuation is just what you think it is, you know?

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:52.670
If you went and you were valuing two companies against

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.406
one another, you'd want to know which was more valuable.

00:02:55.406 --> 00:02:59.285
Cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago.

00:02:59.285 --> 00:03:01.975
If you want to compare oranges to windshields, what do you do?

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:04.331
Well, you can't compare oranges to windshields.

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.586
They're immiscible. They don't mix with one another.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.937
So instead, you convert them to a common currency scale,

00:03:08.937 --> 00:03:11.643
put them on that scale, and value them accordingly.

00:03:11.643 --> 00:03:15.079
Well, your brain has to do something just like that as well,

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.567
and we're now beginning to understand and identify

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:19.704
brain systems involved in valuation,

00:03:19.704 --> 00:03:22.336
and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:24.968
whose cells are located in your brainstem

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:28.143
and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain.

00:03:28.143 --> 00:03:30.585
I won't go through the details of it, but that's an important

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.742
discovery, and we know a good bit about that now,

00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:34.972
and it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because

00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:38.247
those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease,

00:03:38.247 --> 00:03:40.263
and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:42.495
every drug of abuse, and that makes sense.

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:44.831
Drugs of abuse would come in, and they would change

00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:46.620
the way you value the world. They change the way

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.819
you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice,

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.333
and they make you value that over everything else.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:55.354
Here's the key feature though. These neurons are also

00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:58.855
involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas,

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:00.896
and I put some symbols up here that we assign value to

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:03.616
for various reasons.

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:06.305
We have a behavioral superpower in our brain,

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:08.058
and it at least in part involves dopamine.

00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:12.247
We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea,

00:04:12.247 --> 00:04:16.252
for a mere idea. No other species can do that.

00:04:16.252 --> 00:04:19.858
In 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide

00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:22.073
predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship

00:04:22.073 --> 00:04:25.858
hiding in the tail of the then-visible comet Hale-Bopp

00:04:25.858 --> 00:04:30.130
waiting to take them to the next level. It was an incredibly tragic event.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.615
More than two thirds of them had college degrees.

00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:37.338
But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival

00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:40.204
using exactly the same systems that were put there

00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:44.246
to make them survive. That's a lot of control, okay?

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:46.335
One thing that I've left out of this narrative

00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:48.569
is the obvious thing, which is the focus of the rest of my

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.728
little talk, and that is other people.

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.724
These same valuation systems are redeployed

00:04:53.724 --> 00:04:56.216
when we're valuing interactions with other people.

00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:59.487
So this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs,

00:04:59.487 --> 00:05:02.011
that makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease,

00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:05.088
that contributes to various forms of psychosis,

00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:09.008
is also redeployed to value interactions with other people

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:11.904
and to assign value to gestures that you do

00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:14.478
when you're interacting with somebody else.

00:05:14.478 --> 00:05:17.055
Let me give you an example of this.

00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:20.022
You bring to the table such enormous processing power

00:05:20.022 --> 00:05:22.646
in this domain that you hardly even notice it.

00:05:22.646 --> 00:05:24.113
Let me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby.

00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:27.843
She's three months old. She still poops in her diapers and she can't do calculus.

00:05:27.843 --> 00:05:31.196
She's related to me. Somebody will be very glad that she's up here on the screen.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:33.572
You can cover up one of her eyes, and you can still read

00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:36.327
something in the other eye, and I see sort of curiosity

00:05:36.327 --> 00:05:39.924
in one eye, I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other.

00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:43.103
Here's a couple. They're sharing a moment together,

00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:44.421
and we've even done an experiment where you can cut out

00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:47.428
different pieces of this frame and you can still see

00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:49.932
that they're sharing it. They're sharing it sort of in parallel.

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:52.395
Now, the elements of the scene also communicate this

00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:54.630
to us, but you can read it straight off their faces,

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.133
and if you compare their faces to normal faces, it would be a very subtle cue.

00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:01.480
Here's another couple. He's projecting out at us,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.368
and she's clearly projecting, you know,

00:06:04.368 --> 00:06:06.631
love and admiration at him.

00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:10.266
Here's another couple. (Laughter)

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:15.416
And I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left. (Laughter)

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.976
In fact, I know this is his sister, and you can just see

00:06:17.976 --> 00:06:20.489
him saying, "Okay, we're doing this for the camera,

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:26.191
and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face." (Laughter)

00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:28.297
He'll kill me for showing that.

00:06:28.297 --> 00:06:31.094
All right, so what does this mean?

00:06:31.094 --> 00:06:34.444
It means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem.

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:38.092
It engages deep systems in our brain, in dopaminergic

00:06:38.092 --> 00:06:40.910
systems that are there to make you chase sex, food and salt.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.804
They keep you alive. It gives them the pie, it gives

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:46.708
that kind of a behavioral punch which we've called a superpower.

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:50.362
So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged

00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:53.060
social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.751
And the short answer is games.

00:06:55.751 --> 00:07:00.155
Economic games. So what we do is we go into two areas.

00:07:00.155 --> 00:07:03.491
One area is called experimental economics. The other area is called behavioral economics.

00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:07.569
And we steal their games. And we contrive them to our own purposes.

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.536
So this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game.

00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:12.381
Red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:16.104
a split to blue. Let's say red wants to keep 70,

00:07:16.104 --> 00:07:20.190
and offers blue 30. So he offers a 70-30 split with blue.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.041
Control passes to blue, and blue says, "I accept it,"

00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:24.997
in which case he'd get the money, or blue says,

00:07:24.997 --> 00:07:29.304
"I reject it," in which case no one gets anything. Okay?

00:07:29.304 --> 00:07:32.696
So a rational choice economist would say, well,

00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:34.752
you should take all non-zero offers.

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:38.514
What do people do? People are indifferent at an 80-20 split.

00:07:38.514 --> 00:07:42.038
At 80-20, it's a coin flip whether you accept that or not.

00:07:42.038 --> 00:07:44.929
Why is that? You know, because you're pissed off.

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:48.538
You're mad. That's an unfair offer, and you know what an unfair offer is.

00:07:48.538 --> 00:07:51.242
This is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:53.786
That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that

00:07:53.786 --> 00:07:57.524
these games probe. The interesting thing is, these games

00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:01.231
require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.159
You have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person.

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:07.372
You have to be able to remember what you've done.

00:08:07.372 --> 00:08:08.792
You have to stand up in the moment to do that.

00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:12.142
Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back,

00:08:12.142 --> 00:08:15.114
and you have to do something that is interesting,

00:08:15.114 --> 00:08:17.711
which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.

00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:21.044
That is, you have to decide what that other person expects of you.

00:08:21.044 --> 00:08:23.998
You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind.

00:08:23.998 --> 00:08:26.851
Like a job interview. You sit across the desk from somebody,

00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:28.220
they have some prior image of you,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.971
you send signals across the desk to move their image

00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:34.891
of you from one place to a place where you want it to be.

00:08:34.891 --> 00:08:38.276
We're so good at this we don't really even notice it.

00:08:38.276 --> 00:08:42.043
These kinds of probes exploit it. Okay?

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:43.850
In doing this, what we've discovered is that humans

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.181
are literal canaries in social exchanges.

00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:49.578
Canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines.

00:08:49.578 --> 00:08:53.138
When methane built up, or carbon dioxide built up,

00:08:53.138 --> 00:08:57.324
or oxygen was diminished, the birds would swoon

00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:59.650
before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system:

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.630
Hey, get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.584
People come to the table, and even these very blunt,

00:09:05.584 --> 00:09:08.574
staged social interactions, and they, and there's just

00:09:08.574 --> 00:09:11.590
numbers going back and forth between the people,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.789
and they bring enormous sensitivities to it.

00:09:13.789 --> 00:09:16.478
So we realized we could exploit this, and in fact,

00:09:16.478 --> 00:09:19.034
as we've done that, and we've done this now in

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:21.728
many thousands of people, I think on the order of

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.893
five or six thousand. We actually, to make this

00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:26.117
a biological probe, need bigger numbers than that,

00:09:26.117 --> 00:09:29.791
remarkably so. But anyway,

00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.795
patterns have emerged, and we've been able to take

00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:35.631
those patterns, convert them into mathematical models,

00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:38.320
and use those mathematical models to gain new insights

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.451
into these exchanges. Okay, so what?

00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:43.764
Well, the so what is, that's a really nice behavioral measure,

00:09:43.764 --> 00:09:47.083
the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play.

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:49.567
We can compute that during the game.

00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:52.520
And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.850
Here's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.400
we developed a team. It was at the time in Houston, Texas.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.794
It's now in Virginia and London. And we built software

00:10:02.794 --> 00:10:06.001
that'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:10.036
up over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:12.017
at a time, but let's just focus on two.

00:10:12.017 --> 00:10:15.075
So it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world.

00:10:15.075 --> 00:10:18.244
We synchronize the machines, set them into these

00:10:18.244 --> 00:10:20.227
staged social interactions, and we eavesdrop on both

00:10:20.227 --> 00:10:21.893
of the interacting brains. So for the first time,

00:10:21.893 --> 00:10:25.500
we don't have to look at just averages over single individuals,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.397
or have individuals playing computers, or try to make

00:10:28.397 --> 00:10:31.160
inferences that way. We can study individual dyads.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.945
We can study the way that one person interacts with another person,

00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:36.509
turn the numbers up, and start to gain new insights

00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:39.024
into the boundaries of normal cognition,

00:10:39.024 --> 00:10:41.756
but more importantly, we can put people with

00:10:41.756 --> 00:10:45.093
classically defined mental illnesses, or brain damage,

00:10:45.093 --> 00:10:48.644
into these social interactions, and use these as probes of that.

00:10:48.644 --> 00:10:50.994
So we've started this effort. We've made a few hits,

00:10:50.994 --> 00:10:53.443
a few, I think, embryonic discoveries.

00:10:53.443 --> 00:10:56.255
We think there's a future to this. But it's our way

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.815
of going in and redefining, with a new lexicon,

00:10:58.815 --> 00:11:02.837
a mathematical one actually, as opposed to the standard

00:11:02.837 --> 00:11:05.415
ways that we think about mental illness,

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.482
characterizing these diseases, by using the people

00:11:07.482 --> 00:11:10.489
as birds in the exchanges. That is, we exploit the fact

00:11:10.489 --> 00:11:14.733
that the healthy partner, playing somebody with major depression,

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:17.643
or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder,

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:21.493
or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:24.712
we use that as a kind of biosensor, and then we use

00:11:24.712 --> 00:11:27.356
computer programs to model that person, and it gives us

00:11:27.356 --> 00:11:29.826
a kind of assay of this.

00:11:29.826 --> 00:11:31.957
Early days, and we're just beginning, we're setting up sites

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:35.367
around the world. Here are a few of our collaborating sites.

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:37.676
The hub, ironically enough,

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:40.565
is centered in little Roanoke, Virginia.

00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:42.834
There's another hub in London, now, and the rest

00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:46.843
are getting set up. We hope to give the data away

00:11:46.843 --> 00:11:50.516
at some stage. That's a complicated issue

00:11:50.516 --> 00:11:53.510
about making it available to the rest of the world.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.357
But we're also studying just a small part

00:11:55.357 --> 00:11:57.624
of what makes us interesting as human beings, and so

00:11:57.624 --> 00:11:59.665
I would invite other people who are interested in this

00:11:59.665 --> 00:12:02.234
to ask us for the software, or even for guidance

00:12:02.234 --> 00:12:04.453
on how to move forward with that.

00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:06.794
Let me leave you with one thought in closing.

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:08.736
The interesting thing about studying cognition

00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:12.468
has been that we've been limited, in a way.

00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:15.411
We just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains

00:12:15.411 --> 00:12:16.611
simultaneously.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:19.081
The fact is, though, that even when we're alone,

00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:23.192
we're a profoundly social creature. We're not a solitary mind

00:12:23.192 --> 00:12:27.565
built out of properties that kept it alive in the world

00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:31.513
independent of other people. In fact, our minds

00:12:31.513 --> 00:12:34.383
depend on other people. They depend on other people,

00:12:34.383 --> 00:12:35.924
and they're expressed in other people,

00:12:35.924 --> 00:12:39.576
so the notion of who you are, you often don't know

00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:42.264
who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people

00:12:42.264 --> 00:12:44.670
that are close to you, people that are enemies of you,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.215
people that are agnostic to you.

00:12:47.215 --> 00:12:50.991
So this is the first sort of step into using that insight

00:12:50.991 --> 00:12:54.286
into what makes us human beings, turning it into a tool,

00:12:54.286 --> 00:12:56.264
and trying to gain new insights into mental illness.

00:12:56.264 --> 00:12:59.385
Thanks for having me. (Applause)

00:12:59.385 --> 00:13:02.474
(Applause)
