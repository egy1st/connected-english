00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:03.968
As it turns out, when tens of millions
of people are unemployed

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:05.526
or underemployed,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.716
there's a fair amount of interest
in what technology might be doing

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.902
to the labor force.

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.815
And as I look at the conversation,

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.519
it strikes me that it's focused
on exactly the right topic,

00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:18.368
and at the same time,
it's missing the point entirely.

00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:19.933
The topic that it's focused on,

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:24.440
the question is whether or not all these
digital technologies are affecting

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:26.481
people's ability to earn a living,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.490
or, to say it a little bit different way,

00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:30.603
are the droids taking our jobs?

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:32.564
And there's some evidence that they are.

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:36.633
The Great Recession ended
when American GDP resumed

00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:39.524
its kind of slow, steady march upward,

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:42.818
and some other economic indicators
also started to rebound,

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:45.135
and they got kind of healthy
kind of quickly.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.326
Corporate profits are quite high;

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.246
in fact, if you include bank profits,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.261
they're higher than they've ever been.

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:54.772
And business investment
in gear -- in equipment

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:57.640
and hardware and software --
is at an all-time high.

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:00.979
So the businesses are getting
out their checkbooks.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.002
What they're not really doing is hiring.

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.552
So this red line

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:07.114
is the employment-to-population ratio,

00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:11.267
in other words, the percentage
of working-age people in America

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.677
who have work.

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:15.807
And we see that it cratered
during the Great Recession,

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.728
and it hasn't started
to bounce back at all.

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:21.671
But the story is not
just a recession story.

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.775
The decade that we've
just been through had

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.012
relatively anemic job growth
all throughout,

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.659
especially when we compare it
to other decades,

00:01:29.683 --> 00:01:32.713
and the 2000s are the only time
we have on record

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:36.269
where there were fewer people working
at the end of the decade

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:37.695
than at the beginning.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.392
This is not what you want to see.

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:43.107
When you graph the number
of potential employees

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.687
versus the number of jobs in the country,

00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:49.561
you see the gap gets bigger
and bigger over time,

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:52.895
and then, during the Great Recession,
it opened up in a huge way.

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:54.379
I did some quick calculations.

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:56.835
I took the last 20 years of GDP growth

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.131
and the last 20 years
of labor-productivity growth

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:02.873
and used those in a fairly
straightforward way

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:05.920
to try to project how many jobs
the economy was going to need

00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:07.247
to keep growing,

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:09.396
and this is the line that I came up with.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.162
Is that good or bad?

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:13.097
This is the government's projection

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:16.457
for the working-age
population going forward.

00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:21.579
So if these predictions are accurate,
that gap is not going to close.

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:24.629
The problem is, I don't think
these projections are accurate.

00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:28.132
In particular, I think my projection
is way too optimistic,

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:29.603
because when I did it,

00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:33.845
I was assuming that the future
was kind of going to look like the past,

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:35.538
with labor productivity growth,

00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:37.433
and that's actually not what I believe.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.806
Because when I look around,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.050
I think that we ain't seen nothing yet

00:02:41.074 --> 00:02:44.310
when it comes to technology's
impact on the labor force.

00:02:44.702 --> 00:02:48.673
Just in the past couple years,
we've seen digital tools

00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:52.930
display skills and abilities
that they never, ever had before,

00:02:52.954 --> 00:02:56.464
and that kind of eat deeply
into what we human beings

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:57.770
do for a living.

00:02:57.794 --> 00:02:59.720
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:02:59.744 --> 00:03:00.996
Throughout all of history,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.570
if you wanted something translated
from one language into another,

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:06.319
you had to involve a human being.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.798
Now we have multi-language, instantaneous,

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:14.242
automatic translation services
available for free

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.409
via many of our devices,
all the way down to smartphones.

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:19.229
And if any of us have used these,

00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:22.768
we know that they're not perfect,
but they're decent.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.252
Throughout all of history,
if you wanted something written,

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:29.613
a report or an article,
you had to involve a person.

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:31.311
Not anymore.

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:34.308
This is an article that appeared
in Forbes online a while back,

00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:35.508
about Apple's earnings.

00:03:35.532 --> 00:03:37.150
It was written by an algorithm.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.577
And it's not decent -- it's perfect.

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.778
A lot of people look at this and they say,

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:46.107
"OK, but those are very
specific, narrow tasks,

00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:49.042
and most knowledge workers
are actually generalists.

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:53.258
And what they do is sit on top of a very
large body of expertise and knowledge

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:57.079
and they use that to react on the fly
to kind of unpredictable demands,

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.223
and that's very, very hard to automate."

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:02.708
One of the most impressive
knowledge workers in recent memory

00:04:02.732 --> 00:04:04.253
is a guy named Ken Jennings.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:09.011
He won the quiz show
"Jeopardy!" 74 times in a row.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.800
Took home three million dollars.

00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:15.595
That's Ken on the right,
getting beat three-to-one

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:19.996
by Watson, the Jeopardy-playing
supercomputer from IBM.

00:04:20.642 --> 00:04:24.157
So when we look at what technology can do
to general knowledge workers,

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.259
I start to think there might not be
something so special

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:29.051
about this idea of a generalist,

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:33.405
particularly when we start doing things
like hooking Siri up to Watson,

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:36.698
and having technologies
that can understand what we're saying

00:04:36.722 --> 00:04:38.706
and repeat speech back to us.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.633
Now, Siri is far from perfect,
and we can make fun of her flaws,

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.156
but we should also keep in mind

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.544
that if technologies like Siri and Watson
improve along a Moore's law trajectory,

00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:51.090
which they will,

00:04:51.114 --> 00:04:54.704
in six years, they're not going to be two
times better or four times better,

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:58.198
they'll be 16 times better
than they are right now.

00:04:58.222 --> 00:05:02.068
So I start to think a lot of knowledge
work is going to be affected by this.

00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:05.828
And digital technologies are not
just impacting knowledge work,

00:05:05.852 --> 00:05:09.591
they're starting to flex their muscles
in the physical world as well.

00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:13.340
I had the chance a little while back
to ride in the Google autonomous car,

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:15.641
which is as cool as it sounds.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:17.853
(Laughter)

00:05:17.877 --> 00:05:22.298
And I will vouch that it handled
the stop-and-go traffic on US 101

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.575
very smoothly.

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.250
There are about three and a half million
people who drive trucks for a living

00:05:27.274 --> 00:05:28.425
in the United States;

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.517
I think some of them are going
to be affected by this technology.

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:34.641
And right now, humanoid robots
are still incredibly primitive.

00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:36.622
They can't do very much.

00:05:36.646 --> 00:05:38.618
But they're getting better quite quickly

00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:42.179
and DARPA, which is the investment arm
of the Defense Department,

00:05:42.203 --> 00:05:44.180
is trying to accelerate their trajectory.

00:05:44.204 --> 00:05:48.646
So, in short, yeah, the droids
are coming for our jobs.

00:05:49.845 --> 00:05:52.737
In the short term, we can
stimulate job growth

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:54.898
by encouraging entrepreneurship

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.836
and by investing in infrastructure,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.398
because the robots today
still aren't very good at fixing bridges.

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:02.320
But in the not-too-long-term,

00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:06.246
I think within the lifetimes
of most of the people in this room,

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.818
we're going to transition into an economy
that is very productive,

00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:12.736
but that just doesn't need
a lot of human workers.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.872
And managing that transition
is going to be the greatest challenge

00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:17.434
that our society faces.

00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:19.408
Voltaire summarized why; he said,

00:06:19.432 --> 00:06:24.611
"Work saves us from three great evils:
boredom, vice and need."

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.227
But despite this challenge --

00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:30.163
personally, I'm still
a huge digital optimist,

00:06:30.187 --> 00:06:32.391
and I am supremely confident

00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:35.003
that the digital technologies
that we're developing now

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:37.677
are going to take us
into a Utopian future,

00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:39.413
not a dystopian future.

00:06:39.437 --> 00:06:40.588
And to explain why,

00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:43.191
I want to pose a ridiculously
broad question.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:44.366
I want to ask:

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.736
what have been the most important
developments in human history?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.721
Now, I want to share some
of the answers that I've gotten

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:52.142
in response to this question.

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:55.334
It's a wonderful question to ask
and start an endless debate about,

00:06:55.358 --> 00:06:57.332
because some people are going to bring up

00:06:57.356 --> 00:07:00.656
systems of philosophy
in both the West and the East

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.903
that have changed how a lot
of people think about the world.

00:07:03.927 --> 00:07:05.420
And then other people will say,

00:07:05.444 --> 00:07:07.905
"No, actually, the big stories,
the big developments

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:10.512
are the founding
of the world's major religions,

00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:13.762
which have changed civilizations
and have changed and influenced

00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:16.380
how countless people
are living their lives."

00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:18.101
And then some other folk will say,

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:20.515
"Actually, what changes civilizations,

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.324
what modifies them and what changes
people's lives are empires,

00:07:25.348 --> 00:07:27.753
so the great developments in human history

00:07:27.777 --> 00:07:30.539
are stories of conquest and of war."

00:07:30.563 --> 00:07:33.344
And then some cheery soul
usually always pipes up and says,

00:07:33.368 --> 00:07:35.050
"Hey, don't forget about plagues!"

00:07:35.074 --> 00:07:38.983
(Laughter)

00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:41.530
There are some optimistic
answers to this question,

00:07:41.554 --> 00:07:43.968
so some people will bring up
the Age of Exploration

00:07:43.992 --> 00:07:45.537
and the opening up of the world.

00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:49.339
Others will talk about intellectual
achievements in disciplines like math

00:07:49.363 --> 00:07:51.857
that have helped us get
a better handle on the world,

00:07:51.881 --> 00:07:55.321
and other folk will talk about periods
when there was a deep flourishing

00:07:55.345 --> 00:07:56.950
of the arts and sciences.

00:07:56.974 --> 00:07:58.561
So this debate will go on and on.

00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:00.046
It's an endless debate

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.303
and there's no conclusive,
single answer to it.

00:08:03.327 --> 00:08:04.844
But if you're a geek like me,

00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:07.549
you say, "Well, what do the data say?"

00:08:07.573 --> 00:08:08.905
And you start to do things

00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:11.613
like graph things
that we might be interested in --

00:08:11.637 --> 00:08:14.716
the total worldwide
population, for example,

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.105
or some measure of social development

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.617
or the state of advancement of a society.

00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:23.764
And you start to plot the data,
because, by this approach,

00:08:23.788 --> 00:08:26.393
the big stories, the big
developments in human history,

00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:28.927
are the ones that will bend
these curves a lot.

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:31.171
So when you do this
and when you plot the data,

00:08:31.195 --> 00:08:33.887
you pretty quickly come
to some weird conclusions.

00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:35.307
You conclude, actually,

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:37.894
that none of these things
have mattered very much.

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:41.512
(Laughter)

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.333
They haven't done
a darn thing to the curves.

00:08:45.357 --> 00:08:50.047
There has been one story,
one development in human history

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.280
that bent the curve,
bent it just about 90 degrees,

00:08:53.304 --> 00:08:55.439
and it is a technology story.

00:08:55.963 --> 00:08:58.733
The steam engine and the other
associated technologies

00:08:58.757 --> 00:09:00.788
of the Industrial Revolution

00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:04.088
changed the world and influenced
human history so much,

00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:06.514
that in the words
of the historian Ian Morris,

00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:10.329
"... they made mockery out of all
that had come before."

00:09:10.353 --> 00:09:13.880
And they did this by infinitely
multiplying the power of our muscles,

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:16.298
overcoming the limitations of our muscles.

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.820
Now, what we're in the middle of now

00:09:18.844 --> 00:09:21.877
is overcoming the limitations
of our individual brains

00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:24.812
and infinitely multiplying
our mental power.

00:09:24.836 --> 00:09:28.013
How can this not be as big a deal

00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:30.741
as overcoming the limitations
of our muscles?

00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:33.625
So at the risk of repeating
myself a little bit,

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:37.402
when I look at what's going on
with digital technology these days,

00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:40.536
we are not anywhere near
through with this journey.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.066
And when I look at what is happening
to our economies and our societies,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.179
my single conclusion is that
we ain't seen nothing yet.

00:09:47.203 --> 00:09:48.929
The best days are really ahead.

00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:50.954
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:53.351
Economies don't run on energy.

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:56.414
They don't run on capital,
they don't run on labor.

00:09:56.438 --> 00:09:58.843
Economies run on ideas.

00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:02.208
So the work of innovation,
the work of coming up with new ideas,

00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:05.930
is some of the most powerful, most
fundamental work that we can do

00:10:05.954 --> 00:10:07.105
in an economy.

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:10.247
And this is kind of how
we used to do innovation.

00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:13.247
We'd find a bunch of fairly
similar-looking people ...

00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:16.767
(Laughter)

00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:18.784
We'd take them out of elite institutions,

00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:20.887
we'd put them into other
elite institutions

00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:22.497
and we'd wait for the innovation.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:23.690
Now --

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:26.143
(Laughter)

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:29.655
as a white guy who spent
his whole career at MIT and Harvard,

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.705
I've got no problem with this.

00:10:31.729 --> 00:10:34.034
(Laughter)

00:10:35.345 --> 00:10:36.552
But some other people do,

00:10:36.576 --> 00:10:38.361
and they've kind of crashed the party

00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:40.530
and loosened up
the dress code of innovation.

00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:41.586
(Laughter)

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.810
So here are the winners of a Topcoder
programming challenge,

00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:47.526
and I assure you that nobody cares

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.306
where these kids grew up,
where they went to school,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.830
or what they look like.

00:10:52.854 --> 00:10:56.697
All anyone cares about is the quality
of the work, the quality of the ideas.

00:10:56.721 --> 00:10:58.957
And over and over again,
we see this happening

00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:01.505
in the technology-facilitated world.

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:04.026
The work of innovation
is becoming more open,

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.699
more inclusive, more transparent
and more merit-based,

00:11:07.723 --> 00:11:11.421
and that's going to continue no matter
what MIT and Harvard think of it,

00:11:11.445 --> 00:11:14.010
and I couldn't be happier
about that development.

00:11:14.349 --> 00:11:16.804
I hear once in a while,
"OK, I'll grant you that,

00:11:16.828 --> 00:11:19.847
but technology is still a tool
for the rich world,

00:11:19.871 --> 00:11:21.270
and what's not happening,

00:11:21.294 --> 00:11:23.905
these digital tools are not
improving the lives

00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:26.078
of people at the bottom of the pyramid."

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.768
And I want to say to that
very clearly: nonsense.

00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:32.285
The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting
hugely from technology.

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:35.869
The economist Robert Jensen
did this wonderful study a while back

00:11:35.893 --> 00:11:37.826
where he watched, in great detail,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.468
what happened to the fishing
villages of Kerala, India,

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.373
when they got mobile phones
for the very first time.

00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:47.206
And when you write for the Quarterly
Journal of Economics,

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.112
you have to use very dry
and very circumspect language.

00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:51.398
But when I read his paper,

00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:53.629
I kind of feel Jensen
is trying to scream at us

00:11:53.653 --> 00:11:55.977
and say, "Look, this was a big deal.

00:11:56.001 --> 00:11:59.652
Prices stabilized, so people
could plan their economic lives.

00:11:59.676 --> 00:12:03.350
Waste was not reduced --
it was eliminated.

00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:05.988
And the lives of both
the buyers and the sellers

00:12:06.012 --> 00:12:08.486
in these villages measurably improved."

00:12:08.813 --> 00:12:12.603
Now, what I don't think
is that Jensen got extremely lucky

00:12:12.627 --> 00:12:14.838
and happened to land
in the one set of villages

00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:17.171
where technology made things better.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.842
What happened instead
is he very carefully documented

00:12:19.866 --> 00:12:23.945
what happens over and over again
when technology comes for the first time

00:12:23.969 --> 00:12:25.906
to an environment and a community:

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.767
the lives of people, the welfares
of people, improve dramatically.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.672
So as I look around at all the evidence

00:12:31.696 --> 00:12:34.133
and I think about the room
that we have ahead of us,

00:12:34.157 --> 00:12:35.985
I become a huge digital optimist

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:40.585
and I start to think that this wonderful
statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson

00:12:40.609 --> 00:12:42.347
is actually not hyperbole.

00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:44.880
This is an accurate assessment
of what's going on.

00:12:44.904 --> 00:12:47.602
Our technologies are great gifts,

00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:50.673
and we, right now,
have the great good fortune

00:12:50.697 --> 00:12:54.427
to be living at a time when
digital technology is flourishing,

00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:57.846
when it is broadening and deepening
and becoming more profound

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.148
all around the world.

00:12:59.172 --> 00:13:02.447
So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,

00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:06.042
but focusing on that fact
misses the point entirely.

00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:09.566
The point is that then we
are freed up to do other things,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.877
and what we're going to do,
I am very confident,

00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:14.417
what we're going to do is reduce poverty

00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:16.910
and drudgery and misery around the world.

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:20.939
I'm very confident we're going to learn
to live more lightly on the planet,

00:13:20.963 --> 00:13:24.388
and I am extremely confident
that what we're going to do

00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:25.787
with our new digital tools

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:28.803
is going to be so profound
and so beneficial

00:13:28.827 --> 00:13:32.311
that it's going to make a mockery
out of everything that came before.

00:13:32.335 --> 00:13:33.891
I'm going to leave the last word

00:13:33.915 --> 00:13:36.569
to a guy who had a front-row seat
for digital progress,

00:13:36.593 --> 00:13:38.165
our old friend Ken Jennings.

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:40.432
I'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:

00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:43.372
"I, for one, welcome our new
computer overlords."

00:13:43.396 --> 00:13:44.477
(Laughter)

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:45.985
Thanks very much.

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:47.167
(Applause)
