00:00:00.671 --> 00:00:03.456
Hi. So, this chap here,

00:00:03.456 --> 00:00:05.718
he thinks he can tell you the future.

00:00:05.718 --> 00:00:07.697
His name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have

00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:11.367
made him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter)

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:14.270
And like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.378
that people can see into the future.

00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:18.082
I don't believe in precognition, and every now and then,

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:21.264
you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future,

00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:24.323
and that's probably because it was a fluke, and we only

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:26.938
hear about the flukes and about the freaks.

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:31.017
We don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong.

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:33.177
Now we expect that to happen with silly stories

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:36.316
about precognition, but the problem is,

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:39.660
we have exactly the same problem in academia

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.161
and in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives.

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.526
So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out,

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:50.055
just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:51.891
a piece of research where he found evidence

00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:55.549
of precognitive powers in undergraduate students,

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.123
and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal

00:00:58.123 --> 00:01:00.404
and most of the people who read this just said, "Okay, well,

00:01:00.404 --> 00:01:02.585
fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:05.419
that if I did a study where I found no evidence

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:07.931
that undergraduate students had precognitive powers,

00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:11.483
it probably wouldn't get published in a journal.

00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:14.338
And in fact, we know that that's true, because

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:16.867
several different groups of research scientists tried

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:20.387
to replicate the findings of this precognition study,

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:23.022
and when they submitted it to the exact same journal,

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:26.174
the journal said, "No, we're not interested in publishing

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:30.699
replication. We're not interested in your negative data."

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:33.453
So this is already evidence of how, in the academic

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:38.323
literature, we will see a biased sample of the true picture

00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:41.790
of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.219
But it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.586
It also happens in, for example, cancer research.

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:54.663
So in March, 2012, just one month ago, some researchers

00:01:54.663 --> 00:01:57.559
reported in the journal Nature how they had tried

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:01.405
to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at

00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:04.960
potential treatment targets in cancer,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.598
and out of those 53 studies, they were only able

00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:10.674
to successfully replicate six.

00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:15.007
Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable.

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.920
And they say in their discussion that this is very likely

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.559
because freaks get published.

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.655
People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies,

00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:25.775
and the occasions when it works they will publish,

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:27.454
and the ones where it doesn't work they won't.

00:02:27.454 --> 00:02:31.395
And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem,

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:34.684
because it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys,

00:02:34.684 --> 00:02:36.390
their first recommendation of how to fix this problem

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.783
is to make it easier to publish negative results in science,

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:42.690
and to change the incentives so that scientists are

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.042
encouraged to post more of their negative results in public.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.894
But it doesn't just happen in the very dry world

00:02:50.894 --> 00:02:54.745
of preclinical basic science cancer research.

00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:58.402
It also happens in the very real, flesh and blood

00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:01.993
of academic medicine. So in 1980,

00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:05.001
some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide,

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:07.332
and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug,

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.583
a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms,

00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:11.826
and the idea was, after people have had a heart attack,

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:13.363
they're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms,

00:03:13.363 --> 00:03:15.740
so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.453
rhythms, this will increase the chances of them surviving.

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:22.461
Early on its development, they did a very small trial,

00:03:22.461 --> 00:03:24.105
just under a hundred patients.

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:27.757
Fifty patients got lorcainide, and of those patients, 10 died.

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:30.800
Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.758
with no active ingredient, and only one of them died.

00:03:33.758 --> 00:03:36.407
So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure,

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:39.276
and its commercial development was stopped, and because

00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:43.624
its commercial development was stopped, this trial was never published.

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:49.021
Unfortunately, over the course of the next five, 10 years,

00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:52.846
other companies had the same idea about drugs that would

00:03:52.846 --> 00:03:55.438
prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks.

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:57.158
These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed

00:03:57.158 --> 00:04:00.570
very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.413
and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs

00:04:04.413 --> 00:04:07.324
also caused an increased rate of death

00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:10.071
that before we detected that safety signal,

00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:16.122
over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:19.573
from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs.

00:04:19.573 --> 00:04:23.171
Now actually, in 1993,

00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:26.731
the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study,

00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:30.572
published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community,

00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:33.697
in which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980,

00:04:33.697 --> 00:04:35.633
we thought that the increased death rate that occurred

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:38.991
in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."

00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:41.023
The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons,

00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:42.661
and this study was never published;

00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:45.047
it's now a good example of publication bias.

00:04:45.047 --> 00:04:46.938
That's the technical term for the phenomenon where

00:04:46.938 --> 00:04:51.176
unflattering data gets lost, gets unpublished, is left

00:04:51.176 --> 00:04:54.547
missing in action, and they say the results described here

00:04:54.547 --> 00:04:59.355
"might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead."

00:04:59.355 --> 00:05:02.568
Now these are stories from basic science.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:07.355
These are stories from 20, 30 years ago.

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:10.502
The academic publishing environment is very different now.

00:05:10.502 --> 00:05:14.497
There are academic journals like "Trials," the open access journal,

00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:17.152
which will publish any trial conducted in humans

00:05:17.152 --> 00:05:20.455
regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.

00:05:20.455 --> 00:05:24.424
But this problem of negative results that go missing in action

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:27.983
is still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent

00:05:27.983 --> 00:05:33.834
that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:36.849
So this is a drug called reboxetine, and this is a drug

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.384
that I myself have prescribed. It's an antidepressant.

00:05:39.384 --> 00:05:41.920
And I'm a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.972
that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:47.919
that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo,

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.783
and I read the other three studies that were published

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:53.354
that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant,

00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:55.541
and because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants,

00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.007
I thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try.

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:01.399
But it turned out that I was misled. In fact,

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.848
seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine

00:06:03.848 --> 00:06:06.560
against a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.872
was positive and that was published, but six of them

00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:12.920
were negative and they were left unpublished.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.659
Three trials were published comparing reboxetine

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.885
against other antidepressants in which reboxetine

00:06:16.885 --> 00:06:18.678
was just as good, and they were published,

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:23.067
but three times as many patients' worth of data was collected

00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:24.938
which showed that reboxetine was worse than

00:06:24.938 --> 00:06:29.639
those other treatments, and those trials were not published.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.398
I felt misled.

00:06:33.398 --> 00:06:35.528
Now you might say, well, that's an extremely unusual example,

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.536
and I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of

00:06:37.536 --> 00:06:40.517
cherry-picking and selective referencing

00:06:40.517 --> 00:06:42.308
that I'm accusing other people of.

00:06:42.308 --> 00:06:44.192
But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias

00:06:44.192 --> 00:06:46.319
has actually been very, very well studied.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.537
So here is one example of how you approach it.

00:06:48.537 --> 00:06:50.977
The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:53.162
you know that they've been conducted and completed,

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:55.483
and then you go and see if they've been published anywhere

00:06:55.483 --> 00:06:58.346
in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials

00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:00.500
that had ever been conducted on antidepressants

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.142
that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA.

00:07:04.142 --> 00:07:07.898
They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package.

00:07:07.898 --> 00:07:11.098
So that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs,

00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.196
because we can never know if we have those,

00:07:13.196 --> 00:07:16.690
but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.039
And then they went to see if these trials had been published

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.611
in the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found.

00:07:21.611 --> 00:07:24.780
It was pretty much a 50-50 split. Half of these trials

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.377
were positive, half of them were negative, in reality.

00:07:28.377 --> 00:07:33.118
But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature,

00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:35.352
what they found was a very different picture.

00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:39.724
Only three of the negative trials were published,

00:07:39.724 --> 00:07:44.366
but all but one of the positive trials were published.

00:07:44.366 --> 00:07:48.127
Now if we just flick back and forth between those two,

00:07:48.127 --> 00:07:50.721
you can see what a staggering difference there was

00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:54.171
between reality and what doctors, patients,

00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:56.793
commissioners of health services, and academics

00:07:56.793 --> 00:08:00.074
were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature.

00:08:00.074 --> 00:08:04.528
We were misled, and this is a systematic flaw

00:08:04.528 --> 00:08:07.858
in the core of medicine.

00:08:07.858 --> 00:08:10.521
In fact, there have been so many studies conducted on

00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:13.905
publication bias now, over a hundred, that they've been

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:17.099
collected in a systematic review, published in 2010,

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:19.865
that took every single study on publication bias

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:21.164
that they could find.

00:08:21.164 --> 00:08:24.016
Publication bias affects every field of medicine.

00:08:24.016 --> 00:08:28.329
About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action,

00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:31.387
and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely

00:08:31.387 --> 00:08:34.441
to be published as negative findings.

00:08:34.441 --> 00:08:38.502
This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine.

00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:42.373
If I flipped a coin 100 times but then

00:08:42.373 --> 00:08:45.632
withheld the results from you from half of those tosses,

00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:49.032
I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads.

00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:50.838
But that wouldn't mean that I had a two-headed coin.

00:08:50.853 --> 00:08:52.565
That would mean that I was a chancer

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.679
and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter)

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:59.316
But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:03.105
in the whole of evidence-based medicine.

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:07.537
And to me, this is research misconduct.

00:09:07.537 --> 00:09:10.280
If I conducted one study and I withheld

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.280
half of the data points from that one study,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.987
you would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud.

00:09:17.987 --> 00:09:20.770
And yet, for some reason, if somebody conducts

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.328
10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want,

00:09:25.328 --> 00:09:28.116
we don't consider that to be research misconduct.

00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:30.683
And when that responsibility is diffused between

00:09:30.683 --> 00:09:33.844
a whole network of researchers, academics,

00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:37.372
industry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason

00:09:37.372 --> 00:09:38.825
we find it more acceptable,

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:42.500
but the effect on patients is damning.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.518
And this is happening right now, today.

00:09:47.518 --> 00:09:50.229
This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug

00:09:50.229 --> 00:09:52.825
which governments around the world have spent billions

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:55.397
and billions of dollars on stockpiling,

00:09:55.397 --> 00:09:58.545
and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic,

00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:02.494
in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza.

00:10:02.494 --> 00:10:05.178
Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia

00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:09.992
and death. (Laughter)

00:10:09.992 --> 00:10:13.200
Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.725
were trying to collect together all of the data from all

00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:19.373
of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not,

00:10:19.373 --> 00:10:22.324
they found that several of those trials were unpublished.

00:10:22.324 --> 00:10:24.166
The results were unavailable to them.

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:28.130
And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means,

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.812
through Freedom of Information Act requests, through

00:10:29.812 --> 00:10:34.621
harassing various different organizations, what they found was inconsistent.

00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:37.087
And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports,

00:10:37.087 --> 00:10:40.133
the 10,000-page long documents that have

00:10:40.133 --> 00:10:43.733
the best possible rendition of the information,

00:10:43.733 --> 00:10:46.621
they were told they weren't allowed to have them.

00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:49.304
And if you want to read the full correspondence

00:10:49.304 --> 00:10:52.594
and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company,

00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:55.311
you can see that written up in this week's edition

00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:59.678
of PLOS Medicine.

00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:03.537
And the most staggering thing of all of this, to me,

00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:06.836
is that not only is this a problem, not only do we recognize

00:11:06.836 --> 00:11:11.031
that this is a problem, but we've had to suffer fake fixes.

00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:14.089
We've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed.

00:11:14.089 --> 00:11:16.277
First of all, we had trials registers, and everybody said,

00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:19.880
oh, it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials, they'll post the protocol,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.904
they'll say what they're going to do before they do it,

00:11:21.904 --> 00:11:24.025
and then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which

00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:26.493
have been conducted and completed have been published.

00:11:26.493 --> 00:11:28.689
But people didn't bother to use those registers.

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:31.308
And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along,

00:11:31.308 --> 00:11:32.851
and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line.

00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:35.484
We won't publish any journals, we won't publish any trials,

00:11:35.484 --> 00:11:38.166
unless they've been registered before they began.

00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:41.697
But they didn't hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted

00:11:41.697 --> 00:11:44.712
which showed that half of all of trials published by journals

00:11:44.712 --> 00:11:47.379
edited by members of the ICMJE

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:52.192
weren't properly registered, and a quarter of them weren't registered at all.

00:11:52.192 --> 00:11:54.993
And then finally, the FDA Amendment Act was passed

00:11:54.993 --> 00:11:57.342
a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.785
a trial must post the results of that trial within one year.

00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:04.881
And in the BMJ, in the first edition of January, 2012,

00:12:04.881 --> 00:12:07.585
you can see a study which looks to see if people kept

00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:11.304
to that ruling, and it turns out that only one in five

00:12:11.304 --> 00:12:14.168
have done so.

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:17.451
This is a disaster.

00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:21.015
We cannot know the true effects of the medicines

00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:24.231
that we prescribe if we do not have access

00:12:24.231 --> 00:12:27.411
to all of the information.

00:12:27.411 --> 00:12:31.370
And this is not a difficult problem to fix.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:36.498
We need to force people to publish all trials

00:12:36.498 --> 00:12:39.469
conducted in humans, including the older trials,

00:12:39.469 --> 00:12:43.414
because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008,

00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:46.027
and I don't know what world it is in which we're only

00:12:46.027 --> 00:12:50.483
practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years.

00:12:50.483 --> 00:12:52.588
We need to publish all trials in humans,

00:12:52.588 --> 00:12:55.662
including the older trials, for all drugs in current use,

00:12:55.662 --> 00:12:58.578
and you need to tell everyone you know

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:02.020
that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.971
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:08.244
(Applause)
