00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:02.858
I've always written primarily about architecture,

00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:05.383
about buildings, and writing about architecture

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:08.124
is based on certain assumptions.

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:10.582
An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place,

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:13.062
or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:16.336
a city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:18.733
of politics and culture and economics that shapes

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.736
these places, at the end of the day, you can go

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:24.392
and you can visit them. You can walk around them.

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:26.065
You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:29.558
You can experience their sense of place.

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:31.907
But what was striking to me over the last several years

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:35.282
was that less and less was I going out into the world,

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:38.511
and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.

00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:42.831
And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone,

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:44.707
I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day,

00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:46.804
but I was also getting up at the end of the day

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:50.104
and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.

00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:52.963
And what was surprising to me was how quickly

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:55.900
my relationship to the physical world had changed.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.675
In this very short period of time, you know, whether you

00:00:57.675 --> 00:01:01.131
call it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last,

00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:04.090
you know, four or five years of being online all the time,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.264
our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:09.063
our attention is constantly divided. You know,

00:01:09.063 --> 00:01:11.627
we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking

00:01:11.627 --> 00:01:13.459
out in the world around us.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.986
And what was even more striking to me, and what I really

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:18.988
got hung up on, was that the world inside the screen

00:01:18.988 --> 00:01:22.777
seemed to have no physical reality of its own.

00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:25.545
If you went and looked for images of the Internet,

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.663
this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte

00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:31.793
of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse

00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:33.889
where we don't seem to be anywhere on it.

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.313
We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:39.930
It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.660
the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.357
I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.

00:01:45.357 --> 00:01:49.042
We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.407
So if there was this world and this screen, and if there was

00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:55.264
the physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them

00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:58.245
together in the same place.

00:01:58.245 --> 00:02:01.452
And then this happened.

00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:04.050
My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.784
and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:08.911
the dusty clump of cables behind the couch,

00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.121
and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard,

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.997
and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.

00:02:14.997 --> 00:02:17.551
And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire,

00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:20.342
and he said, "There's your problem.

00:02:20.342 --> 00:02:24.763
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet." (Laughter)

00:02:24.763 --> 00:02:27.890
And this seemed astounding. The Internet is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.264
a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed

00:02:31.264 --> 00:02:34.719
everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.348
It was unequivocally not something

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:40.659
a squirrel could chew on. (Laughter)

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.537
But that in fact seemed to be the case.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.739
A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet. (Laughter)

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.926
And then I got this image in my head of what would happen

00:02:47.926 --> 00:02:50.106
if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:51.710
to follow it. Where would it go?

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.218
Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?

00:02:55.218 --> 00:02:56.567
Could I go there? Who would I meet?

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:59.943
You know, was there something actually out there?

00:02:59.943 --> 00:03:02.980
And the answer, by all accounts, was no.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.760
This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.190
as represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.749
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben,

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.831
because that's where you get the best reception,

00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:19.136
but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:22.308
for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.

00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:24.682
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it

00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:27.548
for a short while, and she looks at it and she says,

00:03:27.548 --> 00:03:30.938
"This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"

00:03:30.938 --> 00:03:34.898
They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:37.215
And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing

00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:39.511
that only fools seem to look for.

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.346
The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.592
black box with a blinking red light on it.

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:46.920
It wasn't a real world out there.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.232
But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there,

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:51.998
and that's what I spent about two years visiting,

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:55.543
these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers

00:03:55.543 --> 00:03:58.188
that use as much power as the cities in which they sit,

00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:01.377
and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York,

00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:03.085
which is one of the buildings in the world,

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:05.983
one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings,

00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:08.627
where more networks of the Internet connect to each other

00:04:08.627 --> 00:04:09.985
than anywhere else.

00:04:09.985 --> 00:04:12.602
And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.

00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:15.087
It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:18.029
a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is,

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.460
connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.154
the ceiling and down into the router of another network,

00:04:23.154 --> 00:04:27.531
and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.

00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:30.824
A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others,

00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:33.150
has 10 times more networks connecting within it

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.998
than the next tier of buildings.

00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:37.066
There's a very short list of these places.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:39.974
And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home

00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:42.563
to about a half a dozen very important networks,

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:44.861
which are the networks which serve the undersea cables

00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:47.209
that travel underneath the ocean

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.462
that connect Europe and America and connect all of us.

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:53.049
And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.

00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:56.909
If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live

00:04:56.925 --> 00:04:59.365
in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.470
the ocean, cables like this.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.356
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.

00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:07.298
You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.

00:05:07.298 --> 00:05:11.361
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive,

00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:13.001
as expansive as you can imagine.

00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:15.556
They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five

00:05:15.556 --> 00:05:18.167
or eight thousand miles in length, and

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:20.776
if the material science and the computational technology

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:24.309
is incredibly complicated, the basic physical process

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:28.089
is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.374
and comes out on the other, and it usually comes

00:05:31.374 --> 00:05:34.007
from a building called a landing station that's often

00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:36.954
tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood,

00:05:36.954 --> 00:05:39.688
and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor

00:05:39.688 --> 00:05:42.208
that look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.865
they amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission

00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:49.071
is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second

00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:51.569
wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.753
connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams,

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:58.031
but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light

00:05:58.031 --> 00:06:00.988
through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe

00:06:00.988 --> 00:06:04.007
50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light

00:06:04.007 --> 00:06:06.875
through a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:09.477
eight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.

00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:12.967
And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.

00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:14.796
And then they connect to the continent somewhere.

00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:17.134
They connect in a manhole like this. Literally,

00:06:17.134 --> 00:06:20.223
this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.

00:06:20.223 --> 00:06:24.713
This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.

00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:27.694
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago,

00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:29.590
when I started thinking about this, there was one cable

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.757
down the Western coast of Africa, represented

00:06:32.757 --> 00:06:35.631
in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.

00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:40.476
Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.

00:06:40.476 --> 00:06:43.107
Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable,

00:06:43.107 --> 00:06:44.907
they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build

00:06:44.907 --> 00:06:47.723
an industry around it, they need to know that their connection

00:06:47.723 --> 00:06:50.433
isn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks,

00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:52.500
you have to send a ship out into the water, throw

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.415
a grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end,

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.458
and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.

00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:02.998
It's an intensely, intensely physical process.

00:07:02.998 --> 00:07:07.296
So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently

00:07:07.296 --> 00:07:09.968
worked for Tata Communications, the communications wing

00:07:09.968 --> 00:07:12.966
of Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.948
And I've never met him. We've only communicated

00:07:15.948 --> 00:07:19.405
via this telepresence system, which always makes me

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:23.301
think of him as the man inside the Internet. (Laughter)

00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:26.498
And he is English. The undersea cable industry

00:07:26.498 --> 00:07:30.143
is dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.

00:07:30.143 --> 00:07:33.318
(Laughter) Because they all started at the same time

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:35.818
with the boom about 20 years ago.

00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:39.078
And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business

00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:41.543
when they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic

00:07:41.543 --> 00:07:44.703
and one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces

00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:48.247
onto them, until they had built a belt around the world,

00:07:48.247 --> 00:07:50.344
which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.

00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:52.567
They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world,

00:07:52.567 --> 00:07:54.778
and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around

00:07:54.778 --> 00:07:57.963
the other direction. And then having done that,

00:07:57.963 --> 00:08:01.907
they started to look for places to wire next.

00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:04.397
They looked for the unwired places, and that's meant

00:08:04.397 --> 00:08:07.191
North and South, primarily these cables to Africa.

00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:10.962
But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.

00:08:10.962 --> 00:08:13.921
He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:17.234
And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see

00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:20.086
one of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time

00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:22.406
online we experience these fleeting moments of connection,

00:08:22.406 --> 00:08:25.700
these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.540
or an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.616
It seemed like there was a moment when the continent

00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:33.963
was being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.

00:08:33.963 --> 00:08:36.248
And Simon was working on a new cable,

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:38.759
WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:40.880
from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.749
to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.

00:08:43.749 --> 00:08:46.082
And he said there was coming soon, depending

00:08:46.082 --> 00:08:48.276
on the weather, but he'd let me know when,

00:08:48.276 --> 00:08:51.477
and so with about four days notice, he said to go

00:08:51.477 --> 00:08:54.308
to this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9,

00:08:54.308 --> 00:08:58.004
this guy will walk out of the water. (Laughter)

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:02.324
And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line,

00:09:02.324 --> 00:09:05.037
called a messenger line, and that was the first link

00:09:05.037 --> 00:09:07.590
between sea and land, this link that would then be

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.453
leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.

00:09:11.453 --> 00:09:14.043
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this

00:09:14.043 --> 00:09:17.400
specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.148
on these buoys until it was in the right place.

00:09:20.148 --> 00:09:22.890
Then you can see the English engineers looking on.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.703
And then, once it was in the right place, he got back

00:09:25.703 --> 00:09:29.062
in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off,

00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:31.361
and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable

00:09:31.361 --> 00:09:33.266
dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out

00:09:33.266 --> 00:09:35.139
to the ship, and when he got there,

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:37.552
they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie,

00:09:37.552 --> 00:09:39.971
and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,

00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:47.131
and then he lit a cigarette. (Laughter)

00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:49.843
And then once that cable was on shore,

00:09:49.843 --> 00:09:53.347
they began to prepare to connect it to the other side,

00:09:53.347 --> 00:09:56.304
for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.162
And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start

00:09:59.162 --> 00:10:02.098
sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a --

00:10:02.098 --> 00:10:04.160
sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.868
like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up

00:10:06.868 --> 00:10:08.545
with the cable that had come down,

00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:11.536
and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.

00:10:11.536 --> 00:10:14.867
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw,

00:10:14.867 --> 00:10:17.510
you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.447
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.

00:10:21.447 --> 00:10:23.955
And what surprised me as well was that as much as this

00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:26.802
is based on the most sophisticated technology, as much

00:10:26.802 --> 00:10:29.707
as this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process

00:10:29.707 --> 00:10:33.474
itself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.

00:10:33.474 --> 00:10:35.463
You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer

00:10:35.463 --> 00:10:38.638
giving directions in the background. And more importantly,

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.281
the places are the same. These cables still connect

00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:44.331
these classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa,

00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:47.490
Mumbai, Singapore, New York.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.576
And then the process on shore takes around three or four days,

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:55.767
and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover

00:10:55.767 --> 00:10:58.738
back on top, and they push the sand over that,

00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:01.820
and we all forget about it.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.071
And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud,

00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:05.981
but every time we put something on the cloud,

00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:08.183
we give up some responsibility for it.

00:11:08.183 --> 00:11:12.047
We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.330
And that doesn't seem right.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.672
There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says

00:11:15.672 --> 00:11:20.069
that wired people should know something about wires.

00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:22.339
And we should know, I think, we should know

00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:25.092
where our Internet comes from, and we should know

00:11:25.092 --> 00:11:29.914
what it is that physically, physically connects us all.

00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:32.253
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:32.253 --> 00:11:34.650
(Applause)

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.260
Thanks. (Applause)
