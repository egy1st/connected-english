00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:25.568
(Music)

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:25.924
(Applause)

00:02:25.924 --> 00:02:31.284
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.957
Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here.

00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:36.881
A few weeks ago, I saw a video on YouTube

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:39.161
of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords

00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:41.320
at the early stages of her recovery

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.505
from one of those awful bullets.

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:45.626
This one entered her left hemisphere, and

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:49.142
knocked out her Broca's area, the speech center of her brain.

00:02:49.142 --> 00:02:53.048
And in this session, Gabby's working with a speech therapist,

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.837
and she's struggling to produce

00:02:54.837 --> 00:02:57.949
some of the most basic words, and you can see her

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.128
growing more and more devastated, until she ultimately

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:04.004
breaks down into sobbing tears, and she starts sobbing

00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:07.980
wordlessly into the arms of her therapist.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.297
And after a few moments, her therapist tries a new tack,

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:11.932
and they start singing together,

00:03:11.932 --> 00:03:14.073
and Gabby starts to sing through her tears,

00:03:14.073 --> 00:03:16.736
and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:19.197
the words to a song that describe the way she feels,

00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:22.117
and she sings, in one descending scale, she sings,

00:03:22.117 --> 00:03:25.726
"Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine."

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:28.707
And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:32.271
the beauty of music has the ability to speak

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:37.047
where words fail, in this case literally speak.

00:03:37.047 --> 00:03:38.800
Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.601
of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug,

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:45.352
one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard,

00:03:45.352 --> 00:03:47.771
and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called

00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:52.784
Melodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now.

00:03:52.784 --> 00:03:57.107
Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic,

00:03:57.107 --> 00:04:01.757
could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences,

00:04:01.757 --> 00:04:05.060
but they could still sing the lyrics to a song,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.009
whether it was "Happy Birthday To You"

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.647
or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones.

00:04:09.647 --> 00:04:12.586
And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons,

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:16.588
he found that the music was able to literally rewire

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:19.040
the brains of his patients and create a homologous

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.932
speech center in their right hemisphere

00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:24.431
to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.816
When I was 17, I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab, and in one afternoon

00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:30.332
he walked me through some of the leading research

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:34.167
on music and the brain -- how musicians had

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:37.231
fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians,

00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:38.741
how music, and listening to music,

00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:40.995
could just light up the entire brain, from

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:44.469
our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum,

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.296
how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality

00:04:47.296 --> 00:04:50.919
to help children with autism, to help people struggling

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.704
with stress and anxiety and depression,

00:04:53.704 --> 00:04:57.119
how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:00.500
and their gait would steady when they listened to music,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.909
and how late-stage Alzheimer's patients, whose dementia

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.805
was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:09.591
their family, could still pick out a tune by Chopin

00:05:09.591 --> 00:05:13.253
at the piano that they had learned when they were children.

00:05:13.253 --> 00:05:16.300
But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.518
and it was this: that I was at a crossroads in my life,

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:22.303
trying to choose between music and medicine.

00:05:22.303 --> 00:05:25.264
I had just completed my undergraduate, and I was working

00:05:25.264 --> 00:05:28.137
as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe,

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:31.600
studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard, and I had fallen

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.467
in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:38.245
I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes,

00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:42.362
these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:45.193
and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant

00:05:45.193 --> 00:05:48.982
tuberculosis, or with children with disfiguring cancers.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.906
I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor,

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:53.910
that doctor without borders.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.453
On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.

00:05:57.453 --> 00:06:01.195
Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:04.358
It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied

00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:07.437
at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and to have played

00:06:07.437 --> 00:06:11.792
my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv,

00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:13.830
and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.054
had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory,

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:19.437
but had given up his love for music to pursue a career

00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:23.118
in medicine. And that afternoon, I had to ask him,

00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:25.654
"How was it for you making that decision?"

00:06:25.654 --> 00:06:27.683
And he said that there were still times when he wished

00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:30.455
he could go back and play the organ the way he used to,

00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:33.672
and that for me, medical school could wait,

00:06:33.672 --> 00:06:36.447
but that the violin simply would not.

00:06:36.447 --> 00:06:39.007
And after two more years of studying music, I decided

00:06:39.007 --> 00:06:41.816
to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT

00:06:41.816 --> 00:06:44.392
and applying to medical school like a good Indian son

00:06:44.392 --> 00:06:47.250
to become the next Dr. Gupta. (Laughter)

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.882
And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took

00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:52.825
an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic.

00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:55.827
It was my first audition, and after three days of playing

00:06:55.827 --> 00:06:58.853
behind a screen in a trial week, I was offered the position.

00:06:58.853 --> 00:07:02.771
And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform

00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:06.271
in an orchestra, to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall

00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:09.855
in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel,

00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:12.841
but much more importantly to me to be surrounded

00:07:12.841 --> 00:07:16.731
by musicians and mentors that became my new family,

00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:19.925
my new musical home.

00:07:19.925 --> 00:07:23.635
But a year later, I met another musician who had also

00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:26.724
studied at Juilliard, one who profoundly helped me

00:07:26.724 --> 00:07:31.082
find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician.

00:07:31.082 --> 00:07:34.363
Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard, but

00:07:34.363 --> 00:07:38.102
he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s,

00:07:38.102 --> 00:07:40.448
was treated with thorazine at Bellevue,

00:07:40.448 --> 00:07:43.924
and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row

00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:46.370
in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.815
Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness

00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:52.673
and mental health advocacy throughout the United States,

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:54.818
as told through the book and the movie "The Soloist,"

00:07:54.818 --> 00:07:57.964
but I became his friend, and I became his violin teacher,

00:07:57.964 --> 00:08:00.474
and I told him that wherever he had his violin,

00:08:00.474 --> 00:08:03.445
and wherever I had mine, I would play a lesson with him.

00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:06.124
And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row,

00:08:06.124 --> 00:08:08.933
I witnessed how music was able to bring him back

00:08:08.933 --> 00:08:11.900
from his very darkest moments, from what seemed to me

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.860
in my untrained eye to be

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.660
the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.914
Playing for Nathaniel, the music took on a deeper meaning,

00:08:20.914 --> 00:08:23.472
because now it was about communication,

00:08:23.472 --> 00:08:26.382
a communication where words failed, a communication

00:08:26.382 --> 00:08:29.540
of a message that went deeper than words, that registered

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.029
at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche,

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:37.576
yet came as a true musical offering from me.

00:08:37.576 --> 00:08:41.553
I found myself growing outraged that someone

00:08:41.553 --> 00:08:45.462
like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row

00:08:45.462 --> 00:08:48.801
because of his mental illness, yet how many tens of thousands

00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:51.906
of others there were out there on Skid Row alone

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:56.662
who had stories as tragic as his, but were never going to have a book or a movie

00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:58.924
made about them that got them off the streets?

00:08:58.924 --> 00:09:02.937
And at the very core of this crisis of mine, I felt somehow

00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:07.032
the life of music had chosen me, where somehow,

00:09:07.032 --> 00:09:10.001
perhaps possibly in a very naive sense, I felt what Skid Row

00:09:10.001 --> 00:09:13.012
really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer

00:09:13.012 --> 00:09:17.153
and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill.

00:09:17.153 --> 00:09:19.203
But in the end, it was Nathaniel who showed me

00:09:19.203 --> 00:09:21.930
that if I was truly passionate about change,

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.253
if I wanted to make a difference, I already had the perfect instrument to do it,

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:31.022
that music was the bridge that connected my world and his.

00:09:31.022 --> 00:09:32.694
There's a beautiful quote

00:09:32.694 --> 00:09:35.158
by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann,

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:40.367
who said, "To send light into the darkness of men's hearts,

00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:42.792
such is the duty of the artist."

00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:45.228
And this is a particularly poignant quote

00:09:45.228 --> 00:09:47.967
because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:50.075
and died in asylum.

00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:52.537
And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel,

00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:54.901
I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians

00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:58.094
called Street Symphony, bringing the light of music

00:09:58.094 --> 00:10:00.738
into the very darkest places, performing

00:10:00.738 --> 00:10:03.325
for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics

00:10:03.325 --> 00:10:07.355
on Skid Row, performing for combat veterans

00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:10.765
with post-traumatic stress disorder, and for the incarcerated

00:10:10.765 --> 00:10:14.569
and those labeled as criminally insane.

00:10:14.569 --> 00:10:16.962
After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital

00:10:16.962 --> 00:10:19.483
in San Bernardino, a woman walked up to us

00:10:19.483 --> 00:10:21.800
and she had tears streaming down her face,

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.266
and she had a palsy, she was shaking,

00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:27.288
and she had this gorgeous smile, and she said

00:10:27.288 --> 00:10:29.270
that she had never heard classical music before,

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.696
she didn't think she was going to like it, she had never

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:35.798
heard a violin before, but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine,

00:10:35.798 --> 00:10:39.167
and that nobody ever came to visit them, and that for the first time in six years,

00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:43.970
when she heard us play, she stopped shaking without medication.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.928
Suddenly, what we're finding with these concerts,

00:10:46.928 --> 00:10:49.970
away from the stage, away from the footlights, out

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.591
of the tuxedo tails, the musicians become the conduit

00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:56.713
for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits

00:10:56.713 --> 00:10:59.806
of music on the brain to an audience that would never

00:10:59.806 --> 00:11:01.608
have access to this room,

00:11:01.608 --> 00:11:07.440
would never have access to the kind of music that we make.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.871
Just as medicine serves to heal more

00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:14.169
than the building blocks of the body alone,

00:11:14.169 --> 00:11:17.936
the power and beauty of music transcends the "E"

00:11:17.936 --> 00:11:20.671
in the middle of our beloved acronym.

00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:24.309
Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.319
The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:30.576
hear an opera by Wagner, or a symphony by Brahms,

00:11:30.576 --> 00:11:34.222
or chamber music by Beethoven, compels us to remember

00:11:34.222 --> 00:11:38.130
our shared, common humanity, the deeply communal

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.545
connected consciousness, the empathic consciousness

00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:45.118
that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired

00:11:45.118 --> 00:11:48.194
into our brain's right hemisphere.

00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:51.590
And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.751
of mental illness within homelessness

00:11:53.751 --> 00:11:56.534
and incarceration, the music and the beauty of music

00:11:56.534 --> 00:12:01.166
offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them,

00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:04.548
to remember that they still have the capacity to experience

00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:08.500
something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.361
And the spark of that beauty, the spark of that humanity

00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:14.161
transforms into hope,

00:12:14.161 --> 00:12:17.121
and we know, whether we choose the path of music

00:12:17.121 --> 00:12:20.330
or of medicine, that's the very first thing we must instill

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.269
within our communities, within our audiences,

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:26.200
if we want to inspire healing from within.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.876
I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats,

00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:30.921
the Romantic English poet,

00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:33.859
a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know.

00:12:33.859 --> 00:12:36.878
Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine

00:12:36.878 --> 00:12:40.199
to pursue poetry, but he died when he was a year older than me.

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:45.272
And Keats said, "Beauty is truth, and truth beauty.

00:12:45.272 --> 00:12:51.770
That is all ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know."

00:12:54.527 --> 00:15:38.650
(Music)

00:15:38.650 --> 00:16:07.126
(Applause)
