00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:04.831
When I was considering a career in the art world,

00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.125
I took a course in London,

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:12.578
and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:16.539
called Pietro, who drank too much,

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.028
smoked too much and swore much too much.

00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:25.204
But he was a passionate teacher,

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:28.246
and I remember one of our earlier classes with him,

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:30.594
he was projecting images on the wall,

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:33.487
asking us to think about them,

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:36.013
and he put up an image of a painting.

00:00:36.013 --> 00:00:39.708
It was a landscape with figures, semi-dressed,

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:42.496
drinking wine. There was a nude woman

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:45.872
in the lower foreground, and on the hillside in the back,

00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:49.886
there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus,

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:52.235
and he said, "What is this?"

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.512
And I -- no one else did, so I put up my hand, and I said,

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:58.873
"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."

00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:01.526
He said, "It's a what?"

00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:03.120
I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.195
"It's a Bacchanal by Titian."

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.918
He said, "It's a what?"

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:13.002
I said, "It's a Bacchanal by Titian." (Laughter)

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.347
He said, "You boneless bookworm!

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:18.890
It's a fucking orgy!"

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.961
(Laughter)

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.313
As I said, he swore too much.

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:27.845
There was an important lesson for me in that.

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:31.673
Pietro was suspicious of formal art training,

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:35.605
art history training, because he feared

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:39.367
that it filled people up with jargon, and then they just

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:44.046
classified things rather than looking at them,

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:48.805
and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary,

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.809
and he wanted us to use our eyes,

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:55.319
and he was especially evangelical about this message,

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.822
because he was losing his sight.

00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:02.181
He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects.

00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:05.727
What is it? How is it made? Why was it made?

00:02:05.727 --> 00:02:08.494
How is it used?

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:10.663
And these were important lessons to me when

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.961
I subsequently became a professional art historian.

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:18.684
My kind of eureka moment came a few years later,

00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:23.781
when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe,

00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:27.429
and of course it was very much discussed in terms of

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.813
the paintings and the sculptures

00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:33.121
and the architecture of the day.

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:36.958
But as I began to read historical documents

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.073
and contemporary descriptions,

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:43.235
I found there was a kind of a missing component,

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:48.321
for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries.

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:52.217
Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages

00:02:52.217 --> 00:02:55.149
and, really, well into the 18th century,

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.643
and it was pretty apparent why.

00:02:57.643 --> 00:03:00.638
Tapestries were portable. You could roll them up,

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.283
send them ahead of you, and in the time

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.801
it took to hang them up, you could transform a cold,

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:10.923
dank interior into a richly colored setting.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:15.850
Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.507
on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes

00:03:19.507 --> 00:03:22.209
with whom they wanted to be associated,

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.267
or even themselves,

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:29.665
and in addition to that, tapestries were hugely expensive.

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:33.334
They required scores of highly skilled weavers

00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:36.170
working over extended periods of time

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.971
with very expensive materials -- the wools, the silks,

00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:42.808
even gold and silver thread.

00:03:42.808 --> 00:03:47.546
So, all in all, in an age when the visual image

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:52.898
of any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:56.543
form of propaganda.

00:03:56.543 --> 00:04:00.571
Well, I became a tapestry historian.

00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:03.575
In due course, I ended up as a curator

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:07.131
at the Metropolitan Museum, because I saw the Met

00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:10.843
as one of the few places where I could organize

00:04:10.843 --> 00:04:14.398
really big exhibitions about the subject

00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:17.739
I cared so passionately about.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.125
And in about 1997, the then-director Philippe de Montebello

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:25.468
gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition

00:04:25.468 --> 00:04:31.048
for 2002. We normally have these very long lead-in times.

00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:34.539
It wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.944
of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.408
They have to be wound on huge rollers,

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:45.370
shipped in oversized freighters.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.997
Some of them are so big we had, to get them into the museum,

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:52.693
we had to take them up the great steps at the front.

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:57.378
We thought very hard about how to present this

00:04:57.378 --> 00:05:00.986
unknown subject to a modern audience:

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:03.956
the dark colors to set off the colors that remained

00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:06.757
in objects that were often faded;

00:05:06.757 --> 00:05:10.976
the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread;

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:12.440
the labeling.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.244
You know, we live in an age where we are so used

00:05:15.244 --> 00:05:18.256
to television images and photographs,

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:23.303
a one-hit image. These were big, complex things,

00:05:23.303 --> 00:05:27.768
almost like cartoons with multiple narratives.

00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:30.998
We had to draw our audience in, get them to slow down,

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.923
to explore the objects.

00:05:33.923 --> 00:05:38.073
There was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night,

00:05:38.073 --> 00:05:41.461
I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying,

00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.576
"This is going to be a bomb."

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:48.846
But in reality, in the course of the coming weeks and months,

00:05:48.846 --> 00:05:54.433
hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show.

00:05:54.433 --> 00:05:59.078
The exhibition was designed to be an experience,

00:05:59.078 --> 00:06:02.236
and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs.

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:05.235
So I want you to use your imaginations,

00:06:05.235 --> 00:06:08.781
thinking of these wall-high objects,

00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.896
some of them 10 meters wide,

00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:15.915
depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies

00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:20.484
who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today,

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:24.690
thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.830
in pursuit of wild boars and deer,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.680
violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.842
I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time,

00:06:37.842 --> 00:06:41.679
and all the little boys, they kind of -- you know, they were little boys,

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:44.500
and then the thing that caught their attention

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.609
was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:50.274
pooping in the foreground — (Laughter) —

00:06:50.274 --> 00:06:53.956
kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist.

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:56.430
And you can just imagine them.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.803
But it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw

00:06:59.803 --> 00:07:02.883
that these weren't just old faded tapestries.

00:07:02.883 --> 00:07:07.374
These were images of the world in the past,

00:07:07.374 --> 00:07:10.290
and that it was the same for our audience.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.847
And for me as a curator, I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little.

00:07:15.847 --> 00:07:18.997
Through this experience that could only be created

00:07:18.997 --> 00:07:23.080
in a museum, I'd opened up the eyes of my audience --

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.221
historians, artists, press, the general public --

00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:31.897
to the beauty of this lost medium.

00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:35.471
A few years later, I was invited to be the director

00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:38.586
of the museum, and after I got over that --

00:07:38.586 --> 00:07:44.097
"Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" --

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:49.477
I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that

00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:52.756
curated museum experience.

00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:56.363
We live in an age of ubiquitous information,

00:07:56.363 --> 00:08:00.422
and sort of "just add water" expertise,

00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:04.464
but there's nothing that compares with the presentation

00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:08.348
of significant objects in a well-told narrative,

00:08:08.348 --> 00:08:13.408
what the curator does, the interpretation of a complex,

00:08:13.408 --> 00:08:17.919
esoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:21.002
of the subject, that makes it -- unpacks it

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:23.169
for a general audience.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.696
And that, to me, today, is now the challenge and the fun

00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:31.679
of my job, supporting the vision of my curators,

00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:35.032
whether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords,

00:08:35.032 --> 00:08:40.116
early Byzantine artifacts, Renaissance portraits,

00:08:40.116 --> 00:08:43.190
or the show we heard mentioned earlier,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.205
the McQueen show, with which we enjoyed

00:08:46.205 --> 00:08:49.016
so much success last summer.

00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:51.517
That was an interesting case.

00:08:51.517 --> 00:08:56.691
In the late spring, early summer of 2010, shortly after

00:08:56.691 --> 00:08:59.603
McQueen's suicide,

00:08:59.603 --> 00:09:03.859
our curator of costume, Andrew Bolton, came to see me,

00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:07.094
and said, "I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen,

00:09:07.094 --> 00:09:11.652
and now is the moment. We have to, we have to do it fast."

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:16.389
It wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.843
with a small team of designers and managers

00:09:19.843 --> 00:09:23.985
who were very protective of his legacy,

00:09:23.985 --> 00:09:25.819
but Andrew went to London and worked with them

00:09:25.819 --> 00:09:29.549
over the summer and won their confidence, and that of

00:09:29.549 --> 00:09:33.644
the designers who created his amazing fashion shows,

00:09:33.644 --> 00:09:38.258
which were works of performance art in their own right,

00:09:38.258 --> 00:09:40.757
and we proceeded to do something at the museum,

00:09:40.757 --> 00:09:42.977
I think, we've never done before.

00:09:42.977 --> 00:09:45.994
It wasn't just your standard installation.

00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:50.184
In fact, we ripped down the galleries to recreate

00:09:50.184 --> 00:09:55.596
entirely different settings, a recreation of his first studio,

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:58.469
a hall of mirrors,

00:09:58.469 --> 00:10:00.997
a curiosity box,

00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:04.357
a sunken ship, a burned-out interior,

00:10:04.357 --> 00:10:07.649
with videos and soundtracks that ranged from

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:11.382
operatic arias to pigs fornicating.

00:10:11.382 --> 00:10:16.343
And in this extraordinary setting, the costumes

00:10:16.343 --> 00:10:21.777
were like actors and actresses, or living sculptures.

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:23.956
It could have been a train wreck.

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:28.415
It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue

00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:32.038
at Christmas, but because of the way that Andrew

00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:36.031
connected with the McQueen team, he was channeling

00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:39.455
the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen,

00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:42.262
and the show was quite transcendant,

00:10:42.262 --> 00:10:45.034
and it became a phenomenon in its own right.

00:10:45.034 --> 00:10:47.548
By the end of the show, we had people queuing

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:51.050
for four or five hours to get into the show,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.677
but no one really complained.

00:10:53.677 --> 00:10:56.755
I heard over and over again, "Wow, that was worth it.

00:10:56.755 --> 00:11:00.834
It was a such a visceral, emotive experience."

00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:05.091
Now, I've described two very immersive exhibitions,

00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:10.500
but I also believe that collections, individual objects,

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.705
can also have that same power.

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:16.589
The Met was set up not as a museum of American art,

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:19.694
but of an encyclopedic museum,

00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:24.509
and today, 140 years later, that vision

00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:27.647
is as prescient as ever,

00:11:27.647 --> 00:11:31.270
because, of course, we live in a world of crisis,

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.903
of challenge, and we're exposed to it

00:11:33.903 --> 00:11:37.052
through the 24/7 newsreels.

00:11:37.052 --> 00:11:41.912
It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations,

00:11:41.912 --> 00:11:46.292
the cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of.

00:11:46.292 --> 00:11:50.621
Whether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria,

00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:53.331
it's in our galleries that we can explain

00:11:53.331 --> 00:11:55.403
and give greater understanding.

00:11:55.403 --> 00:11:58.888
I mean, our new Islamic galleries are a case in point,

00:11:58.888 --> 00:12:04.568
opened 10 years, almost to the week, after 9/11.

00:12:04.568 --> 00:12:09.002
I think for most Americans, knowledge of the Islamic world

00:12:09.002 --> 00:12:12.853
was pretty slight before 9/11, and then it was thrust upon us

00:12:12.853 --> 00:12:16.946
in one of America's darkest hours,

00:12:16.946 --> 00:12:19.620
and the perception was through the polarization

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.274
of that terrible event.

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:26.494
Now, in our galleries, we show 14 centuries

00:12:26.494 --> 00:12:30.947
of the development of different Islamic cultures

00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:33.686
across a vast geographic spread,

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:37.713
and, again, hundreds of thousands of people have come

00:12:37.713 --> 00:12:42.888
to see these galleries since they opened last October.

00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:49.994
I'm often asked, "Is digital media replacing the museum?"

00:12:49.994 --> 00:12:53.871
and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection

00:12:53.871 --> 00:12:57.311
of that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong,

00:12:57.311 --> 00:13:00.586
I'm a huge advocate of the Web.

00:13:00.586 --> 00:13:04.005
It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences

00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:09.406
around the globe, but nothing replaces the authenticity

00:13:09.406 --> 00:13:15.993
of the object presented with passionate scholarship.

00:13:15.993 --> 00:13:20.596
Bringing people face to face with our objects

00:13:20.596 --> 00:13:24.043
is a way of bringing them face to face with people

00:13:24.043 --> 00:13:28.609
across time, across space, whose lives may have been

00:13:28.609 --> 00:13:33.177
very different to our own, but who, like us,

00:13:33.177 --> 00:13:38.207
had hopes and dreams, frustrations and achievements

00:13:38.207 --> 00:13:41.386
in their lives. And I think this is a process

00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:45.139
that helps us better understand ourselves,

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:50.647
helps us make better decisions about where we're going.

00:13:50.647 --> 00:13:56.049
The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world,

00:13:56.049 --> 00:14:00.193
awe-inspiring, like a medieval cathedral.

00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:02.474
From there, you can walk in any direction

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:05.705
to almost any culture.

00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:08.101
I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries

00:14:08.101 --> 00:14:11.176
and I watch our visitors coming in.

00:14:11.176 --> 00:14:15.268
Some of them are comfortable. They feel at home.

00:14:15.268 --> 00:14:17.878
They know what they're looking for.

00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:22.334
Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place.

00:14:22.334 --> 00:14:25.488
They feel that the institution is elitist.

00:14:25.488 --> 00:14:31.683
I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism.

00:14:31.683 --> 00:14:35.631
I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind,

00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:41.788
where they're prepared to be a little bit lost, to explore,

00:14:41.788 --> 00:14:45.610
to see the unfamiliar in the familiar,

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:50.079
or to try the unknown.

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:54.420
Because for us, it's all about bringing them face to face

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.345
with great works of art,

00:14:57.345 --> 00:15:01.745
capturing them at that moment of discomfort,

00:15:01.745 --> 00:15:05.241
when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone,

00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:10.644
your Blackberry, but to create a zone

00:15:10.644 --> 00:15:15.750
where their curiosity can expand.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.314
And whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture

00:15:19.314 --> 00:15:21.304
that reminds you of a friend,

00:15:21.304 --> 00:15:25.584
or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry,

00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:28.994
or, to bring it back to my tutor Pietro,

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:31.671
those dancing figures

00:15:31.671 --> 00:15:34.458
who are indeed knocking back the wine,

00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:37.948
and that nude figure in the left foreground.

00:15:37.948 --> 00:15:46.293
Wow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality.

00:15:46.293 --> 00:15:51.915
In that moment, our scholarship can tell you

00:15:51.915 --> 00:15:55.229
that this is a bacchanal,

00:15:55.229 --> 00:15:58.380
but if we're doing our job right,

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.116
and you've checked the jargon at the front door,

00:16:02.116 --> 00:16:04.984
trust your instinct.

00:16:04.984 --> 00:16:08.156
You know it's an orgy.

00:16:08.156 --> 00:16:11.474
Thank you. (Applause)

00:16:11.474 --> 00:16:16.381
(Applause)
