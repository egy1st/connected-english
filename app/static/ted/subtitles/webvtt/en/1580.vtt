00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:03.856
Over the past six months, I've spent my time

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.247
traveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles,

00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:10.169
but without leaving my desk.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.015
And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:15.968
I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here,

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:20.369
and at the same time, my alter ego is a big green boxy

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.049
avatar nicknamed Cyber Frank.

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:26.858
So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start,

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:29.920
if it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.504
so it's important that we focus on outcomes.

00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:35.437
And then I struggled, because I was thinking to myself,

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:37.905
"What should I talk? What should I do? It's a TED audience.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.713
It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make — ?"

00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:43.806
So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right.

00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:45.870
So let's just walk our way through this.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.319
Please could you work this through with me? You can shout out the answer if you like.

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:51.501
The question is, which of these horizontal lines is longer?

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:52.647
The answer is?

00:00:52.647 --> 00:00:55.371
Audience: The same.Eddie Obeng: The same.

00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:57.118
No, they're not the same. (Laughter)

00:00:57.118 --> 00:01:00.747
They're not the same. The top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one.

00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:04.056
So why did you tell me they were the same? Do you remember when we were kids at school,

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:06.511
about that big, they played the same trick on us?

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:08.848
It was to teach us parallax. Do you remember?

00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:11.995
And you got, you said, "It's the same!" And you got it wrong.

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:15.831
You remember? And you learned the answer, and you've carried this answer in your head for 10, 20, 30, 40 years:

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:19.711
The answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are,

00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.280
you say they're the same, but they're not the same, because I've changed it.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.447
And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the 21st century.

00:01:26.447 --> 00:01:28.745
Somebody or something has changed the rules

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:30.802
about how our world works.

00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:33.708
When I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight,

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:37.544
you see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay?

00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:40.159
You didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is,

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.831
they switched all the rules round, so that the way to

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.423
successfully run a business, an organization, or even a country,

00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:49.104
has been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new

00:01:49.104 --> 00:01:53.384
— you think I'm joking, don't you — there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter)

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:55.194
Did you notice that? I mean, you missed this one.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:57.029
You probably — No, you didn't. Okay. (Laughter)

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:01.371
My simple idea is that what's happened is,

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:05.365
the real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us,

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:08.410
so instead we spend our time responding rationally

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.583
to a world which we understand and recognize,

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:14.002
but which no longer exists.

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.211
You don't believe me, do you? Okay. (Applause)

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:21.115
So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:23.707
If you search Amazon for the word "creativity,"

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:26.074
you'll discover something like 90,000 books.

00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:28.878
If you go on Google and you look for "innovation + creativity,"

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:33.137
you get 30 million hits. If you add the word "consultants," it doubles to 60 million. (Laughter)

00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:36.322
Are you with me? And yet, statistically, what you discover

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.307
is that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money

00:02:39.307 --> 00:02:42.430
or delivering benefits two years after its inception.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.443
It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives

00:02:45.443 --> 00:02:48.003
spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:52.063
which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published.

00:02:52.063 --> 00:02:55.786
How is that possible? If you look at the visions we have,

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:57.563
the visions of how we're going to change the world,

00:02:57.563 --> 00:03:00.188
the key thing is implementation. We have the vision.

00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:01.544
We've got to make it happen.

00:03:01.544 --> 00:03:04.536
We've spent decades professionalizing implementation.

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:06.993
People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen.

00:03:06.993 --> 00:03:11.890
However, if I use as an example a family of five

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.624
going on holiday, if you can imagine this,

00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:19.024
all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong,

00:03:19.024 --> 00:03:22.933
what I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses.

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:26.064
What actually happens is, if I compare this to the average

00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:31.851
real project, average real successful project,

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:36.077
the family actually end up in Makassar, South Sulawesi,

00:03:36.077 --> 00:03:39.094
at a cost of 4,000 pounds,

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:41.799
whilst leaving two of the children behind. (Laughter)

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.134
What I'm trying to explain to you is, there are things which don't make sense to us.

00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:50.419
It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one.

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.993
This is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it.

00:03:52.993 --> 00:03:56.336
It says -- I'll put on the voice -- "In summary, your Majesty,

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:59.842
the failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity

00:03:59.842 --> 00:04:03.605
of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:07.003
and the number of bright minds," or something like that.

00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:10.811
This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England

00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:12.816
when she asked the question,

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:15.755
"Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?" (Laughter)

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:19.258
I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood. (Laughter)

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.486
That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is,

00:04:21.486 --> 00:04:24.948
these are eminent economists, some of the smartest people

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:28.464
on the planet. Do you see the challenge? (Laughter)

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:33.011
It's scary. My friend and mentor, Tim Brown of IDEO,

00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.913
he explains that design must get big, and he's right.

00:04:36.913 --> 00:04:39.532
He wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking

00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:41.834
must tackle big systems for the challenges we have.

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:43.971
He's absolutely right.

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:47.644
And then I ask myself, "Why was it ever small?"

00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:51.506
Isn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool,

00:04:51.506 --> 00:04:53.639
is cross-functional working is so amazing,

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.865
why did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on?

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:03.146
You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:07.232
we've not noticed that change I described earlier.

00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:10.010
What we do know is that the world has accelerated.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.332
Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light.

00:05:12.332 --> 00:05:14.804
Technology accelerates things exponentially.

00:05:14.804 --> 00:05:16.966
So if this is now, and that's the past,

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:18.336
and we start thinking about change, you know,

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.907
all governments are seeking change, you're here seeking change,

00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:23.578
everybody's after change, it's really cool. (Laughter)

00:05:23.578 --> 00:05:28.021
So what happens is, we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change.

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:32.117
The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing.

00:05:32.117 --> 00:05:34.788
At the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird.

00:05:34.788 --> 00:05:37.437
We've doubled the population in 40 years,

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:41.051
put half of them in cities, then connected them all up so they can interact.

00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:43.920
The density of the interaction of human beings is amazing.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.772
There are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing.

00:05:48.772 --> 00:05:50.406
And then we've done a third thing.

00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:52.401
you know, for those of you who have as an office

00:05:52.401 --> 00:05:57.870
a little desk underneath the stairs, and you say, well this is my little desk under the stairs,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.261
no! You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet.

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:07.175
What's happened is, we've changed the scale.

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:10.122
Size and scale are no longer the same.

00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:13.344
And then add to that, every time you tweet,

00:06:13.344 --> 00:06:16.134
over a third of your followers follow from a country

00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:19.042
which is not your own.

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:22.051
Global is the new scale. We know that.

00:06:22.051 --> 00:06:26.063
And so people say things like, "The world is now a turbulent place." Have you heard them saying things like that?

00:06:26.063 --> 00:06:28.824
And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this?

00:06:28.824 --> 00:06:31.957
And they think it's a metaphor, but this is not a metaphor.

00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:35.174
It's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember

00:06:35.174 --> 00:06:39.165
going to a demonstration where they basically,

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.576
the demonstrator did something quite intriguing.

00:06:41.576 --> 00:06:46.758
What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? —

00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:50.174
he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was,

00:06:50.174 --> 00:06:53.349
you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.064
and the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.

00:06:56.064 --> 00:06:59.262
Okay? So I'll write the word "tap." Is that okay? It's a tap. (Laughter)

00:06:59.262 --> 00:07:03.064
Okay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on.

00:07:03.064 --> 00:07:05.685
And he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.

00:07:05.685 --> 00:07:08.806
I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?

00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:12.924
So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.

00:07:12.924 --> 00:07:16.636
And he says, "Anything you notice?" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe,

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.812
and he connects this to a container, and he fills

00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:22.133
the container up with green ink. You with me?

00:07:22.133 --> 00:07:25.923
So guess what happens? A thin green line comes out

00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:30.269
as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:34.561
And then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.

00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:37.747
So he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.

00:07:37.747 --> 00:07:40.614
He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.

00:07:40.614 --> 00:07:45.770
There's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.745
the whole of that green line disappears, and instead

00:07:48.745 --> 00:07:52.105
there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:55.269
They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink

00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:58.953
so that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.

00:07:58.953 --> 00:08:02.966
What's happened in this world of pipe

00:08:02.966 --> 00:08:06.893
is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.

00:08:06.893 --> 00:08:10.574
All the rules are gone. In that environment, instantly,

00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:14.693
all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available,

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:17.535
and it's not the same as laminar.

00:08:17.535 --> 00:08:22.493
And if we didn't have that green ink, you'd never notice.

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:25.790
And I think this is our challenge, because somebody

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.894
has actually increased — and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff —

00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:33.875
the speed, the scale and the density of interaction.

00:08:33.875 --> 00:08:35.574
Now how do we cope and deal with that?

00:08:35.574 --> 00:08:39.007
Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.

00:08:39.007 --> 00:08:44.105
Yes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when

00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:46.909
there were actually these things called correct answers,

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:50.070
because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.883
and you believe it will last forever.

00:08:51.883 --> 00:08:55.310
So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.485
and that's how we used to do it. We could see things,

00:08:57.485 --> 00:08:59.998
understand them, take the time to put them into practice.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:03.847
Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace

00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:07.092
of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work

00:09:07.092 --> 00:09:09.638
for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work

00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:12.584
on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy,

00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:15.189
and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings.

00:09:15.189 --> 00:09:20.557
If you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision.

00:09:20.557 --> 00:09:23.292
And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles,

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:25.679
it's even funnier, because you have to wait all the way

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:29.302
for the cycle to fail before you go, "There's something wrong." You with me?

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:34.854
So it's likely that the line, in terms of learning, is pretty flat.

00:09:34.854 --> 00:09:39.051
You with me? This point over here, the point at which

00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:42.954
the lines cross over, the pace of change

00:09:42.954 --> 00:09:46.098
overtakes the pace of learning,

00:09:46.098 --> 00:09:48.983
and for me, that is what I was describing

00:09:48.983 --> 00:09:52.240
when I was telling you about midnight.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.401
So what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do,

00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:59.040
many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.776
without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it,

00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:04.712
the things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future?

00:10:04.712 --> 00:10:07.232
If you haven't understood the world you're living in,

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:10.848
it's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits.

00:10:10.848 --> 00:10:14.256
I'll give you an example, a quick one. Creativity and ideas,

00:10:14.256 --> 00:10:17.297
I mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me, my clients, they want innovation,

00:10:17.297 --> 00:10:20.601
so they seek innovation. They say to people, "Take risks and be creative!"

00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:23.528
But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air.

00:10:23.528 --> 00:10:27.649
Entering their ears, what they hear is, "Do crazy things and then I'll fire you." Why? (Laughter) Because —

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:31.304
Why? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world,

00:10:31.304 --> 00:10:33.769
over here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable.

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:36.401
If you got something wrong, you'd failed. How should you be treated?

00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:39.537
Well, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience.

00:10:39.537 --> 00:10:44.601
So we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for 20, 30 years, are you with me?

00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:47.304
The answer is, don't do things which are different.

00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:49.527
And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work.

00:10:49.527 --> 00:10:52.139
You see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world.

00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:55.990
One, you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to, and it's a very difficult thing,

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.472
you're sloppy, you get it wrong. How should you be treated? You should probably be fired.

00:10:59.472 --> 00:11:02.704
On the other hand, you're doing something new, no one's ever done before,

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.684
you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated?

00:11:04.684 --> 00:11:08.296
Well, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed.

00:11:08.296 --> 00:11:11.784
It's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V.

00:11:11.784 --> 00:11:14.513
So what I want to leave you, then, is with the explanation

00:11:14.513 --> 00:11:18.337
of why I actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk.

00:11:18.337 --> 00:11:20.377
When I realized the power of this new world,

00:11:20.377 --> 00:11:24.749
I quit my safe teaching job, and set up a virtual business school,

00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:28.544
the first in the world, in order to teach people how to make this happen,

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:33.877
and I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself.

00:11:33.877 --> 00:11:36.926
If you're interested, worldaftermidnight.com, you'll find out more,

00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:39.846
but I've applied them to myself for over a decade,

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:43.595
and I'm still here, and I still have my house, and the most important thing is,

00:11:43.595 --> 00:11:48.975
I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives,

00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:51.718
so that when you go away and you're making your next

00:11:51.718 --> 00:11:56.317
absolutely sensible and rational decision, you'll take some time to think,

00:11:56.317 --> 00:11:59.397
"Hmm, I wonder whether this also makes sense

00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:02.180
in our new world after midnight." Thank you very much.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:09.230
(Applause)

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:15.659
Thank you, thank you. (Applause)
