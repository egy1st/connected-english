WEBVTT

00:00:01.544 --> 00:00:05.513
To understand the world that live in, we tell stories.

00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:08.983
And while remixing and sharing have come to define

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:10.564
the web as we know it,

00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:14.399
all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.864
that allow us to make things online.

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:20.946
But video has been left out. It arrived on the web

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:23.692
in a small box, and there it has remained,

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:26.781
completely disconnected from the data and the content

00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:28.653
all around it.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.565
In fact, in over a decade on the web, the only thing

00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:34.161
that has changed about video is the size of the box

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:37.038
and the quality of the picture.

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:40.206
Popcorn changes all of that.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.319
It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:46.704
with content pulled live directly from the web.

00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:50.239
Videos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself:

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.286
dynamic, full of links, and completely remixable,

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:58.585
and finally allowed to break free from the frame.

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:00.989
I want to give you a demo of a prototype

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.029
that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:07.975
It will be completely free, and it will work in any browser.

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:11.041
So, every Popcorn production begins with the video,

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.427
and so I've made a short, 20-second clip

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:17.178
using a newscaster template that we use in workshops.

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:20.862
So let's watch it. We'll go back, and I'll show you how we made it.

00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:23.614
Hi, and welcome to my newscast.

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:26.055
I've added my location with a Google Map,

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:29.423
and it's live, so try moving it around.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:32.815
You can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons,

00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:36.279
or pull in content from any web service, like Flickr,

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:41.109
or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content.

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.748
So let's go back, and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there.

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:48.174
So this is the timeline, and if you've ever edited video,

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.093
you're familiar with this, but instead of clips in the timeline,

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:54.679
what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video.

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.070
Now in this Popcorn production we've got

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.823
the title card, we've got a Google Map that shows up

00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:03.310
picture-in-picture, then Popcorn lets it push

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.670
outside the frame and take over the whole screen.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.339
There are two pop-ups bringing you some other information,

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:13.717
and a final article with a link out to the original article.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:17.251
Let's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it.

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.500
All you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.759
and I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:26.281
Let's set it to something else.

00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.412
Popcorn immediately goes out onto the web,

00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:32.469
talks to Google, grabs the map, and puts it in the display.

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.075
And it's exactly the same

00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:35.811
for the people who watch your production.

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.322
And it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it,

00:02:38.322 --> 00:02:42.552
you zoom in, right down to street view if you want to.

00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:45.559
Now in the video, I mentioned adding a live feed,

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.740
which we can do right now, so let's add a live feed

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.624
from Flickr. Go over to the right-hand side,

00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:54.013
grab Flickr from the list of options,

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:56.260
drag it into the timeline,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.734
and put it where you'd like it to go,

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:01.197
and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:04.209
images based on the tags. Now, my developers

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.069
really like ponies, and so they've set that as the default tag.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.185
Let's try something else,

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:14.753
maybe something a bit more relevant to today.

00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:17.483
Now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed.

00:03:17.483 --> 00:03:19.071
If you come and watch this a week from now,

00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:20.615
this will be completely different,

00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:23.124
dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web,

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:25.176
everything is sourced, so click your link,

00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:28.969
and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image.

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.215
Everything you've seen today is built with the basic

00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:34.775
building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:36.694
That means it's completely remixable. It also means

00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:39.258
there's no proprietary software. All you need

00:03:39.258 --> 00:03:42.217
is a web browser.

00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:45.587
So imagine if every video that we watched on the web

00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:48.633
worked like the web, completely remixable,

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:51.380
linked to its source content, and interactive

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.761
for everyone who views it.

00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:56.757
I think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on

00:03:56.757 --> 00:03:59.135
the web, and the way we understand the world we live in.

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:04.821
Thank you. (Applause)
