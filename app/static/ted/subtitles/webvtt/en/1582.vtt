WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.785
What I do is I organize information.

00:00:01.809 --> 00:00:03.216
I'm a graphic designer.

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.285
Professionally, I try to make sense

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:09.914
often of things that don't
make much sense themselves.

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:14.052
So my father might not understand
what it is that I do for a living.

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:16.329
His part of my ancestry has been farmers.

00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:19.453
He's part of this ethnic minority
called the Pontic Greeks.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.392
They lived in Asia Minor
and fled to Greece after a genocide

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:25.936
about a hundred years ago.

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.823
And ever since that, migration
has somewhat been a theme in my family.

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:35.348
My father moved to Germany,
studied there and married,

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:39.800
and as a result, I now have
this half-German brain,

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:43.182
with all the analytical thinking
and that slightly dorky demeanor

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:45.185
that come with that.

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:48.295
And of course it meant
that I was a foreigner in both countries,

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.669
and that of course made it pretty easy
for me to migrate as well,

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:55.116
in good family tradition, if you like.

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:58.997
But of course, most journeys
that we undertake from day to day

00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:00.647
are within a city.

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:03.443
And, especially if you know the city,

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:07.465
getting from A to B
may seem pretty obvious, right?

00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:11.617
But the question is, why is it obvious?

00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:13.523
How do we know where we're going?

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:17.808
So I washed up on a Dublin ferry port
about 12 years ago,

00:01:17.832 --> 00:01:20.224
a professional foreigner, if you like,

00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:23.350
and I'm sure you've all had
this experience before, yeah?

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:25.462
You arrive in a new city,

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:29.459
and your brain is trying
to make sense of this new place.

00:01:29.483 --> 00:01:32.861
Once you find your base, your home,

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:37.321
you start to build this cognitive map
of your environment.

00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:41.233
It's essentially this virtual map
that only exists in your brain.

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:43.018
All animal species do it,

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:46.017
even though we all use
slightly different tools.

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:52.066
Us humans, of course, we don't move around
marking our territory by scent, like dogs.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.582
We don't run around emitting
ultrasonic squeaks, like bats.

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:59.603
We just don't do that,

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:02.873
although a night in the Temple Bar
district can get pretty wild.

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:04.245
(Laughter)

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:08.183
No, we do two important things
to make a place our own.

00:02:08.207 --> 00:02:11.259
First, we move along linear routes.

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:13.753
Typically, we find a main street,

00:02:13.777 --> 00:02:17.347
and this main street becomes
a linear strip map in our minds.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.594
But our mind keeps it pretty simple, yeah?

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:22.973
Every street is generally perceived
as a straight line,

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:26.729
and we kind of ignore the little twists
and turns that the streets make.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.560
When we do, however,
make a turn into a side street,

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:34.874
our mind tends to adjust that turn
to a 90-degree angle.

00:02:34.898 --> 00:02:37.596
This of course makes for
some funny moments

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.946
when you're in some old city layout

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.962
that follows some sort
of circular city logic, yeah?

00:02:44.986 --> 00:02:47.074
Maybe you've had that experience as well.

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:50.194
Let's say you're on some spot
on a side street

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:52.560
that projects from a main
cathedral square,

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:56.776
and you want to get to another point
on a side street just like that.

00:02:57.308 --> 00:03:01.254
The cognitive map
in your mind may tell you,

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:04.679
"Aris, go back to the main
cathedral square,

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:08.416
take a 90-degree turn
and walk down that other side street."

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.875
But somehow you feel adventurous that day,
and you suddenly discover

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:17.751
that the two spots were actually
only a single building apart.

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:19.116
Now, I don't know about you,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.264
but I always feel
like I find this wormhole

00:03:21.288 --> 00:03:24.061
or this inter-dimensional portal.

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:25.359
(Laughter)

00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:28.890
So we move along linear routes

00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:34.936
and our mind straightens streets
and perceives turns as 90-degree angles.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.905
The second thing that we do
to make a place our own

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:42.092
is we attach meaning
and emotions to the things

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:44.981
that we see along those lines.

00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:50.872
If you go to the Irish countryside
and you ask an old lady for directions,

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:54.784
brace yourself for some
elaborate Irish storytelling

00:03:54.808 --> 00:03:56.762
about all the landmarks, yeah?

00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:00.037
She'll tell you the pub
where her sister used to work,

00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:03.432
and "... go past that church
where I got married," that kind of thing.

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:07.512
So we fill our cognitive maps
with these markers of meaning.

00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:13.670
What's more, we abstract
repeat patterns and recognize them.

00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:19.113
We recognize them by the experiences
and we abstract them into symbols.

00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:24.235
And of course, we're all capable
of understanding these symbols.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.735
(Laughter)

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.242
What's more, we're all capable
of understanding the cognitive maps,

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:35.984
and you are all capable of creating
these cognitive maps yourselves.

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:39.601
So next time, when you want to tell
your friend how to get to your place,

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:44.393
you grab a beermat, grab a napkin,
and you just observe yourself

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:48.784
create this awesome piece
of communication design.

00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:50.220
It's got straight lines.

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:52.722
It's got 90-degree corners.

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:54.846
You might add little symbols
along the way.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.989
And when you look
at what you've just drawn,

00:04:59.013 --> 00:05:03.551
you realize it does not
resemble a street map.

00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:07.850
If you were to put an actual street map
on top of what you've just drawn,

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:12.439
you'd realize your streets
and the distances -- they'd be way off.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.832
No, what you've just drawn
is more like a diagram or a schematic.

00:05:18.856 --> 00:05:23.803
It's a visual construct
of lines, dots, letters,

00:05:23.827 --> 00:05:26.239
designed in the language of our brains.

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.575
So it's no big surprise

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.558
that the big information-design icon
of the last century --

00:05:33.582 --> 00:05:37.915
the pinnacle of showing everybody
how to get from A to B,

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.957
the London Underground map --

00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:44.294
was not designed by a cartographer
or a city planner;

00:05:44.318 --> 00:05:47.992
it was designed
by an engineering draftsman.

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:50.424
In the 1930s,

00:05:50.448 --> 00:05:56.600
Harry Beck applied the principles
of schematic diagram design

00:05:56.624 --> 00:06:00.500
and changed the way public transport
maps are designed forever.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.965
Now the very key
to the success of this map

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:09.049
is in the omission
of less important information

00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:11.768
and in the extreme simplification.

00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:15.728
So, straightened streets,
corners of 90 and 45 degrees,

00:06:15.752 --> 00:06:21.872
but also the extreme geographic
distortion in that map.

00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:25.802
If you were to look at the actual
locations of these stations,

00:06:25.826 --> 00:06:27.841
you'd see they're very different.

00:06:28.493 --> 00:06:32.240
But this is all for the clarity
of the public Tube map.

00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:36.225
If you, say, wanted to get
from Regent's Park station

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:37.875
to Great Portland Street,

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.733
the Tube map would tell you:

00:06:39.757 --> 00:06:44.369
take the Tube, go to Baker Street,
change over, take another Tube.

00:06:44.393 --> 00:06:48.290
Of course, what you don't know
is that the two stations

00:06:48.314 --> 00:06:50.858
are only about a hundred meters apart.

00:06:50.882 --> 00:06:53.769
Now we've reached the subject
of public transport,

00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:56.837
and public transport here in Dublin

00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:58.844
is a somewhat touchy subject.

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:01.147
(Laughter)

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:04.384
For everybody who does not know
the public transport here in Dublin,

00:07:04.408 --> 00:07:09.351
essentially, we have this system
of local buses that grew with the city.

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:12.999
For every outskirt that was added,
there was another bus route added,

00:07:13.023 --> 00:07:16.753
running from the outskirt
all the way to the city center.

00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:21.936
And as these local buses
approach the city center,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.845
they all run side by side and converge
in pretty much one main street.

00:07:27.535 --> 00:07:31.448
So when I stepped off
the boat 12 years ago,

00:07:31.472 --> 00:07:34.009
I tried to make sense of that.

00:07:35.557 --> 00:07:39.291
Because exploring a city on foot
only gets you so far.

00:07:39.974 --> 00:07:45.303
But when you explore a foreign
and new public transport system,

00:07:45.327 --> 00:07:49.616
you will build a cognitive map
in your mind in pretty much the same way.

00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:55.835
Typically, you choose yourself
a rapid transport route,

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:59.651
and in your mind, this route
is perceived as a straight line.

00:08:00.295 --> 00:08:01.947
And like a pearl necklace,

00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:06.900
all the stations and stops are nicely
and neatly aligned along the line.

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:13.243
And only then you start to discover
some local bus routes

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:14.982
that would fill in the gaps,

00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:19.853
and that allow for those wormhole,
inter-dimensional portal shortcuts.

00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:25.079
So I tried to make sense,
and when I arrived,

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:27.643
I was looking for some
information leaflets

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:31.184
that would help me crack this system
and understand it,

00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:32.919
and I found those brochures.

00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:37.450
(Laughter)

00:08:37.474 --> 00:08:40.819
They were not geographically distorted.

00:08:40.843 --> 00:08:44.823
They had a lot of omission of information,

00:08:44.847 --> 00:08:47.214
but unfortunately, the wrong information.

00:08:47.238 --> 00:08:48.988
Say, in the city center --

00:08:49.012 --> 00:08:52.239
there were never actually any lines
that showed the routes.

00:08:52.263 --> 00:08:53.407
(Laughter)

00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:58.181
There are actually not even
any stations with names.

00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.451
(Laughter)

00:08:59.475 --> 00:09:05.098
Now, the maps of Dublin transport
have gotten better,

00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:10.288
and after I finished the project,
they got a good bit better,

00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:12.808
but still no station names,
still no routes.

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:19.485
So, being naive,
and being half-German, I decided,

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:22.025
"Aris, why don't you build your own map?"

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:23.927
So that's what I did.

00:09:23.951 --> 00:09:29.939
I researched how each and every bus route
moved through the city, nice and logical,

00:09:29.963 --> 00:09:31.948
every bus route a separate line.

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:36.035
I plotted it into my own map of Dublin,

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:38.646
and in the city center ...

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.300
I got a nice spaghetti plate.

00:09:40.324 --> 00:09:42.852
(Laughter)

00:09:42.876 --> 00:09:45.925
Now, this is a bit of a mess,

00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:48.099
so I decided, of course,

00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:51.678
"You're going to apply
the rules of schematic design,"

00:09:51.702 --> 00:09:53.563
cleaning up the corridors,

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:56.342
widening the streets
where there were loads of buses

00:09:56.366 --> 00:10:01.151
and making the streets at straight,
90-degree corners, 45-degree corners

00:10:01.175 --> 00:10:02.604
or fractions of that,

00:10:02.628 --> 00:10:05.614
and filled it in with the bus routes.

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:08.937
And I built this city center
bus map of the system,

00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:10.793
how it was five years ago.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.712
I'll zoom in again
so that you get the full impact

00:10:13.736 --> 00:10:16.062
of the quays and Westmoreland Street.

00:10:16.086 --> 00:10:18.753
(Laughter)

00:10:18.777 --> 00:10:20.767
Now I can proudly say --

00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:27.119
(Applause)

00:10:27.143 --> 00:10:31.324
I can proudly say,
as a public transport map,

00:10:31.348 --> 00:10:35.280
this diagram is an utter failure.

00:10:35.304 --> 00:10:37.191
(Laughter)

00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:39.250
Except, probably, in one aspect:

00:10:39.274 --> 00:10:41.902
I now had a great visual representation

00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:45.798
of just how clogged up and overrun
the city center really was.

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:49.147
Now, call me old-fashioned,

00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:52.654
but I think a public transport
route map should have lines,

00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:54.771
because that's what they are, yeah?

00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:58.011
They're little pieces of string
that wrap their way

00:10:58.035 --> 00:11:00.224
through the city center
or through the city.

00:11:00.739 --> 00:11:06.230
If you will, the Greek guy inside of me
feels if I don't get a line,

00:11:06.254 --> 00:11:09.323
it's like entering
the labyrinth of the Minotaur

00:11:09.347 --> 00:11:12.611
without having Ariadne giving you
the string to find your way.

00:11:12.635 --> 00:11:16.578
So the outcome of my academic research,

00:11:16.602 --> 00:11:23.375
loads of questionnaires, case studies
and looking at a lot of maps,

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:25.812
was that a lot of the problems
and shortcomings

00:11:25.836 --> 00:11:28.158
of the public transport
system here in Dublin

00:11:28.182 --> 00:11:30.588
was the lack of a coherent
public transport map --

00:11:30.612 --> 00:11:33.329
a simplified, coherent
public transport map --

00:11:33.353 --> 00:11:36.768
because I think this is the crucial
step to understanding

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:39.989
a public transport network
on a physical level,

00:11:40.013 --> 00:11:44.308
but it's also the crucial step to make
a public transport network mappable

00:11:44.332 --> 00:11:45.840
on a visual level.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:50.249
So I teamed up with a gentleman
called James Leahy,

00:11:50.273 --> 00:11:53.584
a civil engineer and a recent
master's graduate

00:11:53.608 --> 00:11:56.918
of the Sustainable Development
program at DIT,

00:11:56.942 --> 00:12:01.245
and together we drafted
the simplified model network,

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.547
which I could then go ahead and visualize.

00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:06.602
So here's what we did.

00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:12.916
We distributed these rapid-transport
corridors throughout the city center,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.355
and extended them into the outskirts.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.031
Rapid, because we wanted them to be served
by rapid-transport vehicles.

00:12:22.055 --> 00:12:25.965
They would get exclusive
road use, where possible,

00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:28.544
and it would be high-quantity,
high-quality transport.

00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:31.246
James wanted to use
bus rapid transport for that,

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.700
rather than light rail.

00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:34.851
For me, it was important

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:39.273
that the vehicles that would run
on those rapid transport corridors

00:12:39.297 --> 00:12:43.713
would be visibly distinguishable
from local buses on the street.

00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:47.755
Now we could take out all the local buses

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:50.852
that ran alongside
those rapid transport means.

00:12:50.876 --> 00:12:54.368
Any gaps that appeared
in the outskirts were filled again.

00:12:54.392 --> 00:12:57.605
So, in other words,
if there was a street in an outskirt

00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:00.692
where there had been a bus,
we put a bus back in,

00:13:00.716 --> 00:13:05.147
only now these buses wouldn't run
all the way to the city center,

00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:08.711
but connect to the nearest
rapid-transport mode,

00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:10.896
one of these thick lines over there.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.065
So the rest was merely
a couple of months of work,

00:13:14.089 --> 00:13:16.188
and a couple of fights with my girlfriend,

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:20.164
of our place constantly
being clogged up with maps,

00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:22.181
and the outcome, one of the outcomes,

00:13:22.205 --> 00:13:25.438
was this map of the Greater Dublin area.

00:13:25.462 --> 00:13:27.048
I'll zoom in a little bit.

00:13:28.548 --> 00:13:32.595
This map only shows the rapid
transport connections, no local bus,

00:13:32.619 --> 00:13:37.869
very much in the "metro map" style
that was so successful in London,

00:13:37.893 --> 00:13:42.165
and that since has been exported
to so many other major cities,

00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:44.970
and therefore is the language
that we should use

00:13:44.994 --> 00:13:47.157
for public transport maps.

00:13:47.863 --> 00:13:53.380
What's also important is,
with a simplified network like this,

00:13:53.404 --> 00:13:58.882
it now would become possible for me
to tackle the ultimate challenge

00:13:58.906 --> 00:14:02.479
and make a public transport map
for the city center,

00:14:02.503 --> 00:14:05.599
one where I wouldn't just show
rapid transport connections,

00:14:05.623 --> 00:14:09.097
but also all the local bus routes,
streets and the likes,

00:14:09.121 --> 00:14:11.431
and this is what a map
like this could look like.

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:13.042
I'll zoom in a little bit.

00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:20.968
In this map, I'm including
each transport mode,

00:14:20.992 --> 00:14:25.857
so rapid transport, bus,
DART, tram and the likes.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:31.900
Each individual route
is represented by a separate line.

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:37.389
The map shows each and every station,

00:14:37.413 --> 00:14:40.718
each and every station name,

00:14:40.742 --> 00:14:44.992
and I'm also displaying side streets.

00:14:45.516 --> 00:14:48.997
In fact, most of the side streets
even with their name,

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:53.948
and for good measure,
also a couple of landmarks,

00:14:53.972 --> 00:14:56.146
some of them signified by little symbols,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.259
others by these isometric
three-dimensional

00:14:59.283 --> 00:15:01.281
bird's-eye-view drawings.

00:15:01.305 --> 00:15:03.938
The map is relatively small
in overall size,

00:15:03.962 --> 00:15:07.103
so something that you could
still hold as a fold-out map

00:15:07.127 --> 00:15:10.785
or display in a reasonably-sized
display box on a bus shelter.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:15.453
I think it tries to be the best balance

00:15:15.477 --> 00:15:18.809
between actual representation
and simplification --

00:15:18.833 --> 00:15:23.976
the language of way-finding in our brain.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.531
So, straightened lines,
cleaned-up corners,

00:15:27.555 --> 00:15:31.221
and of course, that very, very
important geographic distortion

00:15:31.245 --> 00:15:34.769
that makes public transport maps possible.

00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:37.531
If you, for example, have a look
at the two main corridors

00:15:37.555 --> 00:15:40.827
that run through the city --
the yellow and orange one over here --

00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:44.429
this is how they look in an actual,
accurate street map,

00:15:44.453 --> 00:15:48.438
and this is how they would
look in my distorted,

00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:50.877
simplified public transport map.

00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:54.318
So for a successful public transport map,

00:15:54.342 --> 00:15:57.096
we should not stick
to accurate representation,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.481
but design them in the way
our brains work.

00:15:59.505 --> 00:16:02.776
The reactions I got were tremendous,
it was really good to see.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.492
And of course, for my own self,
I was very happy to see

00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:09.914
that my folks in Germany and Greece
finally have an idea

00:16:09.938 --> 00:16:11.117
what I do for a living.

00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:12.143
(Laughter)

00:16:12.167 --> 00:16:13.318
Thank you.

00:16:13.342 --> 00:16:15.539
(Applause)
