00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:05.742
This is the skyline
of my hometown, New Orleans.

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.379
It was a great place to grow up,

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:12.114
but it's one of the most vulnerable
spots in the world.

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:14.821
Half the city is already below sea level.

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:18.273
In 2005, the world watched as New Orleans

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:21.776
and the Gulf Coast were
devastated by Hurricane Katrina.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.986
One thousand, eight hundred and thirty-six
people died. Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.257
These are my mother's, at the top --

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.711
although that's not her car,

00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:34.259
it was carried there
by floodwaters up to the roof --

00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:36.357
and that's my sister's, below.

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:40.209
Fortunately, they and other
family members got out in time,

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.424
but they lost their homes,
and as you can see,

00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:45.274
just about everything in them.

00:00:45.298 --> 00:00:47.584
Other parts of the world
have been hit by storms

00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:49.568
in even more devastating ways.

00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:52.446
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.788
killed 138,000 in Myanmar.

00:00:55.812 --> 00:00:59.220
Climate change is affecting
our homes, our communities,

00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:01.668
our way of life. We should be preparing

00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:05.325
at every scale and at every opportunity.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.180
This talk is about being
prepared for, and resilient to

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:11.966
the changes that are coming
and that will affect our homes

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.520
and our collective home, the Earth.

00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:18.872
The changes in these times
won't affect us all equally.

00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:21.182
There are important
distributional consequences,

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.350
and they're not what you
always might think.

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.592
In New Orleans, the elderly
and female-headed households

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:28.872
were among the most vulnerable.

00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:30.960
For those in vulnerable,
low-lying nations,

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:33.808
how do you put a dollar value
on losing your country

00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:38.328
where you ancestors are buried?
And where will your people go?

00:01:38.352 --> 00:01:40.459
And how will they cope in a foreign land?

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:42.536
Will there be tensions over immigration,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.032
or conflicts over competition
for limited resources?

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:51.024
It's already fueled conflicts
in Chad and Darfur.

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:55.841
Like it or not, ready
or not, this is our future.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:59.368
Sure, some are looking
for opportunities in this new world.

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:02.392
That's the Russians planting
a flag on the ocean bottom

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.824
to stake a claim for minerals
under the receding Arctic sea ice.

00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:09.086
But while there might be
some short-term individual winners,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.624
our collective losses
will far outweigh them.

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:14.887
Look no further than the insurance
industry as they struggle

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:16.943
to cope with mounting catastrophic losses

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:19.369
from extreme weather events.

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:22.224
The military gets it.
They call climate change

00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:25.465
a threat multiplier that could
harm stability and security,

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.354
while governments
around the world are evaluating

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:30.401
how to respond.

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:34.576
So what can we do? How can
we prepare and adapt?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.607
I'd like to share three sets
of examples, starting with

00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:40.576
adapting to violent storms and floods.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.264
In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans,

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:46.137
with sections knocked
out in Katrina, have been rebuilt

00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:50.112
21 feet higher to allow
for greater storm surge.

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.658
And these raised
and energy-efficient homes

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:55.520
were developed by Brad
Pitt and Make It Right

00:02:55.544 --> 00:02:58.336
for the hard-hit Ninth Ward.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.432
The devastated church
my mom attends has been

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:04.104
not only rebuilt higher,
it's poised to become

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:06.736
the first Energy Star
church in the country.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.856
They're selling electricity
back to the grid

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.503
thanks to solar panels,
reflective paint and more.

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:15.080
Their March electricity
bill was only 48 dollars.

00:03:15.104 --> 00:03:19.393
Now these are examples of New
Orleans rebuilding in this way,

00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:24.289
but better if others act proactively
with these changes in mind.

00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:28.072
For example, in Galveston,
here's a resilient home

00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:30.520
that survived Hurricane Ike,

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.136
when others on neighboring
lots clearly did not.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.313
And around the world,
satellites and warning systems

00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:40.721
are saving lives in flood-prone
areas such as Bangladesh.

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:43.833
But as important as technology
and infrastructure are,

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.569
perhaps the human element
is even more critical.

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:50.952
We need better planning
and systems for evacuation.

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:54.041
We need to better understand
how people make decisions

00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:56.137
in times of crisis, and why.

00:03:56.161 --> 00:04:00.249
While it's true that many who died in Katrina
did not have access to transportation,

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:03.449
others who did refused to leave
as the storm approached,

00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:07.271
often because available
transportation and shelters

00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:09.785
refused to allow them to take their pets.

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:14.805
Imagine leaving behind your own pet
in an evacuation or a rescue.

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.680
Fortunately in 2006, Congress passed

00:04:17.704 --> 00:04:21.154
the Pet Evacuation and Transportation
Standards Act (Laughter)

00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:25.692
— it spells "PETS" — to change that.

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:28.577
Second, preparing for heat and drought.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.450
Farmers are facing challenges
of drought from Asia

00:04:31.474 --> 00:04:33.954
to Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma,

00:04:33.978 --> 00:04:36.321
while heat waves linked
with climate change

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:38.722
have killed tens of thousands of people

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:44.954
in Western Europe in 2003,
and again in Russia in 2010.

00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:49.905
In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0
percent of the population,

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:52.514
depends on rainfall for its livelihood.

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:56.226
Oxfam and Swiss Re, together
with Rockefeller Foundation,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.882
are helping farmers like this
one build hillside terraces

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:02.513
and find other ways to conserve water,

00:05:02.537 --> 00:05:06.514
but they're also providing for insurance
when the droughts do come.

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:08.872
The stability this provides
is giving the farmers

00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:10.698
the confidence to invest.

00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:13.340
It's giving them access
to affordable credit.

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:14.988
It's allowing them to become
more productive so that

00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:18.898
they can afford their own insurance
over time, without assistance.

00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:21.542
It's a virtuous cycle,
and one that could be replicated

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:23.893
throughout the developing world.

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.738
After a lethal 1995 heat wave

00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:29.338
turned refrigerator
trucks from the popular

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.531
Taste of Chicago festival
into makeshift morgues,

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:34.778
Chicago became a recognized leader,

00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:37.609
tamping down on the urban
heat island impact

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:39.626
through opening cooling centers,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.835
outreach to vulnerable
neighborhoods, planting trees,

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:45.762
creating cool white
or vegetated green roofs.

00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:49.406
This is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook
County's [portion of the] roof,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.922
which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit
hotter at the surface.

00:05:52.946 --> 00:05:57.018
Washington, D.C., last year,
actually led the nation

00:05:57.042 --> 00:06:00.330
in new green roofs installed,
and they're funding this in part

00:06:00.354 --> 00:06:03.784
thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.

00:06:03.808 --> 00:06:06.570
They're splitting the cost
of installing these green roofs

00:06:06.594 --> 00:06:08.282
with home and building owners.

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:10.813
The roofs not only temper
urban heat island impact

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:13.170
but they save energy, and therefore money,

00:06:13.194 --> 00:06:15.323
the emissions that cause climate change,

00:06:15.347 --> 00:06:17.818
and they also reduce stormwater runoff.

00:06:17.842 --> 00:06:22.570
So some solutions to heat can
provide for win-win-wins.

00:06:22.594 --> 00:06:26.332
Third, adapting to rising seas.

00:06:26.356 --> 00:06:29.978
Sea level rise threatens coastal
ecosystems, agriculture,

00:06:30.002 --> 00:06:33.362
even major cities. This
is what one to two meters

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:36.362
of sea level rise looks
like in the Mekong Delta.

00:06:36.386 --> 00:06:39.013
That's where half
of Vietnam's rice is grown.

00:06:39.037 --> 00:06:42.146
Infrastructure is going to be affected.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.666
Airports around the world
are located on the coast.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.690
It makes sense, right? There's open space,

00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:49.335
the planes can take off and land
without worrying about

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:51.550
creating noise or avoiding tall buildings.

00:06:51.574 --> 00:06:54.686
Here's just one example,
San Francisco Airport,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.400
with 16 inches or more of flooding.

00:06:57.424 --> 00:07:00.302
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting

00:07:00.326 --> 00:07:03.656
this vital infrastructure with levees.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.585
But there might be some changes in store

00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:07.792
that you might not imagine. For example,

00:07:07.816 --> 00:07:10.353
planes require more runway for takeoff

00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:14.219
because the heated, less dense
air, provides for less lift.

00:07:14.243 --> 00:07:17.704
San Francisco is also
spending 40 million dollars

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.894
to rethink and redesign its
water and sewage treatment,

00:07:20.918 --> 00:07:24.224
as water outfall pipes like this
one can be flooded with seawater,

00:07:24.248 --> 00:07:27.193
causing backups at the plant,
harming the bacteria

00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:28.884
that are needed to treat the waste.

00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:31.004
So these outfall pipes
have been retrofitted

00:07:31.028 --> 00:07:34.160
to shut seawater
off from entering the system.

00:07:34.184 --> 00:07:37.088
Beyond these technical solutions, our work

00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:38.856
at the Georgetown Climate
Center with communities

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.624
encourages them to look at what existing
legal and policy tools are available

00:07:42.648 --> 00:07:46.200
and to consider how they can
accommodate change.

00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:49.152
For example, in land use,
which areas do you want

00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:52.112
to protect, through adding
a seawall, for example,

00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:55.888
alter, by raising
buildings, or retreat from,

00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:58.696
to allow the migration
of important natural systems,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.423
such as wetlands or beaches?

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:03.680
Other examples to consider. In the U.K.,

00:08:03.704 --> 00:08:07.134
the Thames Barrier protects
London from storm surge.

00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:09.680
The Asian Cities Climate
[Change] Resilience Network

00:08:09.704 --> 00:08:12.878
is restoring vital ecosystems
like forest mangroves.

00:08:12.902 --> 00:08:15.968
These are not only important
ecosystems in their own right,

00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:20.264
but they also serve as a buffer
to protect inland communities.

00:08:20.288 --> 00:08:23.976
New York City is incredibly
vulnerable to storms,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.659
as you can see from this clever
sign, and to sea level rise,

00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:30.819
and to storm surge, as you can
see from the subway flooding.

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:34.229
But back above ground, these
raised ventilation grates

00:08:34.253 --> 00:08:36.777
for the subway system show
that solutions can be both

00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:39.443
functional and attractive.
In fact, in New York,

00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:42.595
San Francisco and London,
designers have envisioned

00:08:42.619 --> 00:08:45.483
ways to better integrate
the natural and built environments

00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:47.891
with climate change in mind.

00:08:47.915 --> 00:08:50.795
I think these are inspiring
examples of what's possible

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:53.962
when we feel empowered to plan
for a world that will be different.

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:56.980
But now, a word of caution.

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:59.859
Adaptation's too important
to be left to the experts.

00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:03.211
Why? Well, there are no experts.

00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:06.531
We're entering uncharted
territory, and yet

00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:10.427
our expertise and our systems
are based on the past.

00:09:10.451 --> 00:09:13.404
"Stationarity" is the notion
that we can anticipate the future

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:16.275
based on the past, and plan accordingly,

00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:18.728
and this principle governs
much of our engineering,

00:09:18.752 --> 00:09:21.777
our design of critical
infrastructure, city water systems,

00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:25.898
building codes, even water rights
and other legal precedents.

00:09:25.922 --> 00:09:29.027
But we can simply no longer
rely on established norms.

00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:33.387
We're operating outside the bounds
of CO2 concentrations

00:09:33.411 --> 00:09:37.894
that the planet has seen
for hundreds of thousands of years.

00:09:37.918 --> 00:09:41.207
The larger point I'm
trying to make is this.

00:09:41.231 --> 00:09:44.903
It's up to us to look
at our homes and our communities,

00:09:44.927 --> 00:09:47.590
our vulnerabilities
and our exposures to risk,

00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:51.135
and to find ways to not just
survive, but to thrive,

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:53.879
and it's up to us to plan and to prepare

00:09:53.903 --> 00:09:56.475
and to call on our government
leaders and require them

00:09:56.499 --> 00:09:58.535
to do the same, even while they address

00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:01.774
the underlying causes of climate change.

00:10:01.798 --> 00:10:03.430
There are no quick fixes.

00:10:03.454 --> 00:10:06.705
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.

00:10:06.729 --> 00:10:08.614
We're all learning by doing.

00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:12.719
But the operative word is doing.

00:10:12.743 --> 00:10:14.022
Thank you.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:18.046
(Applause)
