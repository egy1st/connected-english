00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.983
One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness,

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:08.277
so if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir.

00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:09.836
You. Yeah. (Laughter)

00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:13.184
With the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter)

00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:14.239
You know who you are.

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.636
Actually, that whole row isn't right. (Laughter)

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:21.810
That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me. (Laughter)

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.923
I am one of the one in four. Thank you.

00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:29.933
I think I inherit it from my mother, who,

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.747
used to crawl around the house on all fours.

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:35.794
She had two sponges in her hand, and then she had two

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:40.376
tied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent. (Laughter)

00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:42.684
And she would crawl around behind me going,

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:46.249
"Who brings footprints into a building?!"

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.599
So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right.

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:53.791
So before I start, I would like to thank

00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:58.477
the makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine,

00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:03.400
because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.237
So how did it start?

00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:12.356
My mental illness -- well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness.

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:14.669
What am I going to talk about? Okay.

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:19.071
I always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown,

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:21.610
it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.023
existentialist revelation,

00:01:24.023 --> 00:01:28.368
or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it. (Laughter)

00:01:28.368 --> 00:01:31.475
But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.465
during my daughter's sports day.

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:37.190
There were all the parents sitting in a parking lot

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.197
eating food out of the back of their car -- only the English --

00:01:41.197 --> 00:01:47.424
eating their sausages. They loved their sausages. (Laughter)

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:52.056
Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac,

00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:54.519
and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running,

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:59.730
and all the mummies went, "Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!" (Laughter)

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.598
"Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!"

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:06.065
And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running,

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:09.010
everybody except for my daughter, who was just standing

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.777
at the starting line, just waving,

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:14.108
because she didn't know she was supposed to run.

00:02:14.108 --> 00:02:18.457
So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up

00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:23.050
I found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.442
I realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter)

00:02:27.442 --> 00:02:30.930
Because they became my only friends, they became my friends,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.928
because very few people that I knew -- Well, I wasn't

00:02:33.928 --> 00:02:37.298
sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg

00:02:37.298 --> 00:02:39.462
or I was with child I would have been inundated,

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:43.138
but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.

00:02:43.138 --> 00:02:44.838
Perk up.

00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:49.545
Because I didn't think of that. (Laughter)

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:52.845
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:57.122
Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease,

00:02:57.122 --> 00:03:01.088
this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame,

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:03.400
because your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.811
show me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show,

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:08.905
so you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking,

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.721
"I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township."

00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:15.169
So you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice,

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.028
you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices,

00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:22.037
like if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.

00:03:22.037 --> 00:03:24.665
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil,

00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:26.544
there are no voices in your head.

00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:28.218
You know that when you have those abusive voices,

00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:31.119
all those little neurons get together and in that little gap

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.777
you get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical,

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:37.523
and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape,

00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:39.419
you might have yourself depression.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.102
Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:45.704
If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally,

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:49.161
its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:53.153
that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow,

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:56.608
so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.

00:03:56.608 --> 00:04:00.085
If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:03.599
such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words,

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.373
so he just feels the horror over and over again.

00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:08.746
So here's my question. My question is, how come

00:04:08.746 --> 00:04:12.791
when people have mental damage, it's always an active imagination?

00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.010
How come every other organ in your body can get sick

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.714
and you get sympathy, except the brain?

00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:21.113
I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain,

00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:23.144
because I know you like that here at TED,

00:04:23.144 --> 00:04:26.597
so if you just give me a minute here, okay.

00:04:26.597 --> 00:04:28.603
Okay, let me just say, there's some good news.

00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:31.885
There is some good news. First of all, let me say,

00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:34.212
we've come a long, long way.

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:38.253
We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba,

00:04:38.253 --> 00:04:42.850
tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.750
Here we go. (Laughter)

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.115
This little baby has a lot of horsepower.

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:51.538
It comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.

00:04:51.538 --> 00:04:55.131
We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.

00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:57.777
We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.

00:04:57.777 --> 00:04:59.396
Here we've got a little bit of long-term memory,

00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:04.633
so, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone. (Laughter)

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:07.953
So actually, it's filled with 100 billion neurons

00:05:07.953 --> 00:05:11.256
just zizzing away, electrically transmitting information,

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:13.976
zizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here.

00:05:13.976 --> 00:05:17.568
I don't know if you can get that here. (Laughter)

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:21.568
So, zizzing away, and so — (Laughter) —

00:05:21.568 --> 00:05:25.257
And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:28.929
For every one single neuron, you can actually have

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:32.655
from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections

00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:35.917
or dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:38.437
you learn something, or you have an experience,

00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:40.710
that bush grows, you know, that bush of information.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.664
Can you imagine, every human being is carrying

00:05:43.664 --> 00:05:48.587
that equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter)

00:05:48.587 --> 00:05:50.281
Go figure.

00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:53.765
But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:56.885
This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.

00:05:56.885 --> 00:06:01.065
We are not equipped for the 21st century.

00:06:01.065 --> 00:06:04.814
Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth,

00:06:04.814 --> 00:06:07.397
and for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day,

00:06:07.397 --> 00:06:10.957
they're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us.

00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:13.481
Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches

00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:15.925
in evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.486
When we were ancient man — (Laughter) —

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:23.247
millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened

00:06:23.247 --> 00:06:26.949
by a predator, okay? — (Laughter) —

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.897
we would — Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter)

00:06:29.897 --> 00:06:33.720
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.794
Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline

00:06:37.794 --> 00:06:40.412
and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed,

00:06:40.412 --> 00:06:43.682
we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel,

00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:45.615
and we'd go back to normal. Okay.

00:06:45.615 --> 00:06:50.897
So the problem is, nowadays, with modern man— (Laughter) —

00:06:50.897 --> 00:06:54.664
when we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemical

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:59.299
but because we can't kill traffic wardens — (Laughter) —

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:04.096
or eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our body

00:07:04.096 --> 00:07:06.584
over and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm,

00:07:06.584 --> 00:07:08.317
a constant state. And here's another thing that happened.

00:07:08.317 --> 00:07:11.422
About 150,000 years ago, when language came online,

00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:13.847
we started to put words to this constant emergency,

00:07:13.847 --> 00:07:16.503
so it wasn't just, "Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger,"

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:20.544
which could be, it was suddenly, "Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat.

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:24.549
Oh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!"

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:27.035
So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes

00:07:27.035 --> 00:07:29.571
over and over again that drives you insane, so,

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.548
you see what the problem is? What once made you safe

00:07:32.548 --> 00:07:34.354
now drives you insane.

00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:37.508
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.

00:07:37.508 --> 00:07:43.372
Your pets are happier than you are. (Laughter)

00:07:43.372 --> 00:07:46.268
(Applause)

00:07:46.268 --> 00:07:51.423
So kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed. (Laughter)

00:07:51.423 --> 00:07:53.698
Completely and utterly -- so, screwed.

00:07:53.698 --> 00:07:56.157
But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff,

00:07:56.157 --> 00:07:58.495
and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:00.969
to be one in four. It's going to be four in four

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:04.232
who are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.

00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:06.759
And while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma?

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:13.436
Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:13.436 --> 00:08:24.181
(Applause) Thank you.
