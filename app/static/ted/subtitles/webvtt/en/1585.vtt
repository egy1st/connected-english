WEBVTT

00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:03.159
So I have bad news, I have good news,

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.024
and I have a task.

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:07.967
So the bad news is that we all get sick.

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:10.239
I get sick. You get sick.

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:12.781
And every one of us gets sick, and the question really is,

00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.658
how sick do we get? Is it something that kills us?

00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:17.003
Is it something that we survive?

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.931
Is it something that we can treat?

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.187
And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people.

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:25.673
And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick.

00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:27.630
And for a long time, it was the gods, right?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.784
The gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me,

00:00:30.784 --> 00:00:33.200
right? Or God, singular, more recently,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.864
is punishing me or judging me.

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:38.544
And as long as we've looked for explanations,

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:42.255
we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science,

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:44.744
which is hypotheses as to why we get sick,

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:49.484
and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well.

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:53.517
So this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called "The Canon of Medicine,"

00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:55.923
and the rules he laid out for testing medicines

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.712
are actually really similar to the rules we have today,

00:00:57.712 --> 00:01:00.657
that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength,

00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:03.054
the medicine needs to be pure, and in the end we need

00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:06.195
to test it in people. And so if you put together these themes

00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:10.660
of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.316
right, you get some beautiful results,

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:14.758
even when we didn't have very good technologies.

00:01:14.758 --> 00:01:17.820
This is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.725
that was way outside the box for his time, in the late 1800s.

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:23.573
He thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing.

00:01:23.573 --> 00:01:25.999
He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos.

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.361
And they laughed at him. For 20 years, they called this guy

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:31.850
"the mosquito man." But he ran an experiment in people,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.953
right? He had this hypothesis, and he tested it in people.

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:39.595
So he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:42.630
and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.652
So some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes

00:01:45.652 --> 00:01:46.871
and some of the people were in tents that were full

00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.127
of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever.

00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:52.528
And it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:55.950
called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.326
But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew.

00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:01.285
And this is what those people signed up for.

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:04.375
This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:08.909
at that time. You suffered in a tent, in the heat, alone,

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.605
and you probably died.

00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:14.822
But people volunteered for this.

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:18.133
And it's not just a cool example of a scientific design

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:21.046
of experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing.

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:24.965
They signed this document, and it's called an informed consent document.

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.478
And informed consent is an idea that we should be

00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:29.704
very proud of as a society, right? It's something that

00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:32.470
separates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.345
enforced medical experimentation. It's the idea

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:39.133
that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:43.242
It's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters,

00:02:43.242 --> 00:02:46.095
from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:49.847
study that we don't understand, or that we don't agree to.

00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:54.176
And so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis,

00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:56.773
experimentation in humans, and informed consent,

00:02:56.773 --> 00:02:59.438
and you get what we call clinical study, and it's how we do

00:02:59.438 --> 00:03:02.453
the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:04.795
if you're in the north, the south, the east, the west.

00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:08.908
Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate,

00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:10.767
so if we're going to look at a new drug, right,

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:13.765
we test it in people, we draw blood, we do experiments,

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:16.094
and we gain consent for that study, to make sure

00:03:16.094 --> 00:03:18.743
that we're not screwing people over as part of it.

00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:22.407
But the world is changing around the clinical study,

00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:25.773
which has been fairly well established for tens of years

00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:27.673
if not 50 to 100 years.

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:30.724
So now we're able to gather data about our genomes,

00:03:30.724 --> 00:03:33.584
but, as we saw earlier, our genomes aren't dispositive.

00:03:33.584 --> 00:03:36.350
We're able to gather information about our environment.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.260
And more importantly, we're able to gather information

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.100
about our choices, because it turns out that what we think of

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.820
as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.469
our genomes, our choices and our environment.

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.213
And the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good

00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:52.845
at studying that because they are based on the idea

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:54.759
of person-to-person interaction. You interact

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.854
with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study.

00:03:56.854 --> 00:03:59.469
So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him,

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.264
but he's holding my mom, and his genes are in me, right?

00:04:03.264 --> 00:04:06.155
His choices ran through to me. He was a smoker,

00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:08.739
like most people were. This is my son.

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.181
So my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him,

00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:14.733
and my choices are going to affect his health.

00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:17.427
The technology between these two pictures

00:04:17.427 --> 00:04:21.100
cannot be more different, but the methodology

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.224
for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period.

00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:27.892
We just have better statistics.

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:31.344
The way we gain informed consent was formed in large part

00:04:31.344 --> 00:04:33.935
after World War II, around the time that picture was taken.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:37.869
That was 70 years ago, and the way we gain informed consent,

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:40.746
this tool that was created to protect us from harm,

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:44.412
now creates silos. So the data that we collect

00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:47.138
for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:49.753
goes into silos where it can only be used

00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:52.977
for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research.

00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:55.871
Right? It can't be networked. It can't be integrated.

00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:59.404
It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed.

00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:02.357
So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.

00:05:02.357 --> 00:05:05.425
A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.

00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:09.568
Computer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork.

00:05:09.568 --> 00:05:13.554
And this is an accident. These are tools that we created

00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:16.821
to protect us from harm, but what they're doing

00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:19.351
is protecting us from innovation now.

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:22.616
And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right?

00:05:22.616 --> 00:05:25.315
It's a side effect, if you will, of a power we created

00:05:25.315 --> 00:05:27.674
to take us for good.

00:05:27.674 --> 00:05:30.818
And so if you think about it, the depressing thing is that

00:05:30.818 --> 00:05:32.951
Facebook would never make a change to something

00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.522
as important as an advertising algorithm

00:05:35.522 --> 00:05:39.933
with a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial.

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:43.595
We cannot take the information from past trials

00:05:43.595 --> 00:05:47.749
and put them together to form statistically significant samples.

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:51.233
And that sucks, right? So 45 percent of men develop

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:54.330
cancer. Thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.674
One in four men dies of cancer.

00:05:56.674 --> 00:06:00.230
One in five women dies of cancer, at least in the United States.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.458
And three out of the four drugs we give you

00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:05.971
if you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me.

00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:07.934
My sister is a cancer survivor.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:11.523
My mother-in-law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks.

00:06:11.523 --> 00:06:13.713
And when you have it, you don't have a lot of privacy

00:06:13.713 --> 00:06:17.200
in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.895
People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you,

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:24.336
and when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created

00:06:24.336 --> 00:06:27.434
to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used,

00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:29.484
especially when only three to four percent of people

00:06:29.484 --> 00:06:32.282
who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study,

00:06:32.282 --> 00:06:35.840
their reaction is not, "Thank you, God, for protecting my privacy."

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.537
It's outrage

00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:40.662
that we have this information and we can't use it.

00:06:40.662 --> 00:06:43.138
And it's an accident.

00:06:43.138 --> 00:06:46.193
So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous.

00:06:46.193 --> 00:06:49.848
Two hundred and twenty-six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States.

00:06:49.848 --> 00:06:53.067
Fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States.

00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:55.640
And it's getting worse.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.622
So the good news is that some things have changed,

00:06:58.622 --> 00:07:00.175
and the most important thing that's changed

00:07:00.175 --> 00:07:02.513
is that we can now measure ourselves in ways

00:07:02.513 --> 00:07:05.571
that used to be the dominion of the health system.

00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:07.729
So a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust.

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:10.771
I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid.

00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:13.147
We can reach back and grab that dust,

00:07:13.147 --> 00:07:15.561
and we can learn a lot about health from it, so if our choices

00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:18.241
are part of our health, what we eat is a really important

00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:20.930
aspect of our health. So you can do something very simple

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.887
and basic and take a picture of your food,

00:07:22.887 --> 00:07:25.771
and if enough people do that, we can learn a lot about

00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:27.196
how our food affects our health.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:31.712
One interesting thing that came out of this — this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery —

00:07:31.712 --> 00:07:34.202
is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier

00:07:34.202 --> 00:07:37.640
than other people's pizza is. Okay? (Laughter)

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.248
And it seems like a trivial result, but this is the sort of research

00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:43.562
that used to take the health system years

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:45.855
and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish.

00:07:45.855 --> 00:07:49.579
It was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people.

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:52.203
I don't have any financial interest in it.

00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:54.899
But more nontrivially, we can get our genotypes done,

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:57.717
and although our genotypes aren't dispositive, they give us clues.

00:07:57.717 --> 00:08:00.523
So I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's.

00:08:00.523 --> 00:08:02.755
This is the interpretation of it. As you can see,

00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:05.355
I carry a 32 percent risk of prostate cancer,

00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:09.578
22 percent risk of psoriasis and a 14 percent risk of Alzheimer's disease.

00:08:09.578 --> 00:08:12.185
So that means, if you're a geneticist, you're freaking out,

00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:16.219
going, "Oh my God, you told everyone you carry the ApoE E4 allele. What's wrong with you?"

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:19.907
Right? When I got these results, I started talking to doctors,

00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:22.316
and they told me not to tell anyone, and my reaction is,

00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:25.604
"Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease?"

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:28.668
And no one could tell me yes.

00:08:28.668 --> 00:08:31.474
And I live in a web world where, when you share things,

00:08:31.474 --> 00:08:34.184
beautiful stuff happens, not bad stuff.

00:08:34.184 --> 00:08:36.084
So I started putting this in my slide decks,

00:08:36.084 --> 00:08:38.545
and I got even more obnoxious, and I went to my doctor,

00:08:38.545 --> 00:08:40.527
and I said, "I'd like to actually get my bloodwork.

00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:43.317
Please give me back my data." So this is my most recent bloodwork.

00:08:43.317 --> 00:08:45.686
As you can see, I have high cholesterol.

00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:48.437
I have particularly high bad cholesterol, and I have some

00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:51.440
bad liver numbers, but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.149
the night before we ran the test. (Laughter)

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:58.562
Right. But look at how non-computable this information is.

00:08:58.562 --> 00:09:01.536
This is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom

00:09:01.536 --> 00:09:05.135
from a data perspective, and I had to go into the system

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:07.297
and get it out.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:10.579
So the thing that I'm proposing we do here

00:09:10.579 --> 00:09:12.995
is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust,

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:15.973
that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype,

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:18.674
and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records,

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:22.114
and we use it to build something together, which is a commons.

00:09:22.114 --> 00:09:25.258
And there's been a lot of talk about commonses, right,

00:09:25.258 --> 00:09:28.206
here, there, everywhere, right. A commons is nothing more

00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:31.134
than a public good that we build out of private goods.

00:09:31.134 --> 00:09:33.903
We do it voluntarily, and we do it through standardized

00:09:33.903 --> 00:09:36.703
legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies.

00:09:36.703 --> 00:09:39.974
Right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build

00:09:39.974 --> 00:09:42.494
together because we think it's important.

00:09:42.494 --> 00:09:45.126
And a commons of data is something that's really unique,

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.994
because we make it from our own data. And although

00:09:47.994 --> 00:09:50.281
a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control

00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:52.536
around data, and obsess around privacy, at least

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:55.584
some of us really like to share as a form of control,

00:09:55.584 --> 00:09:57.937
and what's remarkable about digital commonses

00:09:57.937 --> 00:10:01.469
is you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough

00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:03.980
to generate something massive and beautiful.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.538
So not that many programmers write free software,

00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:08.873
but we have the Apache web server.

00:10:08.873 --> 00:10:11.570
Not that many people who read Wikipedia edit,

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.579
but it works. So as long as some people like to share

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:19.323
as their form of control, we can build a commons, as long as we can get the information out.

00:10:19.323 --> 00:10:21.699
And in biology, the numbers are even better.

00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:24.251
So Vanderbilt ran a study asking people, we'd like to take

00:10:24.251 --> 00:10:27.573
your biosamples, your blood, and share them in a biobank,

00:10:27.573 --> 00:10:29.945
and only five percent of the people opted out.

00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:33.037
I'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science-positive state

00:10:33.037 --> 00:10:36.076
in the United States of America. (Laughter)

00:10:36.076 --> 00:10:38.454
But only five percent of the people wanted out.

00:10:38.454 --> 00:10:42.477
So people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice.

00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:46.960
And the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.233
is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians,

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:53.147
and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data

00:10:53.147 --> 00:10:56.090
because they can use it to tease signals out of noise.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.058
And those correlations that they can tease out, they're not

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:02.930
necessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age,

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.290
is like a giant set of power tools

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.165
that we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health,

00:11:09.165 --> 00:11:11.477
while we use hand saws.

00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:15.915
If we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared

00:11:15.915 --> 00:11:18.663
outcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices,

00:11:18.663 --> 00:11:21.439
and a lot of shared environmental information, we can start

00:11:21.439 --> 00:11:24.335
to tease out the correlations between subtle variations

00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:29.646
in people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices,

00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:32.132
and there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.

00:11:32.132 --> 00:11:35.226
Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system

00:11:35.226 --> 00:11:39.798
that's waiting for data, but there isn't any.

00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:43.686
So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:47.624
the world's first fully digital, fully self-contributed,

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:52.659
unlimited in scope, global in participation, ethically approved

00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:56.314
clinical research study where you contribute the data.

00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:58.520
So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.146
if you reach into your body and grab your genome,

00:12:01.146 --> 00:12:04.193
if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record,

00:12:04.193 --> 00:12:07.516
you can actually go through an online informed consent process --

00:12:07.516 --> 00:12:10.162
because the donation to the commons must be voluntary

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.955
and it must be informed -- and you can actually upload

00:12:12.955 --> 00:12:15.547
your information and have it syndicated to the

00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:18.643
mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research,

00:12:18.643 --> 00:12:21.499
and the goal is to get 100,000 in the first year

00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:23.857
and a million in the first five years so that we have

00:12:23.857 --> 00:12:27.691
a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take

00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:30.113
smaller sample sizes from traditional research

00:12:30.113 --> 00:12:31.712
and map it against,

00:12:31.712 --> 00:12:34.634
so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations

00:12:34.634 --> 00:12:37.163
between the variations that make us unique

00:12:37.163 --> 00:12:41.187
and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society.

00:12:41.187 --> 00:12:44.211
And I've spent a lot of time around other commons.

00:12:44.211 --> 00:12:46.891
I've been around the early web. I've been around

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.499
the early creative commons world, and there's four things

00:12:49.499 --> 00:12:52.853
that all of these share, which is, they're all really simple.

00:12:52.853 --> 00:12:55.580
And so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.835
you're not going to see something complicated.

00:12:57.835 --> 00:13:02.884
But it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally,

00:13:02.884 --> 00:13:05.907
right, because you can always add power and control to a system,

00:13:05.907 --> 00:13:09.871
but it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning,

00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:12.416
and so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic,

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.600
and being weak doesn't mean weakness.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.951
Those are strengths in the system.

00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:19.616
And open doesn't mean that there's no money.

00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:22.636
Closed systems, corporations, make a lot of money

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:26.175
on the open web, and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives

00:13:26.175 --> 00:13:29.002
is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness

00:13:29.002 --> 00:13:31.336
of the system.

00:13:31.336 --> 00:13:35.130
And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created,

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.559
so you can actually come in, all you have to be is 14 years old,

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:40.586
willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk,

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.251
basically, and you're in.

00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:44.824
You can start analyzing the data.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:48.983
You do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well. (Laughter)

00:13:48.983 --> 00:13:52.564
And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it,

00:13:52.564 --> 00:13:55.710
that's okay too. That's all in the consent,

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.274
so if you don't like those terms, you don't come in.

00:13:58.274 --> 00:14:01.366
It's very much the design principles of a commons

00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:03.960
that we're trying to bring to health data.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.939
And the other thing about these systems is that it only takes

00:14:06.939 --> 00:14:10.118
a small number of really unreasonable people working together

00:14:10.118 --> 00:14:13.300
to create them. It didn't take that many people

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.772
to make Wikipedia Wikipedia, or to keep it Wikipedia.

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:18.840
And we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.116
and so I hate this word "patient."

00:14:21.116 --> 00:14:24.283
I don't like being patient when systems are broken,

00:14:24.283 --> 00:14:26.910
and health care is broken.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.074
I'm not talking about the politics of health care, I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care.

00:14:31.074 --> 00:14:34.344
So I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you

00:14:34.344 --> 00:14:37.390
is to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try,

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.107
when you go home, to get your data.

00:14:40.107 --> 00:14:42.824
You'll be shocked and offended and, I would bet, outraged,

00:14:42.824 --> 00:14:45.700
at how hard it is to get it.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.319
But it's a challenge that I hope you'll take,

00:14:48.319 --> 00:14:50.780
and maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.224
If you don't have anyone in your family who's sick,

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:55.217
maybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do,

00:14:55.217 --> 00:14:57.424
or if you've been sick, then maybe you would.

00:14:57.424 --> 00:15:00.512
And we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months

00:15:00.512 --> 00:15:03.669
that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there.

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.791
So this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study

00:15:05.791 --> 00:15:09.609
of 150,000 women in California, and they're going to

00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:12.327
return all the data to the participants of the study

00:15:12.327 --> 00:15:15.473
in a computable form, with one-clickability to load it into

00:15:15.473 --> 00:15:18.089
the study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly

00:15:18.089 --> 00:15:20.393
how many people are willing to be unreasonable.

00:15:20.393 --> 00:15:22.777
So what I'd end [with] is,

00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:26.097
the most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job

00:15:26.097 --> 00:15:29.480
almost a year ago to do this, is that it really doesn't take

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.288
very many of us to achieve spectacular results.

00:15:33.288 --> 00:15:36.000
You just have to be willing to be unreasonable,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.331
and the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men

00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:40.199
who got yellow fever ran. Right?

00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:43.060
It's to be naked, digitally, in public. So you know more

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.493
about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now.

00:15:46.493 --> 00:15:50.123
And being naked and alone can be terrifying.

00:15:50.123 --> 00:15:54.590
But to be naked in a group, voluntarily, can be quite beautiful.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.478
And so it doesn't take all of us.

00:15:56.478 --> 00:15:59.484
It just takes all of some of us. Thank you.

00:15:59.484 --> 00:16:05.074
(Applause)
