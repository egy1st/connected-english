WEBVTT

00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:05.356
We most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it.

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:11.242
We are at war with a new form of terrorism.

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:14.744
It's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism,

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:18.206
but it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century.

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:22.654
One of the big things about countering terrorism

00:00:22.654 --> 00:00:25.986
is, how do you perceive it?

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:29.482
Because perception leads to your response to it.

00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:33.710
So if you have a traditional perception of terrorism,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.658
it would be that it's one of criminality, one of war.

00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:39.271
So how are you going to respond to it?

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:42.905
Naturally, it would follow that you meet kind with kind.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:46.736
You fight it. If you have a more modernist approach,

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:50.992
and your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect,

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:54.955
then naturally from that, the responses that come out of it

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:58.603
are much more asymmetrical.

00:00:58.603 --> 00:01:02.710
We live in a modern, global world.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.192
Terrorists have actually adapted to it.

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:09.941
It's something we have to, too, and that means the people

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:13.081
who are working on counterterrorism responses

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.905
have to start, in effect, putting on

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:20.159
their Google-tinted glasses, or whatever.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.952
For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:28.456
terrorism as though it was a global brand,

00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:30.085
say, Coca-Cola.

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:36.102
Both are fairly bad for your health. (Laughter)

00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:40.132
If you look at it as a brand in those ways,

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:43.396
what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.

00:01:43.396 --> 00:01:46.489
As we've said, it's pretty bad for your health,

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:48.495
it's bad for those who it affects,

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:51.528
and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:55.144
It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin.

00:01:55.144 --> 00:02:00.136
You're not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven.

00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:02.606
It's not going to happen, I don't think.

00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:06.584
And you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:09.505
by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.

00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:12.783
But what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel.

00:02:12.783 --> 00:02:15.536
The brand has an Achilles' heel.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.303
We've mentioned the health,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.983
but it needs consumers to buy into it.

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:25.063
The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency.

00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:27.764
They're the people who buy into the brand, support them,

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:31.072
facilitate them, and they're the people

00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:33.587
we've got to reach out to.

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:36.447
We've got to attack that brand in front of them.

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:40.700
There's two essential ways of doing that, if we carry on this brand theme.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.978
One is reducing their market. What I mean is,

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:48.754
it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete.

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:51.006
We've got to show we're a better product.

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:54.163
If I'm trying to show we're a better product,

00:02:54.163 --> 00:02:59.094
I probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay.

00:02:59.094 --> 00:03:02.759
We've talked there about curtailing the underlying need

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.407
for the product itself. You could be looking there at

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:09.992
poverty, injustice, all those sorts of things

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:11.521
which feed terrorism.

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:15.253
The other thing to do is to knock the product,

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:17.448
attack the brand myth, as we've said.

00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:20.807
You know, there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid.

00:03:20.807 --> 00:03:25.503
Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across.

00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:28.597
We've got to reveal the dangers in the product.

00:03:28.597 --> 00:03:32.246
Our target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism,

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:33.447
as I've said, the terrorists.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.834
It's not just the marketeers of terrorism,

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:40.641
which is those who finance, those who facilitate it,

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:42.554
but it's the consumers of terrorism.

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.788
We've got to get in to those homelands.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:49.257
That's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength.

00:03:49.257 --> 00:03:51.609
That's where their consumers come from.

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.521
And we have to get our messaging in there.

00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:59.370
So the essentials are, we've got to have interaction

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.713
in those areas, with the terrorists, the facilitators, etc.

00:04:02.713 --> 00:04:05.848
We've got to engage, we've got to educate,

00:04:05.848 --> 00:04:08.651
and we've got to have dialogue.

00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:12.802
Now, staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds,

00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:16.054
think about delivery mechanisms.

00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:17.687
How are we going to do these attacks?

00:04:17.687 --> 00:04:20.696
Well, reducing the market is really one for governments

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:24.214
and civil society. We've got to show we're better.

00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:28.056
We've got to show our values.

00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:30.358
We've got to practice what we preach.

00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:32.571
But when it comes to knocking the brand,

00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:37.043
if the terrorists are Coca-Cola and we're Pepsi,

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:41.057
I don't think, being Pepsi, anything we say about Coca-Cola,

00:04:41.057 --> 00:04:42.939
anyone's going to believe us.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.264
So we've got to find a different mechanism,

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:47.656
and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across

00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:50.313
is the victims of terrorism.

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:53.226
They are somebody who can actually stand there and say,

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:57.654
"This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days.

00:04:57.654 --> 00:05:01.100
It burnt my hand, whatever." You believe them.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.743
You can see their scars. You trust them.

00:05:03.743 --> 00:05:09.008
But whether it's victims, whether it's governments,

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:14.713
NGOs, or even the Queen yesterday, in Northern Ireland,

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:18.815
we have to interact and engage with those different

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:23.410
layers of terrorism, and, in effect,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.457
we do have to have a little dance with the devil.

00:05:27.457 --> 00:05:30.440
This is my favorite part of my speech.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.696
I wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point,

00:05:33.696 --> 00:05:37.418
but — (Laughter) —

00:05:37.418 --> 00:05:40.206
TED, for health and safety reasons, have told me

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.712
I've got to do a countdown, so

00:05:41.712 --> 00:05:45.010
I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist,

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.424
sort of a health and safety terrorist, and I — (Laughter) —

00:05:50.424 --> 00:05:53.733
I've got to count 3, 2, 1, and

00:05:53.733 --> 00:05:57.060
it's a bit alarming, so thinking of what my motto would be,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.818
and it would be, "Body parts, not heart attacks."

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:05.309
So 3, 2, 1. (Explosion sound)

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:10.256
Very good. (Laughter)

00:06:10.256 --> 00:06:18.065
Now, lady in 15J was a suicide bomber amongst us all.

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:20.190
We're all victims of terrorism.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.091
There's 625 of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life.

00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:29.166
There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there.

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:31.650
The son's dead. The father lives.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.571
The father will probably kick himself for years to come

00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:41.810
that he didn't take that seat instead of his kid.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.823
He's going to take to alcohol, and he's probably

00:06:43.823 --> 00:06:48.183
going to kill himself in three years. That's the stats.

00:06:48.183 --> 00:06:51.927
There's a very young, attractive lady over here,

00:06:51.927 --> 00:06:54.955
and she has something which I think's the worst form

00:06:54.955 --> 00:06:57.751
of psychological, physical injury I've ever seen

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.447
out of a suicide bombing: It's human shrapnel.

00:07:01.447 --> 00:07:03.600
What it means is, when she sat in a restaurant

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.605
in years to come, 10 years to come, 15 years to come,

00:07:06.605 --> 00:07:09.087
or she's on the beach, every so often she's going to start

00:07:09.087 --> 00:07:12.060
rubbing her skin, and out of there will come

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.294
a piece of that shrapnel.

00:07:14.294 --> 00:07:19.526
And that is a hard thing for the head to take.

00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:22.454
There's a lady over there as well who lost her legs

00:07:22.454 --> 00:07:25.966
in this bombing.

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:30.050
She's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.157
of money off our government

00:07:34.157 --> 00:07:37.449
for looking after what's happened to her.

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:39.589
She had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:42.290
universities. She's going to give up university

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.019
to look after Mum.

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:48.551
We're all here, and all of those who watch it

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.190
are going to be traumatized by this event,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.338
but all of you here who are victims are going to learn

00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:55.920
some hard truths.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.641
That is, our society, we sympathize, but after a while,

00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:04.529
we start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society.

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:08.106
We do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them,

00:08:08.106 --> 00:08:11.114
and what I'm going to try and show is that actually,

00:08:11.114 --> 00:08:13.898
victims are the best weapon we have

00:08:13.898 --> 00:08:17.074
against more terrorism.

00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:21.290
How would the government at the turn of the millennium

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.515
approach today? Well, we all know.

00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:26.119
What they'd have done then is an invasion.

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:29.297
If the suicide bomber was from Wales,

00:08:29.297 --> 00:08:31.642
good luck to Wales, I'd say.

00:08:31.642 --> 00:08:35.394
Knee-jerk legislation, emergency provision legislation --

00:08:35.394 --> 00:08:39.093
which hits at the very basis of our society, as we all know --

00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:42.266
it's a mistake.

00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:45.721
We're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh,

00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:50.151
throughout the U.K., for Welsh people.

00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:55.796
Today's approach, governments have learned from their mistakes.

00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:58.034
They are looking at what I've started off on,

00:08:58.034 --> 00:09:01.588
on these more asymmetrical approaches to it,

00:09:01.588 --> 00:09:04.290
more modernist views, cause and effect.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.067
But mistakes of the past are inevitable.

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:08.567
It's human nature.

00:09:08.567 --> 00:09:12.303
The fear and the pressure to do something on them

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:14.583
is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes.

00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:18.228
They're not just going to be smart.

00:09:18.228 --> 00:09:21.542
There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:24.597
the point very beautifully. He said,

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.709
"The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:31.173
to be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once."

00:09:31.173 --> 00:09:34.413
So what we need to do is we have to effect it.

00:09:34.413 --> 00:09:37.169
We've got to start thinking about being more proactive.

00:09:37.169 --> 00:09:41.857
We need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons

00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:43.478
in this war on terrorism.

00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:51.926
But of course, it's ideas -- is not something that governments do very well.

00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:56.105
I want to go back just to before the bang, to this idea of

00:09:56.105 --> 00:10:00.299
brand, and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi, etc.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:04.210
We see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.231
They'll see it as freedom fighters and truth

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:13.454
against injustice, imperialism, etc.

00:10:13.454 --> 00:10:17.445
We do have to see this as a deadly battlefield.

00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:20.619
It's not just [our] flesh and blood they want.

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:23.492
They actually want our cultural souls, and that's why

00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:27.503
the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this.

00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:32.083
If we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:36.623
a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere

00:10:36.623 --> 00:10:38.762
which not many people had heard of.

00:10:38.762 --> 00:10:42.926
9/11 launched it. It was its big marketing day,

00:10:42.926 --> 00:10:47.795
and it was packaged for the 21st century. They knew what they were doing.

00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:51.723
They were effectively [doing] something in this brand image

00:10:51.723 --> 00:10:54.907
of creating a brand which can be franchised around

00:10:54.907 --> 00:11:00.567
the world, where there's poverty, ignorance and injustice.

00:11:00.567 --> 00:11:04.630
We, as I've said, have got to hit that market,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.089
but we've got to use our heads rather than our might.

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:11.863
If we perceive it in this way as a brand, or other ways of thinking at it like this,

00:11:11.863 --> 00:11:16.302
we will not resolve or counter terrorism.

00:11:16.302 --> 00:11:19.662
What I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples

00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:25.093
from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently.

00:11:25.093 --> 00:11:28.782
The first one has been dubbed "lawfare,"

00:11:28.782 --> 00:11:31.224
for want of a better word.

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:35.424
When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists,

00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:37.790
everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.554
and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it.

00:11:41.554 --> 00:11:43.167
There's a bomb, people start suing.

00:11:43.167 --> 00:11:46.858
But one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing.

00:11:46.858 --> 00:11:50.597
A civil action was brought from 1998.

00:11:50.597 --> 00:11:54.005
In Omagh, bomb went off, Real IRA,

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:56.220
middle of a peace process.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.363
That meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted

00:12:00.363 --> 00:12:03.611
for lots of reasons, mostly to do with the peace process

00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:05.828
and what was going on, the greater good.

00:12:05.828 --> 00:12:08.323
It also meant, then, if you can imagine this,

00:12:08.323 --> 00:12:10.626
that the people who bombed your children

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:15.983
and your husbands were walking around the supermarket

00:12:15.983 --> 00:12:17.667
that you lived in.

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:21.429
Some of those victims said enough is enough.

00:12:21.429 --> 00:12:24.863
We brought a private action, and thank God, 10 years later,

00:12:24.863 --> 00:12:27.458
we actually won it. There is a slight appeal on

00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:29.273
at the moment so I have to be a bit careful,

00:12:29.273 --> 00:12:31.375
but I'm fairly confident.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.009
Why was it effective?

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:35.646
It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done

00:12:35.646 --> 00:12:37.385
where there was a huge void.

00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:42.011
It was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups,

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.090
their whole strength is from the fact that they are

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.836
an underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:51.976
and flipped it, they didn't know what to do.

00:12:51.976 --> 00:12:56.227
They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down.

00:12:56.227 --> 00:13:00.515
The bombs actually stopped -- fact -- because of this action.

00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:04.220
We became, or those victims became, more importantly,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.196
a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization.

00:13:08.196 --> 00:13:10.995
There's other examples. We have a case called Almog

00:13:10.995 --> 00:13:15.187
which is to do with a bank that was,

00:13:15.187 --> 00:13:18.193
allegedly, from our point of view,

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:22.108
giving rewards to suicide bombers.

00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:25.116
Just by bringing the very action,

00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:27.627
that bank has stopped doing it, and indeed,

00:13:27.627 --> 00:13:30.031
the powers that be around the world, which for real politic

00:13:30.031 --> 00:13:33.374
reasons before, couldn't actually deal with this issue,

00:13:33.374 --> 00:13:34.904
because there was lots of competing interests,

00:13:34.904 --> 00:13:37.888
have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system.

00:13:37.888 --> 00:13:40.603
There's another case called the McDonald case,

00:13:40.603 --> 00:13:44.925
where some victims of Semtex, of the Provisional IRA bombings,

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:51.544
which were supplied by Gaddafi, sued,

00:13:51.544 --> 00:13:56.481
and that action has led to amazing things for new Libya.

00:13:56.481 --> 00:13:59.434
New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims,

00:13:59.434 --> 00:14:03.066
and started taking it -- so it started a whole new dialogue there.

00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:07.349
But the problem is, we need more and more support

00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:10.151
for these ideas and cases.

00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:14.577
Civil affairs and civil society initiatives.

00:14:14.577 --> 00:14:17.104
A good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy.

00:14:17.104 --> 00:14:18.910
If anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.536
like a war on terrorism and beat it, you're wrong.

00:14:21.536 --> 00:14:24.523
What we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman.

00:14:24.523 --> 00:14:26.747
They used to be fisherman, of course,

00:14:26.747 --> 00:14:29.943
but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste

00:14:29.943 --> 00:14:33.238
in their water, so what we're trying to do is create

00:14:33.238 --> 00:14:35.724
security and employment by bringing a coastguard

00:14:35.724 --> 00:14:39.061
along with the fisheries industry, and I can guarantee you,

00:14:39.061 --> 00:14:41.925
as that builds, al Shabaab and such likes will not have

00:14:41.925 --> 00:14:45.749
the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people.

00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:49.624
These initiatives cost less than a missile,

00:14:49.624 --> 00:14:52.591
and certainly less than any soldier's life,

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:55.446
but more importantly, it takes the war to their homelands,

00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:57.744
and not onto our shore,

00:14:57.744 --> 00:14:59.188
and we're looking at the causes.

00:14:59.188 --> 00:15:02.637
The last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue.

00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:05.443
The advantages of dialogue are obvious.

00:15:05.443 --> 00:15:09.745
It self-educates both sides, enables a better understanding,

00:15:09.745 --> 00:15:11.967
reveals the strengths and weaknesses,

00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:14.568
and yes, like some of the speakers before,

00:15:14.568 --> 00:15:18.457
the shared vulnerability does lead to trust, and

00:15:18.457 --> 00:15:21.362
it does then become, that process, part of normalization.

00:15:21.362 --> 00:15:26.035
But it's not an easy road. After the bomb,

00:15:26.035 --> 00:15:29.164
the victims are not into this.

00:15:29.164 --> 00:15:31.058
There's practical problems.

00:15:31.058 --> 00:15:33.954
It's politically risky for the protagonists

00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:36.689
and for the interlocutors. On one occasion

00:15:36.689 --> 00:15:39.130
I was doing it, every time I did a point that they didn't like,

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.991
they actually threw stones at me,

00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:42.978
and when I did a point they liked,

00:15:42.978 --> 00:15:47.573
they starting shooting in the air, equally not great. (Laughter)

00:15:47.573 --> 00:15:50.775
Whatever the point, it gets to the heart of the problem,

00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:52.891
you're doing it, you're talking to them.

00:15:52.891 --> 00:15:56.634
Now, I just want to end with saying, if we follow reason,

00:15:56.634 --> 00:16:01.996
we realize that I think we'd all say that we want to

00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:04.678
have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure

00:16:04.678 --> 00:16:08.427
military perception of it.

00:16:08.446 --> 00:16:10.903
We need to foster more

00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:13.688
modern and asymmetrical responses to it.

00:16:13.688 --> 00:16:16.243
This isn't about being soft on terrorism.

00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:19.963
It's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields.

00:16:19.963 --> 00:16:22.914
We must foster innovation, as I've said.

00:16:22.914 --> 00:16:26.786
Governments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors.

00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:28.999
The private sector has a role.

00:16:28.999 --> 00:16:31.572
The role we could do right now is going away

00:16:31.572 --> 00:16:35.297
and looking at how we can support victims around the world

00:16:35.297 --> 00:16:36.769
to bring initiatives.

00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:39.572
If I was to leave you with some big questions here which

00:16:39.572 --> 00:16:43.047
may change one's perception to it, and who knows what

00:16:43.047 --> 00:16:45.426
thoughts and responses will come out of it,

00:16:45.426 --> 00:16:49.381
but did myself and my terrorist group actually need

00:16:49.381 --> 00:16:52.617
to blow you up to make our point?

00:16:52.617 --> 00:16:56.999
We have to ask ourselves these questions, however unpalatable.

00:16:56.999 --> 00:17:00.133
Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian

00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:02.898
struggle somewhere in the world?

00:17:02.898 --> 00:17:05.548
What if, actually, engagement on poverty and injustice

00:17:05.548 --> 00:17:07.963
is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do?

00:17:07.963 --> 00:17:11.068
What if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us?

00:17:11.068 --> 00:17:14.267
What happens if that bomb went off

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:17.574
because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place

00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:22.253
to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction?

00:17:22.253 --> 00:17:25.420
What is definitely uncontroversial

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.227
is that, as I've said, we've got to stop being reactive,

00:17:27.227 --> 00:17:30.844
and more proactive, and I just want to leave you

00:17:30.844 --> 00:17:34.252
with one idea, which is that

00:17:34.252 --> 00:17:37.412
it's a provocative question for you to think about,

00:17:37.412 --> 00:17:41.533
and the answer will require sympathy with the devil.

00:17:41.533 --> 00:17:44.250
It's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:49.167
and writers: What if society actually needs crisis to change?

00:17:49.167 --> 00:17:53.470
What if society actually needs terrorism

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.013
to change and adapt for the better?

00:17:55.013 --> 00:17:59.564
It's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus

00:17:59.564 --> 00:18:02.768
and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane

00:18:02.768 --> 00:18:05.048
walking into the moonlight.

00:18:05.048 --> 00:18:07.896
What it would mean is that humans,

00:18:07.896 --> 00:18:10.552
in order to survive in development,

00:18:10.552 --> 00:18:12.627
quite Darwinian spirit here,

00:18:12.627 --> 00:18:16.957
inherently must dance with the devil.

00:18:16.957 --> 00:18:21.216
A lot of people say that communism was defeated

00:18:21.216 --> 00:18:25.210
by the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.046
Maybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this.

00:18:28.046 --> 00:18:30.633
Thank you.

00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:39.503
(Music) (Applause)

00:18:39.503 --> 00:18:42.081
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. (Applause)
