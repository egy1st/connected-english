00:00:01.487 --> 00:00:03.656
Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:07.703
All you have to do is read what you see. Right?

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:10.904
So, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:13.403
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?

00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:17.782
BL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this.

00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:23.098
BL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter)

00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:27.895
If you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.873
Audience: What are you reading?

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:33.331
BL: What are you reading? There are no words there.

00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:35.868
I said, read what you're seeing. Right?

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:39.718
It literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" (Laughter) Right?

00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:43.546
That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:47.082
It's because perception is grounded in our experience.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:49.979
Right? The brain takes meaningless information

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.938
and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:55.194
what's there, we never see information,

00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:58.469
we only ever see what was useful to see in the past.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.205
All right? Which means, when it comes to perception,

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:08.000
we're all like this frog.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.912
(Laughter)

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:12.307
Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior

00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:16.775
that's useful. (Laughter)

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:23.807
(Laughter)

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:29.789
(Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.501
BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way,

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.760
we get a little bit annoyed, right?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.490
But we're talking about perception here, right?

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.855
And perception underpins everything we think, we know,

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:44.726
we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear,

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:48.469
falling in love, everything begins with perception.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.414
Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means

00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:54.873
we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.

00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:57.949
But actually, it's a tremendous problem,

00:01:57.949 --> 00:02:01.566
because how can we ever see differently?

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:05.629
Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently,

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:09.617
and all new perceptions begin in the same way.

00:02:09.617 --> 00:02:12.199
They begin with a question.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.437
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty.

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:18.166
Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:21.767
a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.127
Okay? (Laughter)

00:02:23.127 --> 00:02:26.287
Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:28.539
Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.715
are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:33.031
it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:37.686
Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:41.615
The question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do,

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:44.607
because it takes you into uncertainty.

00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:47.486
And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:51.022
do anything new is to step into that space.

00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:54.246
So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately,

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.830
evolution has given us an answer, right?

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.425
And it enables us to address even the most difficult

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:06.104
of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:10.060
They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.049
It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin,

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.357
or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:18.358
is really stepping into that space.

00:03:18.358 --> 00:03:23.168
So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:24.941
It's play.

00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:29.134
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you

00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:31.749
that actually it's a way of being.

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.640
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.966
is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.

00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:43.241
Right? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility,

00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:47.350
and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.076
and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means

00:03:49.076 --> 00:03:53.682
is that we play to play. Play is its own reward.

00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:57.573
Now if you look at these five ways of being,

00:03:57.573 --> 00:04:00.294
these are the exact same ways of being you need

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:02.330
in order to be a good scientist.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.357
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper.

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:08.497
It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true

00:04:08.497 --> 00:04:11.150
for anything that is creative.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.353
So if you add rules to play, you have a game.

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:18.143
That's actually what an experiment is.

00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:20.062
So armed with these two ideas,

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:24.384
that science is a way of being and experiments are play,

00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:27.837
we asked, can anyone become a scientist?

00:04:27.837 --> 00:04:31.337
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:34.844
Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena

00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:38.391
down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this

00:04:38.391 --> 00:04:42.635
was to not just get the kids to see science differently,

00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:47.233
but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:50.641
The first step was to ask a question.

00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:53.521
Now, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study

00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:56.851
because the scientists said small children couldn't make

00:04:56.851 --> 00:05:01.153
a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.

00:05:01.153 --> 00:05:04.887
So we did it anyway. Right? Of course.

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:07.706
So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:12.146
so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:16.764
were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?

00:05:16.764 --> 00:05:19.424
So they were asking questions that were significant

00:05:19.424 --> 00:05:21.554
to expert scientists.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:25.688
Now here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?

00:05:25.688 --> 00:05:28.300
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.634
and she's now one of the youngest published scientists

00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:34.517
in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage,

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:38.215
will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?

00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:41.090
Now, science and asking questions is about courage.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.290
Now she is the personification of courage, because she's

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.677
going to stand up here and talk to you all.

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:50.931
So Amy, would you please come up? (Applause)

00:05:50.931 --> 00:05:58.116
(Applause)

00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:00.635
So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call

00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:03.301
the Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you

00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:05.846
the question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.

00:06:05.846 --> 00:06:07.565
Amy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought

00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:10.966
that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:13.990
in the way that we think, because we look alike.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.679
But we wondered if there's a possible link

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:21.383
with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees

00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:25.496
thought similar, since they seem so different from us.

00:06:25.496 --> 00:06:28.549
So we asked if humans and bees might solve

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:30.956
complex problems in the same way.

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:34.243
Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt

00:06:34.243 --> 00:06:37.950
themselves to new situations using previously learned rules

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.164
and conditions. So what if bees can think like us?

00:06:42.164 --> 00:06:44.716
Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect

00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:47.241
with only one million brain cells.

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.383
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should,

00:06:49.383 --> 00:06:52.660
because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.273
regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather,

00:06:56.273 --> 00:07:02.015
or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause)

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:05.797
BL: So the next step was to design an experiment,

00:07:05.797 --> 00:07:09.099
which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.400
this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.866
Amy, can you tell us what the game was,

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:16.009
and the puzzle that you set the bees?

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.032
AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.

00:07:19.032 --> 00:07:22.677
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color,

00:07:22.677 --> 00:07:25.345
but to a certain color flower only

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:26.977
when it's in a certain pattern.

00:07:26.977 --> 00:07:30.236
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers

00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:33.296
if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue,

00:07:33.296 --> 00:07:36.564
or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.

00:07:36.564 --> 00:07:39.149
Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:42.574
to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?

00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:45.354
What was really exciting about this project was we,

00:07:45.354 --> 00:07:47.697
and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.

00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:50.151
It was completely new, and no one had done it before,

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:53.874
including adults. (Laughter)

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:57.338
BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.

00:07:57.338 --> 00:08:00.242
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing,

00:08:00.242 --> 00:08:02.786
because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher

00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:04.411
not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day --

00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:07.010
so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.219
the collaborator on this project. Okay?

00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:11.951
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study

00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:14.589
because actually you can read about it, but the next step

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:18.234
is observation. So here are some of the students

00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:21.002
doing the observations. They're recording the data

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:26.046
of where the bees fly.

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:28.069
(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do —Student: 5C.

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:32.059
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.656
Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?

00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:38.560
BL: "Can you help me, Henry?" What good scientist says that, right?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.270
Student: There's two up there.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.144
And three in here.

00:08:46.144 --> 00:08:48.419
BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:52.192
They do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.

00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:54.123
And now we want to share. That's the next step.

00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:55.731
So we're going to write this up and try to submit this

00:08:55.731 --> 00:08:58.587
for publication. Right? So we have to write it up.

00:08:58.587 --> 00:09:03.100
So we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter)

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.384
The one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter)

00:09:05.384 --> 00:09:07.470
Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections:

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.277
an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.

00:09:10.277 --> 00:09:12.881
The introduction says, what's the question and why?

00:09:12.881 --> 00:09:16.000
Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.143
And the discussion is, who cares? Right?

00:09:18.143 --> 00:09:20.602
That's a science paper, basically. (Laughter)

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:25.131
So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative,

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:28.378
which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.

00:09:28.378 --> 00:09:30.906
It's not written by me. It's written by Amy

00:09:30.906 --> 00:09:34.226
and the other students in the class. As a consequence,

00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:40.243
this science paper begins, "Once upon a time ... " (Laughter)

00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:45.555
The results section, it says: "Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh." Right? (Laughter)

00:09:45.555 --> 00:09:47.751
And the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees

00:09:47.751 --> 00:09:51.068
into the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face. Right? (Laughter)

00:09:51.068 --> 00:09:54.901
This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.

00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.735
So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.

00:09:57.735 --> 00:10:00.586
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.

00:10:00.586 --> 00:10:02.636
The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:05.882
if it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al,"

00:10:05.882 --> 00:10:08.939
and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal,

00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:12.271
and it says this. It said many things, but it said this.

00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:16.190
"I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." (Laughter)

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.750
In other words, it starts off "once upon a time,"

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.276
the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter)

00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:25.629
So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves,

00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:29.162
who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world,

00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:32.611
and he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" — (Laughter) —

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.708
"and it certainly deserves wide exposure."

00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:38.979
Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent.

00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:42.345
The work would be publishable if done by adults."

00:10:42.345 --> 00:10:44.324
So what did we do? We send it back to the editor.

00:10:44.324 --> 00:10:45.913
They say no.

00:10:45.913 --> 00:10:48.367
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write

00:10:48.367 --> 00:10:52.374
a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right,

00:10:52.374 --> 00:10:56.502
putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.

00:10:56.502 --> 00:10:59.829
And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees,

00:10:59.829 --> 00:11:04.250
and it was published. Okay? (Applause)

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:10.250
(Applause)

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.271
It took four months to do the science,

00:11:13.271 --> 00:11:16.499
two years to get it published. (Laughter)

00:11:16.499 --> 00:11:21.334
Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and

00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:23.767
her friends the youngest published scientists in the world.

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.783
What was the feedback like?

00:11:25.783 --> 00:11:28.668
Well, it was published two days before Christmas,

00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:32.671
downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?

00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:36.711
It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.

00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:39.253
It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.

00:11:39.253 --> 00:11:42.933
It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.

00:11:42.933 --> 00:11:45.632
Last year, it was the second-most downloaded paper

00:11:45.632 --> 00:11:49.736
by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists

00:11:49.736 --> 00:11:52.284
and teachers but the public as well.

00:11:52.284 --> 00:11:54.056
And I'll just read one.

00:11:54.056 --> 00:11:56.546
"I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have

00:11:56.546 --> 00:11:58.859
words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.

00:11:58.859 --> 00:12:01.338
What you guys have done is real, true and amazing.

00:12:01.338 --> 00:12:04.447
Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic

00:12:04.447 --> 00:12:06.171
and most important things to do science.

00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:08.649
Who else can have these qualities more than children?

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:12.190
Please congratulate your children's team from my side."

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.573
So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.

00:12:15.573 --> 00:12:18.541
Can I do it on you? (Laughter)

00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:21.634
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.

00:12:21.634 --> 00:12:26.811
Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter)

00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:32.909
For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter)

00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:34.485
And you like technology, right?

00:12:34.485 --> 00:12:36.661
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.

00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:39.612
BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.

00:12:39.612 --> 00:12:43.220
Now ... (Laughter)

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.100
Okay. (Laughter)

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.184
Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?

00:12:50.184 --> 00:12:54.203
You have to close your eyes, and you have to point

00:12:54.203 --> 00:12:57.360
where you hear me clapping. All right?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.758
(Clapping)

00:13:01.758 --> 00:13:04.902
(Clapping)

00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:07.805
Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?

00:13:07.805 --> 00:13:10.706
Audience: (Shouts)

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:15.152
(Laughter)

00:13:15.152 --> 00:13:18.323
(Shouts) (Laughter)

00:13:18.323 --> 00:13:21.964
Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.

00:13:21.964 --> 00:13:24.766
Everyone over there shout. (Shouts)

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:30.698
Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:30.698 --> 00:13:34.928
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:13:34.928 --> 00:13:38.641
What's the point? The point is what science does for us.

00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:41.047
Right? We normally walk through life responding,

00:13:41.047 --> 00:13:43.259
but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:45.948
step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes,

00:13:45.948 --> 00:13:48.330
he was able to see the world in a new way.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.498
That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:55.514
to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?

00:13:55.514 --> 00:13:58.538
Now, true science education I think should be about

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:01.937
giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice,

00:14:01.937 --> 00:14:06.306
so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.

00:14:06.306 --> 00:14:09.411
So, Amy?

00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:11.964
AO: This project was really exciting for me,

00:14:11.964 --> 00:14:14.635
because it brought the process of discovery to life,

00:14:14.635 --> 00:14:17.546
and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone,

00:14:17.546 --> 00:14:20.299
has the potential to discover something new,

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:24.371
and that a small question can lead into a big discovery.

00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:27.023
Changing the way a person thinks about something

00:14:27.023 --> 00:14:30.735
can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person

00:14:30.735 --> 00:14:32.223
feels about change.

00:14:32.223 --> 00:14:34.675
But changing the way I thought about science was

00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:36.950
surprisingly easy. Once we played the games

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.368
and then started to think about the puzzle,

00:14:39.368 --> 00:14:43.225
I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject,

00:14:43.225 --> 00:14:46.419
and that anyone can discover something new.

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.619
You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came

00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:52.255
in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.

00:14:52.255 --> 00:14:56.616
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:14:56.616 --> 00:15:04.363
(Applause)
