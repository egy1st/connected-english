00:00:00.975 --> 00:00:05.047
In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti,

00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:08.377
my former professor of art history, and today

00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:12.563
a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:16.534
Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:20.322
to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:23.135
a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci,

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:25.762
the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:28.708
in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:31.811
Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:35.738
for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:39.608
I decided, with some researchers from the United States

00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:43.819
and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:47.938
decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.615
searching for the lost Leonardo.

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:54.069
Unfortunately, at that time we did not know that

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:58.411
that was not exactly where we should be looking,

00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:02.549
because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.884
came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:11.115
thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.

00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:14.354
Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct

00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:17.210
the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.015
and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494,

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:23.895
and to find out the original doors, windows,

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:28.654
and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model,

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.756
and then, with thermography, we went on to discover

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.987
hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall

00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:38.565
of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.878
of the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore,

00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:44.526
all the layout of this original hall

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:48.081
the way it was before there came Vasari,

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:50.676
and restructured the whole thing,

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:54.012
including a staircase that was very important

00:01:54.012 --> 00:01:58.151
in order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari"

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:02.415
on a specific area of one of the two walls.

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:05.656
Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:10.144
to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574

00:02:10.144 --> 00:02:14.476
by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family,

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:17.917
we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:21.174
specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.539
and leaving a small air gap.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.227
One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence,

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:30.345
so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:33.731
like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo,

00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:36.216
since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:40.723
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:45.951
just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:50.786
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall,

00:02:50.786 --> 00:02:53.408
an air gap, and that's where

00:02:53.408 --> 00:02:54.958
we believe "The Battle of Anghiari,"

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.924
or at least the part that we know has been painted,

00:02:56.924 --> 00:03:00.252
which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.

00:03:00.252 --> 00:03:03.845
Well, from there, unfortunately,

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.499
in 2004, the project

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.646
came to a halt. Many political reasons.

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:11.980
So I decided to go back to my alma mater,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.652
and, at the University of California, San Diego,

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.018
and I proposed to open up a research center

00:03:17.018 --> 00:03:19.830
for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.353
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:27.166
for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.929
and archaeology. So students started to flow in,

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.063
and we started to build technologies, because that's

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:34.712
basically what we also needed in order to move forward

00:03:34.712 --> 00:03:37.472
and go and do fieldwork.

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:41.870
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.501
and this time, with a great group of students,

00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:47.941
and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester,

00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:50.643
who is now the director at CISA3, and we

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:54.816
came back just since we knew already where to look for

00:03:54.816 --> 00:03:57.796
to find out if there was still something left.

00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:01.929
Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say,

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.926
for several reasons that it's not worth explaining,

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:08.672
to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had,

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:12.467
and with a 4mm camera attached to it,

00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:17.256
we were successful in documenting and taking

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:22.060
some fragments of what it turns out to be

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.660
a reddish color, black color, and there is some

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.057
beige fragments that later on

00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:32.051
we ran a much more sophisticated exams,

00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:37.291
XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.954
so far. It seems to indicate that indeed

00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:43.010
we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.311
that no other artist has painted on that wall

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:48.830
before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.691
those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.306
and most likely to Leonardo.

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:59.129
Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.370
work of art ever achieved by mankind.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.575
As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important

00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:08.411
commission that Leonardo has ever had,

00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:13.024
and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named

00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:17.829
the number one artist influence at the time.

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:21.436
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:25.096
to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me,

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:28.167
but basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example,

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:30.723
the state of conservation. See here the face of the

00:05:30.723 --> 00:05:35.447
Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it

00:05:35.447 --> 00:05:38.135
you suddenly see another, different lady,

00:05:38.135 --> 00:05:40.430
aged lady, I should rather say.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.019
There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches,

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:46.866
and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:50.623
But also, technology has helped to write new pages

00:05:50.623 --> 00:05:53.545
of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:55.683
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn,"

00:05:55.683 --> 00:05:58.161
another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.

00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:00.633
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but

00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:04.310
if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.669
And — (Laughter) — no problem, but, unfortunately,

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.447
continuing with the scientific examination of this painting

00:06:11.447 --> 00:06:14.447
came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn,

00:06:14.447 --> 00:06:17.104
did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting

00:06:17.104 --> 00:06:21.840
unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.731
of the unicorn — (Laughter) — unfortunately,

00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:27.891
is not very reliable. (Laughter)

00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:30.491
Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment

00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:34.586
if science really could move in the field of authenticity

00:06:34.586 --> 00:06:37.974
of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution

00:06:37.974 --> 00:06:41.135
to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution,

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:43.527
let me add. Take this example:

00:06:43.527 --> 00:06:47.221
Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life"

00:06:47.221 --> 00:06:51.316
at the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through,

00:06:51.316 --> 00:06:55.051
and luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed

00:06:55.051 --> 00:06:57.651
that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.666
when it was made and also the location.

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:05.065
So that was a good result. Sometimes, it's not that good,

00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:10.229
and so, again, authenticity and science could go together

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:14.526
and change the way, not attributions being made,

00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:18.369
but at least lay the ground for a more objective,

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:22.090
or, I should rather say, less subjective attribution,

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.838
as it is done today.

00:07:24.838 --> 00:07:28.132
But I would say the discovery that really caught

00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:32.239
my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:35.851
drawing under this layer, brown layer,

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:39.103
of "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see

00:07:39.103 --> 00:07:43.533
a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it,

00:07:43.533 --> 00:07:46.740
and just peering through this brown layer

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.491
of this masterpiece to reveal

00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:52.191
what could have been underneath.

00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:54.543
Well, this happens to be the most important painting

00:07:54.543 --> 00:07:57.400
we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.136
look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen

00:08:02.136 --> 00:08:05.827
for five centuries. Look at these portraits.

00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:08.200
They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.857
You see the geniality of his creation, right directly

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:14.764
on the ground layer of the panel, and see

00:08:14.764 --> 00:08:20.836
this cool thing, finding, I should rather say,

00:08:20.836 --> 00:08:24.098
an elephant. (Laughter) Because of this elephant,

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:27.867
over 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.

00:08:27.867 --> 00:08:31.197
This was an epiphany. We came to understand

00:08:31.197 --> 00:08:34.923
and to prove that the brown coating that we see today

00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:37.690
was not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.197
only the other drawing that for five centuries

00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:45.407
we were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.

00:08:45.407 --> 00:08:49.783
Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have

00:08:49.783 --> 00:08:52.561
this pleasure, this privilege to see all this,

00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:56.099
to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?

00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:58.941
So we thought of an augmented reality application

00:08:58.941 --> 00:09:03.229
using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating

00:09:03.229 --> 00:09:06.818
what we could be doing, any of us could be doing,

00:09:06.818 --> 00:09:08.993
in a museum environment.

00:09:08.993 --> 00:09:13.455
So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?

00:09:13.455 --> 00:09:16.751
And we just aim the camera of the tablet

00:09:16.751 --> 00:09:22.882
to the painting that we are interested to see, like this.

00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:28.756
Okay? And I will just click on it, we pause,

00:09:28.756 --> 00:09:32.918
and now let me turn to you so the moment the image,

00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:36.271
or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting,

00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:38.937
then the images you just saw up there in the drawing

00:09:38.937 --> 00:09:42.694
are being loaded. And so, see.

00:09:42.694 --> 00:09:46.497
We can, as we said, we can zoom in. Then we can scroll.

00:09:46.497 --> 00:09:51.442
Okay? Let's go and find the elephant.

00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:54.699
So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:59.240
and we see the elephant. (Applause)

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.784
(Applause)

00:10:02.784 --> 00:10:05.496
Okay? And then if we want,

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:08.276
we can continue the scroll to find out, for example,

00:10:08.276 --> 00:10:12.371
on the staircase, the whole iconography is going

00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:14.699
to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:17.330
from the ruins of an old temple a new temple,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.118
and there are a lot of figures showing up. See?

00:10:21.118 --> 00:10:24.324
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:27.372
not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology,

00:10:27.372 --> 00:10:29.723
the meaning of the painting,

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:32.513
and we believe this is a cool way, easy way,

00:10:32.513 --> 00:10:35.653
that everybody could have access to, to become more

00:10:35.653 --> 00:10:38.746
the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just

00:10:38.746 --> 00:10:42.120
be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.314
endless rooms of museums.

00:10:46.314 --> 00:10:51.650
(Applause)

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.407
Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds

00:10:55.407 --> 00:10:57.882
very obvious if we were to talk about real patients,

00:10:57.882 --> 00:11:00.138
but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately,

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:02.270
it's never been tapped as an idea.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.825
Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning,

00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:07.310
the very first step, to do real conservation,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.798
and allowing us to really explore and to understand

00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:13.589
everything related to the state of our conservation,

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:16.963
the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why

00:11:16.963 --> 00:11:21.554
we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on

00:11:21.554 --> 00:11:25.085
the environment surrounding the painting.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:28.495
Well, our vision is to rediscover

00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:30.904
the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline

00:11:30.904 --> 00:11:34.513
where engineering for cultural heritage is actually

00:11:34.513 --> 00:11:37.215
a symbol of blending art and science together.

00:11:37.215 --> 00:11:39.645
We definitely need a new breed of engineers

00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:42.378
that will go out and do this kind of work and

00:11:42.378 --> 00:11:46.720
rediscover for us these values, these cultural values

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.274
that we badly need, especially today.

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:53.008
And if you want to summarize in one just single word,

00:11:53.008 --> 00:11:55.924
well, this is what we're trying to do.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.162
We're trying to give a future to our past

00:11:58.162 --> 00:12:00.564
in order to have a future.

00:12:00.564 --> 00:12:03.632
As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion,

00:12:03.632 --> 00:12:07.818
there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you. (Applause)

00:12:07.818 --> 00:12:13.595
