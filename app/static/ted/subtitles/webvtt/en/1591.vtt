00:00:00.642 --> 00:00:03.802
Companies are losing control.

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:05.407
What happens on Wall Street

00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:07.738
no longer stays on Wall Street.

00:00:07.738 --> 00:00:11.624
What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube. (Laughter)

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:15.840
Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.416
Management teams seem increasingly

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:21.440
disconnected from their staff. (Laughter)

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.965
A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:27.609
their employees are inspired by their firm.

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.756
However, in the same survey, only four percent

00:00:29.756 --> 00:00:32.199
of employees agreed.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.249
Companies are losing control

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:37.891
of their customers and their employees.

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.141
But are they really?

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.438
I'm a marketer, and as a marketer, I know

00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:46.465
that I've never really been in control.

00:00:46.465 --> 00:00:49.108
Your brand is what other people say about you

00:00:49.108 --> 00:00:52.303
when you're not in the room, the saying goes.

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:56.434
Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:59.315
to be in that room now, 24/7.

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:01.790
They can listen and join the conversation.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.990
In fact, they have more control over the loss of control

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.380
than ever before.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.430
They can design for it. But how?

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.996
First of all, they can give employees and customers more control.

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:17.392
They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas,

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:20.770
knowledge, content, designs and product.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.218
They can give them more control over pricing,

00:01:23.218 --> 00:01:25.178
which is what the band Radiohead did

00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:28.252
with its pay-as-you-like online release of its album

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:31.200
"In Rainbows." Buyers could determine the price,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.050
but the offer was exclusive, and only stood for a limited period of time.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.009
The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.206
The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:46.388
opened a so-called "generous store" in Copenhagen.

00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:48.807
It asked customers to purchase chocolate

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:52.306
with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones.

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:55.220
It turned transactions into interactions,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.773
and generosity into a currency.

00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:00.734
Companies can even give control to hackers.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:03.185
When Microsoft Kinect came out,

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:07.336
the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console,

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:10.272
it immediately drew the attention of hackers.

00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:14.165
Microsoft first fought off the hacks, but then shifted course

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:17.028
when it realized that actively supporting the community

00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:18.787
came with benefits.

00:02:18.787 --> 00:02:22.023
The sense of co-ownership, the free publicity,

00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:25.040
the added value, all helped drive sales.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.369
The ultimate empowerment of customers

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.462
is to ask them not to buy.

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:34.389
Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.358
to check out eBay for its used products

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:40.925
and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones.

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:44.163
In an even more radical stance against consumerism,

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.256
the company placed a "Don't Buy This Jacket"

00:02:46.256 --> 00:02:49.756
advertisement during the peak of shopping season.

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:52.558
It may have jeopardized short-term sales,

00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:55.212
but it builds lasting, long-term loyalty

00:02:55.212 --> 00:02:57.382
based on shared values.

00:02:57.382 --> 00:03:00.602
Research has shown that giving employees more control

00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:04.371
over their work makes them happier and more productive.

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:07.340
The Brazilian company Semco Group famously

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.010
lets employees set their own work schedules

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.022
and even their salaries.

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:14.293
Hulu and Netflix, among other companies,

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:16.745
have open vacation policies.

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:19.663
Companies can give people more control,

00:03:19.663 --> 00:03:23.935
but they can also give them less control.

00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:26.682
Traditional business wisdom holds that trust

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:29.391
is earned by predictable behavior,

00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:32.036
but when everything is consistent and standardized,

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:34.959
how do you create meaningful experiences?

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.426
Giving people less control might be a wonderful way

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.688
to counter the abundance of choice

00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:42.370
and make them happier.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.183
Take the travel service Nextpedition.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.388
Nextpedition turns the trip into a game,

00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:51.960
with surprising twists and turns along the way.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.784
It does not tell the traveler where she's going

00:03:53.784 --> 00:03:56.853
until the very last minute, and information is provided

00:03:56.853 --> 00:04:00.836
just in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLM

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:04.021
launched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomly

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.813
handing out small gifts to travelers

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.975
en route to their destination.

00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:11.808
U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitter

00:04:11.808 --> 00:04:14.318
for users who were having a bad day,

00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:18.409
and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers.

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.422
Is there anything companies can do to make

00:04:20.422 --> 00:04:23.529
their employees feel less pressed for time? Yes.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.454
Force them to help others.

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:29.788
A recent study suggests that having employees complete

00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:32.599
occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.668
increases their sense of overall productivity.

00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:40.337
At Frog, the company I work for, we hold internal

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:44.938
speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees,

00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:47.898
helping them get to know each other fast.

00:04:47.898 --> 00:04:51.220
By applying a strict process, we give them less control,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.954
less choice, but we enable more and richer social interactions.

00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:58.810
Companies are the makers of their fortunes,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.073
and like all of us, they are utterly exposed to serendipity.

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:06.678
That should make them more humble, more vulnerable

00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:09.498
and more human.

00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:12.344
At the end of the day, as hyperconnectivity

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:14.654
and transparency expose companies' behavior

00:05:14.654 --> 00:05:18.288
in broad daylight, staying true to their true selves

00:05:18.288 --> 00:05:21.839
is the only sustainable value proposition.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.484
Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said,

00:05:24.484 --> 00:05:27.494
"What's interesting about you is you."

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.548
For the true selves of companies to come through,

00:05:30.548 --> 00:05:33.179
openness is paramount,

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:36.171
but radical openness is not a solution,

00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:39.581
because when everything is open, nothing is open.

00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:44.498
"A smile is a door that is half open and half closed,"

00:05:44.498 --> 00:05:46.552
the author Jennifer Egan wrote.

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:49.132
Companies can give their employees and customers

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:52.619
more control or less. They can worry about how much

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.277
openness is good for them, and what needs to stay closed.

00:05:56.277 --> 00:06:00.518
Or they can simply smile, and remain open

00:06:00.518 --> 00:06:02.135
to all possibilities.

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:06.246
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:06.246 --> 00:06:09.201
(Applause)
