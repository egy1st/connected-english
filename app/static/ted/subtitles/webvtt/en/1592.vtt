00:00:01.261 --> 00:00:03.783
Five years ago, I experienced a bit

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:07.119
of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:09.782
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,

00:00:09.782 --> 00:00:13.122
to teach a communications class for engineering students.

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:15.728
And I was scared. (Laughter)

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:19.399
Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:23.106
and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.311
But as these conversations unfolded,

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.219
I experienced what Alice must have when she went down

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.396
that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:36.007
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.756
with the students. I was amazed at the ideas

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:43.722
that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:46.353
And I believe the key to opening that door

00:00:46.353 --> 00:00:47.643
is great communication.

00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:50.527
We desperately need great communication from our

00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:53.586
scientists and engineers in order to change the world.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.476
Our scientists and engineers are the ones

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:59.642
that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.647
to environment to health care, among others,

00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:05.809
and if we don't know about it and understand it,

00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:08.817
then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility

00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:11.768
as non-scientists to have these interactions.

00:01:11.768 --> 00:01:14.928
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:18.162
and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.

00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:23.641
So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.128
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:30.203
to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy

00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:32.803
and that your engineering is engaging.

00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:36.536
First question to answer for us: so what?

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:40.491
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.

00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:43.121
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,

00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:47.018
but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones

00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:51.631
because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.

00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:56.137
And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.

00:01:56.137 --> 00:02:00.013
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:03.089
Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:06.515
"space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:11.663
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:14.440
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.874
as simple as possible, but no simpler.

00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:20.647
You can clearly communicate your science

00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:23.334
without compromising the ideas.

00:02:23.334 --> 00:02:27.279
A few things to consider are having examples, stories

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.984
and analogies. Those are ways to engage

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:31.166
and excite us about your content.

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:37.479
And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.332
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? (Laughter)

00:02:41.332 --> 00:02:43.700
What do bullets do? Bullets kill,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.012
and they will kill your presentation.

00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:50.191
A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much

00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.918
on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:57.822
Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is

00:02:57.822 --> 00:03:00.704
much more effective. It's showing that the special structure

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:04.368
of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:07.223
the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.

00:03:07.223 --> 00:03:10.903
And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence

00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:13.955
that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:17.233
and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.647
and create a deeper sense of understanding

00:03:19.647 --> 00:03:21.286
of what's being described.

00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:24.136
So I think these are just a few keys that can help

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:27.658
the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:29.874
that is science and engineering.

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.323
And because the engineers that I've worked with have

00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:36.123
taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:39.076
I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:43.321
Take your science, subtract your bullet points

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:46.099
and your jargon, divide by relevance,

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.546
meaning share what's relevant to the audience,

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:51.337
and multiply it by the passion that you have for

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:53.560
this incredible work that you're doing,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.338
and that is going to equal incredible interactions

00:03:56.338 --> 00:03:58.812
that are full of understanding.

00:03:58.812 --> 00:04:02.274
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:07.370
this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. (Laughter)

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.443
Thank you. (Applause)
