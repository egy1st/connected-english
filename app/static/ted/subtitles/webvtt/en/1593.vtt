WEBVTT

00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:04.999
I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are,

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.507
how globalized we aren't,

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:11.051
and why it's important to actually be accurate

00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:13.832
in making those kinds of assessments.

00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:17.572
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:21.763
by number of books sold, mentions in media,

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:24.979
or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:29.056
my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization,

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:32.170
is this view that national borders

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.723
really don't matter very much anymore,

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:39.779
cross-border integration is close to complete,

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:42.074
and we live in one world.

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:44.306
And what's interesting about this view

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.900
is, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.674
like Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted,

00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:56.600
but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.491
globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives

00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:04.375
if it hasn't already done so.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:08.399
The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.110
I'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.091
some time going back, trying to see the first mention

00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:19.810
of this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.654
that I could find was one from David Livingstone,

00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:29.699
writing in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship,

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:34.166
and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.537
with the rest of the world.

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:39.717
Now clearly, David Livingstone

00:01:39.717 --> 00:01:42.737
was a little bit ahead of his time,

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:46.280
but it does seem useful to ask ourselves,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.376
"Just how global are we?"

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:51.079
before we think about where we go from here.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.617
So the best way I've found of trying to get people

00:01:55.617 --> 00:02:00.266
to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat,

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:04.281
may not even be close to flat, is with some data.

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.660
So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.627
is really compiling data on things that could either happen

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:15.782
within national borders or across national borders,

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:19.285
and I've looked at the cross-border component

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:21.698
as a percentage of the total.

00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:25.663
I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today,

00:02:25.663 --> 00:02:29.269
but let me just give you a few data points.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.603
I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow,

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:38.471
one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital,

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:41.952
and, of course, trade in products and services.

00:02:41.952 --> 00:02:46.531
So let's start off with plain old telephone service.

00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:51.624
Of all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year,

00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:56.272
what percentage do you think were accounted for

00:02:56.272 --> 00:02:58.597
by cross-border phone calls?

00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:02.673
Pick a percentage in your own mind.

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:05.768
The answer turns out to be two percent.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:09.906
If you include Internet telephony, you might be able

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:13.333
to push this number up to six or seven percent,

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:17.990
but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.735
Or let's turn to people moving across borders.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:24.952
One particular thing we might look at, in terms of

00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:28.679
long-term flows of people, is what percentage

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.191
of the world's population is accounted for

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.199
by first-generation immigrants?

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.494
Again, please pick a percentage.

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:41.919
Turns out to be a little bit higher.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.986
It's actually about three percent.

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:49.857
Or think of investment. Take all the real investment

00:03:49.857 --> 00:03:53.025
that went on in the world in 2010.

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.881
What percentage of that was accounted for

00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:59.818
by foreign direct investment?

00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:03.185
Not quite ten percent.

00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:05.824
And then finally, the one statistic

00:04:05.824 --> 00:04:09.001
that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen:

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.729
the export-to-GDP ratio.

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.498
If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate

00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:18.057
a little bit above 30 percent.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:23.146
However, there's a big problem with the official statistics,

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:28.077
in that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier

00:04:28.077 --> 00:04:31.689
ships something to China to be put into an iPod,

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.490
and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.,

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.327
that component ends up getting counted multiple times.

00:04:38.327 --> 00:04:41.096
So nobody knows how bad this bias

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:44.883
with the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:47.467
ask the person who's spearheading the effort

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:50.732
to generate data on this, Pascal Lamy,

00:04:50.732 --> 00:04:53.244
the Director of the World Trade Organization,

00:04:53.244 --> 00:04:55.571
what his best guess would be

00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:58.746
of exports as a percentage of GDP,

00:04:58.746 --> 00:05:01.169
without the double- and triple-counting,

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.703
and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than

00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:09.472
the 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:13.655
So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:17.223
or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book,

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:21.610
"World 3.0," that we're very, very far from

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.664
the no-border effect benchmark, which would imply

00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:32.567
internationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.

00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:36.175
So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors

00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:39.135
have overstated the case.

00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:43.327
But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them,

00:05:43.327 --> 00:05:46.552
who are prone to this kind of overstatement.

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:49.949
I've also spent some time surveying audiences

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.947
in different parts of the world

00:05:51.947 --> 00:05:56.007
on what they actually guess these numbers to be.

00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:59.076
Let me share with you the results of a survey

00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:02.415
that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run

00:06:02.415 --> 00:06:05.935
of its readership as to what people's guesses

00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:10.350
along these dimensions actually were.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.285
So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:21.200
First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.003
Okay. (Laughter)

00:06:24.003 --> 00:06:29.476
Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities

00:06:29.476 --> 00:06:32.455
whose average value is less than 10 percent,

00:06:32.455 --> 00:06:36.557
you have people guessing three, four times that level.

00:06:36.557 --> 00:06:39.645
Even though I'm an economist, I find that

00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:42.049
a pretty large error.

00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:45.911
And third, this is not just confined to the readers

00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:47.871
of the Harvard Business Review.

00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:51.269
I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:54.619
of the world, and in all cases except one,

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:57.491
where a group actually underestimated

00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:01.803
the trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency

00:07:01.803 --> 00:07:04.962
towards overestimation, and so I thought it important

00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:08.267
to give a name to this, and that's what I refer to

00:07:08.267 --> 00:07:12.844
as globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars

00:07:12.844 --> 00:07:15.851
and the light gray bars.

00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:19.987
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be

00:07:19.987 --> 00:07:24.179
a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:27.443
to just spend a little bit of time thinking about

00:07:27.443 --> 00:07:31.202
why we might be prone to globaloney.

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:34.045
A couple of different reasons come to mind.

00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:38.347
First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.

00:07:38.347 --> 00:07:41.528
Let me give you an example. When I first published

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:44.124
some of these data a few years ago

00:07:44.124 --> 00:07:46.661
in a magazine called Foreign Policy,

00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:50.231
one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement,

00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:54.186
was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled

00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:59.096
"Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising. (Laughter)

00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:03.377
What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique,

00:08:03.377 --> 00:08:08.315
which was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."

00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:11.334
And this caused me to scratch my head, because

00:08:11.334 --> 00:08:14.471
as I went back through his several-hundred-page book,

00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:19.104
I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table,

00:08:19.104 --> 00:08:21.832
reference or footnote.

00:08:21.832 --> 00:08:26.439
So my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.831
to convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you

00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:32.816
to go away and look for your own data

00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:36.304
to try and actually assess whether some of these

00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:40.665
hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with

00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:42.577
actually are correct.

00:08:42.577 --> 00:08:46.109
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:50.024
A second reason has to do with peer pressure.

00:08:50.024 --> 00:08:53.205
I remember, I decided to write my

00:08:53.205 --> 00:08:55.830
"Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.019
I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai,

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:02.694
and the interviewer's first question to me was,

00:09:02.694 --> 00:09:06.645
"Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe

00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:10.825
that the world is round?" And I started laughing,

00:09:10.825 --> 00:09:14.598
because I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter)

00:09:14.598 --> 00:09:16.937
And as I was laughing, I was thinking,

00:09:16.937 --> 00:09:19.824
I really need a more coherent response, especially

00:09:19.824 --> 00:09:23.934
on national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter)

00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:26.903
But what I can't quite capture for you

00:09:26.903 --> 00:09:29.503
was the pity and disbelief

00:09:29.503 --> 00:09:32.981
with which the interviewer asked her question.

00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:37.321
The perspective was, here is this poor professor.

00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:42.007
He's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.

00:09:42.007 --> 00:09:44.655
He really has no idea

00:09:44.655 --> 00:09:47.613
as to what's actually going on in the world.

00:09:47.613 --> 00:09:51.086
So try this out with your friends and acquaintances,

00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:54.527
if you like. You'll find that it's very cool

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:57.815
to talk about the world being one, etc.

00:09:57.815 --> 00:10:01.118
If you raise questions about that formulation,

00:10:01.118 --> 00:10:05.015
you really are considered a bit of an antique.

00:10:05.015 --> 00:10:08.469
And then the final reason, which I mention,

00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:12.182
especially to a TED audience, with some trepidation,

00:10:12.182 --> 00:10:15.527
has to do with what I call "techno-trances."

00:10:15.527 --> 00:10:19.054
If you listen to techno music for long periods of time,

00:10:19.054 --> 00:10:22.406
it does things to your brainwave activity. (Laughter)

00:10:22.406 --> 00:10:25.864
Something similar seems to happen

00:10:25.864 --> 00:10:31.174
with exaggerated conceptions of how technology

00:10:31.174 --> 00:10:35.343
is going to overpower in the very immediate run

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.676
all cultural barriers, all political barriers,

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:42.269
all geographic barriers, because at this point

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:44.853
I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions,

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:47.826
but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students,

00:10:47.826 --> 00:10:50.590
hands go up, and people ask me,

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.069
"Yeah, but what about Facebook?"

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:56.682
And I got this question often enough that I thought

00:10:56.682 --> 00:10:59.430
I'd better do some research on Facebook.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.150
Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.819
to think about. Theoretically, it makes it

00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:10.197
as easy to form friendships halfway around the world

00:11:10.197 --> 00:11:13.199
as opposed to right next door.

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:19.285
What percentage of people's friends on Facebook

00:11:19.285 --> 00:11:22.405
are actually located in countries other than where

00:11:22.405 --> 00:11:25.678
people we're analyzing are based?

00:11:25.678 --> 00:11:29.028
The answer is probably somewhere between

00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:31.901
10 to 15 percent.

00:11:31.901 --> 00:11:35.712
Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local

00:11:35.712 --> 00:11:40.719
or national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level

00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:44.125
that you would expect, and the reason's very simple.

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:48.117
We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random

00:11:48.117 --> 00:11:52.939
on Facebook. The technology is overlaid

00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:57.674
on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have,

00:11:57.674 --> 00:12:00.742
and those relationships are what the technology

00:12:00.742 --> 00:12:03.973
doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:08.017
we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends

00:12:08.017 --> 00:12:11.825
being located in countries other than where we are.

00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:17.306
So does all this matter? Or is globaloney

00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:22.718
just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention

00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:25.430
to globalization-related issues?

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.637
I want to suggest that actually,

00:12:27.637 --> 00:12:32.207
globaloney can be very harmful to your health.

00:12:32.207 --> 00:12:35.359
First of all, recognizing that the glass

00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:39.815
is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing

00:12:39.815 --> 00:12:43.199
that there might be potential for additional gains

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:45.230
from additional integration,

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.074
whereas if we thought we were already there,

00:12:48.074 --> 00:12:51.498
there would be no particular point to pushing harder.

00:12:51.498 --> 00:12:54.710
It's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.891
on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open

00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:02.223
to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about

00:13:02.223 --> 00:13:03.638
at this conference.

00:13:03.638 --> 00:13:08.428
So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are

00:13:08.428 --> 00:13:11.487
is critical to even being able to notice

00:13:11.487 --> 00:13:15.166
that there might be room for something more,

00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:19.134
something that would contribute further to global welfare.

00:13:19.134 --> 00:13:21.966
Which brings me to my second point.

00:13:21.966 --> 00:13:26.189
Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:30.984
because it reduces and in some cases even reverses

00:13:30.984 --> 00:13:35.789
some of the fears that people have about globalization.

00:13:35.789 --> 00:13:39.174
So I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book

00:13:39.174 --> 00:13:43.718
working through a litany of market failures and fears

00:13:43.718 --> 00:13:48.858
that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.

00:13:48.858 --> 00:13:52.526
I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today,

00:13:52.526 --> 00:13:55.794
so let me just present to you two headlines

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:59.075
as an illustration of what I have in mind.

00:13:59.075 --> 00:14:03.391
Think of France and the current debate about immigration.

00:14:03.391 --> 00:14:06.623
When you ask people in France what percentage

00:14:06.623 --> 00:14:08.836
of the French population is immigrants,

00:14:08.836 --> 00:14:13.336
the answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.

00:14:13.336 --> 00:14:17.966
Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent

00:14:17.966 --> 00:14:22.380
might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.718
that we see around the immigration issue.

00:14:25.718 --> 00:14:29.862
Or to take an even more striking example,

00:14:29.862 --> 00:14:32.039
when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:35.386
did a survey of Americans, asking them to guess

00:14:35.386 --> 00:14:39.613
what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid,

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:43.294
the guess was 30 percent, which is

00:14:43.294 --> 00:14:48.654
slightly in excess of the actual level — ("actually about ... 1%") (Laughter) —

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:52.028
of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.

00:14:52.028 --> 00:14:55.435
The reassuring thing about this particular survey was,

00:14:55.435 --> 00:14:58.116
when it was pointed out to people how far

00:14:58.116 --> 00:15:01.325
their estimates were from the actual data,

00:15:01.325 --> 00:15:04.420
some of them — not all of them — seemed to become

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.407
more willing to consider increases in foreign aid.

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:11.531
So foreign aid is actually a great way

00:15:11.531 --> 00:15:14.725
of sort of wrapping up here, because

00:15:14.725 --> 00:15:17.813
if you think about it, what I've been talking about today

00:15:17.813 --> 00:15:21.902
is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists --

00:15:21.902 --> 00:15:24.884
that most things are very home-biased.

00:15:24.884 --> 00:15:28.109
"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people,"

00:15:28.109 --> 00:15:31.832
is about the most home-biased thing you can find.

00:15:31.832 --> 00:15:34.870
If you look at the OECD countries and how much

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.012
they spend per domestic poor person,

00:15:38.012 --> 00:15:40.264
and compare it with how much they spend

00:15:40.264 --> 00:15:44.436
per poor person in poor countries,

00:15:44.436 --> 00:15:48.708
the ratio — Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations —

00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:53.384
turns out to be about 30,000 to one.

00:15:53.384 --> 00:15:59.580
Now of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan,

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.749
would like to see that ratio being brought down

00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:04.981
to one-is-to-one.

00:16:04.981 --> 00:16:08.372
I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim

00:16:08.372 --> 00:16:12.533
for that to make substantial progress from where we are.

00:16:12.533 --> 00:16:17.600
If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.970
we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.487
at the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit

00:16:24.487 --> 00:16:28.349
that ended last week made no further progress on.

00:16:28.349 --> 00:16:32.154
So in summary, while radical openness is great,

00:16:32.154 --> 00:16:34.167
given how closed we are,

00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:37.141
even incremental openness could make things

00:16:37.141 --> 00:16:40.772
dramatically better. Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:16:40.772 --> 00:16:43.543
