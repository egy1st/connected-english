00:00:00.732 --> 00:00:05.901
Once upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:09.332
It was run by the great and powerful parents,

00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:11.667
and the people were helpless

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.163
and hopeless naughty children.

00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:16.666
If any of the more rowdier children questioned

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:20.243
the authority of the parents, they were scolded.

00:00:20.243 --> 00:00:23.276
If they went exploring into the parents' rooms,

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:27.059
or even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished,

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.812
and told that for their own good

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:33.443
they must never go in there again.

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:35.939
Then one day, a man came to town

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.737
with boxes and boxes of secret documents

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.601
stolen from the parents' rooms.

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:44.627
"Look what they've been hiding from you," he said.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:47.669
The children looked and were amazed.

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:50.513
There were maps and minutes from meetings

00:00:50.513 --> 00:00:53.778
where the parents were slagging each other off.

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:56.326
They behaved just like the children.

00:00:56.326 --> 00:01:00.284
And they made mistakes, too, just like the children.

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:02.995
The only difference was, their mistakes

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.820
were in the secret filing cabinets.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.625
Well, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:11.492
they should be in the secret filing cabinets,

00:01:11.492 --> 00:01:13.392
or if they were, there ought to be a law

00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:15.509
to allow the children access.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.316
And so she set about to make it so.

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:23.162
Well, I'm the girl in that story, and the secret documents

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:26.316
that I was interested in were located in this building,

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:30.678
the British Parliament, and the data that I wanted

00:01:30.678 --> 00:01:33.339
to get my hands on were the expense receipts

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:37.228
of members of Parliament.

00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:43.467
I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy. (Applause)

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.374
It wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker,

00:01:46.374 --> 00:01:49.227
or anything like that, but the amount of resistance I got

00:01:49.227 --> 00:01:51.750
from this Freedom of Information request,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.994
you would have thought I'd asked something like this.

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:59.219
So I fought for about five years doing this,

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.691
and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made,

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:05.644
not -- I didn't -- Hey, look, I didn't set out, honestly,

00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:07.293
to revolutionize the British Parliament.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.724
That was not my intention. I was just making these requests

00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:13.875
as part of research for my first book.

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.740
But it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.115
and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:24.155
in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:28.307
waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.415
And I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful,

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:33.140
because I'd seen the establishment. I thought,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.496
it always sticks together. I am out of luck.

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:41.082
Well, guess what? I won. Hooray. (Applause)

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:44.505
Well, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was

00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:47.859
that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data,

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.019
and then they tried to retrospectively change the law

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.692
so that it would no longer apply to them.

00:02:53.692 --> 00:02:56.614
The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else,

00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:59.410
they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.905
What they hadn't counted on was digitization,

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:05.291
because that meant that all those paper receipts

00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.531
had been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy

00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:11.730
for somebody to just copy that entire database,

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.664
put it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament,

00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:18.149
which they did, and then they shopped that disk

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.107
to the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph,

00:03:21.107 --> 00:03:24.314
and then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks

00:03:24.314 --> 00:03:27.339
of revelations, everything from porn movies

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.495
and bath plugs and new kitchens

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:33.956
and mortgages that had never been paid off.

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:38.643
The end result was six ministers resigned,

00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:42.694
the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign,

00:03:42.694 --> 00:03:46.713
a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency,

00:03:46.713 --> 00:03:50.496
120 MPs stepped down at that election,

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:54.987
and so far, four MPs and two lords

00:03:54.987 --> 00:03:58.017
have done jail time for fraud.

00:03:58.017 --> 00:04:04.395
So, thank you. (Applause)

00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:08.670
Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.011
It was an example of a culture clash that's happening

00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.331
all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged

00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:19.435
officials who think that they can rule over us

00:04:19.435 --> 00:04:21.343
without very much prying from the public,

00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:23.796
and then suddenly confronted with a public

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:27.234
who is no longer content with that arrangement,

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.472
and not only not content with it, now, more often,

00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:34.846
armed with official data itself.

00:04:34.846 --> 00:04:39.984
So we are moving to this democratization of information,

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:42.631
and I've been in this field for quite a while.

00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.272
Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid,

00:04:45.272 --> 00:04:47.207
I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like,

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:49.833
see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:52.039
I think that was a pretty good indication

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.120
about my future career as an investigative journalist,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.640
and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.416
is that it used to be quite a niche interest,

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:05.567
and it's gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world,

00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:08.735
wants to know about what people in power are doing.

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:12.143
They want a say in decisions that are made in their name

00:05:12.143 --> 00:05:15.166
and with their money. It's this democratization of information

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:17.872
that I think is an information enlightenment,

00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:21.335
and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.

00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:24.330
It's about searching for the truth,

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.527
not because somebody says it's true, "because I say so."

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:31.001
No, it's about trying to find the truth based on

00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.630
what you can see and what can be tested.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.298
That, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about

00:05:36.298 --> 00:05:39.807
the right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people,

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:41.984
or that women should be subordinate to men,

00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:44.687
or that the Church was the official word of God.

00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:47.123
Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this,

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:49.224
and they tried to suppress it,

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:52.295
but what they hadn't counted on was technology,

00:05:52.295 --> 00:05:54.720
and then they had the printing press, which suddenly

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.112
enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast,

00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:00.952
and people would come together in coffee houses,

00:06:00.952 --> 00:06:03.768
discuss the ideas, plot revolution.

00:06:03.768 --> 00:06:08.359
In our day, we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information,

00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:11.764
so now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information.

00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:16.001
Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:21.103
We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system,

00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:23.976
and we have global decisions to make in this system,

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:27.662
decisions about climate, about finance systems,

00:06:27.662 --> 00:06:31.003
about resources. And think about it --

00:06:31.003 --> 00:06:33.465
if we want to make an important decision about buying a house,

00:06:33.465 --> 00:06:35.979
we don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you,

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.323
but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it.

00:06:39.323 --> 00:06:41.678
And if we're thinking about a finance system,

00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:45.322
we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:49.283
for one person to take in the amount, the volume

00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:53.049
of information, and analyze it to make good decisions.

00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:56.075
So that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand

00:06:56.075 --> 00:06:58.460
for access to information.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.769
That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:02.745
come out, so for example, on the environment,

00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:04.461
there's the Aarhus Convention,

00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:06.489
which is a European directive that gives people

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:09.237
a very strong right to know, so if your water company

00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:12.607
is dumping water into your river, sewage water

00:07:12.607 --> 00:07:15.655
into your river, you have a right to know about it.

00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:19.534
In the finance industry, you now have more of a right

00:07:19.534 --> 00:07:22.087
to know about what's going on, so we have

00:07:22.087 --> 00:07:25.040
different anti-bribery laws, money regulations,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.113
increased corporate disclosure, so you can now track assets across borders.

00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:34.357
And it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance,

00:07:34.357 --> 00:07:37.492
pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out

00:07:37.492 --> 00:07:40.211
more and more about these systems.

00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:43.003
And they're all moving to this central system,

00:07:43.003 --> 00:07:45.370
this fully connected system,

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.577
all of them except one. Can you guess which one?

00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:51.248
It's the system which underpins all these other systems.

00:07:51.248 --> 00:07:55.406
It's the system by which we organize and exercise power,

00:07:55.406 --> 00:07:58.336
and there I'm talking about politics, because in politics,

00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:02.463
we're back to this system, this top-down hierarchy.

00:08:02.463 --> 00:08:05.544
And how is it possible that the volume of information

00:08:05.544 --> 00:08:08.355
can be processed that needs to in this system?

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:10.971
Well, it just can't. That's it.

00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:13.678
And I think this is largely what's behind the crisis

00:08:13.678 --> 00:08:18.001
of legitimacy in our different governments right now.

00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:20.184
So I've told you a bit about what I did

00:08:20.184 --> 00:08:22.869
to try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming,

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:25.384
into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you

00:08:25.384 --> 00:08:28.048
a couple of examples of what a few other people I know

00:08:28.048 --> 00:08:29.268
are doing.

00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:32.487
So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer

00:08:32.487 --> 00:08:36.445
programmer, and he built a site called Alaveteli,

00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:41.215
and what it is, it's a Freedom of Information platform.

00:08:41.215 --> 00:08:44.190
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.293
to make a Freedom of Information request,

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:50.262
to ask your public body a question, so

00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:53.382
it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you

00:08:53.382 --> 00:08:55.470
that there is a lot of hassle making these requests,

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.014
so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question,

00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:03.485
for example, how many police officers have a criminal record?

00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:07.326
It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you

00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:10.814
when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all

00:09:10.814 --> 00:09:12.466
the correspondence, it posts it up there,

00:09:12.466 --> 00:09:16.121
and it becomes an archive of public knowledge.

00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:19.694
So that's open-source and it can be used in any country

00:09:19.694 --> 00:09:22.605
where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law.

00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:25.815
So there's a list there of the different countries that have it,

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.610
and then there's a few more coming on board.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.170
So if any of you out there like the sound of that

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.903
and have a law like that in your country,

00:09:32.903 --> 00:09:34.942
I know that Seb would love to hear from you

00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:39.014
about collaborating and getting that into your country.

00:09:39.014 --> 00:09:43.309
This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She's an Icelandic MP.

00:09:43.309 --> 00:09:47.143
And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland, she was

00:09:47.143 --> 00:09:50.460
one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.206
when the country's economy collapsed,

00:09:54.206 --> 00:09:58.100
and then she was elected on a reform mandate,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.467
and she's now spearheading this project.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:03.354
It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative,

00:10:03.354 --> 00:10:05.619
and they've just got funding to make it an international

00:10:05.619 --> 00:10:09.058
modern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws

00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:11.994
around the world about freedom of expression,

00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:14.789
protection of whistleblowers, protection from libel,

00:10:14.789 --> 00:10:19.263
source protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.

00:10:19.263 --> 00:10:21.684
It's a place where your data can be free, so when we think

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:25.099
about, increasingly, how governments want to access user data,

00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:27.871
what they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven

00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:30.608
where it can happen.

00:10:30.608 --> 00:10:33.746
In my own field of investigative journalism, we're also

00:10:33.746 --> 00:10:36.576
having to start thinking globally, so this is a site called

00:10:36.576 --> 00:10:39.699
Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track

00:10:39.699 --> 00:10:42.682
a dictator's assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak,

00:10:42.682 --> 00:10:46.127
you know, he's just funneling out cash from his country

00:10:46.127 --> 00:10:48.666
when he knows he's in trouble, and what you want to do

00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:51.062
to investigate that is, you need to have access to

00:10:51.062 --> 00:10:53.361
all of the world's, as many as you can,

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.144
companies' house registrations databases.

00:10:56.144 --> 00:11:00.582
So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those

00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:03.837
databases into one place so you can start searching for,

00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:07.505
you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.

00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:10.256
You can try and find out how he's moving out assets

00:11:10.256 --> 00:11:12.982
from that country.

00:11:12.982 --> 00:11:16.615
But again, when it comes to the decisions which are

00:11:16.615 --> 00:11:19.615
impacting us the most, perhaps, the most important

00:11:19.615 --> 00:11:22.904
decisions that are being made about war and so forth,

00:11:22.904 --> 00:11:25.833
again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request.

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:28.941
It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on

00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:33.023
illegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks.

00:11:33.023 --> 00:11:36.065
So when the Guardian did this investigation about

00:11:36.065 --> 00:11:39.215
the Afghan War, you know, they can't walk into

00:11:39.215 --> 00:11:42.679
the Department of Defense and ask for all the information.

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:44.621
You know, they're just not going to get it.

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:48.161
So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches

00:11:48.161 --> 00:11:50.567
that were written by American soldiers

00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:53.126
about the Afghan War, and leaked,

00:11:53.126 --> 00:11:56.777
and then they're able to do this investigation.

00:11:56.777 --> 00:12:02.345
Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy.

00:12:02.345 --> 00:12:04.845
Again, this is all based around leaks,

00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:10.096
251,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, and I was involved

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:14.037
in this investigation because I got this leak

00:12:14.037 --> 00:12:17.406
through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker

00:12:17.406 --> 00:12:20.175
and ended up going to work at the Guardian.

00:12:20.175 --> 00:12:22.599
So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access

00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:24.566
to this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.

00:12:24.566 --> 00:12:28.216
It reminded me of that scene in "The Wizard of Oz."

00:12:28.216 --> 00:12:30.704
Do you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto

00:12:30.704 --> 00:12:33.555
runs across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back,

00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:35.017
the dog's pulling back the curtain, and --

00:12:35.017 --> 00:12:39.000
"Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen."

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.136
It was just like that, because what you started to see

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:44.087
is that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous

00:12:44.087 --> 00:12:47.185
politicians, they were just like us.

00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:49.745
They all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy,

00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:52.416
those cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important

00:12:52.416 --> 00:12:55.017
point for all of us to grasp, these are human beings

00:12:55.017 --> 00:12:56.968
just like us. They don't have special powers.

00:12:56.968 --> 00:13:00.791
They're not magic. They are not our parents.

00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:05.640
Beyond that, what I found most fascinating

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.264
was the level of endemic corruption that I saw

00:13:08.264 --> 00:13:11.419
across all different countries, and particularly centered

00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:14.247
around the heart of power, around public officials

00:13:14.247 --> 00:13:16.863
who were embezzling the public's money

00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:19.881
for their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that

00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:23.264
because of official secrecy.

00:13:23.264 --> 00:13:26.891
So I've mentioned WikiLeaks, because surely what could be

00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:29.722
more open than publishing all the material?

00:13:29.722 --> 00:13:32.793
Because that is what Julian Assange did.

00:13:32.793 --> 00:13:35.361
He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it

00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:39.158
to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.

00:13:39.158 --> 00:13:42.873
That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan

00:13:42.873 --> 00:13:46.289
being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator

00:13:46.289 --> 00:13:50.059
was given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:53.545
in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government.

00:13:53.545 --> 00:13:58.017
Is that radical openness? I say it's not, because for me,

00:13:58.017 --> 00:14:01.519
what it means, it doesn't mean abdicating power,

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:05.273
responsibility, accountability, it's actually being a partner

00:14:05.273 --> 00:14:08.289
with power. It's about sharing responsibility,

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:11.201
sharing accountability. Also, the fact that

00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:13.338
he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks,

00:14:13.338 --> 00:14:16.023
I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:21.864
in ideology, to be honest, as well. (Laughs)

00:14:21.864 --> 00:14:25.198
The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive,

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.866
and you must have two real qualities, I think,

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:30.279
when you come to the table, when you're dealing

00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:32.013
with power, talking about power,

00:14:32.013 --> 00:14:34.386
because of its seductive capacity.

00:14:34.386 --> 00:14:37.405
You've got to have skepticism and humility.

00:14:37.405 --> 00:14:39.998
Skepticism, because you must always be challenging.

00:14:39.998 --> 00:14:43.030
I want to see why do you -- you just say so? That's not good enough.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.745
I want to see the evidence behind why that's so.

00:14:45.745 --> 00:14:50.238
And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes.

00:14:50.238 --> 00:14:53.030
And if you don't have skepticism and humility,

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.125
then it's a really short journey to go from reformer

00:14:56.125 --> 00:15:00.734
to autocrat, and I think you only have to read "Animal Farm"

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:06.677
to get that message about how power corrupts people.

00:15:06.677 --> 00:15:12.145
So what is the solution? It is, I believe, to embody

00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:15.612
within the rule of law rights to information.

00:15:15.612 --> 00:15:18.247
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak.

00:15:18.247 --> 00:15:21.229
In a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts,

00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:23.392
including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act

00:15:23.392 --> 00:15:26.508
with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime,

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:30.674
people are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases,

00:15:30.674 --> 00:15:34.877
for publishing or giving away official information.

00:15:34.877 --> 00:15:38.355
Now wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:41.917
all of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act

00:15:41.917 --> 00:15:45.293
where officials were punished if they were found

00:15:45.293 --> 00:15:48.253
to have suppressed or hidden information

00:15:48.253 --> 00:15:50.438
that was in the public interest?

00:15:50.438 --> 00:15:57.338
So that -- yes. Yes! My power pose. (Applause) (Laughs)

00:15:57.338 --> 00:15:59.883
I would like us to work towards that.

00:15:59.883 --> 00:16:03.803
So it's not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is

00:16:03.803 --> 00:16:06.758
progress on the line, but I think what we find is that

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.934
the closer that we get right into the heart of power,

00:16:09.934 --> 00:16:14.358
the more opaque, closed it becomes.

00:16:14.358 --> 00:16:17.438
So it was only just the other week that I heard London's

00:16:17.438 --> 00:16:20.935
Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why

00:16:20.935 --> 00:16:25.527
the police need access to all of our communications,

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:28.590
spying on us without any judicial oversight,

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.256
and he said it was a matter of life and death.

00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:33.503
He actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.

00:16:33.503 --> 00:16:37.725
There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that.

00:16:37.725 --> 00:16:40.847
It was just, "Because I say so.

00:16:40.847 --> 00:16:44.095
You have to trust me. Take it on faith."

00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:46.094
Well, I'm sorry, people, but we are back

00:16:46.094 --> 00:16:49.799
to the pre-Enlightenment Church,

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:53.575
and we need to fight against that.

00:16:53.575 --> 00:16:56.863
So he was talking about the law in Britain which is

00:16:56.863 --> 00:17:01.089
the Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.

00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:04.695
In America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.

00:17:04.695 --> 00:17:08.335
You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance.

00:17:08.335 --> 00:17:11.095
You have the National Security Agency building

00:17:11.095 --> 00:17:14.623
the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal --

00:17:14.623 --> 00:17:17.095
it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol,

00:17:17.095 --> 00:17:18.897
in which they're going to intercept and analyze

00:17:18.897 --> 00:17:21.846
communications, traffic and personal data

00:17:21.846 --> 00:17:25.159
to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society.

00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:29.959
Well, to go back to our original story, the parents

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:33.809
have panicked. They've locked all the doors.

00:17:33.809 --> 00:17:36.895
They've kitted out the house with CCTV cameras.

00:17:36.895 --> 00:17:39.647
They're watching all of us. They've dug a basement,

00:17:39.647 --> 00:17:42.311
and they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.983
and figure out which ones of us are troublesome,

00:17:44.983 --> 00:17:49.217
and if any of us complain about that, we're arrested for terrorism.

00:17:49.217 --> 00:17:52.791
Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?

00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:56.450
Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.197
I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are,

00:17:59.197 --> 00:18:01.695
indeed, very grim.

00:18:01.695 --> 00:18:06.917
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal

00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:09.721
than we want to acknowledge.

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.010
Equally, it could be better than we've been led to believe,

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.721
but either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is,

00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:19.570
with all of its problems, because it's only by seeing it

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.063
with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them

00:18:22.063 --> 00:18:26.134
and live in a world in which we can all be

00:18:26.134 --> 00:18:29.820
happily ever after. (Laughs) Thank you very much.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.055
(Applause)

00:18:33.055 --> 00:18:37.110
Thank you. (Applause)
