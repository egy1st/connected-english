00:00:00.803 --> 00:00:03.587
So little Billy goes to school,

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:06.344
and he sits down and the teacher says,

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:09.349
"What does your father do?"

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.006
And little Billy says, "My father plays the piano

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.112
in an opium den."

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:18.101
So the teacher rings up the parents, and says,

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:21.355
"Very shocking story from little Billy today.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:25.104
Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:27.264
in an opium den."

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:31.123
And the father says, "I'm very sorry. Yes, it's true, I lied.

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:34.754
But how can I tell an eight-year-old boy

00:00:34.754 --> 00:00:39.163
that his father is a politician?" (Laughter)

00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:42.411
Now, as a politician myself, standing in front of you,

00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:46.066
or indeed, meeting any stranger anywhere in the world,

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.642
when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession,

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:51.736
they look at me as though I'm somewhere between

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:56.490
a snake, a monkey and an iguana,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.432
and through all of this, I feel, strongly,

00:01:00.432 --> 00:01:03.414
that something is going wrong.

00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:06.610
Four hundred years of maturing democracy,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.478
colleagues in Parliament who seem to me, as individuals,

00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:13.056
reasonably impressive, an increasingly educated,

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:17.703
energetic, informed population, and yet

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:22.607
a deep, deep sense of disappointment.

00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:26.579
My colleagues in Parliament include, in my new intake,

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.333
family doctors, businesspeople, professors,

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:35.556
distinguished economists, historians, writers,

00:01:35.556 --> 00:01:40.558
army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors.

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:44.219
All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.327
those strange stone gargoyles just down the road,

00:01:48.327 --> 00:01:52.353
feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts,

00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:58.026
feel as though we have become profoundly diminished.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:02.154
And this isn't just a problem in Britain.

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:04.887
It's a problem across the developing world,

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:07.521
and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica,

00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:10.829
for example -- look at Jamaican members of Parliament,

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.809
you meet them, and they're often people who are

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:19.253
Rhodes Scholars, who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton,

00:02:19.253 --> 00:02:22.314
and yet, you go down to downtown Kingston,

00:02:22.314 --> 00:02:25.958
and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:30.043
that you can see in any middle-income country in the world:

00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:32.806
a dismal, depressing landscape

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:35.996
of burnt and half-abandoned buildings.

00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:39.124
And this has been true for 30 years, and the handover

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:43.390
in 1979, 1980, between one Jamaican leader who was

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.865
the son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:50.095
who'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard,

00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:53.098
over 800 people were killed in the streets

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:56.625
in drug-related violence.

00:02:56.625 --> 00:03:00.107
Ten years ago, however, the promise of democracy

00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:04.090
seemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.250
in his State of the Union address in 2003

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.279
and said that democracy was the force that would beat

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.305
most of the ills of the world. He said,

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:18.078
because democratic governments respect their own people

00:03:18.078 --> 00:03:23.812
and respect their neighbors, freedom will bring peace.

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:27.446
Distinguished academics at the same time argued that

00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:31.124
democracies had this incredible range of side benefits.

00:03:31.124 --> 00:03:34.424
They would bring prosperity, security,

00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:37.245
overcome sectarian violence,

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:41.710
ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.064
Since then, what's happened?

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:47.258
Well, what we've seen is the creation, in places like Iraq

00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:51.246
and Afghanistan, of democratic systems of government

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:54.136
which haven't had any of those side benefits.

00:03:54.136 --> 00:03:57.129
In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.796
or two elections. We've gone through three elections,

00:03:59.796 --> 00:04:02.923
presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find?

00:04:02.923 --> 00:04:06.534
Do we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:09.995
and good security? No. What we find in Afghanistan

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:14.140
is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt,

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.325
a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective,

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:21.329
a media which is beginning to get onto its feet

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.154
but a government that's deeply unpopular,

00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:27.922
perceived as being deeply corrupt, and security

00:04:27.922 --> 00:04:31.735
that is shocking, security that's terrible.

00:04:31.735 --> 00:04:36.393
In Pakistan, in lots of sub-Saharan Africa,

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:39.385
again you can see democracy and elections are compatible

00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:43.234
with corrupt governments, with states that are unstable

00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:46.091
and dangerous.

00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:48.375
And when I have conversations with people, I remember

00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:51.256
having a conversation, for example, in Iraq,

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:53.945
with a community that asked me

00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:57.455
whether the riot we were seeing in front of us,

00:04:57.455 --> 00:05:01.278
this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building,

00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:05.970
was a sign of the new democracy.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.111
The same, I felt, was true in almost every single one

00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:13.059
of the middle and developing countries that I went to,

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:17.110
and to some extent the same is true of us.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.686
Well, what is the answer to this? Is the answer to just

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.344
give up on the idea of democracy?

00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:26.086
Well, obviously not. It would be absurd

00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:28.873
if we were to engage again in the kind of operations

00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:31.949
we were engaged in, in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.469
if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.144
in which we were imposing

00:05:38.144 --> 00:05:40.583
anything other than a democratic system.

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:43.135
Anything else would run contrary to our values,

00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:45.386
it would run contrary to the wishes of the people

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:49.009
on the ground, it would run contrary to our interests.

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.316
I remember in Iraq, for example, that we went through

00:05:52.316 --> 00:05:54.857
a period of feeling that we should delay democracy.

00:05:54.857 --> 00:05:57.549
We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned

00:05:57.549 --> 00:06:01.127
from Bosnia was that elections held too early

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:05.361
enshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties,

00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.179
so in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made,

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:11.296
let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in

00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:15.468
voter education. Let's invest in democratization.

00:06:15.468 --> 00:06:19.486
The result was that I found stuck outside my office

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:21.658
a huge crowd of people, this is actually a photograph

00:06:21.658 --> 00:06:25.138
taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq

00:06:25.138 --> 00:06:29.263
of people standing outside screaming for the elections,

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:32.029
and when I went out and said, "What is wrong

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.989
with the interim provincial council?

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:38.657
What is wrong with the people that we have chosen?

00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:41.402
There is a Sunni sheikh, there's a Shiite sheikh,

00:06:41.402 --> 00:06:44.553
there's the seven -- leaders of the seven major tribes,

00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:47.107
there's a Christian, there's a Sabian,

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:51.351
there are female representatives, there's every political party in this council,

00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.991
what's wrong with the people that we chose?"

00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:57.089
The answer came, "The problem isn't the people

00:06:57.089 --> 00:07:02.890
that you chose. The problem is that you chose them."

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.322
I have not met, in Afghanistan, in even the most

00:07:06.322 --> 00:07:09.449
remote community, anybody who does not want

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.233
a say in who governs them.

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.294
Most remote community, I have never met a villager

00:07:14.294 --> 00:07:17.876
who does not want a vote.

00:07:17.876 --> 00:07:21.156
So we need to acknowledge

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:24.738
that despite the dubious statistics, despite the fact that

00:07:24.738 --> 00:07:30.161
84 percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken,

00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:33.133
despite the fact that when I was in Iraq, we did an opinion poll

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:37.391
in 2003 and asked people what political systems they preferred,

00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:39.715
and the answer came back that

00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:42.776
seven percent wanted the United States,

00:07:42.776 --> 00:07:45.499
five percent wanted France,

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:48.154
three percent wanted Britain,

00:07:48.154 --> 00:07:52.509
and nearly 40 percent wanted Dubai, which is, after all,

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:55.275
not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:59.978
minor monarchy, democracy is a thing of value

00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:03.140
for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.492
we need to get away from instrumental arguments.

00:08:06.492 --> 00:08:10.060
We need to get away from saying democracy matters

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.167
because of the other things it brings.

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:15.292
We need to get away from feeling, in the same way,

00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:18.889
human rights matters because of the other things it brings,

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:22.581
or women's rights matters for the other things it brings.

00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:24.885
Why should we get away from those arguments?

00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:27.289
Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying,

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:31.982
for example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract

00:08:31.982 --> 00:08:37.180
good information, or we say, you need women's rights

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.860
because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.517
you leave yourself open to the position where

00:08:43.517 --> 00:08:45.610
the government of North Korea can turn around and say,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.473
"Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting

00:08:48.473 --> 00:08:50.974
good information with our torture at the moment,"

00:08:50.974 --> 00:08:52.934
or the government of Saudi Arabia to say, "Well,

00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:54.663
our economic growth's okay, thank you very much,

00:08:54.663 --> 00:08:56.123
considerably better than yours,

00:08:56.123 --> 00:09:00.929
so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights."

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:04.610
The point about democracy is not instrumental.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.399
It's not about the things that it brings.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.964
The point about democracy is not that it delivers

00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:16.208
legitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law.

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:20.853
It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors.

00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:23.770
The point about democracy is intrinsic.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:29.101
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:33.509
and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity,

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:37.379
the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:40.980
should have an equal vote, an equal say,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.975
in the formation of their government.

00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:49.041
But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again,

00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:51.654
if we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved

00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:56.455
in a new project of the citizens and the politicians.

00:09:56.455 --> 00:10:00.843
Democracy is not simply a question of structures.

00:10:00.843 --> 00:10:04.860
It is a state of mind. It is an activity.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.651
And part of that activity is honesty.

00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:12.189
After I speak to you today, I'm going on a radio program

00:10:12.189 --> 00:10:14.492
called "Any Questions," and the thing you will have noticed

00:10:14.492 --> 00:10:18.292
about politicians on these kinds of radio programs

00:10:18.292 --> 00:10:21.757
is that they never, ever say that they don't know the answer

00:10:21.757 --> 00:10:23.392
to a question. It doesn't matter what it is.

00:10:23.392 --> 00:10:26.744
If you ask about child tax credits, the future of the penguins

00:10:26.744 --> 00:10:31.366
in the south Antarctic, asked to hold forth on whether or not

00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:33.998
the developments in Chongqing contribute

00:10:33.998 --> 00:10:36.332
to sustainable development in carbon capture,

00:10:36.332 --> 00:10:39.094
and we will have an answer for you.

00:10:39.094 --> 00:10:42.279
We need to stop that, to stop pretending to be

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:44.164
omniscient beings.

00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:47.724
Politicians also need to learn, occasionally, to say that

00:10:47.724 --> 00:10:51.470
certain things that voters want, certain things that voters

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.333
have been promised, may be things

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:58.478
that we cannot deliver

00:10:58.478 --> 00:11:02.260
or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.151
And the second thing we should do is understand

00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:08.143
the genius of our societies.

00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:12.172
Our societies have never been so educated, have never

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:15.108
been so energized, have never been so healthy,

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:18.056
have never known so much, cared so much,

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:23.952
or wanted to do so much, and it is a genius of the local.

00:11:23.952 --> 00:11:26.650
One of the reasons why we're moving away

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.151
from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand,

00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:34.627
banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:36.402
of kings enthroned,

00:11:36.402 --> 00:11:39.554
the entire drama played out here on this space,

00:11:39.554 --> 00:11:42.413
where the King of England had his head lopped off,

00:11:42.413 --> 00:11:46.744
why we've moved from spaces like this, thrones like that,

00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:50.469
towards the town hall, is we're moving more and more

00:11:50.469 --> 00:11:54.417
towards the energies of our people, and we need to tap that.

00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:57.207
That can mean different things in different countries.

00:11:57.207 --> 00:12:00.520
In Britain, it could mean looking to the French,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.263
learning from the French,

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:05.892
getting directly elected mayors in place

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.380
in a French commune system.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.214
In Afghanistan, it could have meant instead of concentrating

00:12:11.214 --> 00:12:13.768
on the big presidential and parliamentary elections,

00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:16.085
we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution

00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:20.765
from the very beginning, which is to get direct local elections going

00:12:20.765 --> 00:12:26.312
at a district level and elect people's provincial governors.

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:29.035
But for any of these things to work,

00:12:29.035 --> 00:12:31.858
the honesty in language, the local democracy,

00:12:31.858 --> 00:12:34.626
it's not just a question of what politicians do.

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:36.694
It's a question of what the citizens do.

00:12:36.694 --> 00:12:41.601
For politicians to be honest, the public needs to allow them to be honest,

00:12:41.601 --> 00:12:44.180
and the media, which mediates between the politicians

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.811
and the public, needs to allow those politicians to be honest.

00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:52.433
If local democracy is to flourish, it is about the active

00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:56.669
and informed engagement of every citizen.

00:12:56.669 --> 00:13:01.070
In other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt,

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.394
is to become again vigorous and vibrant,

00:13:05.394 --> 00:13:08.540
it is necessary not just for the public

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.454
to learn to trust their politicians,

00:13:11.454 --> 00:13:16.326
but for the politicians to learn to trust the public.

00:13:16.326 --> 00:13:20.326
Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)
