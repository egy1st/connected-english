00:00:00.864 --> 00:00:05.109
Having spent 18 years as a child of the state

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.415
in children's homes and foster care,

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:10.463
you could say that I'm an expert on the subject,

00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:14.021
and in being an expert, I want to let you know that

00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:19.628
being an expert does in no way make you right

00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:22.628
in light of the truth.

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:26.816
If you're in care, legally the government is your

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:30.543
parent, loco parentis.

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:34.492
Margaret Thatcher was my mother. (Laughter)

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:38.141
Let's not talk about breastfeeding. (Laughter)

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:41.279
Harry Potter was a foster child.

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:46.319
Pip from "Great Expectations" was adopted;

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.401
Superman was a foster child;

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:52.929
Cinderella was a foster child;

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.537
Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo,

00:00:56.537 --> 00:00:59.459
was fostered and institutionalized;

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:03.834
Batman was orphaned;

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:07.532
Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights"

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:09.221
was fostered;

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.956
Jane Eyre, adopted;

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:16.539
Roald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;"

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.051
Matilda; Moses -- Moses! (Laughter)

00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.498
Moses! (Laughter) --

00:01:24.498 --> 00:01:28.994
the boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;"

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:32.810
Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;"

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.394
Luke Skywalker --

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.265
Luke Skywalker! (Laughter) --

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.552
Oliver Twist;

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:44.763
Cassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying;

00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:48.120
Celie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple."

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.732
All of these great fictional characters, all of them

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:56.729
who were hurt by their condition,

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.377
all of them who spawned thousands of other books

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:03.832
and other films, all of them

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:07.985
were fostered, adopted or orphaned.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:13.549
It seems that writers know that the child

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:20.698
outside of family reflects on what family truly is

00:02:20.698 --> 00:02:24.288
more than what it promotes itself to be.

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:29.255
That is, they also use extraordinary skills

00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:34.084
to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis.

00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:37.606
How have we not made the connection?

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:41.644
And why have we not made the connection, between

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:43.844
— How has that happened? —

00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:47.412
between these incredible characters of popular culture

00:02:47.412 --> 00:02:52.500
and religions, and the fostered, adopted or orphaned child

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.132
in our midst? It's not our pity that they need.

00:02:57.132 --> 00:02:59.733
It's our respect.

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:02.350
I know famous musicians,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.422
I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists

00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:10.923
and top lawyers and television executives

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:13.373
and magazine editors and national journalists

00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:16.214
and dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were

00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:19.750
looked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.422
and many of them grow into their adult lives

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:26.693
in fear of speaking of their background, as if it may

00:03:26.693 --> 00:03:31.000
somehow weaken their standing in the foreground,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.042
as if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:39.089
strapped on the inside. Children in care,

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.223
who've had a life in care, deserve the right

00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:48.073
to own and live the memory of their own childhood.

00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:50.352
It is that simple.

00:03:50.352 --> 00:03:54.358
My own mother — and I should say this here —

00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:58.212
she same to this country in the late '60s,

00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:01.977
and she was, you know, she found herself pregnant,

00:04:01.977 --> 00:04:04.072
as women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean?

00:04:04.072 --> 00:04:06.021
They found themselves pregnant.

00:04:06.021 --> 00:04:10.695
And she sort of, she had no idea of the context

00:04:10.695 --> 00:04:14.815
in which she'd landed.

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:18.663
In the 1960s -- I should give you some context -- in the 1960s,

00:04:18.663 --> 00:04:22.014
if you were pregnant and you were single,

00:04:22.014 --> 00:04:24.915
you were seen as a threat to the community.

00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:30.774
You were separated from your family by the state.

00:04:30.774 --> 00:04:33.476
You were separated from your family and placed into

00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:35.598
mother and baby homes.

00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:38.739
You were appointed a social worker.

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:41.129
The adoptive parents were lined up.

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.214
It was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim,

00:04:45.214 --> 00:04:48.555
to get the woman at her most vulnerable time

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:53.908
in her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.

00:04:53.908 --> 00:04:55.793
So the adoption papers were signed.

00:04:55.793 --> 00:04:59.363
The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns.

00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:02.539
The adoption papers were signed,

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.235
the child was given to the adoptive parents, and the mother

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:08.659
shipped back to her community

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.650
to say that she'd been on a little break.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.336
A little break.

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:16.014
A little break.

00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:19.579
The first secret of shame for a woman

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:24.658
for being a woman, "a little break."

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.749
The adoption process took, like, a matter of months,

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.629
so it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal,

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:38.134
an industrious, utilitarian solution:

00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:41.492
the government, the farmer,

00:05:41.492 --> 00:05:45.339
the adopting parents, the consumer,

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:50.141
the mother, the earth, and the child, the crop.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:54.795
It's kind of easy to patronize the past,

00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:59.699
to forego our responsibilities in the present.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.551
What happened then is a direct reflection

00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:08.795
of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves

00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:13.332
to be doing the right thing by God and by the state

00:06:13.332 --> 00:06:20.219
for the big society, fast-tracking adoption.

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.412
So anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant,

00:06:25.412 --> 00:06:30.490
and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.188
its own jubilee at the time

00:06:33.188 --> 00:06:35.958
under the Emperor Haile Selassie,

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:41.084
and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech,

00:06:41.084 --> 00:06:43.204
the "Rivers of Blood" speech.

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:47.826
She lands months before the Beatles release "The White Album,"

00:06:47.826 --> 00:06:50.510
months before Martin Luther King was killed.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.961
It was a summer of love if you were white.

00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:56.653
If you were black, it was a summer of hate.

00:06:56.653 --> 00:07:02.303
So she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England

00:07:02.303 --> 00:07:06.663
to a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.

00:07:06.663 --> 00:07:10.903
It's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses --

00:07:10.903 --> 00:07:15.174
It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time

00:07:15.174 --> 00:07:18.749
while she studies. But the social worker,

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:21.743
he had a different agenda.

00:07:21.743 --> 00:07:25.950
He found the foster parents, and he said to them,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.782
"Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:33.229
His name is Norman." (Laughter)

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:35.566
Norman! (Laughter)

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:38.278
Norman!

00:07:38.278 --> 00:07:44.504
So they took me. I was a message, they said.

00:07:44.504 --> 00:07:46.963
I was a sign from God, they said.

00:07:46.963 --> 00:07:50.707
I was Norman Mark Greenwood.

00:07:50.707 --> 00:07:54.126
Now, for the next 11 years, all I know is that this woman,

00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:56.714
this birth woman, should have her eyes scratched out

00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:59.716
for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman

00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:02.793
too selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years

00:08:02.793 --> 00:08:05.549
kneeling and praying.

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:08.670
I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.478
"God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"

00:08:12.478 --> 00:08:16.826
But I would always answer myself, "Yes, of course you can."

00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:18.440
(Laughter)

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.177
And then I was supposed to determine whether that

00:08:21.177 --> 00:08:24.709
was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:32.068
And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.

00:08:32.068 --> 00:08:34.476
Who knew? (Laughter)

00:08:34.476 --> 00:08:37.372
So anyway, two years sort of passed,

00:08:37.372 --> 00:08:39.150
and they had a child of their own,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.614
and then another two years passed, and they had another child of their own,

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:43.905
and then another time passed

00:08:43.905 --> 00:08:46.482
and they had another child that they called an accident,

00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:49.890
which I thought was an unusual name. (Laughter)

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.619
And I was on the cusp of, sort of, adolescence,

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:58.024
so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking.

00:08:58.024 --> 00:09:01.801
I was starting to stay out a little bit late, etc., etc.

00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:05.204
Now, in their religiosity, in their naivete,

00:09:05.204 --> 00:09:07.641
my mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever,

00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:10.909
as they said they were, my mom and dad

00:09:10.909 --> 00:09:17.718
conceived that I had the Devil inside of me.

00:09:17.718 --> 00:09:19.776
And what -- I should say this here, because this is how

00:09:19.776 --> 00:09:21.735
they engineered my leaving.

00:09:21.735 --> 00:09:25.124
They sat me at a table, my foster mom, and she said to me,

00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:27.192
"You don't love us, do you?" At 11 years old.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.701
They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:34.746
And I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do.

00:09:34.746 --> 00:09:36.897
My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love

00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:39.741
and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow

00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:42.684
and give my most honest and truthful answer.

00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:45.524
So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me

00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:47.860
whether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.725
which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.

00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:53.396
"I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine

00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:57.164
through me to them. How fantastic." This was an opportunity.

00:09:57.164 --> 00:09:59.949
The theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable,

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:02.852
and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:07.540
"I mustn't love you," I said to them. "But I will ask God for forgiveness."

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.092
"Because you don't love us, Norman,

00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:12.436
clearly you've chosen your path."

00:10:12.436 --> 00:10:15.234
Twenty-four hours later, my social worker,

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:18.283
this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months,

00:10:18.283 --> 00:10:21.495
he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents.

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:24.071
I didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father,

00:10:24.071 --> 00:10:25.899
my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles,

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:29.528
my cousins, my grandparents, nobody.

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:33.075
On the way to the children's home, I started to ask myself,

00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:36.050
"What's happened to me?"

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.203
It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me

00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:44.018
as much as the entire floor had been taken away.

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:47.818
When I got to the —

00:10:47.818 --> 00:10:52.201
For the next four, five years,

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:57.054
I was held in four different children's homes.

00:10:57.054 --> 00:11:00.331
On the third children's home, at 15,

00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:03.498
I started to rebel, and what I did was,

00:11:03.498 --> 00:11:07.827
I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models,

00:11:07.827 --> 00:11:11.658
and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home --

00:11:11.658 --> 00:11:13.498
and I was in a little turret at the top of it,

00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:16.801
and I poured them, red, yellow and green,

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:21.842
the colors of Africa, down the tiles.

00:11:21.842 --> 00:11:24.346
You couldn't see it from the street, because the home

00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:26.798
was surrounded by beech trees.

00:11:26.798 --> 00:11:31.754
For doing this, I was incarcerated for a year

00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:34.739
in an assessment center which was actually

00:11:34.739 --> 00:11:39.459
a remand center. It was a virtual prison

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:43.357
for young people.

00:11:43.357 --> 00:11:45.410
By the way, years later, my social worker said

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.869
that I should never have been put in there.

00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:49.524
I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong.

00:11:49.524 --> 00:11:54.250
But because I had no family to inquire about me,

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.001
they could do anything to me.

00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:02.355
I'm 17 years old, and

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:05.996
they had a padded cell.

00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:11.956
They would march me down corridors in last-size order.

00:12:11.956 --> 00:12:14.221
They -- I was put in a dormitory

00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:18.141
with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.

00:12:18.141 --> 00:12:21.463
All of the staff were ex-police -- interesting --

00:12:21.463 --> 00:12:23.477
and ex-probation officers.

00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:27.540
The man who ran it was an ex-army officer.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.700
Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.434
who would feed me grapes, once every three months,

00:12:34.434 --> 00:12:36.645
I was strip-searched.

00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:39.898
That home was full of young boys who were on remand

00:12:39.898 --> 00:12:45.166
for things like murder.

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:49.198
And this was the preparation that I was being given

00:12:49.198 --> 00:12:55.249
after 17 years as a child of the state.

00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:57.832
I have to tell this story.

00:12:57.832 --> 00:13:00.102
I have to tell it, because there was no one

00:13:00.102 --> 00:13:03.055
to put two and two together.

00:13:03.055 --> 00:13:06.082
I slowly became aware that I knew nobody

00:13:06.082 --> 00:13:09.576
that knew me for longer than a year.

00:13:09.576 --> 00:13:12.425
See, that's what family does.

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.816
It gives you reference points.

00:13:14.816 --> 00:13:17.304
I'm not defining a good family from a bad family.

00:13:17.304 --> 00:13:19.120
I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.776
by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is,

00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:23.723
a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle,

00:13:23.723 --> 00:13:25.733
a cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone,

00:13:25.733 --> 00:13:28.020
and therefore it matters to you. Understand,

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.249
I was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself,

00:13:32.249 --> 00:13:37.031
and I wasn't touched either, physically touched.

00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:45.158
I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.373
when I left the children's home I had two things

00:13:48.373 --> 00:13:52.170
that I wanted to do. One was to find my family,

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.700
and the other was to write poetry.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.249
In creativity I saw light.

00:13:56.249 --> 00:14:01.411
In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life,

00:14:01.411 --> 00:14:07.312
the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality,

00:14:07.312 --> 00:14:13.775
the place where anger was an expression

00:14:13.775 --> 00:14:17.523
in the search for love, a place where dysfunction

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:22.241
is a true reaction to untruth.

00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:25.788
I've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family

00:14:25.788 --> 00:14:29.151
in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them,

00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:33.166
and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.

00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:36.906
But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply

00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:42.418
that you can define how strong a democracy is

00:14:42.418 --> 00:14:47.651
by how its government treats its child.

00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:49.707
I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state.

00:14:49.707 --> 00:14:54.674
Thanks very much. It's been an honor. (Applause)

00:14:54.674 --> 00:14:57.126
(Applause)
