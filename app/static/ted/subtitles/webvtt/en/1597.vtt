00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:05.098
In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana

00:00:05.098 --> 00:00:07.809
had a very successful perfume business.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.066
For over 50 years she ran it.

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.851
It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — (Laughter) —

00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:18.282
for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:22.148
In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless,

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:25.472
but as a poison, it was the best money could buy,

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:29.265
so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:34.525
It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group,

00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:38.694
because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing.

00:00:38.694 --> 00:00:42.029
The reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:45.293
You can see this as early as even in newborn infants.

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:47.864
If you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:50.427
of a bitter substance or a sour substance,

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:54.199
and you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose,

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.071
as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth.

00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:00.023
This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes

00:01:00.023 --> 00:01:03.543
sort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.995
about whether or not we're about to be poisoned,

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:08.952
but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:13.083
from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar.

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:17.036
It has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:19.217
from physical contaminants, and there's a growing

00:01:19.217 --> 00:01:22.700
body of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.742
of disgust now influences our moral beliefs

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:29.638
and even our deeply held political intuitions.

00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:33.274
Why this might be the case?

00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:36.269
We can understand this process by understanding

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:39.419
a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions,

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:42.614
those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings,

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:45.415
exist because they motivate us to do good things

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:47.726
and they keep us away from doing bad things.

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:51.109
So by and large, they are good for our survival.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.918
Take the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away

00:01:53.918 --> 00:01:56.422
from doing things that are really, really risky.

00:01:56.422 --> 00:02:00.262
This photo taken just before his death — (Laughter) —

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:03.108
is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:06.725
is because most people would not do this, and if they did,

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.725
they would not live to tell it, because fear would have

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:12.400
kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.007
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:18.341
to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:20.936
keeps us away from not things that might eat us,

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:23.601
or heights, but rather things that might poison us,

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.198
or give us disease and make us sick.

00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:29.455
So one of the features of disgust that makes it such

00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:34.238
an interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit,

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:37.121
in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions,

00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:39.490
and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.373
I can probably make you feel disgust.

00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:44.568
So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back.

00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:45.701
(Laughter)

00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:50.034
I mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on. (Laughter)

00:02:50.034 --> 00:02:51.247
(Audience: Ewww.)

00:02:51.247 --> 00:02:54.256
Okay, turn back, if you didn't look.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:56.791
Those probably made a lot of you in the audience

00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:00.626
feel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look,

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.156
I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:05.839
sort of across the world to make people disgusted,

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.443
things like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:11.277
These are the sorts of things that it makes sense

00:03:11.277 --> 00:03:14.531
for us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.

00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:16.826
In fact, just having a diseased appearance

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:19.226
or odd sexual acts, these things are also

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:22.217
things that give us a lot of disgust.

00:03:22.217 --> 00:03:24.595
Darwin was probably one of the first scientists

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:26.538
to systematically investigate the human emotions,

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:30.227
and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength

00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:32.076
of the disgust response.

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:35.347
This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.083
"In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.588
some cold preserved meat while I was eating ...

00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:43.107
and plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt

00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:46.105
utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — (Laughter) —

00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:48.262
though his hands did not appear dirty."

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:53.660
He later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages." (Laughter)

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.404
Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists

00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:58.685
who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:00.975
to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary,

00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:04.842
and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite.

00:04:04.842 --> 00:04:07.207
Richard Dawkins: "We've evolved around courtship and sex,

00:04:07.207 --> 00:04:10.229
are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:14.929
that are hard to jettison overnight."

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:18.966
David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.609
Professor Dawkins actually gagged.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.194
He jumps back, and he gags, and we had to do it three times,

00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:28.750
and all three times he gagged. (Laughter)

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.896
And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.112
One of the features, though, of disgust,

00:04:35.112 --> 00:04:38.042
is not just its universality and its strength,

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:41.081
but the way that it works through association.

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.816
So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing,

00:04:44.816 --> 00:04:48.170
that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.377
This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to

00:04:51.377 --> 00:04:53.143
convince somebody that an object or an individual

00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:56.811
or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided.

00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:59.352
The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out

00:04:59.352 --> 00:05:01.436
in this quote: "Thus throughout history, certain disgust

00:05:01.436 --> 00:05:04.677
properties -- sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness --

00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:06.977
have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...

00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:10.829
Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people --

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:14.343
all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body."

00:05:14.343 --> 00:05:17.475
Let me give you just some examples of how, some powerful

00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:19.847
examples of how this has been used historically.

00:05:19.847 --> 00:05:23.437
This comes from a Nazi children's book published in 1938:

00:05:23.437 --> 00:05:26.247
"Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards,

00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:29.557
the filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes...

00:05:29.557 --> 00:05:32.323
Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor.

00:05:32.323 --> 00:05:35.116
If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."

00:05:35.116 --> 00:05:37.649
A more modern example comes from people who try to

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:40.110
convince us that homosexuality is immoral.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.795
This is from an anti-gay website, where they said

00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:47.072
gays are "worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices."

00:05:47.072 --> 00:05:50.738
They're like "dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces."

00:05:50.738 --> 00:05:53.482
These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly

00:05:53.482 --> 00:05:56.831
linked to the social group that you should not like.

00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:59.603
When we were first investigating the role of disgust in

00:05:59.603 --> 00:06:03.472
moral judgment, one of the things we became interested in

00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:07.775
was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:10.840
to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.969
So while disgust, along with the other basic emotions,

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.585
are universal phenomena, it just really is true

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.883
that some people are easier to disgust than others.

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:19.569
You could probably see it in the audience members

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:21.626
when I showed you those disgusting images.

00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:24.326
The way that we measured this was by a scale that was

00:06:24.326 --> 00:06:26.655
constructed by some other psychologists

00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:29.512
that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.613
how likely they are to feel disgust.

00:06:31.613 --> 00:06:33.406
So here are a couple of examples.

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:35.578
"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:39.386
favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."

00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:40.951
"Do you agree or disagree?" (Laughter)

00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:43.231
"While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track,

00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:46.895
you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted?"

00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:49.551
If you ask enough of these, you can get a general overall

00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:51.914
score of disgust sensitivity.

00:06:51.914 --> 00:06:54.387
It turns out that this score is actually meaningful.

00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:57.464
When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask

00:06:57.464 --> 00:07:01.293
them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors

00:07:01.293 --> 00:07:06.315
like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop,

00:07:06.315 --> 00:07:10.280
or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.271
your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:15.614
you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors.

00:07:15.614 --> 00:07:18.212
The first time that we set out to collect data on this

00:07:18.212 --> 00:07:20.222
and associate it with political or moral beliefs,

00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:23.099
we found a general pattern --

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.401
this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom --

00:07:26.401 --> 00:07:30.421
that in fact, across three studies we kept finding

00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:32.942
that people who reported that they were easily disgusted

00:07:32.942 --> 00:07:36.397
also reported that they were more politically conservative.

00:07:36.397 --> 00:07:38.281
Another way to say this, though, is that people

00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:43.688
who are very liberal are very hard to disgust. (Laughter)

00:07:43.688 --> 00:07:47.958
In a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at

00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.639
a much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case,

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.231
this is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents,

00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.008
and we find the same pattern. As you can see,

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:57.953
people who are on the very conservative side

00:07:57.953 --> 00:08:00.655
of answering the political orientation scale are

00:08:00.655 --> 00:08:03.425
also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:05.920
This data set also allowed us to statistically control

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.144
for a number of things that we knew were both related

00:08:08.144 --> 00:08:11.059
to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.

00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:13.664
So we were able to control for gender, age, income,

00:08:13.664 --> 00:08:16.955
education, even basic personality variables,

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.257
and the result stays the same.

00:08:19.257 --> 00:08:22.683
When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation,

00:08:22.683 --> 00:08:25.583
but voting behavior, we were able to look geographically

00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:28.529
across the nation. What we found was that in regions

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:32.426
in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity,

00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:34.413
McCain got more votes.

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:37.531
So it not only predicted self-reported political orientation,

00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:39.903
but actual voting behavior. And also we were able,

00:08:39.903 --> 00:08:42.595
with this sample, to look across the world,

00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:46.189
in 121 different countries we asked the same questions,

00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:50.116
and as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:52.486
into 10 different geographical regions.

00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:55.110
No matter where you look, what this is plotting is the size

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.521
of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation,

00:08:58.521 --> 00:09:02.160
and no matter where we looked, we saw a very similar effect.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.597
Other labs have actually looked at this as well

00:09:05.597 --> 00:09:07.774
using different measures of disgust sensitivity,

00:09:07.774 --> 00:09:10.326
so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are,

00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:12.666
they hook people up to physiological measures,

00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:14.294
in this case skin conductance.

00:09:14.294 --> 00:09:16.522
And what they've demonstrated is that people who report

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:20.648
being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused

00:09:20.648 --> 00:09:24.222
when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.

00:09:24.222 --> 00:09:26.391
Interestingly, what they also showed in a finding

00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:30.416
that we kept getting in our previous studies as well

00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:34.163
was that one of the strongest influences here is that

00:09:34.163 --> 00:09:36.373
individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are

00:09:36.373 --> 00:09:38.459
more likely to report being politically conservative, but

00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:41.468
they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage

00:09:41.468 --> 00:09:43.617
and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of

00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:47.382
the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.

00:09:47.382 --> 00:09:50.871
So physiological arousal predicted, in this study,

00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:52.569
attitudes toward gay marriage.

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:55.788
But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:58.947
and political orientation, one of the questions that remains is

00:09:58.947 --> 00:10:02.018
what is the causal link here? Is it the case that

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.292
disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs?

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:07.852
We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this,

00:10:07.852 --> 00:10:10.627
and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab

00:10:10.627 --> 00:10:13.050
and disgust them and compare them to a control group

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.458
that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over

00:10:15.458 --> 00:10:18.186
the past five years a number of researchers have done this,

00:10:18.186 --> 00:10:21.012
and by and large the results have all been the same,

00:10:21.012 --> 00:10:23.441
that when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes

00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:25.544
shift towards the right of the political spectrum,

00:10:25.544 --> 00:10:28.220
toward more moral conservatism as well.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.900
So this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste,

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:37.190
from film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust,

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.556
images like the ones I've shown you, even just

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.519
reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:45.158
be wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean,

00:10:45.158 --> 00:10:47.938
these all have similar effects on judgment.

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:50.304
Let me just give you an example from a recent study

00:10:50.304 --> 00:10:53.264
that we conducted. We asked participants

00:10:53.264 --> 00:10:57.961
to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups,

00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:02.373
and we either made the room smell gross or not.

00:11:02.373 --> 00:11:05.544
When the room smelled gross, what we saw was that

00:11:05.544 --> 00:11:09.215
individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.

00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:11.438
Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.831
social groups that we asked, including African-Americans,

00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:17.693
the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had

00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:19.086
toward gay men.

00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:22.647
In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people --

00:11:22.647 --> 00:11:24.573
this was at a time when the swine flu was going around --

00:11:24.573 --> 00:11:27.057
we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread

00:11:27.057 --> 00:11:30.775
of the flu that they ought to wash their hands.

00:11:30.775 --> 00:11:35.190
For some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.111
next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.

00:11:38.111 --> 00:11:40.631
And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire

00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:44.344
next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals

00:11:44.344 --> 00:11:47.507
report being more politically conservative.

00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:49.544
And when we asked them a variety of questions about

00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:52.967
the rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also

00:11:52.967 --> 00:11:55.282
found was that simply being reminded that they ought

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:58.591
to wash their hands made them more morally conservative.

00:11:58.591 --> 00:12:00.888
In particular, when we asked them questions about

00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:04.662
sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices,

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:07.288
just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands

00:12:07.288 --> 00:12:09.851
made them think that they were more morally wrong.

00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:12.251
Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless

00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:15.016
but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios.

00:12:15.016 --> 00:12:18.774
One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.

00:12:18.774 --> 00:12:21.492
When his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend

00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:22.840
on his grandma's bed.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.337
In another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating

00:12:25.337 --> 00:12:29.231
with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her. (Laughter)

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:31.863
People find these to be more morally abhorrent

00:12:31.863 --> 00:12:36.179
if they've been reminded to wash their hands. (Laughter)

00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:39.371
(Laughter)

00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:42.900
Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.783
should come as no surprise. I mean,

00:12:44.783 --> 00:12:46.184
that's part of how emotions work.

00:12:46.184 --> 00:12:47.748
They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways,

00:12:47.748 --> 00:12:49.832
but they change the way you think.

00:12:49.832 --> 00:12:52.622
In the case of disgust, what is a little bit more surprising

00:12:52.622 --> 00:12:56.067
is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense,

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.946
and it's a very good emotion for us to have, that disgust

00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:01.602
would make me change the way that I perceive

00:13:01.602 --> 00:13:04.645
the physical world whenever contamination is possible.

00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:07.577
It makes less sense that an emotion that was built

00:13:07.577 --> 00:13:10.483
to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict

00:13:10.483 --> 00:13:13.859
who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:16.667
The question of whether disgust ought to influence

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:19.019
our moral and political judgments

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:22.155
certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly

00:13:22.155 --> 00:13:24.837
what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist,

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:26.843
we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method

00:13:26.843 --> 00:13:30.347
is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions.

00:13:30.347 --> 00:13:32.395
But one thing that I am fairly certain about is,

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.214
at the very least, what we can do with this research is

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:38.066
point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.

00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:42.066
Thank you. (Applause)
