00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:04.088
I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car,

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:07.031
I basically had to roll down the window.

00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:11.243
It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.597
and my father would not let us use the air conditioner.

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:16.354
He said that it would overheat the engine.

00:00:16.354 --> 00:00:18.002
And you might remember, some of you,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.902
how the cars were back then, and it was

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:22.268
a common problem of overheating.

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:26.288
But it was also the signal that capped the use,

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:30.710
or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.749
Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.910
We blast the air conditioning the entire way,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.486
and we never experience overheating.

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:41.473
So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:47.091
Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.

00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:50.557
In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:53.236
The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:56.754
very cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,

00:00:56.754 --> 00:00:59.154
and the small windows were also very good because

00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:01.745
it limited the amount of temperature transfer

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:04.212
between the interior and exterior.

00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:08.084
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:11.480
rolled steel and mass production, we were able

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.930
to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.656
and with that came the irreversible reliance on

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:25.237
mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.

00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:28.341
Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger,

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.982
our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems

00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:34.856
were massive. They require a huge amount of energy.

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:37.615
They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere,

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.815
and for some of you may understand the heat island effect

00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:44.325
in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm

00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:47.275
than the adjacent rural areas,

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:50.529
but we also have problems that, when we lose power,

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:53.290
we can't open a window here, and so

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.104
the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant

00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:59.752
until that air conditioning system can start up again.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:03.807
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:08.792
move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.159
just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.937
We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:19.188
So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:22.039
out of this hole that we've dug?

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.948
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know,

00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:28.604
I was a biology major before I went into architecture,

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:32.993
the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:36.429
the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.044
That's the first line of defense for the body.

00:02:39.044 --> 00:02:42.253
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things

00:02:42.253 --> 00:02:45.671
that work together very dynamically and very efficiently,

00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:48.175
and so what I propose is that our building skins

00:02:48.175 --> 00:02:51.824
should be more similar to human skin,

00:02:51.824 --> 00:02:55.936
and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:59.192
and differentiated, depending on where it is.

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:01.125
And this gets me back to my research.

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:06.435
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:09.346
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials,

00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:11.065
and a smart thermo-bimetal.

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:13.977
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:16.707
no controls and it requires no energy,

00:03:16.707 --> 00:03:19.370
and that's a very big deal for architecture.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.184
What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.

00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:26.058
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:29.533
And because it has two different coefficients of expansion,

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:32.830
when heated, one side will expand faster than the other

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.367
and result in a curling action.

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:40.073
So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see

00:03:40.073 --> 00:03:44.266
how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:47.371
air to ventilate through the system,

00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:50.600
and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.081
of having these strips together can try to make

00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:57.155
bigger movement happen when also heated,

00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:01.219
and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.705
in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.603
It's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely

00:04:07.603 --> 00:04:11.643
out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy

00:04:11.643 --> 00:04:15.460
that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.470
when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.839
and in other areas, it's a ventilating system,

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.992
so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually

00:04:24.992 --> 00:04:28.870
move through and out when necessary.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.001
You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:35.747
as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade,

00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:38.223
each of the tiles moves individually.

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:40.735
Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:43.748
this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces

00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:48.477
and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.

00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:50.989
And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:54.988
each one to be very, very specific to its location,

00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:59.934
to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.740
So this kind of proof of concept project

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.704
has a lot of implications

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:08.404
to actual future application in architecture,

00:05:08.404 --> 00:05:10.909
and in this case, here you see a house,

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.342
that's for a developer in China,

00:05:13.342 --> 00:05:16.086
and it's actually a four-story glass box.

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:19.923
It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.805
but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:26.270
it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.298
open and close as that sun moves around on that surface.

00:05:30.298 --> 00:05:34.860
In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.156
so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas

00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:39.748
in the space during different times of day.

00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:43.011
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now,

00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:46.428
we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:48.595
because we can sheath the building with these things,

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:54.162
as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.

00:05:54.162 --> 00:05:57.551
I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market,

00:05:57.551 --> 00:06:00.040
and so here you see a pretty typical

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.771
double-glazed window panel, and in that panel,

00:06:04.771 --> 00:06:07.698
between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing,

00:06:07.698 --> 00:06:09.875
I'm trying to work on making

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.944
a thermo-bimetal pattern system

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:14.616
so that when the sun hits that outside layer

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:19.260
and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.036
will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then

00:06:22.036 --> 00:06:24.339
is it'll start to block out the sun

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.213
in certain areas of the building,

00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:28.154
and totally, if necessary.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.662
And so you can imagine, even in this application, that

00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:33.339
in a high-rise building where the panel systems go

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:38.106
from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.296
could be differentiated at different times of day

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:45.755
depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.

00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:48.574
And these are some later studies that I'm working on

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.838
right now that are on the boards, where you can see,

00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:54.179
in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:56.457
smaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to,

00:06:56.457 --> 00:07:01.703
we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.

00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:04.185
This last project is also of components.

00:07:04.185 --> 00:07:08.042
The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my

00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:11.618
spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper.

00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:14.225
And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:17.627
They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,

00:07:17.627 --> 00:07:21.117
and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,

00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:24.499
and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:26.681
consider that in architecture too, how we can bring

00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:29.347
air through holes in the sides of a building.

00:07:29.347 --> 00:07:32.320
And so you see here some early studies of blocks,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.833
where those holes are actually coming through,

00:07:34.833 --> 00:07:38.553
and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,

00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:41.252
and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:44.460
hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.638
On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal

00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:51.240
is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.280
and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.826
and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different

00:07:56.826 --> 00:07:58.642
components that I'm working on, and again,

00:07:58.642 --> 00:08:00.954
it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine

00:08:00.954 --> 00:08:03.681
that air could potentially be coming through the walls

00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.562
instead of opening windows.

00:08:06.562 --> 00:08:09.250
So I want to leave you with one last impression about

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.630
the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.810
When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.803
day after day, when you're on vacation

00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:23.842
and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,

00:08:23.842 --> 00:08:26.197
or when there's a power outage, and you have

00:08:26.197 --> 00:08:29.218
no electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals

00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:33.216
will still be working tirelessly, efficiently

00:08:33.216 --> 00:08:36.522
and endlessly. Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:39.314
(Applause)
