00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:05.411
I grew up in Bihar, India's poorest state,

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:08.877
and I remember when I was six years old,

00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:12.643
I remember coming home one day to find a cart

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:17.964
full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep.

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:21.453
My brothers and I dug in,

00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:24.741
and that's when my father came home.

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:30.205
He was livid, and I still remember how we cried

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:34.269
when that cart with our half-eaten sweets

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.486
was pulled away from us.

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:42.287
Later, I understood why my father got so upset.

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:45.512
Those sweets were a bribe

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:49.093
from a contractor who was trying to get my father

00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:52.556
to award him a government contract.

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:57.217
My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar,

00:00:57.217 --> 00:01:01.820
and he had developed a firm stance against corruption,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.868
even though he was harassed and threatened.

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:09.236
His was a lonely struggle, because Bihar

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.973
was also India's most corrupt state,

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:16.735
where public officials were enriching themselves,

00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:20.828
[rather] than serving the poor who had no means

00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:24.774
to express their anguish if their children

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:28.607
had no food or no schooling.

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:32.964
And I experienced this most viscerally

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:39.262
when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty.

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:43.079
And as I went village to village,

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.591
I remember one day, when I was famished and exhausted,

00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:51.910
and I was almost collapsing

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.940
in a scorching heat under a tree,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.999
and just at that time, one of the poorest men in that village

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:06.915
invited me into his hut and graciously fed me.

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:11.563
Only I later realized that what he fed me

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:17.306
was food for his entire family for two days.

00:02:17.306 --> 00:02:21.729
This profound gift of generosity

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:27.007
challenged and changed the very purpose of my life.

00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:30.779
I resolved to give back.

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:35.083
Later, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight

00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:40.851
such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries.

00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:45.883
My initial work focused on Uganda, where I focused

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:50.111
on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:52.940
so they could access our loans.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.071
But after we disbursed the loans, I remember

00:02:56.071 --> 00:03:00.789
a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.573
without textbooks or teachers,

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:06.493
new health clinics without drugs,

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:12.276
and the poor once again without any voice or recourse.

00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:15.852
It was Bihar all over again.

00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:19.812
Bihar represents the challenge of development:

00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:23.723
abject poverty surrounded by corruption.

00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:27.983
Globally, 1.3 billion people live on less than

00:03:27.983 --> 00:03:32.692
$1.25 a day, and the work I did in Uganda

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:37.623
represents the traditional approach to these problems

00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:41.915
that has been practiced since 1944,

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:47.535
when winners of World War II, 500 founding fathers,

00:03:47.535 --> 00:03:50.971
and one lonely founding mother,

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.398
gathered in New Hampshire, USA,

00:03:53.398 --> 00:03:56.017
to establish the Bretton Woods institutions,

00:03:56.017 --> 00:03:57.822
including the World Bank.

00:03:57.822 --> 00:04:01.122
And that traditional approach to development

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:05.058
had three key elements. First, transfer of resources

00:04:05.058 --> 00:04:07.009
from rich countries in the North

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.506
to poorer countries in the South,

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:12.399
accompanied by reform prescriptions.

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.965
Second, the development institutions that channeled

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:20.727
these transfers were opaque, with little transparency

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:24.527
of what they financed or what results they achieved.

00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:28.440
And third, the engagement in developing countries

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.722
was with a narrow set of government elites

00:04:31.722 --> 00:04:35.036
with little interaction with the citizens, who are

00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:39.321
the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:43.522
Today, each of these elements is opening up

00:04:43.522 --> 00:04:46.882
due to dramatic changes in the global environment.

00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:50.577
Open knowledge, open aid, open governance,

00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:54.322
and together, they represent three key shifts

00:04:54.322 --> 00:04:57.092
that are transforming development

00:04:57.092 --> 00:05:00.805
and that also hold greater hope for the problems

00:05:00.805 --> 00:05:05.378
I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.

00:05:05.378 --> 00:05:08.344
The first key shift is open knowledge.

00:05:08.344 --> 00:05:11.905
You know, developing countries today will not simply

00:05:11.905 --> 00:05:15.502
accept solutions that are handed down to them

00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:19.129
by the U.S., Europe or the World Bank.

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.964
They get their inspiration, their hope,

00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:24.364
their practical know-how,

00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:27.915
from successful emerging economies in the South.

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:32.595
They want to know how China lifted 500 million people

00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:36.258
out of poverty in 30 years,

00:05:36.258 --> 00:05:39.204
how Mexico's Oportunidades program

00:05:39.204 --> 00:05:43.900
improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.562
This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows,

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:54.495
not just traveling North to South, but South to South,

00:05:54.495 --> 00:05:56.798
and even South to North,

00:05:56.798 --> 00:06:02.540
with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.388
And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up,

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:09.228
so too are the development institutions

00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:11.755
that channeled these transfers.

00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:15.624
This is the second shift: open aid.

00:06:15.624 --> 00:06:19.174
Recently, the World Bank opened its vault of data

00:06:19.174 --> 00:06:24.037
for public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators

00:06:24.037 --> 00:06:28.406
for 200 countries over 50 years,

00:06:28.406 --> 00:06:32.384
and it launched a global competition to crowdsource

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:36.051
innovative apps using this data.

00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:39.224
Development institutions today are also opening

00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:43.038
for public scrutiny the projects they finance.

00:06:43.038 --> 00:06:47.303
Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya,

00:06:47.303 --> 00:06:52.022
the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors

00:06:52.022 --> 00:06:56.014
are located, and the darker the shade of green,

00:06:56.014 --> 00:06:59.374
the more the number of out-of-school children.

00:06:59.374 --> 00:07:03.510
So this simple mashup reveals that donors

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.486
have not financed any schools in the areas

00:07:06.486 --> 00:07:08.594
with the most out-of-school children,

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:12.686
provoking new questions. Is development assistance

00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:17.305
targeting those who most need our help?

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:20.207
In this manner, the World Bank has now GeoMapped

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:25.149
30,000 project activities in 143 countries,

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:28.325
and donors are using a common platform

00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:31.270
to map all their projects.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.132
This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency

00:07:36.132 --> 00:07:38.974
and accountability of aid.

00:07:38.974 --> 00:07:41.970
And this leads me to the third, and in my view,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.302
the most significant shift in development:

00:07:45.302 --> 00:07:49.517
open governance. Governments today are opening up

00:07:49.517 --> 00:07:53.494
just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability.

00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:57.524
From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India,

00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:00.258
using mobile phones and social media

00:08:00.258 --> 00:08:02.872
not just for political accountability

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:07.017
but also for development accountability.

00:08:07.017 --> 00:08:11.489
Are governments delivering services to the citizens?

00:08:11.489 --> 00:08:15.634
So for instance, several governments in Africa

00:08:15.634 --> 00:08:20.658
and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public.

00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:24.061
But, you know, there is a big difference between a budget

00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:28.098
that's public and a budget that's accessible.

00:08:28.098 --> 00:08:33.018
This is a public budget. (Laughter)

00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:36.123
And as you can see, it's not really accessible

00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:38.842
or understandable to an ordinary citizen

00:08:38.842 --> 00:08:43.840
that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.775
To tackle this problem, governments are using new tools

00:08:47.775 --> 00:08:52.458
to visualize the budget so it's more understandable

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:54.658
to the public.

00:08:54.658 --> 00:08:58.592
In this map from Moldova, the green color shows

00:08:58.592 --> 00:09:02.680
those districts that have low spending on schools

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.000
but good educational outcomes,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.249
and the red color shows the opposite.

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:14.776
Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:18.530
into a publicly understandable visual,

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.296
and what's exciting is that with this openness,

00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:26.154
there are today new opportunities for citizens

00:09:26.154 --> 00:09:29.680
to give feedback and engage with government.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.063
So in the Philippines today, parents and students

00:09:34.063 --> 00:09:38.210
can give real-time feedback on a website,

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.302
Checkmyschool.org, or using SMS, whether teachers

00:09:43.302 --> 00:09:46.096
and textbooks are showing up in school,

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:50.747
the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.

00:09:50.747 --> 00:09:53.599
And the government is responsive. So for instance,

00:09:53.599 --> 00:09:58.109
when it was reported on this website that 800 students

00:09:58.109 --> 00:10:02.295
were at risk because school repairs had stalled

00:10:02.295 --> 00:10:04.886
due to corruption, the Department of Education

00:10:04.886 --> 00:10:07.840
in the Philippines took swift action.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.537
And you know what's exciting is that this innovation

00:10:11.537 --> 00:10:16.199
is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:20.544
to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond.

00:10:20.544 --> 00:10:24.803
In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished

00:10:24.803 --> 00:10:28.357
community was able to use these tools

00:10:28.357 --> 00:10:31.329
to voice its aspirations.

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:34.248
This is what the map of Tandale looked like

00:10:34.248 --> 00:10:38.601
in August, 2011. But within a few weeks,

00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:43.067
university students were able to use mobile phones

00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:47.617
and an open-source platform to dramatically map

00:10:47.617 --> 00:10:51.104
the entire community infrastructure.

00:10:51.104 --> 00:10:55.569
And what is very exciting is that citizens were then

00:10:55.569 --> 00:11:00.576
able to give feedback as to which health or water points

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:03.450
were not working, aggregated

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.050
in the red bubbles that you see,

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.648
which together provides a graphic visual

00:11:10.648 --> 00:11:15.103
of the collective voices of the poor.

00:11:15.103 --> 00:11:20.713
Today, even Bihar is turning around and opening up

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:23.585
under a committed leadership that is making government

00:11:23.585 --> 00:11:28.753
transparent, accessible and responsive to the poor.

00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:32.281
But, you know, in many parts of the world,

00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:35.259
governments are not interested in opening up

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:40.376
or in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge

00:11:40.376 --> 00:11:44.720
for those who want to change the system.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.289
These are the lonely warriors

00:11:48.289 --> 00:11:51.753
like my father and many, many others,

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.877
and a key frontier of development work

00:11:54.877 --> 00:12:00.073
is to help these lonely warriors join hands

00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:03.614
so they can together overcome the odds.

00:12:03.614 --> 00:12:08.357
So for instance, today, in Ghana, courageous reformers

00:12:08.357 --> 00:12:11.557
from civil society, Parliament and government,

00:12:11.557 --> 00:12:15.749
have forged a coalition for transparent contracts

00:12:15.749 --> 00:12:19.805
in the oil sector, and, galvanized by this,

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:25.485
reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts.

00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:30.413
These examples give new hope, new possibility

00:12:30.413 --> 00:12:33.525
to the problems I witnessed in Uganda

00:12:33.525 --> 00:12:38.627
or that my father confronted in Bihar.

00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:45.596
Two years ago, on April 8th, 2010, I called my father.

00:12:45.596 --> 00:12:50.994
It was very late at night, and at age 80,

00:12:50.994 --> 00:12:55.795
he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation

00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:59.409
against corruption in a road project.

00:12:59.409 --> 00:13:04.027
Though he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court

00:13:04.027 --> 00:13:08.241
himself the next day. He won the ruling,

00:13:08.241 --> 00:13:10.263
but later that very evening,

00:13:10.263 --> 00:13:14.857
he fell, and he died.

00:13:14.857 --> 00:13:19.801
He fought till the end, increasingly passionate

00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:23.746
that to combat corruption and poverty,

00:13:23.746 --> 00:13:27.753
not only did government officials need to be honest,

00:13:27.753 --> 00:13:31.002
but citizens needed to join together

00:13:31.002 --> 00:13:33.897
to make their voices heard.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:38.758
These became the two bookends of his life,

00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:41.472
and the journey he traveled in between

00:13:41.472 --> 00:13:46.257
mirrored the changing development landscape.

00:13:46.257 --> 00:13:51.210
Today, I'm inspired by these changes, and I'm excited

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.314
that at the World Bank, we are embracing

00:13:54.314 --> 00:13:57.403
these new directions, a significant departure

00:13:57.403 --> 00:14:01.281
from my work in Uganda 20 years ago.

00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:04.822
We need to radically open up development

00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:07.626
so knowledge flows in multiple directions,

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:12.417
inspiring practitioners, so aid becomes transparent,

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:16.576
accountable and effective, so governments open up

00:14:16.576 --> 00:14:20.522
and citizens are engaged and empowered

00:14:20.522 --> 00:14:22.181
with reformers in government.

00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:25.378
We need to accelerate these shifts.

00:14:25.378 --> 00:14:30.378
If we do, we will find that the collective voices

00:14:30.378 --> 00:14:34.768
of the poor will be heard in Bihar,

00:14:34.768 --> 00:14:36.990
in Uganda, and beyond.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:41.065
We will find that textbooks and teachers

00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:44.102
will show up in schools for their children.

00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:48.185
We will find that these children, too,

00:14:48.185 --> 00:14:54.303
have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty.

00:14:54.303 --> 00:14:57.518
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:57.518 --> 00:15:00.238
(Applause)
