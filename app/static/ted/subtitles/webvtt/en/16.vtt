00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:05.499
I'd like to talk today
about the two biggest social trends

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:06.976
in the coming century,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.976
But I want to start
with my work on romantic love,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.865
because that's my most recent work.

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:20.976
What I and my colleagues did was put
32 people, who were madly in love,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.976
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

00:00:23.368 --> 00:00:26.217
17 who were madly in love
and their love was accepted;

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.191
and 15 who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped.

00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:32.350
And so I want to tell you
about that first,

00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:35.239
and then go on into where
I think love is going.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:37.689
(Laughter)

00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:41.459
"What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:44.456
I think our ancestors --

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.378
I think human beings have been
wondering about this question

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.178
since they sat around their campfires

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.893
or lay and watched
the stars a million years ago.

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:58.159
I started out by trying to figure out
what romantic love was

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:03.666
by looking at the last 45 years
of the psychological research

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.997
and as it turns out,

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:08.975
there's a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.976
The first thing that happens is,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.976
a person begins to take on
what I call, "special meaning."

00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:17.195
As a truck driver once said to me,

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.000
"The world had a new center,
and that center was Mary Anne."

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.761
George Bernard Shaw said it differently.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.253
"Love consists of overestimating
the differences

00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:28.285
between one woman and another."

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:30.571
And indeed, that's what we do.

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.849
(Laughter)

00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:36.469
And then you just focus on this person.

00:01:36.493 --> 00:01:39.310
You can list what you
don't like about them,

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:42.898
but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do.

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:44.921
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.691
In trying to understand romantic love,

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:51.692
I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world,

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.368
and I just want to give
you one very short poem

00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:55.639
from eighth-century China,

00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:57.872
because it's an almost perfect example

00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:01.260
of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman.

00:02:01.824 --> 00:02:04.864
It's a little bit like when you are
madly in love with somebody

00:02:04.888 --> 00:02:06.526
and you walk into a parking lot --

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.930
their car is different
from every other car in the parking lot.

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:11.460
Their wine glass at dinner

00:02:11.484 --> 00:02:14.976
is different from every other wine glass
at the dinner party.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.764
And in this case, a man got hooked
on a bamboo sleeping mat.

00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:20.511
And it goes like this.

00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:22.026
It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.

00:02:23.423 --> 00:02:25.976
"I cannot bear to put away
the bamboo sleeping mat.

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:29.642
The night I brought you home,
I watched you roll it out."

00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:32.825
He became hooked on a sleeping mat,

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.825
probably because of elevated activity
of dopamine in his brain,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.270
just like with you and me.

00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:40.459
But anyway, not only does this person
take on special meaning,

00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:42.929
you focus your attention on them.

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:44.554
You aggrandize them.

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:46.339
But you have intense energy.

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:49.858
As one Polynesian said,
"I felt like jumping in the sky."

00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:53.603
You're up all night.
You're walking till dawn.

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:56.586
You feel intense elation
when things are going well;

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.159
mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly.

00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:02.637
Real dependence on this person.

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:05.060
As one businessman in New York said to me,

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.945
"Anything she liked, I liked."

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:09.485
Simple. Romantic love is very simple.

00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:12.976
You become extremely sexually possessive.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.731
You know, if you're just sleeping
with somebody casually,

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:18.625
you don't really care
if they're sleeping with somebody else.

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.203
But the moment you fall in love,

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.523
you become extremely
sexually possessive of them.

00:03:22.547 --> 00:03:25.976
I think there's a Darwinian
purpose to this.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.633
The whole point of this
is to pull two people together

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:31.963
strongly enough to begin
to rear babies as a team.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.976
But the main characteristics
of romantic love are craving:

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.422
an intense craving
to be with a particular person,

00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:41.669
not just sexually, but emotionally.

00:03:41.693 --> 00:03:45.421
It would be nice to go to bed with them,

00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:49.677
but you want them to call you
on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,

00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:51.557
to tell you that they love you.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.182
The other main characteristic
is motivation.

00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:00.571
The motor in the brain begins to crank,
and you want this person.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.864
And last but not least,
it is an obsession.

00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:07.976
Before I put these people
in the MRI machine,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.976
I would ask them all kinds of questions.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.165
But my most important question
was always the same.

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.976
It was: "What percentage of the day
and night do you think about this person?"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.890
And indeed, they would say,

00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:22.071
"All day. All night.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.436
I can never stop thinking
about him or her."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.810
And then, the very last question --

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:29.433
I would always have to work
myself up to this question,

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:31.024
because I'm not a psychologist.

00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:34.024
I don't work with people
in any kind of traumatic situation.

00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:36.299
My final question was always the same.

00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:38.976
I would say,
"Would you die for him or her?"

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.536
And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!"

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.671
as if I had asked them to pass the salt.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:46.389
I was just staggered by it.

00:04:47.634 --> 00:04:50.220
So we scanned their brains,

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:52.354
looking at a photograph
of their sweetheart

00:04:52.378 --> 00:04:54.146
and looking at a neutral photograph,

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.004
with a distraction task in between.

00:04:56.028 --> 00:05:00.976
So we could look at the same brain
when it was in that heightened state

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.297
and when it was in a resting state.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.140
And we found activity
in a lot of brain regions.

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:08.822
In fact, one of the most important
was a brain region

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:12.054
that becomes active
when you feel the rush of cocaine.

00:05:12.657 --> 00:05:15.000
And indeed, that's exactly what happens.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.269
I began to realize that romantic love
is not an emotion.

00:05:20.293 --> 00:05:23.149
In fact, I had always thought
it was a series of emotions,

00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:24.879
from very high to very low.

00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:26.609
But actually, it's a drive.

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:28.768
It comes from the motor of the mind,

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:32.457
the wanting part of the mind,
the craving part of the mind.

00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:33.976
The kind of part of the mind

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.640
when you're reaching
for that piece of chocolate,

00:05:36.664 --> 00:05:40.502
when you want to win
that promotion at work.

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:42.445
The motor of the brain.

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:43.673
It's a drive.

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:46.800
And in fact, I think it's more powerful
than the sex drive.

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:49.649
You know, if you ask somebody
to go to bed with you,

00:05:49.673 --> 00:05:51.110
and they say, "No, thank you,"

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:54.651
you certainly don't kill yourself
or slip into a clinical depression.

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.868
But certainly, around the world,

00:05:57.892 --> 00:06:01.849
people who are rejected
in love will kill for it.

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:03.484
People live for love.

00:06:03.508 --> 00:06:04.768
They kill for love.

00:06:04.792 --> 00:06:05.823
They die for love.

00:06:06.277 --> 00:06:09.855
They have songs, poems, novels,

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.823
sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.

00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:15.996
In over 175 societies,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.804
people have left their evidence
of this powerful brain system.

00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:21.851
I have come to think

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:24.463
it's one of the most powerful
brain systems on Earth

00:06:24.487 --> 00:06:27.064
for both great joy and great sorrow.

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.096
And I've also come to think

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:32.603
that it's one of three
basically different brain systems

00:06:32.628 --> 00:06:34.675
that evolved from mating and reproduction.

00:06:35.072 --> 00:06:38.127
One is the sex drive:
the craving for sexual gratification.

00:06:38.555 --> 00:06:41.976
W.H. Auden called it
an "intolerable neural itch,"

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.975
and indeed, that's what it is.

00:06:45.142 --> 00:06:47.722
It keeps bothering you
a little bit, like being hungry.

00:06:48.904 --> 00:06:51.850
The second of these three brain
systems is romantic love:

00:06:51.874 --> 00:06:53.976
that elation, obsession of early love.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.356
And the third brain system is attachment:

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.333
that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a long-term partner.

00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:03.510
And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there,

00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:06.089
looking for a whole range of partners.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:08.898
You can feel it when you're just
driving along in your car.

00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:10.294
It can be focused on nobody.

00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:13.976
I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.976
on just one individual at a time,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.832
thereby conserving mating time and energy.

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:21.586
And I think that attachment,
the third brain system,

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.152
evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being

00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:29.229
at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.498
So with that preamble,

00:07:32.522 --> 00:07:38.553
I want to go into discussing
the two most profound social trends.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.283
One of the last 10,000 years

00:07:41.307 --> 00:07:46.004
and the other,
certainly of the last 25 years,

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:50.280
that are going to have an impact
on these three different brain systems:

00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:53.857
lust, romantic love
and deep attachment to a partner.

00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:58.723
The first is women working,
moving into the workforce.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:04.224
I've looked at 130 societies

00:08:04.248 --> 00:08:06.889
through the demographic yearbooks
of the United Nations.

00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:11.645
Everywhere in the world,
129 out of 130 of them,

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:13.976
women are not only moving
into the job market --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.976
sometimes very, very slowly,
but they are moving into the job market --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.854
and they are very slowly closing
that gap between men and women

00:08:21.878 --> 00:08:25.675
in terms of economic power,
health and education.

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:26.835
It's very slow.

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.976
For every trend on this planet,
there's a counter-trend.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.313
We all know of them, but nevertheless --

00:08:32.337 --> 00:08:38.733
the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark,
but the caravan moves on."

00:08:38.757 --> 00:08:41.084
And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.

00:08:41.108 --> 00:08:43.795
Women are moving back into the job market.

00:08:43.819 --> 00:08:46.976
And I say back into the job market,
because this is not new.

00:08:47.323 --> 00:08:50.989
For millions of years,
on the grasslands of Africa,

00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:54.163
women commuted to work
to gather their vegetables.

00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:57.847
They came home with 60 to 80 percent
of the evening meal.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.759
The double income family was the standard.

00:09:00.783 --> 00:09:04.213
And women were regarded
as just as economically,

00:09:04.237 --> 00:09:07.976
socially and sexually powerful as men.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.803
In short, we're really
moving forward to the past.

00:09:12.223 --> 00:09:17.516
Then, women's worst
invention was the plow.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.214
With the beginning of plow agriculture,
men's roles became extremely powerful.

00:09:21.238 --> 00:09:25.674
Women lost their ancient
jobs as collectors,

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:29.377
but then with the industrial revolution
and the post-industrial revolution

00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:31.344
they're moving back into the job market.

00:09:31.368 --> 00:09:36.495
In short, they are acquiring the status
that they had a million years ago,

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:39.743
10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.

00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:44.338
We are seeing now one
of the most remarkable traditions

00:09:44.362 --> 00:09:46.695
in the history of the human animal.

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:50.262
And it's going to have an impact.

00:09:50.286 --> 00:09:51.819
I generally give a whole lecture

00:09:51.843 --> 00:09:54.147
on the impact of women
on the business community.

00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:57.228
I'll say just a couple of things,
and then go on to sex and love.

00:09:57.252 --> 00:09:59.109
There's a lot of gender differences;

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:01.309
anybody who thinks men and women are alike

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:03.275
simply never had a boy and a girl child.

00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:06.492
I don't know why they want to think
that men and women are alike.

00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:08.039
There's much we have in common,

00:10:08.063 --> 00:10:10.976
but there's a whole lot
that we do not have in common.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.976
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.104
"I think that we are like two feet.
We need each other to get ahead."

00:10:18.128 --> 00:10:20.976
But we did not evolve
to have the same brain.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.449
And we're finding more and more
gender differences in the brain.

00:10:24.473 --> 00:10:27.600
I'll only just use a couple
and then move on to sex and love.

00:10:27.624 --> 00:10:29.731
One of them is women's verbal ability.

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:30.976
Women can talk.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.976
Women's ability to find the right word
rapidly, basic articulation

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.378
goes up in the middle
of the menstrual cycle,

00:10:37.402 --> 00:10:38.973
when estrogen levels peak.

00:10:38.997 --> 00:10:42.615
But even at menstruation,
they're better than the average man.

00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:44.147
Women can talk.

00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:47.976
They've been doing it for a million years;
words were women's tools.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.087
They held that baby
in front of their face,

00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:53.920
cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words.

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:56.976
And, indeed, they're becoming
a very powerful force.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.237
Even in places like India and Japan,

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:05.658
where women are not moving rapidly
into the regular job market,

00:11:05.682 --> 00:11:07.515
they're moving into journalism.

00:11:07.539 --> 00:11:11.976
And I think that the television
is like the global campfire.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.976
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.084
Almost always, when I'm on TV,
the producer who calls me,

00:11:20.108 --> 00:11:22.251
who negotiates what we're going to say,

00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:23.330
is a woman.

00:11:23.354 --> 00:11:26.012
In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,

00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:29.190
"To have a great writer
is to have another government."

00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:34.269
Today 54 percent of people
who are writers in America are women.

00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:37.831
It's one of many, many
characteristics that women have

00:11:37.855 --> 00:11:40.135
that they will bring into the job market.

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:44.286
They've got incredible people skills,
negotiating skills.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.976
They're highly imaginative.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.579
We now know the brain circuitry
of imagination, of long-term planning.

00:11:50.603 --> 00:11:52.723
They tend to be web thinkers.

00:11:52.747 --> 00:11:55.532
Because the female parts
of the brain are better connected,

00:11:55.556 --> 00:11:58.730
they tend to collect more
pieces of data when they think,

00:11:58.754 --> 00:12:03.457
put them into more complex patterns,
see more options and outcomes.

00:12:03.481 --> 00:12:07.187
They tend to be contextual,
holistic thinkers,

00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:08.751
what I call web thinkers.

00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:10.780
Men tend to -- and these are averages --

00:12:10.804 --> 00:12:13.463
tend to get rid of what they regard
as extraneous,

00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:14.872
focus on what they do,

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:20.822
and move in a more
step-by-step thinking pattern.

00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:23.273
They're both perfectly good
ways of thinking.

00:12:23.297 --> 00:12:25.529
We need both of them to get ahead.

00:12:25.553 --> 00:12:28.976
In fact, there's many more
male geniuses in the world.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.721
And there's also many more
male idiots in the world.

00:12:31.745 --> 00:12:33.471
(Laughter)

00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:36.677
When the male brain works well,
it works extremely well.

00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:40.035
And what I really think
that we're doing is,

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:42.345
we're moving towards
a collaborative society,

00:12:42.369 --> 00:12:45.171
a society in which the talents
of both men and women

00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:48.976
are becoming understood
and valued and employed.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.763
But in fact, women moving
into the job market

00:12:51.787 --> 00:12:56.897
is having a huge impact
on sex and romance and family life.

00:12:57.608 --> 00:13:02.692
Foremost, women are starting
to express their sexuality.

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:05.342
I'm always astonished
when people come to me and say,

00:13:05.366 --> 00:13:07.684
"Why is it that men are so adulterous?"

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:10.421
"Why do you think
more men are adulterous than women?"

00:13:10.445 --> 00:13:12.016
"Well, men are more adulterous!"

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.978
And I say, "Who do you think
these men are sleeping with?"

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:16.406
(Laughter)

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.158
And -- basic math!

00:13:18.182 --> 00:13:19.356
Anyway.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.976
In the Western world,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.976
women start sooner at sex,
have more partners,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.885
express less remorse
for the partners that they do,

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:31.591
marry later, have fewer children,

00:13:31.615 --> 00:13:34.520
leave bad marriages
in order to get good ones.

00:13:34.544 --> 00:13:38.523
We are seeing the rise
of female sexual expression.

00:13:38.547 --> 00:13:43.268
And, indeed, once again we're moving
forward to the kind of sexual expression

00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:46.976
that we probably saw on the grasslands
of Africa a million years ago,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.976
because this is the kind
of sexual expression that we see

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.258
in hunting and gathering societies today.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:56.841
We're also returning
to an ancient form of marriage equality.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.976
They're now saying that the 21st century

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.976
is going to be the century of what
they call the "symmetrical marriage,"

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.384
or the "pure marriage,"
or the "companionate marriage."

00:14:11.408 --> 00:14:14.976
This is a marriage between equals,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.443
moving forward to a pattern

00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:20.601
that is highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit.

00:14:21.775 --> 00:14:24.314
We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.

00:14:24.786 --> 00:14:29.012
91 percent of American women
and 86 percent of American men

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:33.639
would not marry somebody
who had every single quality

00:14:33.663 --> 00:14:35.479
they were looking for in a partner,

00:14:35.503 --> 00:14:38.266
if they were not in love with that person.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.809
People around the world,
in a study of 37 societies,

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:45.470
want to be in love
with the person that they marry.

00:14:45.946 --> 00:14:52.000
Indeed, arranged marriages are
on their way off this braid of human life.

00:14:55.618 --> 00:14:58.412
I even think that marriages
might even become more stable

00:14:58.436 --> 00:15:02.190
because of the second great world trend.

00:15:02.214 --> 00:15:04.976
The first one being women
moving into the job market,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.850
the second one being
the aging world population.

00:15:07.874 --> 00:15:10.301
They're now saying that in America,

00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:13.976
that middle age should be regarded
as up to age 85.

00:15:14.642 --> 00:15:19.521
Because in that highest
age category of 76 to 85,

00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:22.976
as much as 40 percent of people
have nothing really wrong with them.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.382
So we're seeing there's a real
extension of middle age.

00:15:26.714 --> 00:15:31.976
For one of my books,
I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.231
And as it turns out, the older you get,
the less likely you are to divorce.

00:15:36.596 --> 00:15:40.197
So the divorce rate right now
is stable in America,

00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:42.555
and it's actually beginning to decline.

00:15:42.579 --> 00:15:44.181
It may decline some more.

00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:51.132
I would even say that with Viagra,

00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:54.971
estrogen replacement, hip replacements

00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:56.976
and the incredibly interesting women

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.105
-- women have never been
as interesting as they are now.

00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:03.587
Not at any time on this planet
have women been so educated,

00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:05.558
so interesting, so capable.

00:16:05.962 --> 00:16:11.341
And so I honestly think that if there
really was ever a time in human evolution

00:16:11.365 --> 00:16:15.230
when we have the opportunity to make
good marriages, that time is now.

00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:19.717
However, there's always kinds
of complications in this.

00:16:19.741 --> 00:16:24.458
These three brain systems --
lust, romantic love and attachment --

00:16:24.482 --> 00:16:25.836
don't always go together.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.559
They can go together, by the way.

00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:29.535
That's why casual sex isn't so casual.

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:31.828
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.

00:16:31.852 --> 00:16:33.948
Dopamine's associated with romantic love,

00:16:33.972 --> 00:16:35.995
and you can just
fall in love with somebody

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:37.882
who you're just having casual sex with.

00:16:37.906 --> 00:16:41.342
With orgasm, then you get a real rush
of oxytocin and vasopressin --

00:16:41.366 --> 00:16:43.397
those are associated with attachment.

00:16:43.421 --> 00:16:47.380
This is why you can feel such a sense
of cosmic union with somebody

00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:49.253
after you've made love to them.

00:16:49.277 --> 00:16:53.976
But these three brain systems:
lust, romantic love and attachment,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.481
aren't always connected to each other.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.251
You can feel deep attachment
to a long-term partner

00:17:00.275 --> 00:17:04.367
while you feel intense
romantic love for somebody else,

00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:09.844
while you feel the sex drive for people
unrelated to these other partners.

00:17:10.312 --> 00:17:15.341
In short, we're capable of loving
more than one person at a time.

00:17:15.714 --> 00:17:17.706
In fact, you can lie in bed at night

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.976
and swing from deep feelings
of attachment for one person

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.432
to deep feelings
of romantic love for somebody else.

00:17:24.456 --> 00:17:27.337
It's as if there's a committee meeting
going on in your head

00:17:27.361 --> 00:17:30.488
as you are trying to decide what to do.

00:17:30.512 --> 00:17:32.147
So I don't think, honestly,

00:17:32.171 --> 00:17:34.186
we're an animal
that was built to be happy;

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.478
we are an animal
that was built to reproduce.

00:17:36.502 --> 00:17:39.437
I think the happiness we find, we make.

00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:42.943
And I think, however,

00:17:42.967 --> 00:17:45.634
we can make good relationships
with each other.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.105
So I want to conclude with two things.

00:17:48.129 --> 00:17:50.176
I want to conclude with a worry,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.129
and with a wonderful story.

00:17:54.287 --> 00:17:56.976
The worry is about antidepressants.

00:17:58.631 --> 00:18:03.763
Over 100 million prescriptions
of antidepressants

00:18:03.787 --> 00:18:06.608
are written every year
in the United States.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.665
And these drugs are going generic.

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:12.172
They are seeping around the world.

00:18:12.743 --> 00:18:17.976
I know one girl who's been
on these antidepressants,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.976
SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing
antidepressants -- since she was 13.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.976
She's 23. She's been on them
ever since she was 13.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.516
I've got nothing against people
who take them short term,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.763
when they're going
through something horrible.

00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:33.142
They want to commit suicide
or kill somebody else.

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.234
I would recommend it.

00:18:34.258 --> 00:18:36.717
But more and more people
in the United States

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:39.125
are taking them long term.

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:44.514
And indeed, what these drugs do
is raise levels of serotonin.

00:18:44.974 --> 00:18:49.795
And by raising levels of serotonin,
you suppress the dopamine circuit.

00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:51.381
Everybody knows that.

00:18:51.944 --> 00:18:54.839
Dopamine is associated with romantic love.

00:18:56.627 --> 00:18:59.777
Not only do they suppress
the dopamine circuit,

00:18:59.801 --> 00:19:01.668
but they kill the sex drive.

00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:06.140
And when you kill the sex drive,
you kill orgasm.

00:19:06.164 --> 00:19:07.355
And when you kill orgasm,

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:11.246
you kill that flood of drugs
associated with attachment.

00:19:11.712 --> 00:19:13.976
The things are connected in the brain.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.656
And when you tamper with one brain system,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.625
you're going to tamper with another.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.754
I'm just simply saying that a world
without love is a deadly place.

00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:25.740
So now --

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:29.976
(Applause)

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.703
Thank you.

00:19:31.727 --> 00:19:33.212
I want to end with a story.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.139
And then, just a comment.

00:19:36.741 --> 00:19:41.520
I've been studying romantic love
and sex and attachment for 30 years.

00:19:43.774 --> 00:19:47.290
I'm an identical twin;
I am interested in why we're all alike.

00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:50.976
Why you and I are alike,
why the Iraqis and the Japanese

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
and the Australian Aborigines
and the people of the Amazon River

00:19:54.024 --> 00:19:55.024
are all alike.

00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:58.086
And about a year ago,

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.095
an Internet dating service,
Match.com, came to me

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:04.771
and asked me if I would design
a new dating site for them.

00:20:04.795 --> 00:20:07.597
I said, "I don't know anything
about personality. You know?

00:20:07.621 --> 00:20:10.341
I don't know. Do you think
you've got the right person?"

00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:11.405
They said, "Yes."

00:20:11.429 --> 00:20:14.452
It got me thinking
about why it is that you fall in love

00:20:14.476 --> 00:20:16.208
with one person rather than another.

00:20:16.232 --> 00:20:19.675
That's my current project;
it will be my next book.

00:20:20.262 --> 00:20:21.801
There's all kinds of reasons

00:20:21.825 --> 00:20:24.578
that you fall in love
with one person rather than another.

00:20:24.602 --> 00:20:27.888
Timing is important.
Proximity is important.

00:20:27.912 --> 00:20:29.292
Mystery is important.

00:20:29.316 --> 00:20:32.045
You fall in love with somebody
who's somewhat mysterious,

00:20:32.069 --> 00:20:34.747
in part because mystery
elevates dopamine in the brain,

00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:37.537
probably pushes you
over that threshold to fall in love.

00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:38.990
You fall in love with somebody

00:20:39.014 --> 00:20:41.109
who fits within
what I call your "love map,"

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:43.280
an unconscious list of traits

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:45.618
that you build in childhood
as you grow up.

00:20:45.642 --> 00:20:48.684
And I also think
that you gravitate to certain people,

00:20:48.708 --> 00:20:51.976
actually, with somewhat
complementary brain systems.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.287
And that's what I'm now
contributing to this.

00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:57.976
But I want to tell you
a story, to illustrate.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.976
I've been carrying on here
about the biology of love.

00:21:01.709 --> 00:21:05.396
I wanted to show you a little bit
about the culture of it, too,

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.587
the magic of it.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.349
It's a story that was told to me

00:21:11.373 --> 00:21:13.834
by somebody who had
heard it just from one --

00:21:13.858 --> 00:21:14.976
probably a true story.

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:19.976
It was a graduate student --
I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.976
Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.371
That's where we put our people
in the MRI machine.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.563
And this graduate student was madly
in love with another graduate student,

00:21:29.587 --> 00:21:31.960
and she was not in love with him.

00:21:33.206 --> 00:21:35.461
And they were
all at a conference in Beijing.

00:21:36.485 --> 00:21:39.519
And he knew from our work

00:21:39.543 --> 00:21:43.951
that if you go and do something
very novel with somebody,

00:21:43.975 --> 00:21:45.976
you can drive up
the dopamine in the brain,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.693
and perhaps trigger
this brain system for romantic love.

00:21:49.717 --> 00:21:51.874
(Laughter)

00:21:51.898 --> 00:21:55.784
So he decided he'd put science to work.

00:21:56.624 --> 00:21:59.958
And he invited this girl to go off
on a rickshaw ride with him.

00:22:00.809 --> 00:22:02.878
And sure enough -- I've never been in one,

00:22:02.902 --> 00:22:05.640
but apparently they go
all around the buses and the trucks

00:22:05.664 --> 00:22:08.482
and it's crazy and it's noisy
and it's exciting.

00:22:08.506 --> 00:22:10.792
He figured that this
would drive up the dopamine,

00:22:10.816 --> 00:22:12.348
and she'd fall in love with him.

00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:17.346
So off they go and she's squealing
and squeezing him

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.887
and laughing and having a wonderful time.

00:22:19.911 --> 00:22:23.450
An hour later they get down
off of the rickshaw,

00:22:23.474 --> 00:22:27.054
and she throws her hands up and she says,

00:22:27.078 --> 00:22:29.390
"Wasn't that wonderful?"

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:32.828
And, "Wasn't that rickshaw
driver handsome!"

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:35.921
(Laughter)

00:22:35.945 --> 00:22:41.976
(Applause)

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.162
There's magic to love!

00:22:43.186 --> 00:22:44.797
(Applause)

00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:48.441
But I will end by saying
that millions of years ago,

00:22:48.465 --> 00:22:50.797
we evolved three basic drives:

00:22:50.821 --> 00:22:53.340
the sex drive, romantic love

00:22:53.364 --> 00:22:55.704
and attachment to a long-term partner.

00:22:55.728 --> 00:22:58.807
These circuits are deeply
embedded in the human brain.

00:22:59.203 --> 00:23:03.606
They're going to survive
as long as our species survives

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.338
on what Shakespeare called
"this mortal coil."

00:23:06.362 --> 00:23:07.368
Thank you.

00:23:07.392 --> 00:23:08.817
Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher!

00:23:08.841 --> 00:23:09.904
(Applause)
