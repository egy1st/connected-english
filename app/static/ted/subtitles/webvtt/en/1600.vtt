00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:03.983
Today I have just one request.

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:07.373
Please don't tell me I'm normal.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:11.749
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.015
Remi is 22,

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:16.979
tall and very handsome.

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:20.907
He's speechless, but he communicates joy

00:00:20.907 --> 00:00:25.190
in a way that some of the best orators cannot.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.833
Remi knows what love is.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:32.215
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:35.735
He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:39.056
He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this:

00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:42.311
He has never told a lie.

00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:44.792
When he sings songs from our childhood,

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:47.655
attempting words that not even I could remember,

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:49.879
he reminds me of one thing:

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.432
how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful

00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:56.007
the unknown must be.

00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:01.744
Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome.

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:05.528
He has the most impeccable memory.

00:01:05.528 --> 00:01:08.076
He has a selective one, though.

00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:11.844
He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar,

00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:15.134
but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod,

00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:17.533
conversations we had when he was four,

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:21.004
weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies,

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:24.412
and Lady Gaga's birthday.

00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:27.149
Don't they sound incredible?

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.173
But most people don't agree.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.909
And in fact, because their minds don't fit

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.645
into society's version of normal,

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:38.583
they're often bypassed and misunderstood.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:42.349
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.669
was that even though this was the case,

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:47.583
although they were not seen as ordinary,

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:50.095
this could only mean one thing:

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:53.470
that they were extraordinary --

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.693
autistic and extraordinary.

00:01:57.693 --> 00:02:02.144
Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism,"

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:06.046
it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication,

00:02:06.046 --> 00:02:09.734
learning and sometimes physical skills.

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:12.549
It manifests in each individual differently,

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.230
hence why Remi is so different from Sam.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.864
And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person

00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:20.734
is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:23.877
the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world,

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:27.053
there is no known cause or cure.

00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:30.318
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism,

00:02:30.318 --> 00:02:33.397
but I cannot recall a day without it.

00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:35.782
I was just three years old when my brother came along,

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:38.046
and I was so excited that

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:41.149
I had a new being in my life.

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.878
And after a few months went by,

00:02:43.878 --> 00:02:46.263
I realized that he was different.

00:02:46.263 --> 00:02:48.469
He screamed a lot.

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.556
He didn't want to play like the other babies did,

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:53.502
and in fact, he didn't seem

00:02:53.502 --> 00:02:56.387
very interested in me whatsoever.

00:02:56.387 --> 00:03:00.367
Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules,

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.573
and he found pleasure in the smallest things,

00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:05.096
like lining up cars around the room

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:06.773
and staring at the washing machine

00:03:06.773 --> 00:03:10.155
and eating anything that came in between.

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:13.900
And as he grew older, he grew more different,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.583
and the differences became more obvious.

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:20.035
Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:22.804
and the never-ending hyperactivity

00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:25.396
was something really unique:

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:29.364
a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world

00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:34.995
without prejudice, a human who had never lied.

00:03:34.995 --> 00:03:38.076
Extraordinary.

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:39.863
Now, I cannot deny that there have been

00:03:39.863 --> 00:03:42.595
some challenging moments in my family,

00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:45.708
moments where I've wished that they were just like me.

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:48.492
But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me

00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:52.332
about individuality and communication and love,

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:55.669
and I realize that these are things that

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.067
I wouldn't want to change with normality.

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:05.220
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.549
and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.387
It just means that there's a different kind of right.

00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:16.204
And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:18.530
and to Sam

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.257
and to you,

00:04:20.257 --> 00:04:24.053
it would be that you don't have to be normal.

00:04:24.053 --> 00:04:28.036
You can be extraordinary.

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:30.117
Because autistic or not,

00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:32.327
the differences that we have --

00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:36.695
We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us,

00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:40.159
and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.156
is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:47.496
The chance for greatness, for progress and for change

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:51.375
dies the moment we try to be like someone else.

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:54.607
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.

00:04:54.607 --> 00:04:57.080
Thank you. (Applause)

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.793
(Applause)
