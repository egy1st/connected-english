00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.048
Good morning. So magic is an excellent way

00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:05.091
for staying ahead of the reality curve,

00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:08.006
to make possible today

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.088
what science will make a reality tomorrow.

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:13.089
As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.048
and science to give us a feel of how future technologies

00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:20.095
might be experienced.

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:24.000
You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.027
It's new technology. You look through them

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:29.000
and the world you see is augmented with data:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.057
names of places, monuments, buildings,

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:36.073
maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.

00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:40.089
So these are my illusion glasses.

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.044
They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.050
And when you look through them, you get a glimpse

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.058
into the mind of the cyber-illusionist.

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:53.083
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:58.064
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.

00:00:58.064 --> 00:01:02.074
Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it

00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:07.062
when we see it again.

00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:11.012
All right. Very significant mark.

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:13.012
And let's put it back into the deck,

00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:18.006
somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.036
(Music)

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.013
Voice: System ready. Acquiring image.

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:24.042
Marco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards,

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:28.011
a deck of cards is made up of four different suits:

00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:31.012
hearts, clubs,

00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:34.033
diamonds and spades.

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:37.023
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols,

00:01:37.023 --> 00:01:42.027
and have been interpreted in many different ways.

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:46.015
Now, some say that the four suits

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:50.017
represent the four seasons.

00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:53.087
There's spring, summer,

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:56.014
autumn and â

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:59.008
Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.025
Winter is like magic. It's a time of change,

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:05.096
when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow,

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:09.070
and then it all disappears.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.093
There are 13 cards in each suit. (Music)

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:19.050
Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.008
MT: So over here is low tide,

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.078
and over here is high tide,

00:02:24.078 --> 00:02:27.066
and in the middle is the moon.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:31.026
Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:35.091
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.082
There is the color red

00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:43.019
and the color black,

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.018
representing the constant change

00:02:46.018 --> 00:02:49.018
from day to night.

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:51.059
Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter)

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:55.096
MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards

00:02:55.096 --> 00:03:00.099
in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.033
(Music)

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.071
Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards,

00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.005
the result is 365.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.049
MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year,

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.049
the number of days between

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.084
each birthday.

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:21.040
Make a wish. (Blowing noise)

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.084
Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:26.043
MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday

00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:29.087
that I received my first deck of cards,

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:34.027
and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world

00:03:34.027 --> 00:03:37.083
performing magic for boys and girls,

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:40.030
men and women, husbands and wives,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.055
even kings and queens. (Applause)

00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:50.049
Voice: And who are these?MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.058
Wake up.

00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:54.050
Joker: Whoa.MT: Are you ready for your party piece?

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.073
Joker: Ready!MT: Let me see what you've got.

00:03:56.073 --> 00:03:59.080
Joker: Presenting my pogo stick.MT: Ah. Watch out.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.014
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music)

00:04:03.014 --> 00:04:08.074
MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:11.094
I'm performing for you.

00:04:11.094 --> 00:04:14.092
Voice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:19.021
how do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job?

00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:22.027
Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7.

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:26.073
I don't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.

00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:30.013
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration,

00:04:30.013 --> 00:04:33.065
but it does take practice. Now, some people will say,

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:38.036
well, magic, that must be the work of some evil

00:04:38.036 --> 00:04:41.044
supernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:41.044 --> 00:04:44.022
(Music)

00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:49.015
Whoa.

00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:53.001
Well, to this, I just say, no no.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.090
Actually, in German, it's nein nein. (Laughter)

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.041
Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you, though,

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:03.007
if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this,

00:05:03.007 --> 00:05:06.020
don't play for money.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.053
(Music)

00:05:09.053 --> 00:05:13.004
Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.

00:05:13.004 --> 00:05:16.082
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:21.024
MT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds.

00:05:21.024 --> 00:05:26.021
Voice: I think you got your birthday wish.MT: And that actually leaves me with the last,

00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:29.032
and most important card of all:

00:05:29.032 --> 00:05:32.033
the one with this very significant mark on it.

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:35.000
And unlike anything else we've just seen,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.021
virtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected.

00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:48.027
Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing.

00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:57.020
MT: Bye bye. (Music)

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.070
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.088
(Applause)

00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:10.057
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:14.057
(Applause)
