00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:02.791
I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason

00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:05.356
to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day,

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:07.708
and that was mainly because my mother has never believed

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:11.385
in email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.940
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.081
I was literally waiting by the mailbox

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.769
to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone,

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.157
which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital,

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:26.502
but I was just looking for some sort of scribble,

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:29.133
some unkempt cursive from my mother.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.538
And so when I moved to New York City after college

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:34.498
and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression,

00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:37.250
I did the only thing I could think of at the time.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.262
I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:43.675
for strangers, and tucked them all throughout the city,

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:46.518
dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere,

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:50.720
in cafes and in libraries, at the U.N., everywhere.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.775
I blogged about those letters and the days

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:54.749
when they were necessary, and I posed

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.412
a kind of crazy promise to the Internet:

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:59.798
that if you asked me for a hand-written letter,

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:03.119
I would write you one, no questions asked.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.195
Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak --

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.886
a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:13.806
in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.452
who barely even knew her own coffee order,

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.998
to write them a love letter and give them a reason

00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:21.327
to wait by the mailbox.

00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:24.151
Well, today I fuel a global organization

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.827
that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox,

00:01:26.827 --> 00:01:29.457
fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:32.947
like never before to write and mail strangers letters

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:35.804
when they need them most, but most of all,

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:39.100
fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.340
filled with the scriptings of ordinary people,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.041
strangers writing letters to other strangers not because

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.832
they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee,

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:52.444
but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing.

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.958
But, you know, the thing that always gets me

00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.494
about these letters is that most of them have been written

00:01:57.494 --> 00:02:02.198
by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:05.903
They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters.

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:07.772
They're the ones from my generation,

00:02:07.772 --> 00:02:10.638
the ones of us that have grown up into a world

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:13.721
where everything is paperless, and where some

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:16.783
of our best conversations have happened upon a screen.

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:19.141
We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook,

00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:23.431
and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less.

00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:26.103
But what if it's not about efficiency this time?

00:02:26.103 --> 00:02:28.932
I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate,

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:31.338
which is a conversation starter, let me tell you.

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.647
If you ever need one, just carry one of these. (Laughter)

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:36.480
And a man just stared at me, and he was like,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.969
"Well, why don't you use the Internet?"

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.442
And I thought, "Well, sir, I am not a strategist,

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:46.208
nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller."

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:48.889
And so I could tell you about a woman

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.799
whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan,

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.345
and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation,

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:57.805
and so she tucks love letters throughout the house

00:02:57.805 --> 00:02:59.933
as a way to say, "Come back to me.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.491
Find me when you can."

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:04.413
Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters

00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:07.672
around her campus in Dubuque, Iowa, only to find

00:03:07.672 --> 00:03:10.725
her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:12.860
onto the quad and finds love letters hanging

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.973
from the trees, tucked in the bushes and the benches.

00:03:16.973 --> 00:03:20.006
Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life,

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:23.145
uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:24.498
to friends and family.

00:03:24.498 --> 00:03:27.068
Well, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters

00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:30.285
just like this one tucked beneath his pillow,

00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:33.604
scripted by strangers who were there for him when.

00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:35.969
These are the kinds of stories that convinced me

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.815
that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair

00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:42.420
and talk about efficiency, because she is an art form now,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.813
all the parts of her, the signing, the scripting, the mailing,

00:03:45.813 --> 00:03:48.351
the doodles in the margins.

00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:51.485
The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down,

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:53.152
pull out a piece of paper and think about someone

00:03:53.152 --> 00:03:55.798
the whole way through, with an intention that is so much

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:59.028
harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:02.555
is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once,

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:03.990
that is an art form

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.165
that does not fall down to the Goliath of "get faster,"

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:10.037
no matter how many social networks we might join.

00:04:10.037 --> 00:04:12.882
We still clutch close these letters to our chest,

00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:15.516
to the words that speak louder than loud,

00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:17.873
when we turn pages into palettes to say the things

00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:19.439
that we have needed to say,

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.127
the words that we have needed to write, to sisters

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:25.649
and brothers and even to strangers, for far too long.

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:29.215
Thank you. (Applause)

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:32.462
(Applause)
