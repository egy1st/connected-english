00:00:01.797 --> 00:00:04.264
So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world

00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:06.990
from a totally unique point of view,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.015
and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:12.595
I've found, after doing this for many, many years,

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.311
that there's a magical world behind reality.

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.470
And that can be seen directly through a microscope,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.575
and I'm going to show you some of this today.

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:24.262
So let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small,

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:26.526
something that we can see with our naked eye,

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.967
and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee,

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:31.863
it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:34.151
But to really see the details of the bee, and really

00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.880
appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.966
So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope,

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.313
and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:46.144
thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia,

00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:48.576
and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.945
so they know when they're right up close to something,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:54.649
because they can't see in stereo.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.353
As we go smaller, here is a human hair.

00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:01.172
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.

00:01:01.172 --> 00:01:03.906
It's about a tenth of a millimeter.

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:05.082
And as we go smaller again,

00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:08.488
about ten times smaller than that, is a cell.

00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:11.071
So you could fit 10 human cells

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:14.737
across the diameter of a human hair.

00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:16.323
So when we would look at cells, this is how I really got

00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:19.591
involved in biology and science is by looking

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.058
at living cells in the microscope.

00:01:22.058 --> 00:01:24.129
When I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:28.028
absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.

00:01:28.028 --> 00:01:31.344
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,

00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:33.168
they're actually moving all over the place.

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:36.933
This cell is looking for foreign objects,

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.290
bacteria, things that it can find.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.938
And it's looking around, and when it finds something,

00:01:41.938 --> 00:01:44.234
and recognizes it being foreign,

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:45.526
it will actually engulf it and eat it.

00:01:45.526 --> 00:01:49.810
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.432
and it engulfs it and eats it.

00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:58.613
If you take some heart cells from an animal,

00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:01.509
and put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.099
That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life,

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.900
and these cells, the mission is

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.427
to move blood around our body.

00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:13.211
These next cells are nerve cells, and right now,

00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:16.147
as we see and understand what we're looking at,

00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:18.261
our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:20.803
right now. They're not just static. They're moving around

00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:24.305
making new connections, and that's what happens when we learn.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.095
As you go farther down this scale here,

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:29.999
that's a micron, or a micrometer, and we go

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.347
all the way down to here to a nanometer

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:35.104
and an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the size

00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:38.471
of the diameter of a hydrogen atom.

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.104
That's how small that is.

00:02:40.104 --> 00:02:42.406
And microscopes that we have today can actually see

00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.479
individual atoms. So these are some pictures

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.312
of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.

00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:51.141
This is a ring of cobalt atoms.

00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:53.799
So this whole world, the nano world, this area in here

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.994
is called the nano world, and the nano world,

00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:00.128
the whole micro world that we see,

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:03.161
there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:07.556
the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms.

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:10.014
But I want to talk about this larger world,

00:03:10.014 --> 00:03:12.351
the world of the micro world.

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:16.470
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.621
what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?

00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:22.136
It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see

00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:25.430
when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.262
and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface

00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:31.328
of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.

00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:33.704
The petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant

00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:36.385
is kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look

00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:39.729
a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here,

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.474
this is the style of that flower, and you notice

00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:46.699
that it's got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:51.441
that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.

00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:54.058
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like

00:03:54.058 --> 00:03:55.884
it's in a little Willy Wonka land.

00:03:55.884 --> 00:04:00.019
It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.922
These are little bits of individual grain of pollen

00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:07.368
there and there, and here is a --

00:04:07.368 --> 00:04:09.946
what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen,

00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:11.910
when you look in a microscope, it's actually made

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.674
of thousands of little grains of pollen.

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:17.909
So this, for example, when you see bees flying around

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.714
these little plants, and they're collecting pollen,

00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:23.137
those pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.570
into their legs and they take it back to the hive,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.200
and that's what makes the beehive,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.018
the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar,

00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:35.929
and that's what makes the honey that we eat.

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:39.186
Here's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture

00:04:39.186 --> 00:04:41.859
of a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision,

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:44.420
with your naked eye, you'd see it about that well.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.048
There's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen

00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:50.562
and the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen.

00:04:50.562 --> 00:04:53.213
So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there,

00:04:53.213 --> 00:04:56.499
and there's the pistil there, and these are the little things

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.218
called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give

00:05:00.218 --> 00:05:04.178
a fragrance, and plants actually communicate

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:09.572
with one another through their fragrances.

00:05:09.572 --> 00:05:11.940
I want to talk about something really ordinary,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.864
just ordinary sand.

00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:15.794
I became interested in sand about 10 years ago,

00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:18.355
when I first saw sand from Maui,

00:05:18.355 --> 00:05:21.502
and in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.

00:05:21.502 --> 00:05:24.533
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:27.444
Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.

00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:30.027
But when you look closer at this, look at what's there.

00:05:30.027 --> 00:05:33.529
It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there.

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.722
You have things like coral.

00:05:35.722 --> 00:05:39.256
You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine.

00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:41.452
You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit

00:05:41.452 --> 00:05:44.079
of a volcano there. You have tube worms.

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:48.805
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand.

00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:51.484
And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island,

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.850
a lot of the sand is made of biological material

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.847
because the reefs provide a place where all these

00:05:56.847 --> 00:06:00.737
microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,

00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:03.075
and when they die, their shells and their teeth

00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:05.417
and their bones break up and they make grains of sand,

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:08.387
things like coral and so forth.

00:06:08.387 --> 00:06:12.180
So here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.717
This is from Lahaina,

00:06:14.717 --> 00:06:16.447
and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually

00:06:16.447 --> 00:06:19.901
walking along millions of years of biological and geological history.

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:22.368
We don't realize it, but it's actually a record

00:06:22.368 --> 00:06:24.941
of that entire ecology.

00:06:24.941 --> 00:06:28.099
So here we see, for example, a sponge spicule,

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.685
two bits of coral here,

00:06:30.685 --> 00:06:34.535
that's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff.

00:06:34.535 --> 00:06:36.912
So when I first looked at this, I was -- I thought,

00:06:36.912 --> 00:06:38.661
gee, this is like a little treasure trove here.

00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.827
I couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:44.136
the little bits out and making photographs of them.

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:46.647
Here's what most of the sand in our world looks like.

00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:49.908
These are quartz crystals and feldspar,

00:06:49.908 --> 00:06:52.369
so most sand in the world on the mainland

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:56.119
is made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock.

00:06:56.119 --> 00:07:00.470
So mountains are built up, and they erode away by water

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.497
and rain and ice and so forth,

00:07:02.497 --> 00:07:03.803
and they become grains of sand.

00:07:03.803 --> 00:07:06.253
There's some sand that's really much more colorful.

00:07:06.253 --> 00:07:08.322
These are sand from near the Great Lakes,

00:07:08.337 --> 00:07:10.348
and you can see that it's filled with minerals

00:07:10.348 --> 00:07:13.840
like pink garnet and green epidote, all kinds of amazing stuff,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.224
and if you look at different sands from different places,

00:07:16.224 --> 00:07:19.475
every single beach, every single place you look at sand,

00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:24.507
it's different. Here's from Big Sur, like they're little jewels.

00:07:24.507 --> 00:07:26.996
There are places in Africa where they do the mining

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:31.165
of jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers have

00:07:31.165 --> 00:07:33.464
the sand go down to the ocean, and it's like literally looking

00:07:33.464 --> 00:07:36.327
at tiny jewels through the microscope.

00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:39.504
So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.

00:07:39.504 --> 00:07:42.686
Every single grain is different. There are no two grains

00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:44.386
of sand alike in the world.

00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:47.918
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.

00:07:47.918 --> 00:07:51.646
They're like a snapshot in time.

00:07:51.646 --> 00:07:55.069
Now sand is not only on Earth, but sand is

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:57.667
ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer space

00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:01.331
is filled with sand, and that sand comes together

00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:04.528
to make our planets and the Moon.

00:08:04.528 --> 00:08:06.110
And you can see those in micrometeorites.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.653
This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me,

00:08:08.653 --> 00:08:11.747
and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.

00:08:11.747 --> 00:08:14.493
And they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:18.917
tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in --

00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:20.832
the planets and the Moon.

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:24.076
So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand,

00:08:24.076 --> 00:08:26.339
so they sent me sand from all the different landings

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.817
of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.

00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:34.457
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.

00:08:34.457 --> 00:08:37.424
This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.

00:08:37.424 --> 00:08:41.207
I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.

00:08:41.207 --> 00:08:43.870
Now, the way my microscopes work is, normally

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.336
in a microscope you can see very little at one time,

00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:49.283
so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope,

00:08:49.283 --> 00:08:53.074
keep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.548
that puts all those pictures together

00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:58.670
into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.905
and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,

00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:04.607
is a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.

00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:07.160
So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.528
Now something's interesting here. This looks very different

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:11.906
than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've

00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:15.706
seen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me. (Laughter)

00:09:15.706 --> 00:09:18.664
Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused

00:09:18.664 --> 00:09:21.003
by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.

00:09:21.003 --> 00:09:23.360
Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.576
come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon

00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:29.176
is covered with powder now, because for four billion years

00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:31.970
it's been bombarded by micrometeorites,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.360
and when micrometeorites come in at about

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.370
20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.280
And you can see here that that is --

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.874
that's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:45.420
little clump of little sand grains together.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.599
This is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.

00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:49.759
And that's called a ring agglutinate.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:53.703
And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that,

00:09:53.703 --> 00:09:57.160
and you'd never find that on Earth.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.413
Most of the sand on the Moon,

00:10:00.413 --> 00:10:02.112
especially -- and you know when you look at the Moon,

00:10:02.112 --> 00:10:04.472
there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas

00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:08.613
are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows,

00:10:08.613 --> 00:10:11.278
and that's what this sand looks like, very similar

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:15.041
to the sand that you would see in Haleakala.

00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:18.464
Other sands, when these micrometeorites come in,

00:10:18.464 --> 00:10:21.553
they vaporize and they make these fountains,

00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:24.176
these microscopic fountains that go up into the --

00:10:24.176 --> 00:10:26.540
I was going to say "up into the air," but there is no air --

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.760
goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.304
are formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time

00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:36.689
they fall down back to the surface of the Moon,

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:39.585
they have these beautiful colored glass spherules.

00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:41.130
And these are actually microscopic;

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.098
you need a microscope to see these.

00:10:44.098 --> 00:10:47.535
Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon,

00:10:47.535 --> 00:10:49.689
and you can see that the entire

00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:52.172
crystal structure is still there.

00:10:52.172 --> 00:10:54.320
This grain of sand is probably about

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.602
three and a half or four billion years old,

00:10:56.602 --> 00:10:58.793
and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand

00:10:58.793 --> 00:11:02.812
on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling,

00:11:02.812 --> 00:11:06.062
air, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion

00:11:06.062 --> 00:11:10.669
down here by the Sun, has these solar storms,

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:15.432
and that's erosion by solar radiation.

00:11:15.432 --> 00:11:18.018
So what I've been trying to tell you today is

00:11:18.018 --> 00:11:21.587
things even as ordinary as a grain of sand

00:11:21.587 --> 00:11:24.562
can be truly extraordinary if you look closely

00:11:24.562 --> 00:11:27.867
and if you look from a different and a new point of view.

00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:32.242
I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said,

00:11:32.242 --> 00:11:34.784
"To see a world in a grain of sand

00:11:34.784 --> 00:11:37.538
and a heaven in a wild flower,

00:11:37.538 --> 00:11:39.871
hold infinity in the palm of your hand,

00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:42.204
and eternity in an hour."

00:11:42.204 --> 00:11:45.933
Thank you. (Applause)
