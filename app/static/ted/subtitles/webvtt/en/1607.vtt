00:00:00.944 --> 00:00:03.566
So, people want a lot of things out of life,

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:07.461
but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.

00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:10.789
Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.061
towards which all other things aim.

00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:19.581
According to this view, the reason we want a big house

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:22.214
or a nice car

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:24.294
or a good job

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:26.742
isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:29.260
It's that we expect them to bring us

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.717
happiness.

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:33.349
Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.376
a lot of the things that we want. We're richer.

00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:38.453
We live longer. We have access to technology

00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:40.620
that would have seemed like science fiction

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.861
just a few years ago.

00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.285
The paradox of happiness is that even though the

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:48.187
objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically,

00:00:48.187 --> 00:00:51.751
we haven't actually gotten any happier.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.670
Maybe because these conventional notions of progress

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.146
haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness,

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:59.276
there's been an increased interest in recent years

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.798
in happiness itself.

00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:03.833
People have been debating the causes of happiness

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.432
for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years,

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:09.889
but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:11.948
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think

00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:15.160
the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.694
In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:20.495
in research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:23.607
about its demographics, how things like income

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:27.033
and education, gender and marriage relate to it.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.255
But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.194
factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:34.631
Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less,

00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:37.343
or to graduate from college instead of dropping out,

00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:40.104
but the differences in happiness tend to be small.

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:43.939
Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.636
I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet,

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:49.348
but I think something that has the potential to be an answer

00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:52.069
is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.513
the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.508
It certainly seems that we're going about our lives,

00:01:56.508 --> 00:02:00.443
that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about,

00:02:00.443 --> 00:02:02.795
have a big influence on our happiness, and yet

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:05.028
these are the very factors that have been very difficult,

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:07.415
in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.

00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:10.476
A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:13.055
moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:15.797
on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never

00:02:15.797 --> 00:02:18.588
been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org,

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:22.874
it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.

00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:25.663
How does this work? Basically, I send people signals

00:02:25.663 --> 00:02:28.103
at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them

00:02:28.103 --> 00:02:30.391
a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience

00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:32.925
at the instant just before the signal.

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:35.732
The idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:38.356
goes up and down over the course of the day,

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:40.084
minute to minute in some cases,

00:02:40.084 --> 00:02:42.226
and try to understand how what people are doing,

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:45.069
who they're with, what they're thinking about, and all

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.245
the other factors that describe our day, how those might

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:49.956
relate to those changes in happiness, we might be able

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:51.502
to discover some of the things that really have

00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:53.807
a big influence on happiness.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:56.113
We've been fortunate with this project to collect

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:58.971
quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think

00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:00.830
has ever been collected before,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.051
over 650,000 real-time reports

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:06.930
from over 15,000 people.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.039
And it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group,

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.526
people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s,

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.454
a wide range of incomes, education levels,

00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:19.517
people who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.

00:03:19.517 --> 00:03:21.781
They collectively represent every one of

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:26.642
86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.

00:03:26.642 --> 00:03:29.544
What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:31.673
is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been

00:03:31.673 --> 00:03:34.856
investigating, and that's mind-wandering.

00:03:34.856 --> 00:03:37.256
As human beings, we have this unique ability

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:40.191
to have our minds stray away from the present.

00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:42.116
This guy is sitting here working on his computer,

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:43.170
and yet he could be thinking about

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.859
the vacation he had last month,

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.822
wondering what he's going to have for dinner.

00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:51.655
Maybe he's worried that he's going bald. (Laughter)

00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:54.440
This ability to focus our attention on something other

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.695
than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:02.189
and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.587
And yet it's not clear what the relationship is

00:04:04.587 --> 00:04:08.503
between our use of this ability and our happiness.

00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:10.361
You've probably heard people suggest that you should

00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:12.852
stay focused on the present. "Be here now,"

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.337
you've probably heard a hundred times.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.018
Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely

00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:20.529
immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.363
Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind-wandering

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:24.093
is a bad thing.

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:26.512
On the other hand, when our minds wander,

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:29.173
they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality

00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:32.561
in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.

00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:34.374
Since we know people want to be happy, maybe

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:37.065
when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place

00:04:37.065 --> 00:04:39.298
that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense.

00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:40.796
In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind

00:04:40.796 --> 00:04:45.222
allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:47.233
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:49.910
resolve this debate with some data, and in particular

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.398
I'd like to present some data to you from three questions

00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:54.608
that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from

00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:57.260
sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.290
There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.165
How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad

00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:07.304
to very good? Second, an activity question:

00:05:07.304 --> 00:05:09.832
What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities

00:05:09.832 --> 00:05:13.057
including things like eating and working and watching TV?

00:05:13.057 --> 00:05:16.645
And finally a mind-wandering question:

00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:19.287
Are you thinking about something other

00:05:19.287 --> 00:05:21.910
than what you're currently doing?

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.352
People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task --

00:05:25.352 --> 00:05:27.881
or yes -- I am thinking about something else --

00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.337
and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,

00:05:30.337 --> 00:05:31.763
neutral or unpleasant.

00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:37.222
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.

00:05:37.222 --> 00:05:39.687
So what did we find?

00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:41.986
This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis,

00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:44.226
and you can see that bar there representing how happy

00:05:44.226 --> 00:05:45.559
people are when they're focused on the present,

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:47.482
when they're not mind-wandering.

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:51.201
As it turns out, people are substantially less happy

00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:55.937
when their minds are wandering than when they're not.

00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:58.539
Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure,

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.961
on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:02.629
but surely when their minds are straying away

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.748
from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with,

00:06:04.748 --> 00:06:08.512
at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.

00:06:08.512 --> 00:06:11.211
Nope. As it turns out,

00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.903
people are less happy when they're mind-wandering

00:06:12.903 --> 00:06:15.929
no matter what they're doing. For example,

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:18.106
people don't really like commuting to work very much.

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:20.866
It's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:23.400
they are substantially happier when they're focused

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.762
only on their commute than when their mind is going

00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:28.809
off to something else.

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:30.591
It's amazing.

00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:34.436
So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason,

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.834
a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,

00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:39.690
we often think about unpleasant things, and they are

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.297
enormously less happy when they do that,

00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:45.962
our worries, our anxieties, our regrets,

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:48.922
and yet even when people are thinking about something

00:06:48.922 --> 00:06:51.786
neutral, they're still considerably less happy

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.763
than when they're not mind-wandering at all.

00:06:53.763 --> 00:06:56.598
Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant,

00:06:56.598 --> 00:06:58.802
they're actually just slightly less happy

00:06:58.802 --> 00:07:02.059
than when they aren't mind-wandering.

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:04.121
If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like

00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:07.154
having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars

00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:13.305
or one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play. (Laughter)

00:07:13.305 --> 00:07:15.978
So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps,

00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:18.790
that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.557
I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.

00:07:21.557 --> 00:07:24.342
It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case

00:07:24.342 --> 00:07:26.796
that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.

00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:29.165
Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever

00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:32.254
disentangle these two possibilites?

00:07:32.254 --> 00:07:34.598
Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact

00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:37.555
you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not

00:07:37.555 --> 00:07:41.552
backward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect.

00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:44.982
We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person,

00:07:44.982 --> 00:07:48.178
and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering

00:07:48.178 --> 00:07:50.671
tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.854
tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight

00:07:52.854 --> 00:07:55.015
into the causal direction.

00:07:55.015 --> 00:07:58.224
As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between

00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:01.909
mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:05.628
consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.

00:08:05.628 --> 00:08:08.788
In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.797
now and mind-wandering a short time later.

00:08:11.797 --> 00:08:14.119
In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:19.959
an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:22.183
A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering

00:08:22.183 --> 00:08:24.446
to a slot machine you'd never want to play.

00:08:24.446 --> 00:08:26.750
Well, how often do people's minds wander?

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.207
Turns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.

00:08:31.207 --> 00:08:33.901
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking

00:08:33.901 --> 00:08:37.308
about something other than what they're currently doing.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.746
How does that depend on what people are doing?

00:08:39.746 --> 00:08:42.499
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities

00:08:42.499 --> 00:08:46.498
ranging from a high of 65 percent — (Laughter) —

00:08:46.498 --> 00:08:49.010
when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.911
to 50 percent when they're working,

00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:54.954
to 40 percent when they're exercising,

00:08:54.954 --> 00:08:56.873
all the way down to this one short bar on the right

00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:58.861
that I think some of you are probably laughing at.

00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:01.251
Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering

00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:05.822
when they're having sex. (Laughter)

00:09:05.822 --> 00:09:08.755
But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph,

00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:11.803
and that is, basically with one exception,

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:13.981
no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering

00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:17.659
at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think,

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:20.490
that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.223
It pervades basically everything that we do.

00:09:24.223 --> 00:09:27.419
In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering,

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:29.469
a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:31.125
in the equation for happiness.

00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:33.140
My hope is that over time, by tracking people's

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.188
moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences

00:09:36.188 --> 00:09:39.590
in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.520
and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.217
will help us create a future that's not only richer

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:48.079
and healthier, but happier as well.

00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:51.303
Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:51.303 --> 00:09:55.303
(Applause)
