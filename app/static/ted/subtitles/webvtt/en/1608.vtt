00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:02.970
Two years ago, after having served four years

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.630
in the United States Marine Corps

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.990
and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.939
I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.176
of veterans and medical professionals

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:14.609
in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.135
three days after the earthquake.

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:18.298
We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go,

00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:21.829
the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.835
we realized something. Military veterans

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.848
are very, very good at disaster response.

00:00:27.848 --> 00:00:30.323
And coming home, my cofounder and I,

00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:33.586
we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.

00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:36.592
The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.

00:00:36.592 --> 00:00:39.906
It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology,

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:42.287
and it's not using the best people.

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:44.492
The second problem that we became aware of

00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:46.970
was a very inadequate veteran reintegration,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.115
and this is a topic that is front page news right now

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.276
as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:54.426
and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:56.306
And we sat here and we looked at these two problems,

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.040
and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.502
These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that?

00:01:02.502 --> 00:01:05.572
Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity

00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:07.973
for service for the veterans coming home.

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:10.473
Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want

00:01:10.473 --> 00:01:12.713
to continue their service when they take off their uniform.

00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:16.383
And we can use veterans to improve disaster response.

00:01:16.383 --> 00:01:19.446
Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010,

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.455
we responded to the tsunami in Chile,

00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:26.349
the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:28.981
But it was earlier this year, when one of our

00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:33.086
original members caused us to shift focus in the organization.

00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:35.831
This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me.

00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:38.157
We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:42.091
Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile.

00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:45.977
Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.

00:01:45.977 --> 00:01:48.707
This was a tragedy, but it really forced us

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:51.985
to refocus what it is that we were doing.

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:55.449
You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.057
in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself

00:01:58.057 --> 00:02:01.206
because of what he lost when he came home.

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:04.671
He lost purpose. He lost his community.

00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:09.106
And perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth.

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:12.280
And so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.594
from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems --

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:19.834
in the initial iteration of our organization,

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:22.707
we were a disaster response organization that was using

00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:24.946
veteran service. We had a lot of success,

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:29.159
and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.568
But after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly,

00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:35.044
now moving forward, we see ourselves

00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:39.937
as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.

00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:42.547
Because we think that we can give that purpose

00:02:42.547 --> 00:02:45.728
and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:47.959
And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.660
Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.069
Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.545
who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.

00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:00.109
He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.781
They send him to Iraq.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.508
Every day he leaves the wire with a mission.

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:08.112
That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.

00:03:08.112 --> 00:03:10.201
It's to keep the men around him alive.

00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:12.387
It's to pacify the village that he works in.

00:03:12.387 --> 00:03:16.051
He's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri,

00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:18.649
maybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job,

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:21.013
but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose.

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:23.153
You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri

00:03:23.153 --> 00:03:25.513
after a tornado, he regains that.

00:03:25.513 --> 00:03:28.562
Going back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:30.507
in Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army,

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:33.215
the Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq.

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:36.122
Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:39.283
He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:41.466
He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:44.165
They've eaten together. They've bled together.

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:46.563
He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.

00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:49.623
He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off.

00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:50.962
He doesn't have that community anymore.

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:54.196
But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri,

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:56.687
they get that sense of community back.

00:03:56.687 --> 00:03:59.126
Again, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates

00:03:59.126 --> 00:04:00.782
high school in Kansas City.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.498
He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.

00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:04.037
They send him to Iraq.

00:04:04.037 --> 00:04:08.392
They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.

00:04:08.392 --> 00:04:10.810
He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.423
in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City.

00:04:13.423 --> 00:04:15.696
He doesn't have that same self-worth.

00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:18.308
But you send him to Joplin after a tornado,

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:20.128
and somebody once again is walking up to him

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:22.502
and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service,

00:04:22.502 --> 00:04:24.819
now they have self-worth again.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.140
I think it's very important, because right now

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.903
somebody needs to step up,

00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:30.854
and this generation of veterans has the opportunity

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.139
to do that if they are given the chance.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.663
Thank you very much. (Applause)
