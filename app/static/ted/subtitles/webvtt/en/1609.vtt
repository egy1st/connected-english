00:00:00.777 --> 00:00:05.193
Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.

00:00:05.193 --> 00:00:10.561
I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer,

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.258
and that means that I spend a good amount of time

00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:18.632
designing and building new pieces of technology,

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:23.172
and more specifically designing and building electronics.

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:27.530
And what I've found is that the process of designing

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.124
and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:37.965
So it's a really slow process, it's really expensive,

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.405
and the outcome of that process,

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:42.821
namely electronic circuit boards,

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:45.850
are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.490
So they're really small, generally, they're square

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.855
and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them

00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:58.168
just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I

00:00:58.168 --> 00:01:02.156
have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:06.817
the process and the outcome of designing electronics.

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:10.905
And so what if you could design and build electronics

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:14.945
like this? So what if you could do it extremely quickly,

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:20.610
extremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.874
really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally?

00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:29.196
Wouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:31.644
all sorts of new possibilities?

00:01:31.644 --> 00:01:35.028
I'm going to share with you two projects that are

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:39.737
investigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:45.474
(Video) Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.

00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:49.306
A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC.

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:52.180
Sticker templates.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.740
Speed x 4.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.408
Making a switch.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.896
Music: DJ Shadow.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.492
Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:03:00.234
Sketching an interface.

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:12.067
(Music)

00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:17.805
(Laughter)

00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:23.511
(Applause)

00:03:23.511 --> 00:03:26.508
Pretty cool, huh? We think so.

00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:30.292
So now that we developed these tools

00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:34.030
and found these materials that let us do these things,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.198
we started to realize that, essentially, anything

00:03:38.198 --> 00:03:40.582
that we can do with paper, anything that we can do

00:03:40.582 --> 00:03:42.997
with a piece of paper and a pen

00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:45.414
we can now do with electronics.

00:03:45.414 --> 00:03:47.782
So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a

00:03:47.782 --> 00:03:51.342
deeper exploration of that possibility.

00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:55.206
And I'll kind of let it speak for itself.

00:03:55.206 --> 00:05:25.652
(Music)

00:05:25.652 --> 00:05:31.020
(Applause)

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.820
So the next step for us in this process

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.548
is now to find a way to let all of you

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:42.444
build things like this,

00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:45.524
and so the way that we're approaching that is by

00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:48.131
teaching workshops to people where we explain

00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:51.244
how they can use these kinds of tools, and then also

00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:54.986
working to get the tools and the materials and techniques

00:05:54.986 --> 00:05:58.736
out into the real world in a variety of ways.

00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:02.320
And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.114
and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.

00:06:06.114 --> 00:06:10.114
So thank you very much. (Applause)
