WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
How about this word?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here, I'll show it to you.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's little discrete --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And those bits are words.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
like lexicographical.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Lexicographical has this great pattern:

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Right? It's a fun word to say,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I get to say it a lot.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But people think that my job is to let the good words

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and keep the bad words out.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And for another, deciding what words are good

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and what words are bad is actually not very easy.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Well, I blame the Queen.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Why do I blame the Queen?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But secondly, I blame the Queen because

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
dictionaries have really not changed.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
in American dictionaries since 1965.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So he's really responsible for a lot of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
what we consider modern in dictionaries today.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
When a guy who looks like that, in that hat,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is the face of modernity, you have a problem.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
There'd be virtually no learning curve.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Computers! What about computers?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The thing about computers is, I love computers.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But computers don't do much else other than

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
They don't change the end result.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Because what a dictionary is,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The design has not changed.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Online dictionaries must be different.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
This is my favorite word, by the way.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Very useful word. So, look at that.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Right? Those little buttons,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I had them all expanded except for the date chart.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So there's not very much going on here.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
There's not a lot of clickiness.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And when you improve searchability,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- now, when you think about this,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
what we have here is a ham butt problem.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So she calls up mom, and she says,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So they call grandma, and grandma says,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
"My pan was too small!" (Laughter)

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We have a pan that's too small!

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and they don't find a place on the map,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
they think, "This map sucks!"

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
"This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, you can't get a smaller ham.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The English language is as big as it is.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So, if you have a ham butt problem,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and you're thinking about the ham butt problem,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
paper is the enemy of words.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Some of my best friends are books.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
No. There will still be paper dictionaries.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
artificial constraints lead to

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What if biologists could only study animals

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that made people go, "Aww." Right?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and not very much about much else.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And I think this is a problem.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I think we should study all the words,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
from very humble parts.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Lexicography is really more about material science.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We are studying the tolerances of the materials

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that you use to build the structure of your expression:

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
They're just the right tools for the job.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
You know, anybody who's read a children's book

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
knows that love makes things real.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
If you love a word, it becomes real.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
about control and more about description,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
then we can think of the English language

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
as being this beautiful mobile.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
is touched, any time you touch a word,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
you verb it, you make the mobile move.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and that new position can be just as beautiful.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the problem with being a traffic cop is

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
or the cars get confused. Right?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You can ask for help!

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Library of Congress: 17 million books,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
of which half are in English.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
If only one out of every 10 of those books

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
had a word that's not in the dictionary in it,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And I find an un-dictionaried word --

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
a word like "un-dictionaried," for example --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
it would be an entire other OED.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs --

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
than I do Newsweek or Time.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
There's a lot going on there.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And I'm not even talking about polysemy,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
which is the greedy habit some words have of taking

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
more than one meaning for themselves.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and there's one numbered definition in the OED.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Do you know what that says to me?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
That's a lexicographical cop out,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So, we have all these words, and we really need help!

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And the thing is, we could ask for help --

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
asking for help's not that hard.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and this is more of a visual explanation.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
these bright spots are what we know about,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And we don't even know the shape of the language.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
but there's no California!

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We're missing California from American English.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So again, lexicography is not rocket science.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But even if it were, rocket science is being done

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
It can't be that hard to find some words!

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So, enough scientists in other disciplines

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
can upload information about their bird sightings.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And then, ornithologists can go

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and help track populations, migrations, etc.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
He's a director of an electroplating company.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
He's found more than 140 comets.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and that's how he found them.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
If we can find comets without a telescope,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
shouldn't we be able to find words?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And the Internet is great for collecting words,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because the Internet's full of collectors.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
They show the word, but they don't show any context.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Where did it come from? Who said it?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
What newspaper was it in? What book?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So a word without its source is like a cut flower.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It dies too fast.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So, this whole time I've been saying,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
They use it synecdochically.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically"

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something --

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
like the dictionary is a part of the language,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
then you're using it synecdochically.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
We can put in all the meanings.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language --

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
we can make it be the whole language.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
This is what dictionaries used to look like.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It wasn't really what people needed.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And the thing is, if we can put in all the words,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
we can really describe the language like scientists.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Thank you very much for your kind attention.
