00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:02.360
I would like to talk to you about

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.992
a very special group of animals.

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:08.993
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:13.601
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.613
When you see a vulture like this, the first thing

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:20.589
that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly,

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.548
greedy creatures that are just after your flesh,

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:30.875
associated with politicians. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.650
I want to change that perception. I want to change

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.360
those feelings you have for these birds, because

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.410
they need our sympathy. They really do. (Laughter)

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.959
And I'll tell you why.

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:44.551
First of all, why do they have such a bad press?

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:48.538
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:51.730
on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.570
and he said, "These are disgusting birds

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.631
with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity." (Laughter)

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:05.201
You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin. (Laughter)

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:08.062
You know, he changed his mind when he came back,

00:01:08.062 --> 00:01:09.378
and I'll tell you why.

00:01:09.378 --> 00:01:12.669
They've also be associated with Disney — (Laughter) —

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:17.461
personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters.

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:21.037
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press

00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:28.156
— (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) —

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:31.508
these are the attributes that they associated

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:34.820
the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.372
I want to challenge that. Do you know why?

00:01:37.372 --> 00:01:40.092
Because MPs

00:01:40.092 --> 00:01:44.963
do not keep the environment clean. (Laughter)

00:01:44.963 --> 00:01:49.925
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:56.274
They are hardly monogamous. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:56.274 --> 00:02:00.037
They are far from being extinct. (Laughter)

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:06.938
And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking. (Applause) (Laughter)

00:02:06.938 --> 00:02:10.889
So there's two types of vultures in this planet.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.162
There are the New World vultures that are mainly found

00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:16.103
in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras,

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:18.402
and then the Old World vultures, where we have

00:02:18.402 --> 00:02:21.890
16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.977
a high risk of extinction.

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:28.394
So why are vultures important? First of all,

00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:31.875
they provide vital ecological services. They clean up.

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:34.169
They're our natural garbage collectors.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.802
They clean up carcasses right to the bone.

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:40.440
They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.113
that would otherwise spread and cause

00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:47.197
huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals.

00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:49.936
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.939
no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.508
to decompose, and this has huge ramifications

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.403
for the spread of diseases.

00:02:58.403 --> 00:03:01.819
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.063
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.

00:03:05.063 --> 00:03:08.163
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:11.251
and the motherhood, and together with the cobra,

00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:15.365
symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt.

00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:19.173
In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god,

00:03:19.173 --> 00:03:24.445
and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita

00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:27.102
from the 10-headed demon Ravana.

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.533
In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:33.245
sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:36.309
to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them,

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:40.497
so these vultures provide a natural disposal system.

00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:42.964
So what is the problem with vultures?

00:03:42.964 --> 00:03:45.835
We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya,

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:49.822
of which six are highly threatened with extinction.

00:03:49.822 --> 00:03:52.441
The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.033
that they're getting poisoned is because there's

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:57.721
human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities

00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:01.073
are using this poison to target predators,

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:04.708
and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this.

00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:07.372
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan,

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:10.853
four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered,

00:04:10.853 --> 00:04:14.204
which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct,

00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:17.514
and the reason is because they are falling prey

00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:19.962
by consuming livestock that has been treated

00:04:19.962 --> 00:04:22.634
with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac.

00:04:22.634 --> 00:04:25.731
This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India,

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:28.250
and they have taken a stand.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.570
Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.371
in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites,

00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:36.552
and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:39.194
of rabies. The number of cases of rabies

00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:41.922
has increased tremendously in India.

00:04:41.922 --> 00:04:45.367
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa:

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:48.603
353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana.

00:04:48.603 --> 00:04:50.883
I am not against wind energy, but we need to work

00:04:50.883 --> 00:04:54.092
with the governments, because wind turbines

00:04:54.092 --> 00:04:56.692
do this to birds. They slice them in half.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:59.526
They are bird-blending machines.

00:04:59.526 --> 00:05:02.204
In West Africa, there's a horrific trade

00:05:02.204 --> 00:05:07.575
of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market.

00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:10.407
So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research

00:05:10.407 --> 00:05:13.687
on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them.

00:05:13.687 --> 00:05:16.063
We're trying to determine their basic ecology,

00:05:16.063 --> 00:05:18.502
and see where they go.

00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:20.543
We can see that they travel different countries, so

00:05:20.543 --> 00:05:23.839
if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.546
We need to work with governments in regional levels.

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:29.482
We're working with local communities.

00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:32.624
We're talking to them about appreciating vultures,

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.179
about the need from within to appreciate these

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:38.216
wonderful creatures and the services that they provide.

00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:41.229
How can you help? You can become active,

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.952
make noise. You can write a letter to your government

00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:46.262
and tell them that we need to focus on these very

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.440
misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.056
to spread the word. Spread the word.

00:05:52.056 --> 00:05:54.400
When you walk out of this room, you will be informed

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.200
about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.361
to your neighbors about vultures.

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.424
They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:05.453
he changed his mind because he watched them fly

00:06:05.453 --> 00:06:08.718
effortlessly without energy in the skies.

00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:11.597
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer

00:06:11.597 --> 00:06:14.182
without these wonderful species.

00:06:14.182 --> 00:06:18.182
Thank you very much. (Applause)
