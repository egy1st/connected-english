00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.059
So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:06.068
and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:08.621
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable

00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:12.890
as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.413
at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:18.959
of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:22.148
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.

00:00:22.148 --> 00:00:25.332
So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says,

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:28.381
"Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can

00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:32.115
just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:36.026
And I sat, and I was like, "Man, I would buy that, eh?"

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:39.561
So I went home, and I did a little research,

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.993
and I found some very shocking statistics.

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:46.010
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.011
do not have proper access to water and sanitation.

00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.134
Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa,

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.901
and five million of them are in South Africa.

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.441
Various diseases thrive in this environment,

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:59.788
the most drastic of which is called trachoma.

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:02.589
Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.898
getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:08.582
can leave you permanently blind.

00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:12.315
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind

00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:15.060
each and every year. The shocking part about it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.757
is that to avoid being infected with trachoma,

00:01:17.757 --> 00:01:19.630
all you have to do is wash your face:

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.443
no medicine, no pills, no injections.

00:01:22.443 --> 00:01:25.346
So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself,

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:27.698
"Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself

00:01:27.698 --> 00:01:30.411
and the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need

00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:33.051
to do it to try to save the world." (Laughter)

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:38.004
So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone --

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:40.859
I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much,

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.804
except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe —

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:46.845
I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions,

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:50.582
creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities --

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:52.110
I did high school science --

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.848
and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper,

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:59.220
and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.709
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.458
Now we need to get this thing into practice.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:08.454
Fast forward four years later, after having written

00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:11.038
a 40-page business plan on the cell phone,

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:13.137
having written my patent on the cell phone,

00:02:13.137 --> 00:02:15.830
I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.731
and — ("No more bathing!") —

00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:21.336
I can't say any more than that. (Laughter)

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:25.078
I had invented DryBath, the world's first

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.864
bath-substituting lotion.

00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:32.197
You literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.

00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:36.582
(Laughter)

00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:39.271
So after having tried to make it work in high school

00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:42.788
with the limited resources I had, I went to university,

00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:45.491
met a few people, got it into practice,

00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:48.543
and we have a fully functioning product that's ready

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.340
to go to the market. It's actually available on the market.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.266
So we learned a few lessons in commercializing

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:56.693
and making DryBath available.

00:02:56.693 --> 00:02:59.049
One of the things we learned was that poor communities

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.309
don't buy products in bulk.

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.786
They buy products on demand. A person in Alex

00:03:03.786 --> 00:03:06.180
doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.590
each day, even though it's more expensive.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.236
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:14.126
You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:17.813
And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath

00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:20.023
for five rand.

00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:22.715
After creating that model, we also learned a lot

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:24.456
in terms of implementing the product.

00:03:24.456 --> 00:03:26.774
We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:28.962
really want DryBath. (Laughter)

00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:31.145
At least once a week.

00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:33.757
Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters

00:03:33.757 --> 00:03:36.888
of water on average each time they skipped a bath,

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:39.823
and also we would save two hours a day for kids

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:42.889
who are in rural areas, two hours more for school,

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.673
two hours more for homework,

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:47.521
two hours more to just be a kid.

00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:50.168
After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down

00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:52.532
to our key value proposition,

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.775
which was cleanliness and convenience.

00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:57.407
DryBath is a rich man's convenience

00:03:57.407 --> 00:03:59.777
and a poor man's lifesaver.

00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:03.249
Having put the product into practice, we are actually now

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.293
on the verge of selling the product

00:04:05.293 --> 00:04:08.406
onto a multinational to take it to the retail market,

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:11.931
and one question I have for the audience today is,

00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:14.204
on the gravel roads of Limpopo,

00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:17.553
with an allowance of 50 rand a week,

00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:21.375
I came up with a way for the world not to bathe.

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:24.083
What's stopping you? (Applause)

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:27.029
I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:30.094
And another key thing that I learned a lot

00:04:30.094 --> 00:04:31.442
throughout this whole process,

00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:35.527
last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.

00:04:35.527 --> 00:04:38.396
I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur

00:04:38.396 --> 00:04:41.152
in the world, the first African to get that accolade,

00:04:41.152 --> 00:04:46.147
and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this

00:04:46.147 --> 00:04:49.783
just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you.

00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:51.965
(Applause.)
