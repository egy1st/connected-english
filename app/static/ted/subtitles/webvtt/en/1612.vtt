WEBVTT

00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:04.094
Let me tell you, it has been a fantastic month for deception.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:08.347
And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race. (Laughter)

00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:12.682
We have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism,

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:15.614
a young superstar writer whose book involves

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:18.919
so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves;

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.517
a New York Times exposé on fake book reviews.

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:22.926
It's been fantastic.

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:26.777
Now, of course, not all deception hits the news.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:30.456
Much of the deception is everyday. In fact, a lot of research

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:34.787
shows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.

00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:37.720
So it's about 6:30 now, suggests that most of us should have lied.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.620
Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.547
in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib,

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:46.098
or a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?

00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:48.002
All right, good. These are all the liars.

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.295
Make sure you pay attention to them. (Laughter)

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.441
No, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you.

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:56.293
The other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot,

00:00:56.293 --> 00:00:58.953
or you're lying to me about your lying, which is very,

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:03.003
very devious. (Laughter) This fits with a lot of the research,

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:06.357
which suggests that lying is very pervasive.

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:10.318
It's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality

00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:12.758
to what it means to be a human, the fact that we can

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:14.638
tell the truth or make something up,

00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:17.489
that has fascinated people throughout history.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.118
Here we have Diogenes with his lantern.

00:01:20.118 --> 00:01:22.798
Does anybody know what he was looking for?

00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:26.582
A single honest man, and he died without finding one

00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:29.599
back in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.976
who was really concerned with sincerity,

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:35.060
not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.214
but that you believed in what you were doing.

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:40.220
You believed in your principles.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.151
Now my first professional encounter with deception

00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:46.614
is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:50.413
I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-'90s.

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:53.239
Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.021
You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact,

00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:02.051
that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter)

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.588
Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception

00:02:05.588 --> 00:02:08.643
while doing my duty here in customs,

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.527
one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong,

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:13.279
and I'll tell you about some of that tonight.

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.353
But even since just 1995, '96, the way we communicate

00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:20.650
has been completely transformed. We email, we text,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.263
we skype, we Facebook. It's insane.

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:26.524
Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed,

00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:29.084
and of course that's had an impact on deception.

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.667
Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.043
we've been tracking and documenting.

00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:38.287
They're called the Butler, the Sock Puppet

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:40.368
and the Chinese Water Army.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.265
It sounds a little bit like a weird book,

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:44.398
but actually they're all new types of lies.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:47.443
Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one:

00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:50.556
"On my way." Anybody ever written, "On my way?"

00:02:50.556 --> 00:02:54.319
Then you've also lied. (Laughter)

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.516
We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way.

00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:01.279
Here's another one: "Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier.

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.244
My battery was dead." Your battery wasn't dead.

00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:05.120
You weren't in a dead zone.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.073
You just didn't want to respond to that person that time.

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:08.870
Here's the last one: You're talking to somebody,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.360
and you say, "Sorry, got work, gotta go."

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.157
But really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else.

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:17.573
Each of these is about a relationship,

00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:21.978
and this is a 24/7 connected world. Once you get my cell phone number,

00:03:21.978 --> 00:03:24.943
you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day.

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:27.312
And so these lies are being used by people

00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:30.138
to create a buffer, like the butler used to do,

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:33.545
between us and the connections to everybody else.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.252
But they're very special. They use ambiguity

00:03:35.252 --> 00:03:37.313
that comes from using technology. You don't know

00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:40.261
where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.752
And they're aimed at protecting the relationships.

00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:45.333
These aren't just people being jerks. These are people

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.709
that are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now,

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.133
or I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.533
Our relationship is still important.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:54.047
Now, the Sock Puppet, on the other hand,

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:56.390
is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.455
about ambiguity, per se. It's about identity.

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.457
Let me give you a very recent example,

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:02.971
as in, like, last week.

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.239
Here's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.259
Here's one of his bestselling books.

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.672
Here's a reviewer online, on Amazon.

00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:14.329
My favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is,

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.137
"Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."

00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:19.540
And of course, you might suspect

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.167
that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:26.854
He wrote very, very positive reviews about himself. Surprise, surprise.

00:04:26.854 --> 00:04:30.114
Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.

00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:33.281
Walt Whitman also did this back in the day,

00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:36.336
before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet

00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:39.104
becomes interesting when we get to scale,

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:41.622
which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army.

00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:44.058
Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people

00:04:44.058 --> 00:04:47.106
in China that are paid small amounts of money

00:04:47.106 --> 00:04:50.140
to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.699
propaganda. The government hires these people,

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.327
companies hire them, all over the place.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:58.944
In North America, we call this Astroturfing,

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:02.382
and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.

00:05:02.382 --> 00:05:05.609
We see this especially with product reviews, book reviews,

00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:10.404
everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not.

00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:14.322
Now, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception,

00:05:14.322 --> 00:05:17.059
you might think, wow, the Internet is really making us

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:20.268
a deceptive species, especially when you think about

00:05:20.268 --> 00:05:24.870
the Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.608
But actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.

00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:32.857
Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms,

00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:34.756
which I'm sure none of you have been in.

00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:37.085
I can assure you there's deception there.

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:39.794
And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you

00:05:39.794 --> 00:05:43.022
about getting the 43 million out of the country. (Laughter)

00:05:43.022 --> 00:05:44.702
Let's forget about that guy, too.

00:05:44.702 --> 00:05:47.646
Let's focus on the conversations between our friends

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.793
and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones.

00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:52.201
Those are the conversations that really matter.

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:56.441
What does technology do to deception with those folks?

00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:59.516
Here's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:02.887
are called diary studies, in which we ask people to record

00:06:02.887 --> 00:06:06.453
all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days,

00:06:06.453 --> 00:06:09.558
and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place

00:06:09.558 --> 00:06:12.506
per conversation within a medium, and the finding

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:15.030
that we get that surprises people the most is that email

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.309
is the most honest of those three media.

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:20.710
And it really throws people for a loop because we think,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.446
well, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:28.750
The phone, in contrast, the most lies.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.696
Again and again and again we see the phone is the device

00:06:30.696 --> 00:06:35.414
that people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.

00:06:35.414 --> 00:06:39.389
This tends to be very different from what people expect.

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.613
What about résumés? We did a study in which we had

00:06:42.613 --> 00:06:45.157
people apply for a job, and they could apply for a job

00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:48.671
either with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn,

00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:51.493
which is a social networking site like Facebook,

00:06:51.493 --> 00:06:55.060
but for professionals -- involves the same information as a résumé.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.674
And what we found, to many people's surprise,

00:06:57.674 --> 00:07:00.469
was that those LinkedIn résumés were more honest

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:02.293
on the things that mattered to employers, like your

00:07:02.293 --> 00:07:06.444
responsibilities or your skills at your previous job.

00:07:06.444 --> 00:07:08.740
How about Facebook itself?

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.622
You know, we always think that hey, there are these

00:07:10.622 --> 00:07:12.751
idealized versions, people are just showing the best things

00:07:12.751 --> 00:07:15.407
that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times.

00:07:15.407 --> 00:07:18.475
My friends, no way they can be that cool and have good of a life.

00:07:18.475 --> 00:07:22.296
Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:26.514
They had four good friends of a person judge their personality.

00:07:26.514 --> 00:07:28.470
Then they had strangers, many strangers,

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.998
judge the person's personality just from Facebook,

00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:33.427
and what they found was those judgments of the personality

00:07:33.427 --> 00:07:35.936
were pretty much identical, highly correlated,

00:07:35.936 --> 00:07:40.309
meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality.

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:42.881
All right, well, what about online dating?

00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:44.381
I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:47.916
I'm sure you all have "friends" that have used online dating. (Laughter)

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:49.974
And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair

00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:53.004
when he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.

00:07:53.004 --> 00:07:56.140
Well, we were really interested in it, and so what we did

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.247
is we brought people, online daters, into the lab,

00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:00.727
and then we measured them. We got their height

00:08:00.727 --> 00:08:04.608
up against the wall, we put them on a scale, got their weight --

00:08:04.608 --> 00:08:08.503
ladies loved that -- and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age.

00:08:08.503 --> 00:08:12.814
And what we found was very, very interesting.

00:08:12.814 --> 00:08:16.743
Here's an example of the men and the height.

00:08:16.743 --> 00:08:19.213
Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.

00:08:19.213 --> 00:08:24.075
Along the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.

00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:27.151
That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it,

00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:28.705
they were telling exactly the truth.

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:31.818
Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.

00:08:31.818 --> 00:08:34.685
What it means is all the guys were lying about their height.

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:37.626
In fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch,

00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:43.902
what we say in the lab as "strong rounding up." (Laughter)

00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:48.405
You get to 5'8" and one tenth, and boom! 5'9".

00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:50.403
But what's really important here is, look at all those dots.

00:08:50.403 --> 00:08:52.969
They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found

00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:55.377
was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie

00:08:55.377 --> 00:08:58.972
on one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:01.996
One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date,

00:09:01.996 --> 00:09:05.597
a coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said,

00:09:05.597 --> 00:09:09.216
game over. Right? So people lied frequently, but they lied

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:12.685
subtly, not too much. They were constrained.

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.572
Well, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact

00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:20.207
that despite our intuitions, mine included,

00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:23.736
a lot of online communication, technologically-mediated

00:09:23.736 --> 00:09:27.764
communication, is more honest than face to face?

00:09:27.764 --> 00:09:30.253
That really is strange. How do we explain this?

00:09:30.253 --> 00:09:33.632
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.

00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:37.977
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:40.639
It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials,

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:44.620
hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.856
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception,

00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:51.972
really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell

00:09:51.972 --> 00:09:55.356
if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:58.548
That's really bad. Why is it so bad?

00:09:58.548 --> 00:10:01.078
Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.

00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:03.437
If I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on

00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:05.682
when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out

00:10:05.682 --> 00:10:08.612
if they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to?

00:10:08.612 --> 00:10:11.042
Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at

00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:13.770
is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.173
And you're not alone. Around the world, almost every culture,

00:10:16.173 --> 00:10:19.036
one of the top cues is eyes. But the research

00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:22.860
over the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.857
to deception, which blew me away, and it's one of

00:10:25.857 --> 00:10:28.212
the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer.

00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:30.642
The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.

00:10:30.642 --> 00:10:33.660
Some situations, yes -- high stakes, maybe their pupils dilate,

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.164
their pitch goes up, their body movements change a little bit,

00:10:37.164 --> 00:10:41.996
but not all the time, not for everybody, it's not reliable.

00:10:41.996 --> 00:10:45.374
Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me

00:10:45.374 --> 00:10:47.793
doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense,

00:10:47.793 --> 00:10:50.700
but one important finding is that we lie for a reason.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.067
We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:55.894
or for somebody else's gain.

00:10:55.894 --> 00:10:57.824
So there are some pathological liars, but they make up

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.337
a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason.

00:11:01.337 --> 00:11:02.968
Just because people can't see us doesn't mean

00:11:02.968 --> 00:11:05.239
we're going to necessarily lie.

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:06.792
But I think there's actually something much more

00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:10.066
interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:13.863
thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going

00:11:13.863 --> 00:11:17.002
way back in history to the origins of language.

00:11:17.002 --> 00:11:20.889
Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:24.057
between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago.

00:11:24.057 --> 00:11:26.673
A lot of humans have lived since then.

00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:29.096
We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves

00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:32.203
and saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about,

00:11:32.203 --> 00:11:34.721
but they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said,

00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:37.266
there's a lot of humans evolving speaking,

00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:40.072
about 100 billion people in fact.

00:11:40.072 --> 00:11:42.854
What's important though is that writing only emerged

00:11:42.854 --> 00:11:46.441
about 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that

00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:48.833
all the people before there was any writing,

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:54.419
every word that they ever said, every utterance

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:59.171
disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone.

00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:03.236
So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which

00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:09.153
there is no record. In fact, even the next big change

00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:11.621
to writing was only 500 years ago now,

00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:14.000
with the printing press, which is very recent in our past,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.242
and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II,

00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:21.626
so even the people of the last two millennia,

00:12:21.626 --> 00:12:26.658
most of the words they ever said -- poof! -- disappeared.

00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:30.249
Let's turn to now, the networked age.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:34.961
How many of you have recorded something today?

00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:38.138
Anybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word?

00:12:38.138 --> 00:12:42.364
It looks like almost every single person here recorded something.

00:12:42.364 --> 00:12:45.412
In this room, right now, we've probably recorded more

00:12:45.412 --> 00:12:49.954
than almost all of human pre-ancient history.

00:12:49.954 --> 00:12:53.184
That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period

00:12:53.184 --> 00:12:57.199
of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak

00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:59.900
in a way in which our words disappear, but we're in

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.803
an environment where we're recording everything.

00:13:02.803 --> 00:13:05.140
In fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.489
what we write that will be recorded, everything we do

00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:09.822
will be recorded.

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:14.278
What does that mean? What's the next big idea from that?

00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:18.528
Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing

00:13:18.528 --> 00:13:22.075
I have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at

00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:25.686
all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.

00:13:25.686 --> 00:13:29.934
I can look at lies that before were said and then gone.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:33.454
You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were

00:13:33.454 --> 00:13:36.957
talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review,

00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:39.661
they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.

00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:42.096
So one thing that we did, and I'll give you an example of

00:13:42.096 --> 00:13:44.591
looking at the language, is we paid people

00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:48.126
to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake.

00:13:48.126 --> 00:13:50.069
The person never was at the James Hotel.

00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:52.991
The other review is real. The person stayed there.

00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:56.518
Now, your task now is to decide

00:13:56.518 --> 00:14:00.591
which review is fake?

00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:04.777
I'll give you a moment to read through them.

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:07.064
But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point.

00:14:07.064 --> 00:14:11.295
Remember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand.

00:14:11.295 --> 00:14:15.865
All right, how many of you believe that A is the fake?

00:14:17.894 --> 00:14:20.036
All right. Very good. About half.

00:14:20.036 --> 00:14:23.651
And how many of you think that B is?

00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:26.180
All right. Slightly more for B.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.772
Excellent. Here's the answer.

00:14:28.772 --> 00:14:35.353
B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group. (Laughter)

00:14:35.353 --> 00:14:38.199
You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this,

00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:40.945
it's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits

00:14:40.945 --> 00:14:43.591
with the research, 54 percent. Maybe people here

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:47.361
in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out.

00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:50.049
Those cold, hard winters, I love it.

00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:53.103
All right, so why do I care about this?

00:14:53.103 --> 00:14:56.371
Well, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science

00:14:56.371 --> 00:14:59.603
is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze

00:14:59.603 --> 00:15:02.503
the linguistic traces of deception.

00:15:02.503 --> 00:15:04.336
Let me highlight a couple of things here

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:07.779
in the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think

00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:09.367
about narrative. They make up a story:

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:12.553
Who? And what happened? And that's what happened here.

00:15:12.553 --> 00:15:14.842
Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with

00:15:14.842 --> 00:15:19.607
and what they were doing. They also used the first person singular, I,

00:15:19.607 --> 00:15:22.076
way more than the people that actually stayed there.

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:26.772
They were inserting themselves into the hotel review,

00:15:26.772 --> 00:15:28.468
kind of trying to convince you they were there.

00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:32.483
In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there,

00:15:32.483 --> 00:15:34.915
their bodies actually entered the physical space,

00:15:34.915 --> 00:15:37.814
they talked a lot more about spatial information.

00:15:37.814 --> 00:15:40.331
They said how big the bathroom was, or they said,

00:15:40.331 --> 00:15:44.851
you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.

00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:49.012
Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.

00:15:49.012 --> 00:15:51.770
Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.061
than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.

00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:57.091
This isn't a deception-detection machine to tell

00:15:57.091 --> 00:15:59.592
if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:03.156
We believe that every lie now, every type of lie --

00:16:03.156 --> 00:16:06.943
fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews,

00:16:06.943 --> 00:16:09.857
your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging --

00:16:09.857 --> 00:16:11.362
those are all different lies. They're going to have

00:16:11.362 --> 00:16:14.221
different patterns of language. But because everything's

00:16:14.221 --> 00:16:18.910
recorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.903
Now, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful.

00:16:22.903 --> 00:16:24.990
It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.792
so much more about human thought and expression,

00:16:28.792 --> 00:16:33.190
about everything from love to attitudes,

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.150
because everything is being recorded now, but

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.554
what does it mean for the average citizen?

00:16:37.554 --> 00:16:40.356
What does it mean for us in our lives?

00:16:40.356 --> 00:16:44.029
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas,

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:47.717
I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.

00:16:47.717 --> 00:16:50.933
My outbox for email is massive,

00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:54.270
and I never look at it. I write all the time,

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.708
but I never look at my record, at my trace.

00:16:57.708 --> 00:16:59.275
And I think we're going to see a lot more of that,

00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:02.436
where we can reflect on who we are by looking at

00:17:02.436 --> 00:17:06.054
what we wrote, what we said, what we did.

00:17:06.054 --> 00:17:08.326
Now, if we bring it back to deception, there's a couple

00:17:08.326 --> 00:17:10.303
of take-away things here.

00:17:10.303 --> 00:17:14.791
First, lying online can be very dangerous, right?

00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:17.497
Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine,

00:17:17.497 --> 00:17:21.772
but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to,

00:17:21.772 --> 00:17:23.532
and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze

00:17:23.532 --> 00:17:24.986
with some computer algorithms.

00:17:24.986 --> 00:17:28.159
So by all means, go ahead and do that, that's good.

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:32.313
But when it comes to lying and what we want to do

00:17:32.313 --> 00:17:34.866
with our lives, I think we can go back to

00:17:34.866 --> 00:17:38.615
Diogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned

00:17:38.615 --> 00:17:41.447
about whether to lie or not to lie, and more concerned about

00:17:41.447 --> 00:17:44.732
being true to the self, and I think this is really important.

00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:48.915
Now, when you are about to say or do something,

00:17:48.915 --> 00:17:53.475
we can think, do I want this to be part of my legacy,

00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:56.188
part of my personal record?

00:17:56.188 --> 00:17:58.845
Because in the digital age we live in now,

00:17:58.845 --> 00:18:03.309
in the networked age, we are all leaving a record.

00:18:03.309 --> 00:18:05.004
Thank you so much for your time,

00:18:05.004 --> 00:18:09.451
and good luck with your record. (Applause)
