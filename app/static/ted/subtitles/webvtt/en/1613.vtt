00:00:01.018 --> 00:00:05.322
On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:09.785
that I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:14.292
that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of

00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:18.339
making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.604
This one is more than 400 years old.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:26.068
Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:30.364
and it was the imperfections that people cherished.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:38.436
Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:41.545
I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:46.029
takes another day or two to cool down, but raku

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:50.832
is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln

00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:55.387
up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees,

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:59.045
and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside,

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.863
you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off,

00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:04.450
and you reach in with these long metal tongs,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.935
you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:13.849
would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea,

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:17.081
and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.

00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:20.246
But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.911
a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust,

00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.935
which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail,

00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:31.847
and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.

00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:36.727
I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:41.825
I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:46.321
I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze,

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:50.625
but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke,

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:53.090
and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.363
like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful

00:01:56.363 --> 00:01:58.974
on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees

00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:03.053
to room temperature in the space of just a minute.

00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:09.004
Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.769
I find in so many things that tension between

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.204
what I can control and what I have to let go

00:02:16.204 --> 00:02:19.998
happens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show

00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:25.083
or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:29.057
When I sat down to write a book about creativity,

00:02:29.057 --> 00:02:31.541
I realized that the steps were reversed.

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:35.190
I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.794
immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists

00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:44.269
and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.581
to these stories, I realized that creativity

00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:52.909
grows out of everyday experiences

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.613
more often than you might think, including

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.533
letting go.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:03.323
It was supposed to break, but that's okay. (Laughter) (Laughs)

00:03:03.323 --> 00:03:06.272
That's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:09.677
and sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows

00:03:09.677 --> 00:03:12.454
from the broken places.

00:03:12.454 --> 00:03:15.101
The best way to learn about anything

00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:19.135
is through stories, and so I want to tell you a story

00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:24.317
about work and play and about four aspects of life

00:03:24.317 --> 00:03:26.713
that we need to embrace

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:30.781
in order for our own creativity to flourish.

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:32.797
The first embrace is something that we think,

00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:37.003
"Oh, this is very easy," but it's actually getting harder,

00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.998
and that's paying attention to the world around us.

00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:45.453
So many artists speak about needing to be open,

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:48.893
to embrace experience, and that's hard to do when

00:03:48.893 --> 00:03:52.511
you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that

00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:56.098
takes all of your focus.

00:03:56.098 --> 00:04:00.238
The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:04.843
in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar,

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:08.536
and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town.

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:11.408
Mira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.

00:04:11.408 --> 00:04:14.264
We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up

00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:17.520
in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.168
that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually,

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:24.720
was traveling folk theater that would come through the town

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.032
and I would go off and see these great battles

00:04:28.032 --> 00:04:31.448
of good and evil by two people in a school field

00:04:31.448 --> 00:04:33.984
with no props but with a lot of, you know,

00:04:33.984 --> 00:04:37.679
passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.473
You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana,

00:04:40.473 --> 00:04:43.968
the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:47.498
in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater,

00:04:47.498 --> 00:04:52.488
I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.

00:04:52.488 --> 00:04:54.395
Julie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?

00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:56.815
You can see the sort of break in the everyday.

00:04:56.815 --> 00:04:59.534
There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil,

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:05.067
and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:08.665
with thousands of other people watching this performance,

00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:11.615
but she was ready. She was ready to open up

00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:14.744
to what it sparked in her, and it led her,

00:05:14.744 --> 00:05:17.359
as she said, down this path to become

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.162
an award-winning filmmaker.

00:05:20.162 --> 00:05:22.983
So being open for that experience that might change you

00:05:22.983 --> 00:05:25.916
is the first thing we need to embrace.

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:31.695
Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work

00:05:31.695 --> 00:05:36.567
comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.

00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:40.221
The novelist Richard Ford speaks about

00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:44.263
a childhood challenge that continues to be something

00:05:44.263 --> 00:05:49.023
he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic.

00:05:49.023 --> 00:05:51.930
Richard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.762
through school not really reading more than the minimum,

00:05:55.762 --> 00:05:58.290
and still to this day can't read silently

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.138
much faster than I can read aloud,

00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:04.914
but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me

00:06:04.914 --> 00:06:08.059
because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:12.554
I was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly

00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:16.086
into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language

00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:18.898
and of sentences that are not just the cognitive

00:06:18.898 --> 00:06:22.011
aspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words,

00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:23.854
what words look like, where paragraphs break,

00:06:23.854 --> 00:06:26.881
where lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that

00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:29.819
I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:34.362
really slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences

00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:38.722
as I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities,

00:06:38.722 --> 00:06:41.986
which I think has helped me write sentences.

00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:46.066
JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize,

00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:51.218
says that dyslexia helped him write sentences.

00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:53.989
He had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:58.102
intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia.

00:06:58.102 --> 00:07:01.610
He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.674
in language.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:09.244
Artists also speak about how pushing up against

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:12.638
the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing

00:07:12.638 --> 00:07:15.986
into what they can't do, helps them focus

00:07:15.986 --> 00:07:19.225
on finding their own voice.

00:07:19.225 --> 00:07:23.370
The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.290
as a young artist, he thought he was a painter,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.569
and he lived in Florence after graduate school.

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:33.138
While he was there, he traveled to Madrid,

00:07:33.138 --> 00:07:35.852
where he went to the Prado to see this picture

00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:39.612
by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.

00:07:39.612 --> 00:07:44.716
It's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas,"

00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:46.925
and it's the picture of a little princess

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:50.612
and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over

00:07:50.612 --> 00:07:53.988
that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror,

00:07:53.988 --> 00:07:57.285
and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen

00:07:57.285 --> 00:08:00.690
of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.465
to look at the picture.

00:08:02.465 --> 00:08:07.532
As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.

00:08:07.532 --> 00:08:12.225
He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.629
and his palette in the other.

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.657
Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it,

00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:19.267
and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me,

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:23.262
and I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."

00:08:23.262 --> 00:08:25.514
And I thought, "I'm not going to be able to do that painting."

00:08:25.514 --> 00:08:28.715
I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch

00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:33.153
and painting squares out of randomness,

00:08:33.153 --> 00:08:35.171
and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped

00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:38.401
all my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around.

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:41.233
JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might

00:08:41.233 --> 00:08:44.841
have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy

00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:48.609
who'd been dead for 300 years, and realized,

00:08:48.609 --> 00:08:52.481
"I can't do that," and so Richard Serra went back

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:55.312
to his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work

00:08:55.312 --> 00:08:59.115
up to that point, and threw it in a river.

00:08:59.115 --> 00:09:03.051
Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment,

00:09:03.051 --> 00:09:06.577
but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City,

00:09:06.577 --> 00:09:09.491
and he put together a list of verbs

00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:12.779
— to roll, to crease, to fold —

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:15.475
more than a hundred of them, and as he said,

00:09:15.475 --> 00:09:17.512
he just started playing around. He did these things

00:09:17.512 --> 00:09:20.829
to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:24.627
and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing

00:09:24.627 --> 00:09:29.803
to rubber, and when he got to the direction "to lift,"

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:34.901
he created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.

00:09:34.901 --> 00:09:37.861
Richard Serra had to let go of painting

00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:41.301
in order to embark on this playful exploration

00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:44.571
that led him to the work that he's known for today:

00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:50.149
huge curves of steel that require our time and motion

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:53.886
to experience. In sculpture,

00:09:53.886 --> 00:09:57.157
Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.

00:09:57.157 --> 00:10:01.653
He makes us the subject of his art.

00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:05.589
So experience and challenge

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:09.249
and limitations are all things we need to embrace

00:10:09.249 --> 00:10:11.845
for creativity to flourish.

00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:15.405
There's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest.

00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:17.765
It's the embrace of loss,

00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:22.055
the oldest and most constant of human experiences.

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:24.878
In order to create, we have to stand in that space

00:10:24.878 --> 00:10:28.678
between what we see in the world and what we hope for,

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:33.485
looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak,

00:10:33.485 --> 00:10:36.059
at war, at death.

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:38.449
That's a tough space to stand in.

00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:43.838
The educator Parker Palmer calls it "the tragic gap,"

00:10:43.838 --> 00:10:47.805
tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable,

00:10:47.805 --> 00:10:50.845
and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say,

00:10:50.845 --> 00:10:53.789
"You can hold that tension like a violin string

00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:57.225
and make something beautiful."

00:10:57.225 --> 00:11:00.363
That tension resonates in the work of the photographer

00:11:00.363 --> 00:11:03.573
Joel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was

00:11:03.573 --> 00:11:06.813
known for his street photography, for capturing a moment

00:11:06.813 --> 00:11:10.495
on the street, and also for his beautiful photographs

00:11:10.495 --> 00:11:14.179
of landscapes -- of Tuscany, of Cape Cod,

00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:16.861
of light.

00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:20.130
Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.128
was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown

00:11:24.128 --> 00:11:27.043
to the World Trade Center, and he photographed

00:11:27.043 --> 00:11:31.376
those buildings in every sort of light.

00:11:31.376 --> 00:11:35.026
You know where this story goes.

00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:37.514
On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town,

00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:42.113
but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site

00:11:42.113 --> 00:11:44.238
of the destruction.

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:46.417
Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby,

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:49.317
I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers

00:11:49.317 --> 00:11:51.515
and Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:55.185
and a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera

00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:58.185
to take a peek, just to see if there was something to see,

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:02.529
and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder,

00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:04.969
and said, "Hey, no pictures!"

00:12:04.969 --> 00:12:08.193
And it was such a blow that it woke me up,

00:12:08.193 --> 00:12:12.249
in the way that it was meant to be, I guess.

00:12:12.249 --> 00:12:14.292
And when I asked her why no pictures, she said,

00:12:14.292 --> 00:12:17.383
"It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed."

00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:18.852
And I asked her, "What would happen if I was a member

00:12:18.852 --> 00:12:21.056
of the press?" And she told me,

00:12:21.056 --> 00:12:25.150
"Oh, look back there," and back a block was the press corps

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.960
tied up in a little penned-in area,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.481
and I said, "Well, when do they go in?"

00:12:30.481 --> 00:12:32.963
and she said, "Probably never."

00:12:32.963 --> 00:12:37.454
And as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization,

00:12:37.454 --> 00:12:40.248
probably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.

00:12:40.248 --> 00:12:42.423
I thought, "Oh, if there's no pictures,

00:12:42.423 --> 00:12:45.929
then there'll be no record. We need a record."

00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:47.799
And I thought, "I'm gonna make that record.

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:50.086
I'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to

00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:51.954
see this history disappear."

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:56.197
JB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could,

00:12:56.197 --> 00:12:58.710
and got a pass into the World Trade Center site,

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.942
where he photographed for nine months almost every day.

00:13:02.942 --> 00:13:05.886
Looking at these photographs today brings back

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:08.791
the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes

00:13:08.791 --> 00:13:10.788
when I went home to my family at night.

00:13:10.788 --> 00:13:14.206
My office was just a few blocks away.

00:13:14.206 --> 00:13:17.822
But some of these photographs are beautiful,

00:13:17.822 --> 00:13:20.937
and we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz

00:13:20.937 --> 00:13:25.279
to make such beauty out of such devastation?

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:28.645
JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful

00:13:28.645 --> 00:13:32.016
and tragic and horrific and everything, but

00:13:32.016 --> 00:13:36.312
it was also as, in nature, an enormous event

00:13:36.312 --> 00:13:41.478
that was transformed after the fact into this residue,

00:13:41.478 --> 00:13:43.294
and like many other ruins

00:13:43.294 --> 00:13:47.143
— you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace —

00:13:47.143 --> 00:13:51.780
and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.653
I mean, there were afternoons I was down there,

00:13:53.653 --> 00:13:57.303
and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air

00:13:57.303 --> 00:14:01.334
and you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself

00:14:01.334 --> 00:14:05.218
recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature

00:14:05.218 --> 00:14:07.972
and the fact that nature, as time,

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:11.367
is erasing this wound.

00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:15.201
Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.

00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:17.530
It gets further and further away from the day,

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.885
and light and seasons temper it in some way,

00:14:21.885 --> 00:14:26.029
and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.

00:14:26.029 --> 00:14:29.513
The reality is, there's the Woolworth Building

00:14:29.513 --> 00:14:35.341
in a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:39.285
across a theater, and it's turning pink,

00:14:39.285 --> 00:14:42.388
you know, and down below there are hoses spraying,

00:14:42.388 --> 00:14:45.397
and the lights have come on for the evening, and the water

00:14:45.397 --> 00:14:49.425
is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on,

00:14:49.425 --> 00:14:51.602
and I'm thinking, "My God, who could dream this up?"

00:14:51.602 --> 00:14:55.803
But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that,

00:14:55.803 --> 00:14:57.697
you have to take a picture.

00:14:57.697 --> 00:15:00.890
JB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency,

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:06.690
of the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.043
When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how much

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:13.828
I admired his passionate obstinacy, his determination

00:15:13.828 --> 00:15:18.411
to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work,

00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:20.587
and he laughed, and he said, "I'm stubborn,

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.991
but I think what's more important

00:15:22.991 --> 00:15:26.452
is my passionate optimism."

00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:29.255
The first time I told these stories, a man in the audience

00:15:29.255 --> 00:15:32.745
raised his hand and said, "All these artists talk about

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:37.483
their work, not their art, which has got me thinking about

00:15:37.483 --> 00:15:40.151
my work and where the creativity is there,

00:15:40.151 --> 00:15:44.779
and I'm not an artist." He's right. We all wrestle

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:49.395
with experience and challenge, limits and loss.

00:15:49.395 --> 00:15:51.646
Creativity is essential to all of us,

00:15:51.646 --> 00:15:54.299
whether we're scientists or teachers,

00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:58.658
parents or entrepreneurs.

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:00.835
I want to leave you with another

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.929
image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:06.899
is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:09.435
It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:13.078
the fingermarks where the potter pinched it.

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:15.995
But as you can also see, this one did break

00:16:15.995 --> 00:16:18.715
at some point in its hundred years.

00:16:18.715 --> 00:16:21.475
But the person who put it back together,

00:16:21.475 --> 00:16:24.039
instead of hiding the cracks,

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:29.755
decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:34.199
This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken,

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:37.211
than it was when it was first made,

00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:39.441
and we can look at those cracks, because

00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:41.806
they tell the story that we all live,

00:16:41.806 --> 00:16:45.483
of the cycle of creation and destruction,

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:50.410
of control and letting go, of picking up the pieces

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.409
and making something new.

00:16:52.409 --> 00:16:56.963
Thank you. (Applause)
