00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:03.873
Living with a physical
disability isn't easy

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:06.096
anywhere in the world,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.925
but if you live in a country
like the United States,

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.018
there's certain appurtenances available
to you that do make life easier.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.691
So if you're in a building,
you can take an elevator.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.971
If you're crossing the street,
you have sidewalk cutouts.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.234
And if you have to travel
some distance farther

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:22.401
than you can do under your own power,
there's accessible vehicles,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.262
and if you can't afford one of those,

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:26.635
there's accessible public transportation.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.326
But in the developing world,
things are quite different.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.545
There's 40 million people who need
a wheelchair but don't have one,

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:35.900
and the majority of these
people live in rural areas,

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:39.785
where the only connections to community,
to employment, to education,

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.268
are by traveling long
distances on rough terrain

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.005
often under their own power.

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:47.363
And the devices usually
available to these people

00:00:47.387 --> 00:00:49.821
are not made for that context,
break down quickly,

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:52.131
and are hard to repair.

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:56.851
I started looking at wheelchairs
in developing countries in 2005,

00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:00.667
when I spent the summer assessing
the state of technology in Tanzania,

00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.480
and I talked to wheelchair users, wheelchair
manufacturers, disability groups,

00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:06.337
and what stood out to me

00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:08.789
is that there wasn't a device available

00:01:08.813 --> 00:01:11.337
that was designed for rural
areas, that could go fast

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:13.953
and efficiently on many types of terrain.

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:15.736
So being a mechanical engineer,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.522
being at MIT and having lots
of resources available to me,

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:20.836
I thought I'd try to do
something about it.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.789
Now when you're talking
about trying to travel

00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:25.995
long distances on rough terrain,

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.728
I immediately thought of a mountain bike,

00:01:27.752 --> 00:01:29.141
and a mountain bike's good at doing this

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:30.980
because it has a gear train,

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.814
and you can shift to a low gear
if you have to climb a hill

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:35.440
or go through mud or sand

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.554
and you get a lot of torque
but a low speed.

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:39.669
And if you want to go
faster, say on pavement,

00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:41.074
you can shift to a high gear,

00:01:41.098 --> 00:01:43.146
and you get less torque,
but higher speeds.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.727
So the logical evolution here

00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:47.561
is to just make a wheelchair
with mountain bike components,

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:48.919
which many people have done.

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:52.101
But these are two products
available in the U.S. that

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.792
would be difficult to transfer
into developing countries

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:57.342
because they're much, much too expensive.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.618
And the context I'm talking about is where

00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:03.614
you need to have a product
that is less than 200 dollars.

00:02:03.638 --> 00:02:06.045
And this ideal product
would also be able to go

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.049
about five kilometers a day so you
could get to your job, get to school,

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:11.901
and do it on many,
many different types of terrain.

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:14.793
But when you get home or want
to go indoors at your work,

00:02:14.817 --> 00:02:19.214
it's got to be small enough and maneuverable
enough to use inside.

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:22.619
And furthermore, if you want it to last
a long time out in rural areas,

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:26.681
it has to be repairable using the local
tools, materials and knowledge

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:29.497
in those contexts.

00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:32.437
So the real crux of the problem here is,

00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:35.585
how do you make a system
that's a simple device

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.716
but gives you a large
mechanical advantage?

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.903
How do you make a mountain
bike for your arms

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:42.594
that doesn't have the mountain
bike cost and complexity?

00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:44.995
So as is the case with simple solutions,

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.781
oftentimes the answer is right in front
of your face, and for us it was levers.

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:53.415
We use levers all the time,
in tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.201
And that moment of inspiration,
that key invention moment,

00:02:56.225 --> 00:02:58.749
was when I was sitting
in front of my design notebook

00:02:58.773 --> 00:03:01.521
and I started thinking
about somebody grabbing a lever,

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:03.634
and if they grab
near the end of the lever,

00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:05.468
they can get an effectively long lever

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:08.293
and produce a lot of torque
as they push back and forth,

00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:10.513
and effectively get a low gear.

00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:12.920
And as they slide
their hand down the lever,

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:15.756
they can push with a smaller
effective lever length,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.876
but push through a bigger
angle every stroke,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.535
which makes a faster rotational speed,
and gives you an effective high gear.

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.287
So what's exciting about this system

00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.890
is that it's really, really
mechanically simple,

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.724
and you could make it using technology

00:03:27.748 --> 00:03:29.706
that's been around for hundreds of years.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.891
So seeing this in practice,

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:33.868
this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that,

00:03:33.892 --> 00:03:35.608
after a few years of development,

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.545
we're now going into production with,

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.569
and this is a full-time wheelchair user --

00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:41.110
he's paralyzed -- in Guatemala,

00:03:41.134 --> 00:03:45.109
and you see he's able to traverse
pretty rough terrain.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:49.640
Again, the key innovation of this technology
is that when he wants to go fast,

00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:53.695
he just grabs the levers near the pivots
and goes through a big angle every stroke,

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.620
and as the going gets tougher, he just
slides his hands up the levers,

00:03:56.644 --> 00:03:59.216
creates more torque, and kind
of bench-presses his way

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.402
out of trouble through the rough terrain.

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:04.414
Now the big, important point here is that

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:07.127
the person is the complex
machine in this system.

00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:10.473
It's the person that's sliding
his hands up and down the levers,

00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:13.195
so the mechanism itself can be very simple

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.267
and composed of bicycle parts you
can get anywhere in the world.

00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:17.858
Because those bicycle parts

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.363
are so ubiquitously available,
they're super-cheap.

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:22.543
They're made by the gazillions
in China and India,

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:24.399
and we can source them
anywhere in the world,

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:27.138
build the chair anywhere,
and most importantly repair it,

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:29.591
even out in a village
with a local bicycle mechanic

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:33.946
who has local tools, knowledge
and parts available.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.623
Now, when you want to use the LFC indoors,

00:04:36.647 --> 00:04:40.143
all you have to do is pull
the levers out of the drivetrain,

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:43.420
stow them in the frame, and it
converts into a normal wheelchair

00:04:43.444 --> 00:04:46.064
that you can use just
like any other normal wheelchair,

00:04:46.088 --> 00:04:48.081
and we sized it like a normal wheelchair,

00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:52.216
so it's narrow enough to fit
through a standard doorway,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.735
it's low enough to fit under a table,

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.728
and it's small and maneuverable
enough to fit in a bathroom

00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:02.752
and this is important so the user
can get up close to a toilet,

00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:04.456
and be able to transfer off

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.047
just like he could in a normal wheelchair.

00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:13.139
Now, there's three important
points that I want to stress

00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:16.771
that I think really hit
home in this project.

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:19.975
The first is that this
product works well because

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.006
we were effectively able to combine

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.560
rigorous engineering science
and analysis with user-centered design

00:05:26.584 --> 00:05:29.937
focused on the social and usage
and economic factors

00:05:29.961 --> 00:05:32.474
important to wheelchair users
in the developing countries.

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:34.962
So I'm an academic at MIT,
and I'm a mechanical engineer,

00:05:34.986 --> 00:05:38.510
so I can do things like look at the type
of terrain you want to travel on,

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:41.158
and figure out how much
resistance it should impose,

00:05:41.182 --> 00:05:44.166
look at the parts we have
available and mix and match them

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.811
to figure out what sort
of gear trains we can use,

00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:49.920
and then look at the power and force
you can get out of your upper body

00:05:49.944 --> 00:05:51.883
to analyze how fast you should
be able to go in this chair

00:05:51.907 --> 00:05:54.254
as you put your arms
up and down the levers.

00:05:54.278 --> 00:05:57.913
So as a wet-behind-the-ears
student, excited,

00:05:57.937 --> 00:06:00.038
our team made a prototype,

00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:04.913
brought that prototype to Tanzania,
Kenya and Vietnam in 2008,

00:06:04.937 --> 00:06:07.047
and found it was terrible

00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:09.484
because we didn't get
enough input from users.

00:06:09.508 --> 00:06:12.650
So because we tested it
with wheelchair users,

00:06:12.674 --> 00:06:15.156
with wheelchair manufacturers,
we got that feedback from them,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.610
not just articulating their problems,
but articulating their solutions,

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:22.158
and worked together to go back
to the drawing board and make a new design,

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:24.308
which we brought back
to East Africa in '09

00:06:24.332 --> 00:06:27.153
that worked a lot better than a normal
wheelchair on rough terrain,

00:06:27.177 --> 00:06:30.035
but it still didn't work well
indoors because it was too big,

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:32.033
it was heavy, it was hard to move around,

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:35.587
so again with that user feedback,
we went back to the drawing board,

00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:37.902
came up with a better
design, 20 pounds lighter,

00:06:37.926 --> 00:06:41.593
as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested
that in a field trial in Guatemala,

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:43.617
and that advanced the product to the point

00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.840
where we have now that it's going
into production.

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:49.086
Now also being engineering scientists,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.968
we were able to quantify the performance
benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,

00:06:52.992 --> 00:06:55.608
so here are some shots
of our trial in Guatemala

00:06:55.632 --> 00:06:59.150
where we tested the LFC
on village terrain,

00:06:59.174 --> 00:07:01.174
and tested people's biomechanical outputs,

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:03.361
their oxygen consumption,
how fast they go,

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:05.052
how much power they're putting out,

00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:07.951
both in their regular
wheelchairs and using the LFC,

00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:10.452
and we found that the LFC
is about 80 percent faster

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:12.810
going on these terrains
than a normal wheelchair.

00:07:12.834 --> 00:07:16.193
It's also about 40 percent more
efficient than a regular wheelchair,

00:07:16.217 --> 00:07:18.736
and because of the mechanical
advantage you get from the levers,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.665
you can produce 50 percent higher torque

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:24.649
and really muscle your way
through the really, really rough terrain.

00:07:24.673 --> 00:07:28.085
Now the second lesson
that we learned in this is that

00:07:28.109 --> 00:07:30.985
the constraints on this design
really push the innovation,

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.249
because we had to hit
such a low price point,

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:35.559
because we had to make
a device that could travel

00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:38.378
on many, many types of terrain
but still be usable indoors,

00:07:38.402 --> 00:07:40.669
and be simple enough to repair,

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:43.036
we ended up with a fundamentally
new product,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.152
a new product that is an innovation

00:07:45.176 --> 00:07:48.069
in a space that really hasn't
changed in a hundred years.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:51.522
And these are all merits that are not
just good in the developing world.

00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:53.961
Why not in countries like the U.S. too?

00:07:53.985 --> 00:07:55.697
So we teamed up with Continuum,

00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:57.721
a local product design firm here in Boston

00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:00.729
to make the high-end version,
the developed world version,

00:08:00.753 --> 00:08:03.515
that we'll probably sell primarily
in the U.S. and Europe,

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:06.316
but to higher-income buyers.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.302
And the final point I want
to make is that I think

00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:12.128
this project worked
well because we engaged

00:08:12.152 --> 00:08:16.739
all the stakeholders that buy into this
project and are important to consider

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:20.082
in bringing the technology
from inception of an idea

00:08:20.106 --> 00:08:24.321
through innovation, validation,
commercialization and dissemination,

00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:28.066
and that cycle has to start
and end with end users.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.841
These are the people that define
the requirements of the technology,

00:08:30.865 --> 00:08:33.179
and these are the people that have
to give the thumbs-up at the end,

00:08:33.203 --> 00:08:35.823
and say, "Yeah, it actually works.
It meets our needs."

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:37.753
So people like me in the academic space,

00:08:37.777 --> 00:08:41.124
we can do things like innovate
and analyze and test,

00:08:41.148 --> 00:08:44.220
create data and make
bench-level prototypes,

00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:47.387
but how do you get that bench-level
prototype to commercialization?

00:08:47.411 --> 00:08:50.799
So we need gap-fillers like Continuum
that can work on commercializing,

00:08:50.823 --> 00:08:53.585
and we started a whole NGO
to bring our chair to market --

00:08:53.609 --> 00:08:55.750
Global Research Innovation Technology --

00:08:55.774 --> 00:08:59.482
and then we also teamed up with a big
manufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:01.745
that's tooled up now
to make 500 chairs a month

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:03.548
and will make the first
batch of 200 next month,

00:09:03.572 --> 00:09:05.516
which will be delivered in India.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.255
And then finally, to get this
out to the people in scale,

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.803
we teamed up with the largest
disability organization

00:09:10.827 --> 00:09:13.090
in the world, Jaipur Foot.

00:09:13.114 --> 00:09:15.369
Now what's powerful about this model

00:09:15.393 --> 00:09:18.176
is when you bring together
all these stakeholders

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.145
that represent each link in the chain

00:09:20.169 --> 00:09:22.686
from inception of an idea

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.454
all the way to implementation
in the field,

00:09:25.478 --> 00:09:27.005
that's where the magic happens.

00:09:27.029 --> 00:09:29.553
That's where you can take
a guy like me, an academic,

00:09:29.577 --> 00:09:32.581
but analyze and test
and create a new technology

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:36.117
and quantitatively determine
how much better the performance is.

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:38.802
You can connect with stakeholders
like the manufacturers

00:09:38.802 --> 00:09:41.042
and talk with them face-to-face
and leverage their

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:43.909
local knowledge of manufacturing
practices and their clients

00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:46.648
and combine that knowledge
with our engineering knowledge

00:09:46.672 --> 00:09:49.978
to create something greater
than either of us could have done alone.

00:09:50.002 --> 00:09:52.509
And then you can also engage the end user

00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:55.295
in the design process, and not
just ask him what he needs,

00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:58.244
but ask him how he thinks
it can be achieved.

00:09:58.268 --> 00:10:01.301
And this picture was taken
in India in our last field trial,

00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:03.802
where we had a 90-percent
adoption rate where people

00:10:03.826 --> 00:10:07.408
switched to using our Leveraged Freedom
Chair over their normal wheelchair,

00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:10.369
and this picture specifically is of Ashok,

00:10:10.393 --> 00:10:13.401
and Ashok had a spinal injury
when he fell out of a tree,

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:16.283
and he had been working at a tailor,
but once he was injured

00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:19.166
he wasn't able to transport
himself from his house

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.966
over a kilometer to his shop
in his normal wheelchair.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.237
The road was too rough.

00:10:23.261 --> 00:10:26.158
But the day after he got
an LFC, he hopped in it,

00:10:26.182 --> 00:10:28.242
rode that kilometer, opened up his shop

00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:30.958
and soon after landed a contract
to make school uniforms

00:10:30.982 --> 00:10:34.078
and started making money, started
providing for his family again.

00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:35.927
Ashok: You also encouraged me to work.

00:10:35.951 --> 00:10:38.651
I rested for a day at home.

00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:43.107
The next day I went to my shop.

00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:46.085
Now everything is back to normal.

00:10:46.109 --> 00:10:50.170
Amos Winter: And thank you
very much for having me today.

00:10:50.194 --> 00:10:54.194
(Applause)
