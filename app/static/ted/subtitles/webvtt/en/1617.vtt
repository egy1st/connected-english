WEBVTT

00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:04.714
Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:08.699
my life -- has been shaped

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:14.523
by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:18.044
From 1971 to 1977 --

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:21.924
I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) --

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:26.857
I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,

00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:31.074
in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.

00:00:31.074 --> 00:00:34.192
I worked for an Italian NGO,

00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:40.342
and every single project that we set up in Africa

00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:43.786
failed.

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:47.930
And I was distraught.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.178
I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:55.560
and we were doing good work in Africa.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.573
Instead, everything we touched we killed.

00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:07.676
Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book,

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:10.564
"Ripples from the Zambezi,"

00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:13.129
was a project where we Italians

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:19.050
decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.399
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.879
in this absolutely magnificent valley

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.132
going down to the Zambezi River,

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.760
and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.551
and zucchini and ...

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:38.746
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest

00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:41.661
in doing that, so we paid them to come and work,

00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:45.796
and sometimes they would show up. (Laughter)

00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:48.523
And we were amazed that the local people,

00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:51.610
in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.818
But instead of asking them how come they were not

00:01:54.818 --> 00:01:58.840
growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." (Laughter)

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.508
"Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."

00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:06.968
And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:09.626
We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:13.235
would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:16.056
And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,

00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:18.528
"Look how easy agriculture is."

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:21.539
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.967
overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:28.970
and they ate everything. (Laughter)

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.554
And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!"

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:39.235
And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." (Laughter)

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:45.487
"Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked."

00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:50.575
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,

00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:53.319
but then I saw what the Americans were doing,

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.055
what the English were doing, what the French were doing,

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:58.648
and after seeing what they were doing,

00:02:58.648 --> 00:03:02.007
I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:06.996
Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos.

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:11.243
You should see the rubbish — (Applause) --

00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:13.737
You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed

00:03:13.737 --> 00:03:15.537
on unsuspecting African people.

00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:17.113
You want to read the book,

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:22.044
read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,

00:03:22.044 --> 00:03:25.051
Zambian woman economist.

00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:27.421
The book was published in 2009.

00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:31.995
We Western donor countries have given the African continent

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:36.988
two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.

00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:40.813
I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.

00:03:40.813 --> 00:03:43.001
Just go and read her book.

00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:51.364
Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:57.331
We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,

00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:00.645
and there are only two ways we deal with people:

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:05.034
We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.

00:04:05.034 --> 00:04:08.138
The two words come from the Latin root "pater,"

00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:10.368
which means "father."

00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:14.221
But they mean two different things.

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:17.582
Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:23.385
as if they were my children. "I love you so much."

00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:27.892
Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.290
as if they were my servants.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.361
That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss.

00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:39.944
I was given a slap in the face reading a book,

00:04:39.944 --> 00:04:44.911
"Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,

00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:47.869
above all in economic development, if people

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:52.424
do not wish to be helped, leave them alone.

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:55.251
This should be the first principle of aid.

00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:58.937
The first principle of aid is respect.

00:04:58.937 --> 00:05:01.465
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference

00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:05.266
lay a stick on the floor, and said,

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:09.524
"Can we -- can you imagine a city

00:05:09.524 --> 00:05:13.446
that is not neocolonial?"

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:17.599
I decided when I was 27 years old

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.806
to only respond to people,

00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:26.230
and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.605
where you never initiate anything,

00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:33.827
you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant

00:05:33.827 --> 00:05:37.388
of the local passion, the servant of local people

00:05:37.388 --> 00:05:41.786
who have a dream to become a better person.

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:46.195
So what you do -- you shut up.

00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:49.907
You never arrive in a community with any ideas,

00:05:49.907 --> 00:05:54.346
and you sit with the local people.

00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:56.538
We don't work from offices.

00:05:56.538 --> 00:06:00.504
We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.

00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:03.819
We have zero infrastructure.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.146
And what we do, we become friends,

00:06:07.146 --> 00:06:11.906
and we find out what that person wants to do.

00:06:11.906 --> 00:06:13.764
The most important thing is passion.

00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:16.004
You can give somebody an idea.

00:06:16.004 --> 00:06:17.626
If that person doesn't want to do it,

00:06:17.626 --> 00:06:21.307
what are you going to do?

00:06:21.307 --> 00:06:25.853
The passion that the person has for her own growth

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:27.579
is the most important thing.

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:32.136
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth

00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:33.801
is the most important thing.

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:36.888
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge,

00:06:36.888 --> 00:06:42.357
because nobody in the world can succeed alone.

00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:45.076
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge,

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:47.214
but the knowledge is available.

00:06:47.214 --> 00:06:51.073
So years and years ago, I had this idea:

00:06:51.073 --> 00:06:55.239
Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:59.942
to tell people what to do, why don't, for once,

00:06:59.942 --> 00:07:04.767
listen to them? But not in community meetings.

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:09.681
Let me tell you a secret.

00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:14.026
There is a problem with community meetings.

00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:17.732
Entrepreneurs never come,

00:07:17.732 --> 00:07:20.904
and they never tell you, in a public meeting,

00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:24.520
what they want to do with their own money,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.349
what opportunity they have identified.

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:33.273
So planning has this blind spot.

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:37.564
The smartest people in your community you don't even know,

00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:45.404
because they don't come to your public meetings.

00:07:45.404 --> 00:07:49.364
What we do, we work one-on-one,

00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:51.077
and to work one-on-one, you have to create

00:07:51.077 --> 00:07:53.752
a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.

00:07:53.752 --> 00:07:56.324
You have to create a new profession.

00:07:56.324 --> 00:08:01.828
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise,

00:08:01.828 --> 00:08:05.399
the family doctor of business, who sits with you

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:08.524
in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,

00:08:08.524 --> 00:08:12.562
and helps you find the resources to transform your passion

00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:14.955
into a way to make a living.

00:08:14.955 --> 00:08:20.276
I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.

00:08:20.276 --> 00:08:22.528
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,

00:08:22.528 --> 00:08:26.851
trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit

00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:30.663
that we arrive and tell you what to do.

00:08:30.663 --> 00:08:35.243
And so what I did in Esperance that first year

00:08:35.243 --> 00:08:39.869
was to just walk the streets, and in three days

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:42.763
I had my first client, and I helped this first guy

00:08:42.763 --> 00:08:47.308
who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,

00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:50.613
and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:53.743
to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,

00:08:53.743 --> 00:08:56.729
"You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?"

00:08:56.729 --> 00:08:59.893
And I helped these five fishermen to work together

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:04.029
and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany

00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:07.862
for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way

00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:13.213
to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,

00:09:13.213 --> 00:09:14.735
and the farmers came to talk to me, said,

00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:17.024
"Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"

00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:19.950
In a year, I had 27 projects going on,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.102
and the government came to see me to say,

00:09:22.102 --> 00:09:24.489
"How can you do that?

00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:27.815
How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.

00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:33.468
I shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter)

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:41.690
So — (Applause) —

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.295
So the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter)

00:09:46.295 --> 00:09:49.453
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.

00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:52.988
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.

00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:54.660
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.189
who are dying of solitude.

00:09:57.189 --> 00:10:03.348
Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,

00:10:03.348 --> 00:10:07.900
died age 96, a few years ago.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.680
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.644
before becoming involved in business,

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:14.521
and this is what Peter Drucker says:

00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:20.185
"Planning is actually incompatible

00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:24.434
with an entrepreneurial society and economy."

00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:30.677
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.

00:10:30.677 --> 00:10:33.372
So now you're rebuilding Christchurch

00:10:33.372 --> 00:10:36.853
without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch

00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:41.511
want to do with their own money and their own energy.

00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:44.709
You have to learn how to get these people

00:10:44.709 --> 00:10:47.706
to come and talk to you.

00:10:47.706 --> 00:10:52.534
You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,

00:10:52.534 --> 00:10:56.318
you have to be fantastic at helping them,

00:10:56.318 --> 00:11:00.312
and then they will come, and they will come in droves.

00:11:00.312 --> 00:11:03.207
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.

00:11:03.207 --> 00:11:05.779
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people,

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:08.021
the intelligence and the passion?

00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:11.552
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning?

00:11:11.552 --> 00:11:17.512
Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.

00:11:17.512 --> 00:11:22.783
So what I'm saying is that

00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:25.250
entrepreneurship is where it's at.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.396
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution --

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:31.709
nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing --

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:36.166
and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.

00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:38.813
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.

00:11:38.813 --> 00:11:42.134
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:45.222
What we have to look at is at how we

00:11:45.222 --> 00:11:51.240
feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.791
for seven billion people in a sustainable way.

00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:58.685
The technologies do not exist to do that.

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:02.053
Who is going to invent the technology

00:12:02.053 --> 00:12:08.551
for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!

00:12:08.551 --> 00:12:11.444
Government? Forget about it!

00:12:11.444 --> 00:12:16.698
It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.

00:12:16.698 --> 00:12:19.593
There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine

00:12:19.593 --> 00:12:21.266
many, many years ago.

00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:23.486
There was a group of experts who were invited

00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:28.114
to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:30.604
And in 1860, this group of people came together,

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:33.551
and they all speculated about what would happen

00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:35.405
to the city of New York in 100 years,

00:12:35.405 --> 00:12:36.881
and the conclusion was unanimous:

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:40.822
The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.

00:12:40.822 --> 00:12:43.083
Why? Because they looked at the curve and said,

00:12:43.083 --> 00:12:46.049
if the population keeps growing at this rate,

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:50.185
to move the population of New York around,

00:12:50.185 --> 00:12:53.050
they would have needed six million horses,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.405
and the manure created by six million horses

00:12:56.405 --> 00:12:58.784
would be impossible to deal with.

00:12:58.784 --> 00:13:04.414
They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter)

00:13:04.414 --> 00:13:09.463
So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology

00:13:09.463 --> 00:13:14.281
that is going to choke the life out of New York.

00:13:14.281 --> 00:13:19.410
So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:24.013
in the United States of America, there were 1,001

00:13:24.013 --> 00:13:30.393
car manufacturing companies -- 1,001.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.999
The idea of finding a different technology

00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:36.361
had absolutely taken over,

00:13:36.361 --> 00:13:41.277
and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.

00:13:41.277 --> 00:13:46.909
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:51.280
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.674
First, you have to offer them confidentiality.

00:13:54.674 --> 00:13:57.012
Otherwise they don't come and talk to you.

00:13:57.012 --> 00:14:01.322
Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,

00:14:01.322 --> 00:14:04.774
passionate service to them.

00:14:04.774 --> 00:14:08.421
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.

00:14:08.421 --> 00:14:11.192
The smallest company, the biggest company,

00:14:11.192 --> 00:14:14.582
has to be capable of doing three things beautifully:

00:14:14.582 --> 00:14:18.833
The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:22.657
you have to have fantastic marketing,

00:14:22.657 --> 00:14:26.026
and you have to have tremendous financial management.

00:14:26.026 --> 00:14:28.614
Guess what?

00:14:28.614 --> 00:14:31.028
We have never met a single human being

00:14:31.028 --> 00:14:36.675
in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:39.506
It doesn't exist.

00:14:39.506 --> 00:14:42.256
This person has never been born.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:44.748
We've done the research, and we have looked

00:14:44.748 --> 00:14:48.699
at the 100 iconic companies of the world --

00:14:48.699 --> 00:14:53.280
Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.883
all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.

00:14:55.883 --> 00:14:58.559
There's only one thing that all the successful companies

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:02.047
in the world have in common, only one:

00:15:02.047 --> 00:15:06.582
None were started by one person.

00:15:06.582 --> 00:15:11.084
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds

00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:14.625
in Northumberland, and we start the class

00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:19.049
by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,

00:15:19.049 --> 00:15:22.886
and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,

00:15:22.886 --> 00:15:26.514
in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography

00:15:26.514 --> 00:15:29.669
how many times Richard uses the word "I"

00:15:29.669 --> 00:15:32.378
and how many times he uses the word "we."

00:15:32.378 --> 00:15:37.118
Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times.

00:15:37.118 --> 00:15:40.371
He wasn't alone when he started.

00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:45.415
Nobody started a company alone. No one.

00:15:45.415 --> 00:15:48.521
So we can create the community

00:15:48.521 --> 00:15:51.947
where we have facilitators who come from a small business background

00:15:51.947 --> 00:15:59.444
sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies

00:15:59.444 --> 00:16:03.116
who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman

00:16:03.116 --> 00:16:06.357
who talks about this epic,

00:16:06.357 --> 00:16:08.612
somebody who will say to you, "What do you need?

00:16:08.612 --> 00:16:10.551
What can you do? Can you make it?

00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:12.801
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?"

00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:16.555
"Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?"

00:16:16.555 --> 00:16:18.643
We activate communities.

00:16:18.643 --> 00:16:22.687
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator

00:16:22.687 --> 00:16:25.810
to help you to find resources and people

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.799
and we have discovered that the miracle

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:31.303
of the intelligence of local people is such

00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:35.010
that you can change the culture and the economy

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:39.191
of this community just by capturing the passion,

00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:42.828
the energy and imagination of your own people.

00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:47.521
Thank you. (Applause)
