00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:03.675
I'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.747
I'm actually interested in how the brain learns,

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:10.114
and I'm especially interested in a possibility of

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:14.846
making our brains smarter, better and faster.

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:17.722
This is in this context I'm going to tell you

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.472
about video games. When we say video games,

00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:23.010
most of you think about children.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.988
It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.

00:00:26.988 --> 00:00:29.906
But let's be frank.

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:34.695
When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:41.179
Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.186
not eight years old, and in fact, if we look

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.895
at the projected demographics of video game play,

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:50.628
the video game players of tomorrow are

00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:53.752
older adults. (Laughter)

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:58.003
So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:02.386
It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact

00:01:02.386 --> 00:01:05.773
on our everyday life. Consider these statistics

00:01:05.773 --> 00:01:11.588
released by Activision. After one month of release

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:16.080
of the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.453
for 68,000 years

00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:21.319
worldwide, right?

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.266
Would any of you complain if this was the case

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.429
about doing linear algebra?

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.724
So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.572
Now I want to step back a bit.

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:36.813
I know most of you have had the experience of coming back

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:41.533
home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.673
(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:46.637
after your enemy zombie bad guys

00:01:46.637 --> 00:01:50.227
before they get to you, right?

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:53.404
And I'm almost sure most of you have thought,

00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:56.725
"Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent

00:01:56.725 --> 00:02:00.052
than shooting at zombies?"

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.518
I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction

00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:06.015
in the context of what you would have thought

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:09.524
if you had found your girl playing sudoku

00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:13.875
or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.612
Most parents would find that great.

00:02:16.612 --> 00:02:19.956
Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:22.924
days in and days out is actually good for your health.

00:02:22.924 --> 00:02:26.124
It's not, and binging is never good.

00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:30.115
But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses,

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:33.084
actually the very game I showed you at the beginning,

00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:35.668
those action-packed shooter games

00:02:35.668 --> 00:02:39.444
have quite powerful effects and positive effects

00:02:39.444 --> 00:02:43.302
on many different aspects of our behavior.

00:02:43.302 --> 00:02:46.997
There's not one week that goes without some major

00:02:46.997 --> 00:02:49.773
headlines in the media about whether video games are

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:54.389
good or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:00.077
I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside

00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:03.220
and get you to actually step into the lab.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.093
What we do in the lab is actually measure directly,

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:08.860
in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.629
of video games on the brain.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.964
And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.

00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:17.563
One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.849
is the fact that too much screen time

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.664
makes your eyesight worse.

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:24.867
That's a statement about vision.

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:27.403
There may be vision scientists among you.

00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:30.342
We actually know how to test that statement.

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:33.779
We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:37.460
Well, guess what? People that don't play a lot

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.450
of action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.982
in front of screens, have normal, or what we call

00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:46.636
corrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:49.085
The issue is what happens with these guys that actually

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:52.365
indulge into playing video games like five hours per week,

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.240
10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.468
By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?

00:03:57.468 --> 00:04:00.165
Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.

00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:02.605
It's better than those that don't play.

00:04:02.605 --> 00:04:04.877
And it's better in two different ways.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.302
The first way is that they're actually able to resolve

00:04:07.302 --> 00:04:10.557
small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:14.355
being able to read the fine print on a prescription

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:18.982
rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it

00:04:18.982 --> 00:04:20.548
with just your eyesight.

00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:23.364
The other way that they are better is actually being able

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:26.273
to resolve different levels of gray.

00:04:26.273 --> 00:04:29.444
Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference

00:04:29.444 --> 00:04:31.925
between seeing the car in front of you

00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:35.668
and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.

00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:38.684
So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games

00:04:38.684 --> 00:04:43.158
for patients with low vision, and to have an impact

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:46.493
on retraining their brain to see better.

00:04:46.493 --> 00:04:50.142
Clearly, when it comes to action video games,

00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:53.037
screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.

00:04:53.037 --> 00:04:57.023
Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around:

00:04:57.023 --> 00:05:01.397
Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.

00:05:01.397 --> 00:05:05.302
Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.

00:05:05.302 --> 00:05:08.903
I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.

00:05:08.903 --> 00:05:11.628
I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have

00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:14.652
to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you

00:05:14.652 --> 00:05:20.085
colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:23.468
Right? So this is the first example.

00:05:23.468 --> 00:05:24.558
["Chair"]

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:27.619
Orange, good. ["Table"] Green.

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:28.999
["Board"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:30.293
["Horse"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.

00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:31.618
["Yellow"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.

00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:33.127
["Blue"] DB: Yellow.

00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:39.482
Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)

00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:42.818
You're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?

00:05:42.818 --> 00:05:46.772
Because I introduced a conflict between

00:05:46.772 --> 00:05:49.685
the word itself and its color.

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:52.724
How good your attention is determines actually how fast

00:05:52.724 --> 00:05:55.251
you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here

00:05:55.251 --> 00:05:57.812
at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better

00:05:57.812 --> 00:06:00.356
than some of us that are older.

00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:02.924
What we can show is that when you do this kind of task

00:06:02.924 --> 00:06:04.524
with people that play a lot of action games,

00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:07.844
they actually resolve the conflict faster.

00:06:07.844 --> 00:06:11.052
So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead

00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:13.535
to attention problems.

00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:15.506
Actually, those action video game players have

00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:17.823
many other advantages in terms of attention, and one

00:06:17.823 --> 00:06:20.722
aspect of attention which is also improved for the better

00:06:20.722 --> 00:06:25.500
is our ability to track objects around in the world.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.044
This is something we use all the time. When you're driving,

00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:31.292
you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.

00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:34.367
You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:37.420
and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.484
In the lab, we get people to come to the lab,

00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:42.564
sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them

00:06:42.564 --> 00:06:45.460
little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.412
You're going to see yellow happy faces

00:06:48.412 --> 00:06:52.228
and a few sad blue faces. These are children

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:56.048
in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess

00:06:56.048 --> 00:07:00.349
during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.476
But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.

00:07:03.476 --> 00:07:06.796
Everybody begins to move around, and your task

00:07:06.796 --> 00:07:09.920
is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.411
and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example

00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:15.240
where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.577
actually track it with your eyes. You can track,

00:07:17.577 --> 00:07:19.857
you can track, and then when it stops, and there is

00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:23.788
a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?

00:07:23.788 --> 00:07:26.616
Was it yellow initially or blue?

00:07:26.616 --> 00:07:30.413
I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)

00:07:30.413 --> 00:07:35.209
I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:37.297
a little more challenging task. There are going to be

00:07:37.297 --> 00:07:40.480
three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.733
Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:45.379
and expand, pull your attention. That's the only way

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:48.227
you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.

00:07:48.227 --> 00:07:49.690
Yellow or blue?

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.336
Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:53.839
So your typical normal young adult

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:57.475
can have a span of about three or four objects of attention.

00:07:57.475 --> 00:08:00.235
That's what we just did. Your action video game player

00:08:00.235 --> 00:08:03.435
has a span of about six to seven objects of attention,

00:08:03.435 --> 00:08:06.413
which is what is shown in this video here.

00:08:06.413 --> 00:08:09.889
That's for you guys, action video game players.

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.774
A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)

00:08:11.774 --> 00:08:15.482
Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people

00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:18.686
that are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)

00:08:18.686 --> 00:08:22.290
Good. So in the same way that we actually see

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.768
the effects of video games on people's behavior,

00:08:25.768 --> 00:08:28.833
we can use brain imaging and look at the impact

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:32.618
of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,

00:08:32.618 --> 00:08:35.978
but the main changes are actually to the brain networks

00:08:35.978 --> 00:08:40.522
that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex

00:08:40.522 --> 00:08:44.241
which is very well known to control the orientation of attention.

00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:46.674
The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls

00:08:46.674 --> 00:08:49.384
how we sustain attention, and another one

00:08:49.384 --> 00:08:51.953
is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate

00:08:51.953 --> 00:08:55.250
and regulate attention and resolve conflict.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.114
Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three

00:08:58.114 --> 00:09:01.458
of these networks are actually much more efficient

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.218
in people that play action games.

00:09:04.218 --> 00:09:08.969
This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding

00:09:08.969 --> 00:09:12.410
in the literature about technology and the brain.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.859
You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:19.069
of multitasking when you're driving

00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:23.760
and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.663
Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,

00:09:27.663 --> 00:09:31.811
you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly

00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:34.259
to the car braking in front of you, and so you're

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:39.830
much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.706
Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.

00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:45.178
We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see

00:09:45.178 --> 00:09:47.523
how many car accidents they have. That would be a little

00:09:47.523 --> 00:09:51.070
costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.188
where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,

00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:58.716
how good they are at switching from one task to another.

00:09:58.716 --> 00:10:01.284
When we do that, we actually find that people

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:04.368
that play a lot of action games are really, really good.

00:10:04.368 --> 00:10:08.851
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.

00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:11.509
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:15.241
in the context of another group of technology users,

00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:17.651
a group which is actually much revered by society,

00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:22.190
which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.835
What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us,

00:10:25.835 --> 00:10:29.116
most of our children, are engaged with listening to music

00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:31.863
at the same time as they're doing search on the web

00:10:31.863 --> 00:10:35.220
at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.556
That's a multimedia-tasker.

00:10:37.556 --> 00:10:41.116
There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford

00:10:41.116 --> 00:10:43.669
and that we replicated that showed that

00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:48.316
those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers

00:10:48.316 --> 00:10:52.163
are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.

00:10:52.163 --> 00:10:54.900
When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.606
Right? So these kinds of results really

00:10:57.606 --> 00:11:00.092
makes two main points.

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:03.284
The first one is that not all media are created equal.

00:11:03.284 --> 00:11:08.196
You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking

00:11:08.196 --> 00:11:09.842
and the effect of playing action games. They have

00:11:09.842 --> 00:11:13.234
totally different effects on different aspects of cognition,

00:11:13.234 --> 00:11:16.348
perception and attention.

00:11:16.348 --> 00:11:19.188
Even within video games, I'm telling you right now

00:11:19.188 --> 00:11:20.941
about these action-packed video games.

00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:24.275
Different video games have a different effect on your brains.

00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:26.957
So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure

00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:29.468
what is the effect of each video game.

00:11:29.468 --> 00:11:33.755
The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.811
I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that

00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:39.259
despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:43.267
have a lot of very good vision, etc.

00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:46.585
Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates

00:11:46.585 --> 00:11:49.826
that actually report engaging in a lot of high

00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:54.803
multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.

00:11:54.803 --> 00:11:57.093
So you show them their data, you show them they are bad

00:11:57.093 --> 00:11:59.779
and they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:03.635
this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.

00:12:03.635 --> 00:12:06.580
That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.172
and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.

00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:14.755
Now in a sense, when we think about the effect

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:17.235
of video games on the brain, it's very similar

00:12:17.235 --> 00:12:21.099
to the effect of wine on the health.

00:12:21.099 --> 00:12:24.139
There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:28.355
very poor uses of video games. But when consumed

00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:31.836
in reasonable doses, and at the right age,

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:35.107
wine can be very good for health. There are actually

00:12:35.107 --> 00:12:38.371
specific molecules that have been identified

00:12:38.371 --> 00:12:44.203
in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.

00:12:44.203 --> 00:12:47.475
So it's the same way, like those action video games

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.137
have a number of ingredients that are actually really

00:12:49.137 --> 00:12:53.107
powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,

00:12:53.107 --> 00:12:56.712
vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on

00:12:56.712 --> 00:12:59.467
understanding what are those active ingredients so that

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:03.357
we can really then leverage them to deliver better games,

00:13:03.357 --> 00:13:07.600
either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.379
Now because we are interested in having an impact

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:13.867
for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually

00:13:13.867 --> 00:13:17.283
not that interested in how those of you that choose

00:13:17.283 --> 00:13:21.155
to play video games for many hours on end perform.

00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:24.980
I'm much more interested in taking any of you

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.760
and showing that by forcing you to play an action game,

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.623
I can actually change your vision for the better,

00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:33.954
whether you want to play that action game or not, right?

00:13:33.954 --> 00:13:36.370
That's the point of rehabilitation or education.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.296
Most of the kids don't go to school saying,

00:13:38.296 --> 00:13:41.036
"Great, two hours of math!"

00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:45.475
So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that,

00:13:45.475 --> 00:13:47.939
we need to go one more step.

00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:50.963
And one more step is to do training studies.

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:54.363
So let me illustrate that step with

00:13:54.363 --> 00:13:57.931
a task which is called mental rotation.

00:13:57.931 --> 00:14:02.106
Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you,

00:14:02.106 --> 00:14:03.991
and again you're going to do the task,

00:14:03.991 --> 00:14:07.676
to look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape,

00:14:07.676 --> 00:14:10.930
and I'm going to present to you four different shapes.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.770
One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:18.074
version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:

00:14:18.074 --> 00:14:22.915
the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?

00:14:22.915 --> 00:14:25.332
Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one.

00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:29.862
One more. Get those brains working. Come on.

00:14:29.862 --> 00:14:34.836
That's our target shape.

00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:38.539
Third. Good! This is hard, right?

00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:40.026
Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because

00:14:40.026 --> 00:14:42.760
you really feel your brain cringing, right?

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.192
It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.

00:14:46.192 --> 00:14:48.897
Well, what we do in these training studies is, people

00:14:48.897 --> 00:14:51.506
come to the lab, they do tasks like this one,

00:14:51.506 --> 00:14:55.836
we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.

00:14:55.836 --> 00:14:58.582
They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.

00:14:58.582 --> 00:15:01.692
They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:05.993
several days over a period of two weeks.

00:15:05.993 --> 00:15:07.789
Then, once they are done with the training, they come back

00:15:07.789 --> 00:15:11.762
a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type

00:15:11.762 --> 00:15:15.378
of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague

00:15:15.378 --> 00:15:17.913
in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,

00:15:17.913 --> 00:15:20.111
you know, subjects perform where they are expected

00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:25.321
to perform given their age. After two weeks of training

00:15:25.321 --> 00:15:29.177
on action video games, they actually perform better,

00:15:29.177 --> 00:15:34.533
and the improvement is still there five months after

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:37.401
having done the training. That's really, really important.

00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:39.881
Why? Because I told you we want to use these games

00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:43.081
for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects

00:15:43.081 --> 00:15:46.017
that are going to be long-lasting.

00:15:46.017 --> 00:15:48.870
Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.503
well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market

00:15:52.503 --> 00:15:55.055
a game that would be good for the attention

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:58.575
of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,

00:15:58.575 --> 00:16:01.158
or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision

00:16:01.158 --> 00:16:04.967
of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?

00:16:04.967 --> 00:16:09.447
Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.

00:16:09.447 --> 00:16:11.358
There are brain scientists like me that are beginning

00:16:11.358 --> 00:16:14.615
to understand what are the good ingredients in games

00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:17.720
to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.294
to call the broccoli side of the equation.

00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:25.030
There is an entertainment software industry

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.502
which is extremely deft at coming up with

00:16:28.502 --> 00:16:32.646
appealing products that you can't resist.

00:16:32.646 --> 00:16:36.174
That's the chocolate side of the equation.

00:16:36.174 --> 00:16:39.198
The issue is we need to put the two together,

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.454
and it's a little bit like with food.

00:16:41.454 --> 00:16:45.095
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?

00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:47.354
None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had

00:16:47.354 --> 00:16:49.686
that feeling, right, picking up an education game

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:53.078
and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun,

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:55.495
it's not really engaging. So what we need

00:16:55.495 --> 00:16:58.846
is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate

00:16:58.846 --> 00:17:02.857
that is irresistible, that you really want to play,

00:17:02.857 --> 00:17:05.842
but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients

00:17:05.842 --> 00:17:09.070
that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.909
but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it,

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:16.385
but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,

00:17:16.385 --> 00:17:19.348
people that work in the entertainment software industry,

00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:22.086
and publishers, so these are not people that usually

00:17:22.086 --> 00:17:24.423
meet every day, but it's actually doable,

00:17:24.423 --> 00:17:27.070
and we are on the right track.

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.852
I'd like to leave you with that thought,

00:17:28.852 --> 00:17:32.219
and thank you for your attention. (Applause)

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:36.219
(Applause)
