Tommy Mizzone: Tonight we're going to play you two songs.

00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:05.222
We're three brothers from New Jersey,

00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:06.870
and the funny thing is that,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.510
believe it or not, we are hooked on bluegrass

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.666
and we're excited to play it for you tonight.

00:00:11.666 --> 00:02:07.480

Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.

00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:20.831
I'm Robbie Mizzone. I'm 13, and I play the fiddle.

00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:23.391
This is my brother, Jonny. He's 10, and he plays the banjo.

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:26.120
And on guitar is my 14-year-old brother, Tommy.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.967

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:32.922
We call ourselves the Sleepy Man Banjo Boys.
