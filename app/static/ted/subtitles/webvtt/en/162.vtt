00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:06.920
I would like to tell you about a project
which I started about 16 years ago.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.412
It's about making new forms of life.

00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:15.976
And these are made of this kind of tube --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.976
electricity tube, we call it in Holland.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.976
And we can start a film about that,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.620
and we can see a little bit
backwards in time.

00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:31.976
(Video) Narrator: Eventually, these beasts
are going to live in herds on the beaches.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.071
Theo Jansen is working hard
on this evolution.

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:43.976
Theo Jansen: I want to put
these forms of life on the beaches.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.976
And they should survive over there,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.637
on their own, in the future.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.904
Learning to live on their own --

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:59.555
and it'll take couple of more years

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.339
to let them walk on their own.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:08.001
Narrator: The mechanical beasts
will not get their energy from food,

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:09.182
but from the wind.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.381
The wind will move feathers on their back,
which will drive their feet.

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:17.729
The beast walks sideways
on the wet sand of the beach,

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:20.044
with its nose pointed into the wind.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:26.712
As soon as it walks into
either the rolling surf or the dry sand,

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:30.062
it stops, and walks
in the opposite direction.

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:35.824
Evolution has generated many species.

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:42.295
(Music)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.205
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.002
(Music)

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:01.976
(Laughter)

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.738
(Applause)

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.976
TJ: This is a herd, and it is built
according to genetic codes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.976
And it is a sort of race,
and each and every animal is different,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.171
and the winning codes will multiply.

00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:26.949
This is the wave,
going from left to right.

00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:28.123
You can see this one.

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:35.360
Yes, and now it goes from left to right.

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:38.666
This is a new generation, a new family,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.078
which is able to store the wind.

00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:45.315
So, the wings pump up air
in lemonade bottles,

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:46.609
which are on top of that.

00:02:47.213 --> 00:02:52.977
And they can use that energy
in case the wind falls away,

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:54.492
and the tide is coming up,

00:02:54.516 --> 00:03:00.301
and there is still a little bit of energy
to reach the dunes and save their lives,

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:02.325
because they are drowned very easily.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.472
(Laughter)

00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:09.328
I could show you this animal.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.311
(Applause)

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:21.538
Thank you.

00:03:21.562 --> 00:03:25.976
(Applause)

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.442
So, the proportion of the tubes in this
animal is very important for the walking.

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:36.078
There are 11 numbers,
which I call The 11 Holy Numbers.

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:40.976
These are the distances of the tubes
which make it walk that way.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.976
In fact, it's a new
invention of the wheel.

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:45.976
It works the same as a wheel.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.467
The axis of a wheel
stays on the same level,

00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:52.583
and this hip is staying
on the same level as well.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.503
In fact, this is better than a wheel,

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:59.976
because when you try to drive
your bicycle on the beach,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.361
you will notice it's very hard to do.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:08.665
And the feet just step over the sand,

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.268
and the wheel has to touch every piece
of the ground in-between.

00:04:13.228 --> 00:04:17.149
So 5,000 years after
the invention of the wheel,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.450
we have a new wheel.

00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:20.976
I will show you, in the next video --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.474
can you start it, please? --

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:28.491
that very heavy loads can be moved.

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.976
There's a guy pushing there, behind,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.976
but it can also walk
on the wind very well.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.623
It's 3.2 tons.

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:48.793
This is working on the stored
wind in the bottles.

00:04:48.817 --> 00:04:52.785
It has a feeler, where it can
feel obstacles and turn around.

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.572
You see, it's going the other way.

00:05:06.098 --> 00:05:07.589
Can I have the feeler here?

00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.454
OK. Good.

00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:23.283
So, they have to survive
all the dangers of the beach,

00:05:23.307 --> 00:05:25.199
and one of the big dangers is the sea.

00:05:25.223 --> 00:05:26.493
This is the sea.

00:05:27.113 --> 00:05:30.160
And it must feel the water of the sea.

00:05:30.842 --> 00:05:32.976
And this is the water feeler,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.980
and what's very important is this tube.

00:05:35.693 --> 00:05:39.976
It sucks in air normally,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.082
but when it swallows water,
it feels the resistance of it.

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:48.436
So, imagine that the animal
is walking towards the sea.

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:54.999
As soon as it touches the water --

00:05:55.023 --> 00:06:01.611
you should hear a sound of running air.

00:06:06.235 --> 00:06:07.291
(Sound of running air)

00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:08.482
Yes!

00:06:11.627 --> 00:06:15.884
So if it doesn't feel,
it will be drowned, OK?

00:06:22.178 --> 00:06:24.146
Here we have the brain of the animal.

00:06:25.903 --> 00:06:30.023
In fact, it is a step counter,
and it counts the steps.

00:06:30.468 --> 00:06:31.976
It's a binary step counter.

00:06:32.587 --> 00:06:35.630
So as soon it has been to the sea,

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:40.807
it changes the pattern
of zeroes and ones here.

00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:45.894
And it always knows
where it is on the beach.

00:06:45.918 --> 00:06:48.257
So it's very simple brain.

00:06:48.654 --> 00:06:52.456
It says, well, there's the sea,
there are dunes, and I'm here.

00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:58.229
So it's a sort of imagination
of the simple world of the beach animal.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:06:59.959
Thank you.

00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:07.547
One of the biggest enemies are the storms.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.047
This is a part of the nose
of the Animaris Percipiere.

00:07:17.285 --> 00:07:20.467
When the nose of the animal
is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:27.046
So when the storm is coming up,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.459
it drives a pin into the ground.

00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:33.999
(Laughter)

00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:35.188
Audience member: Wow!

00:07:35.212 --> 00:07:37.334
The nose is fixed,
the whole animal is fixed.

00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:41.345
The wind may turn, but the animal
will always turn its nose into the wind.

00:07:44.308 --> 00:07:49.809
Now, another couple of years, and these
animals will survive on their own.

00:07:50.277 --> 00:07:51.833
I still have to help them a lot.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.507
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:56.024
(Applause)
