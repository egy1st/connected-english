00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:04.642
Hi. I'm here to talk about congestion,

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:05.996
namely road congestion.

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:08.257
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon.

00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:11.117
It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world,

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:13.065
which is a little bit surprising when you think about it.

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:16.028
I mean, think about how different cities are, actually.

00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:17.790
I mean, you have the typical European cities,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.782
with a dense urban core, good public transportation

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:23.237
mostly, not a lot of road capacity.

00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:25.686
But then, on the other hand, you have the American cities.

00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:28.477
It's moving by itself, okay.

00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:31.483
Anyway, the American cities:

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:34.411
lots of roads dispersed over large areas,

00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:35.870
almost no public transportation.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.080
And then you have the emerging world cities,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.606
with a mixed variety of vehicles,

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.148
mixed land-use patterns, also rather dispersed

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:44.747
but often with a very dense urban core.

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:47.149
And traffic planners all around the world have tried

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.803
lots of different measures: dense cities or dispersed cities,

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:53.354
lots of roads or lots of public transport

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:56.140
or lots of bike lanes or more information,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.934
or lots of different things, but nothing seems to work.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.937
But all of these attempts have one thing in common.

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:05.288
They're basically attempts at figuring out

00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:08.615
what people should do instead of rush hour car driving.

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:11.727
They're essentially, to a point, attempts at planning

00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:14.929
what other people should do, planning their life for them.

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.381
Now, planning a complex social system

00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:20.456
is a very hard thing to do, and let me tell you a story.

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:23.183
Back in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell,

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.805
an urban planner in London got a phone call

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:28.355
from a colleague in Moscow saying, basically,

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.873
"Hi, this is Vladimir. I'd like to know,

00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:33.895
who's in charge of London's bread supply?"

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:35.548
And the urban planner in London goes,

00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:37.518
"What do you mean, who's in charge of London's â€”

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:38.789
I mean, no one is in charge."

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.671
"Oh, but surely someone must be in charge.

00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:44.327
I mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this."

00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:47.433
"No. No. No one is in charge.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:50.034
I mean, it basically -- I haven't really thought of it.

00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:52.623
It basically organizes itself."

00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:55.200
It organizes itself.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.043
That's an example of a complex social system

00:01:58.043 --> 00:02:00.771
which has the ability of self-organizing,

00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:03.359
and this is a very deep insight.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.672
When you try to solve really complex social problems,

00:02:06.672 --> 00:02:08.388
the right thing to do is most of the time

00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:09.979
to create the incentives.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.923
You don't plan the details,

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.543
and people will figure out what to do,

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:16.403
how to adapt to this new framework.

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.894
And let's now look at how we can use this insight

00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:21.530
to combat road congestion.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.762
This is a map of Stockholm, my hometown.

00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:27.403
Now, Stockholm is a medium-sized city, roughly two million people,

00:02:27.403 --> 00:02:30.192
but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:33.469
means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges, old bridges --

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.504
which means lots of road congestion.

00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:40.144
And these red dots show the most congested parts,

00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:42.721
which are the bridges that lead into the inner city.

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.247
And then someone came up with the idea that,

00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:47.084
apart from good public transport,

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:49.685
apart from spending money on roads,

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:53.900
let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.824
Now, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money,

00:02:56.824 --> 00:02:59.481
I mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc.,

00:02:59.481 --> 00:03:02.199
so you would probably expect that car drivers

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.637
wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge.

00:03:04.637 --> 00:03:05.937
You would be wrong.

00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:09.965
One or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:12.349
disappear from rush hours.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.900
Now, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.107
but you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right?

00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:19.976
Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic.

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:23.243
Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be

00:03:23.243 --> 00:03:25.935
a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:29.076
once you reach above a certain capacity threshold

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:32.244
then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:34.704
But fortunately, it also works the other way around.

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:38.035
If you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion

00:03:38.035 --> 00:03:41.664
will go down much faster than you might think.

00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:44.555
Now, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:49.159
on January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.142
of Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2.

00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:56.955
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this.

00:03:56.955 --> 00:03:59.875
This is what happens when you take away

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.940
20 percent of the cars from the streets.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.650
You really reduce congestion quite substantially.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.308
But, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right?

00:04:08.308 --> 00:04:10.810
So after a while they would all come back because they

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.758
have sort of gotten used to charges.

00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:16.434
Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:18.417
since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm,

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:22.406
and we basically have the same low traffic levels still.

00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:24.677
But you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:26.140
in 2007.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.529
Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges,

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.625
they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:35.594
in January and then abolished again at the end of July,

00:04:35.594 --> 00:04:38.188
followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced

00:04:38.188 --> 00:04:42.388
again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.

00:04:42.388 --> 00:04:46.525
I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with,

00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:48.306
and we actually got to do it twice.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:50.415
And personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so,

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:51.903
but they won't let me do that.

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.088
But it was fun anyway.

00:04:54.088 --> 00:04:57.473
So, we followed up. What happened?

00:04:57.473 --> 00:05:01.339
This is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31,

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:03.117
and you see the same street but now it's summer,

00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:04.861
and summer in Stockholm is a very nice

00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:07.111
and light time of the year,

00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:09.954
and the first day without the congestion charges

00:05:09.954 --> 00:05:11.321
looked like this.

00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:13.984
All the cars were back again, and you even have to admire

00:05:13.984 --> 00:05:16.894
the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly.

00:05:16.894 --> 00:05:19.141
The first day they all came back.

00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:24.491
And this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.822
Now these traffic figures are really exciting

00:05:26.822 --> 00:05:29.473
and a little bit surprising and very useful to know,

00:05:29.473 --> 00:05:32.232
but I would say that the most surprising slide here

00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:36.262
I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one.

00:05:36.262 --> 00:05:39.593
This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm,

00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:42.262
and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced

00:05:42.262 --> 00:05:46.579
in the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it.

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:49.607
Seventy percent of the population didn't want this.

00:05:49.607 --> 00:05:51.255
But what happened when the congestion charges

00:05:51.255 --> 00:05:54.716
were there is not what you would expect, that people hated it more and more.

00:05:54.716 --> 00:05:57.869
No, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:01.570
where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges,

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.411
meaning that -- I mean, let me repeat that:

00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.218
70 percent of the population in Stockholm

00:06:06.218 --> 00:06:10.211
want to keep a price for something that used to be free.

00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:13.837
Okay. So why can that be? Why is that?

00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:16.837
Well, think about it this way. Who changed?

00:06:16.837 --> 00:06:19.463
I mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared,

00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:21.408
surely they must be discontent in a way.

00:06:21.408 --> 00:06:23.742
And where did they go? If we can understand this,

00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:27.872
then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.

00:06:27.872 --> 00:06:30.274
Well, so we did this huge interview survey

00:06:30.274 --> 00:06:32.109
with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out

00:06:32.109 --> 00:06:33.864
who changed, and where did they go?

00:06:33.864 --> 00:06:38.278
And it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter)

00:06:38.278 --> 00:06:43.126
For some reason, the car drivers are --

00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:46.622
they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do.

00:06:46.622 --> 00:06:48.878
And why is that? It's because that travel patterns

00:06:48.878 --> 00:06:51.277
are much less stable than you might think.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:54.108
Each day, people make new decisions, and people change

00:06:54.108 --> 00:06:56.533
and the world changes around them, and each day

00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:59.786
all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.753
away from rush hour car driving

00:07:01.753 --> 00:07:04.337
in a way that people don't even notice.

00:07:04.337 --> 00:07:06.382
They're not even aware of this themselves.

00:07:06.382 --> 00:07:09.183
And the other question, who changed their mind?

00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:11.149
Who changed their opinion, and why?

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:13.675
So we did another interview survey, tried to figure out

00:07:13.675 --> 00:07:18.051
why people changed their mind, and what type of group changed their minds?

00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:20.944
And after analyzing the answers, it turned out that

00:07:20.944 --> 00:07:24.829
more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds.

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:27.116
They're actually confident that they have

00:07:27.116 --> 00:07:29.805
liked congestion pricing all along.

00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:31.524
Which means that we are now in a position

00:07:31.524 --> 00:07:34.517
where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon

00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:37.728
with 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers,

00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:41.275
and people aren't even aware that they have changed,

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:45.186
and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:48.660
This is the power of nudges when trying to solve

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.292
complex social problems, and when you do that,

00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:54.922
you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt.

00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:57.109
You should just nudge them in the right direction.

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:58.831
And if you do it right,

00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:00.883
people will actually embrace the change,

00:08:00.883 --> 00:08:03.945
and if you do it right, people will actually even like it.

00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:07.270
Thank you. (Applause)
