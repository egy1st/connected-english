00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:05.698
Life is about opportunities --
creating them and embracing them.

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:08.809
And for me, that was the Olympic dream.

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:11.638
That's what defined me. That was my bliss.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.677
As a cross-country skier
and member of the Australian ski team

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:17.808
headed towards the Winter Olympics,

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:21.212
I was on a training bike ride
with my fellow teammates.

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:25.540
As we made our way up
towards the spectacular Blue Mountains

00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:26.715
west of Sydney,

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.179
it was the perfect autumn day:

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:33.365
sunshine, the smell
of eucalypt and a dream.

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:34.634
Life was good.

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:37.861
We'd been on our bikes
for around five-and-a-half hours

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:40.311
when we got to the part
of the ride that I loved,

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:43.056
and that was the hills,
because I loved the hills.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.981
I got up off the seat of my bike
and I started pumping my legs,

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.823
and as I sucked in the cold mountain air,
I could feel it burning my lungs,

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:53.953
and I looked up to see
the sun shining in my face.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.998
And then everything went black.

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:00.691
Where was I? What was happening?

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:03.541
My body was consumed by pain.

00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:07.668
I'd been hit by a speeding utility truck

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:10.227
with only 10 minutes
to go on the bike ride.

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:14.166
I was airlifted from the scene
of the accident by a rescue helicopter

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.461
to a large spinal unit in Sydney.

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:19.231
I had extensive
and life-threatening injuries.

00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:23.234
I'd broken my neck
and my back in six places.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.201
I broke five ribs on my left side.

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:29.009
I broke my right arm.
I broke my collarbone.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:30.878
I broke some bones in my feet.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.405
My whole right side was ripped open,
filled with gravel.

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.810
My head was cut open
across the front, lifted back,

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:38.507
exposing the skull underneath.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.633
I had head injures.
I had internal injuries.

00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:41.987
I had massive blood loss.

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:44.090
In fact, I lost
about five liters of blood,

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:46.669
which is all someone my size
would actually hold.

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:50.263
By the time the helicopter arrived
at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney,

00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:52.867
my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:55.987
I was having a really bad day.

00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:02.342
(Laughter)

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.176
For over 10 days, I drifted
between two dimensions.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.399
I had an awareness of being in my body,

00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:12.675
but also being out of my body,
somewhere else,

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.722
watching from above,
as if it was happening to someone else.

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:19.104
Why would I want to go back
to a body that was so broken?

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:21.912
But this voice kept calling me:

00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:24.130
"Come on, stay with me."

00:02:24.663 --> 00:02:26.932
"No, it's too hard."

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.867
"Come on. This is our opportunity."

00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:34.477
"No. That body is broken.
It can no longer serve me."

00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:38.426
"Come on. Stay with me. We can do it.
We can do it together."

00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:41.253
I was at a crossroads.

00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:45.539
I knew if I didn't return to my body,
I'd have to leave this world forever.

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:48.406
It was the fight of my life.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:54.043
After 10 days, I made the decision
to return to my body.

00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.316
And the internal bleeding stopped.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:02.137
The next concern
was whether I would walk again,

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.471
because I was paralyzed
from the waist down.

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:08.154
They said to my parents
that the neck break was a stable fracture,

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:09.919
but the back was completely crushed:

00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:13.329
the vertebra at L1
was like you'd dropped a peanut,

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:16.444
stepped on it, smashed it
into thousands of pieces.

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:17.860
They'd have to operate.

00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:21.382
They went in. They put me on a beanbag.

00:03:21.406 --> 00:03:23.490
They cut me -- literally cut me in half.

00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:25.948
I have a scar that wraps
around my entire body.

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:29.717
They picked as much
broken bone as they could

00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.418
that had lodged in my spinal cord.

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:35.376
They took out two of my broken ribs
and they rebuilt my back --

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.043
L1, they rebuilt it,
they took out another broken rib,

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:41.456
they fused T12, L1 and L2 together.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.661
Then they stitched me up;
they took an entire hour to stitch me up.

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:46.314
I woke up in intensive care,

00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:49.970
and the doctors were really excited
that the operation had been a success,

00:03:49.994 --> 00:03:52.565
because at that stage,
I had a little bit of movement

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:53.747
in one of my big toes,

00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.811
and I thought, "Great,
because I'm going to the Olympics!"

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:58.871
(Laughter)

00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:00.501
I had no idea.

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:04.057
That's the sort of thing that happens
to someone else, not me, surely.

00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:06.462
But then the doctor
came over to me and she said,

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:09.296
"Janine, the operation was a success,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.058
and we've picked as much bone
out of your spinal cord as we could.

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:14.471
But the damage is permanent.

00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:17.543
The central nervous system
nerves -- there is no cure.

00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:20.416
You're what we call a partial paraplegic,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.408
and you'll have all of the injuries
that go along with that.

00:04:23.432 --> 00:04:26.295
You'll have no feeling
from the waist down,

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.346
and at most, you might get
10 or 20 percent return.

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:32.758
You'll have internal injuries
for the rest of your life.

00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:35.517
You'll have to use a catheter
for the rest of your life.

00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:40.678
And if you walk again, it will be
with calipers and a walking frame."

00:04:40.702 --> 00:04:41.877
And then she said,

00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:45.027
"Janine, you'll have to rethink
everything you do in your life,

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:48.722
because you're never going to be able
to do the things you did before."

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:49.823
(Gasps)

00:04:49.847 --> 00:04:52.259
I tried to grasp what she was saying.

00:04:52.283 --> 00:04:55.000
I was an athlete. That's all I knew.
That's all I'd done.

00:04:55.024 --> 00:04:57.828
If I couldn't do that,
then what could I do?

00:04:57.852 --> 00:04:59.662
And the question I asked myself is:

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:01.163
If I couldn't do that,

00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:03.357
then who was I?

00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:11.125
They moved me from intensive care
to acute spinal.

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:13.379
I was lying on a thin, hard spinal bed.

00:05:13.403 --> 00:05:14.864
I had no movement in my legs.

00:05:14.888 --> 00:05:18.236
I had tight stockings on
to protect from blood clots.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.127
I had one arm in plaster,
one arm tied down by drips.

00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:24.127
I had a neck brace and sandbags
on either side of my head

00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:26.097
and I saw my world through a mirror

00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:28.195
that was suspended above my head.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.553
I shared the ward with five other people,

00:05:32.577 --> 00:05:33.879
and the amazing thing is,

00:05:33.903 --> 00:05:37.449
because we were all lying paralyzed
in a spinal ward,

00:05:37.473 --> 00:05:39.879
we didn't know
what each other looked like.

00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:41.697
How amazing is that?

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:47.855
How often in life do you get to make
friendships, judgment-free,

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.845
purely based on spirit?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.433
And there were
no superficial conversations

00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:56.507
as we shared our innermost
thoughts, our fears,

00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:59.483
and our hopes for life
after the spinal ward.

00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:04.953
I remember one night,
one of the nurses came in, Jonathan,

00:06:04.977 --> 00:06:08.027
with a whole lot of plastic straws.

00:06:08.051 --> 00:06:10.313
He put a pile on top
of each of us, and he said,

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:12.513
"Start threading them together."

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:16.463
Well, there wasn't much else to do
in the spinal ward, so we did.

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:17.512
(Laughter)

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:20.353
And when we'd finished,
he went around silently

00:06:20.377 --> 00:06:25.693
and he joined all of the straws up
till it looped around the whole ward.

00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:26.884
And then he said,

00:06:26.908 --> 00:06:29.752
"OK everybody, hold on to your straws."

00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:33.027
And we did. And he said, "Right ...

00:06:33.953 --> 00:06:35.868
Now we're all connected."

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:41.708
And as we held on and we breathed as one,

00:06:42.773 --> 00:06:45.343
we knew we weren't on this journey alone.

00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:50.759
And even lying paralyzed
in the spinal ward ...

00:06:51.742 --> 00:06:54.935
there were moments of incredible
depth and richness,

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:57.435
of authenticity and connection

00:06:58.243 --> 00:07:00.641
that I had never experienced before.

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.476
And each of us knew
that when we left the spinal ward,

00:07:07.237 --> 00:07:08.892
we would never be the same.

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:15.024
After six months, it was time to go home.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.442
I remember Dad pushing me
outside in my wheelchair,

00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:21.600
wrapped in a plaster body cast,

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:25.606
and feeling the sun on my face
for the first time.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.029
I soaked it up and I thought,

00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:30.281
"How could I ever
have taken this for granted?"

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.201
I felt so incredibly grateful for my life.

00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:36.583
But before I left hospital,

00:07:36.607 --> 00:07:39.639
the head nurse had said to me,
"Janine, I want you to be ready,

00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:42.348
because when you get home,
something's going to happen."

00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:43.537
And I said, "What?"

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:46.274
And she said, "You're going
to get depressed."

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:49.284
And I said, "Not me,
not Janine the Machine,"

00:07:49.308 --> 00:07:51.022
which was my nickname.

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:54.129
She said, "You are, because,
see, it happens to everyone.

00:07:54.153 --> 00:07:58.404
In the spinal ward, that's normal.
You're in a wheelchair. That's normal.

00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:02.023
But you're going to get home
and realize how different life is."

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.086
And I got home.

00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:06.729
And something happened.

00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:10.714
I realized Sister Sam was right.

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:13.388
I did get depressed.

00:08:14.943 --> 00:08:16.696
I was in my wheelchair.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.573
I had no feeling from the waist down,

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:20.050
attached to a catheter bottle.

00:08:20.074 --> 00:08:21.224
I couldn't walk.

00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:23.980
I'd lost so much weight in hospital,

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.576
I now weighed about 80 pounds.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.886
And I wanted to give up.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.982
All I wanted to do was put my running
shoes on and run out the door.

00:08:34.006 --> 00:08:37.165
I wanted my old life back.
I wanted my body back.

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:39.591
And I can remember
Mom sitting on the end of my bed

00:08:39.615 --> 00:08:42.597
and saying, "I wonder if life
will ever be good again."

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:45.511
And I thought, "How could it?

00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:49.826
Because I've lost
everything that I valued,

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.959
everything that I'd worked towards.

00:08:51.983 --> 00:08:53.133
Gone."

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:58.809
And the question I asked was,
"Why me? Why me?"

00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:01.437
And then I remembered

00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.752
my friends that were still
in the spinal ward,

00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:07.086
particularly Maria.

00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:09.348
Maria was in a car accident,

00:09:09.372 --> 00:09:11.297
and she woke up on her 16th birthday

00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:14.416
to the news that she was
a complete quadriplegic,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.709
had no movement from the neck down,

00:09:16.733 --> 00:09:19.731
had damage to her vocal chords,
and she couldn't talk.

00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:23.100
They told me, "We're going
to move you next to her

00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:25.160
because we think it will be good for her."

00:09:26.193 --> 00:09:29.926
I was worried. I didn't know
how I'd react to being next to her.

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:34.569
I knew it would be challenging,
but it was actually a blessing,

00:09:34.593 --> 00:09:39.412
because Maria always smiled.

00:09:39.436 --> 00:09:44.172
She was always happy,
and even when she began to talk again,

00:09:44.196 --> 00:09:49.428
albeit difficult to understand,
she never complained, not once.

00:09:50.198 --> 00:09:55.200
And I wondered how had she ever
found that level of acceptance.

00:09:55.758 --> 00:10:00.025
And I realized
that this wasn't just my life;

00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:01.834
it was life itself.

00:10:02.409 --> 00:10:06.819
I realized that this wasn't just my pain;
it was everybody's pain.

00:10:07.314 --> 00:10:10.160
And then I knew, just like before,

00:10:10.184 --> 00:10:13.962
that I had a choice:
I could keep fighting this,

00:10:14.944 --> 00:10:19.547
or I could let go
and accept not only my body,

00:10:19.571 --> 00:10:21.965
but the circumstances of my life.

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.720
And then I stopped asking, "Why me?"

00:10:26.476 --> 00:10:28.805
And I started to ask, "Why not me?"

00:10:29.932 --> 00:10:32.224
And then I thought to myself,

00:10:32.248 --> 00:10:36.879
maybe being at rock bottom
is actually the perfect place to start.

00:10:41.396 --> 00:10:44.415
I had never before thought of myself
as a creative person.

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:47.600
I was an athlete; my body was a machine.

00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:52.935
But now I was about to embark
on the most creative project

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:54.943
that any of us could ever do:

00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:56.802
that of rebuilding a life.

00:10:57.992 --> 00:11:01.427
And even though I had absolutely
no idea what I was going to do,

00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:04.691
in that uncertainty came
a sense of freedom.

00:11:05.619 --> 00:11:07.898
I was no longer tied to a set path.

00:11:08.605 --> 00:11:13.504
I was free to explore
life's infinite possibilities.

00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:18.388
And that realization
was about to change my life.

00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:25.184
Sitting at home in my wheelchair
and my plaster body cast,

00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:27.351
an airplane flew overhead.

00:11:28.482 --> 00:11:32.153
I looked up, and I thought
to myself, "That's it!

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:35.621
If I can't walk,
then I might as well fly."

00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:36.660
(Laughter)

00:11:36.684 --> 00:11:39.313
I said, "Mom, I'm going
to learn how to fly."

00:11:39.337 --> 00:11:41.091
She said, "That's nice, dear."

00:11:41.115 --> 00:11:43.190
(Laughter)

00:11:43.214 --> 00:11:45.585
I said, "Pass me the yellow pages."

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:48.342
She passed me the phone book,
I rang up the flying school,

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:51.187
I said I'd like to make a booking
to come out for a flight.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.527
They said, "When do you want to come out?"

00:11:53.551 --> 00:11:57.121
I said, "Well, I have to get a friend
to drive me because I can't drive.

00:11:57.145 --> 00:11:59.539
Sort of can't walk, either.
Is that a problem?"

00:11:59.563 --> 00:12:01.213
I made a booking, and weeks later,

00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:04.010
my friend Chris and my mom
drove me out to the airport,

00:12:04.034 --> 00:12:06.432
all 80 pounds of me covered
in a plaster body cast

00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:07.890
in a baggy pair of overalls.

00:12:07.914 --> 00:12:09.012
(Laughter)

00:12:09.036 --> 00:12:11.792
I can tell you, I did not
look like the ideal candidate

00:12:11.816 --> 00:12:13.182
to get a pilot's license.

00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:14.800
(Laughter)

00:12:14.824 --> 00:12:17.277
I'm holding on to the counter
because I can't stand.

00:12:17.301 --> 00:12:19.365
I said, "Hi, I'm here
for a flying lesson."

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:23.023
They took one look and ran
out the back to draw short straws.

00:12:23.047 --> 00:12:25.990
"You get her." "No, no, you take her."

00:12:26.014 --> 00:12:29.209
Finally a guy goes, "Hi, I'm Andrew.
I'm going to take you flying."

00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:30.407
I go, "Great!"

00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:32.126
They get me out on the tarmac,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.618
and there was this red, white and blue
airplane -- it was beautiful.

00:12:35.642 --> 00:12:39.428
They had to slide me up on the wing
to put me in the cockpit.

00:12:39.452 --> 00:12:42.211
They sat me down. There are buttons
and dials everywhere.

00:12:42.235 --> 00:12:45.840
I'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know
what all these buttons and dials do?"

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:48.515
Andrew got in the front,
started the plane, and said,

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:50.517
"Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"

00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:53.287
That's when you use your feet
to control the rudder pedals

00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:55.158
to control the airplane on the ground.

00:12:55.182 --> 00:12:57.057
I said, "No, I can't use my legs."

00:12:57.081 --> 00:12:58.264
He went, "Oh."

00:12:58.288 --> 00:13:01.090
I said, "But I can use
my hands," and he said, "OK."

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:04.047
So he got over to the runway,
and he applied the power.

00:13:04.071 --> 00:13:06.291
And as we took off down the runway,

00:13:06.315 --> 00:13:10.015
and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac,
and we became airborne,

00:13:11.062 --> 00:13:14.689
I had the most incredible
sense of freedom.

00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:17.212
And Andrew said to me,

00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:20.093
as we got over the training area,

00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:22.888
"You see that mountain over there?"

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.793
And I said, "Yeah."

00:13:24.817 --> 00:13:29.294
And he said, "Well, you take the controls,
and you fly towards that mountain."

00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:31.777
And as I looked up, I realized

00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:35.242
that he was pointing
towards the Blue Mountains,

00:13:35.266 --> 00:13:36.969
where the journey had begun.

00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:40.075
And I took the controls,

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:42.342
and I was flying.

00:13:42.978 --> 00:13:45.916
And I was a long, long way
from that spinal ward.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.531
I knew right then
that I was going to be a pilot.

00:13:49.713 --> 00:13:52.345
Didn't know how on Earth
I'd ever pass a medical.

00:13:52.369 --> 00:13:53.479
(Laughter)

00:13:53.503 --> 00:13:56.758
But I'd worry about that later,
because right now, I had a dream.

00:13:56.782 --> 00:14:00.156
So I went home, I got a training
diary out, and I had a plan.

00:14:01.084 --> 00:14:03.803
And I practiced my walking
as much as I could,

00:14:03.827 --> 00:14:06.523
and I went from the point
of two people holding me up ...

00:14:07.573 --> 00:14:09.134
to one person holding me up ...

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.438
to the point where I could
walk around the furniture

00:14:12.462 --> 00:14:14.197
as long as it wasn't too far apart.

00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:15.958
And then I made great progression,

00:14:15.982 --> 00:14:18.268
to the point where I could walk
around the house,

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.982
holding onto the walls, like this.

00:14:20.425 --> 00:14:22.656
And Mom said she was forever following me,

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.179
wiping off my fingerprints.

00:14:24.203 --> 00:14:26.552
(Laughter)

00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:28.716
But at least she always knew where I was.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.818
(Laughter)

00:14:30.842 --> 00:14:33.315
So while the doctors continued to operate

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.391
and put my body back together again,

00:14:35.415 --> 00:14:37.236
I went on with my theory study.

00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:42.395
And then eventually, amazingly,
I passed my pilot's medical,

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:44.627
and that was my green light to fly.

00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:47.469
And I spent every moment I could
out at that flying school,

00:14:47.493 --> 00:14:49.047
way out of my comfort zone,

00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:52.142
all these young guys that wanted
to be Qantas pilots, you know,

00:14:52.166 --> 00:14:55.095
and little old hop-along me
in first my plaster cast,

00:14:55.119 --> 00:14:57.594
and then my steel brace,
my baggy overalls,

00:14:57.618 --> 00:15:01.194
my bag of medication
and catheters and my limp.

00:15:01.218 --> 00:15:02.832
They use to look at me and think,

00:15:02.856 --> 00:15:06.134
"Oh, who is she kidding?
She's never going to be able to do this."

00:15:06.158 --> 00:15:07.942
And sometimes I thought that, too.

00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:09.569
But that didn't matter,

00:15:09.593 --> 00:15:12.375
because now there was something
inside that burned

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:15.415
that far outweighed my injuries.

00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:18.721
And little goals
kept me going along the way,

00:15:18.745 --> 00:15:21.619
and eventually I got
my private pilot's license.

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:26.407
Then I learned to navigate,
and I flew my friends around Australia.

00:15:27.352 --> 00:15:30.303
And then I learned to fly
an airplane with two engines

00:15:30.327 --> 00:15:32.129
and I got my twin-engine rating.

00:15:32.746 --> 00:15:36.056
And then I learned to fly in bad weather
as well as fine weather,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.879
and got my instrument rating.

00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:41.236
And then I got
my commercial pilot's license.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.488
And then I got my instructor rating.

00:15:44.298 --> 00:15:47.158
And then I found myself
back at that same school

00:15:47.182 --> 00:15:49.650
where I'd gone for that very first flight,

00:15:49.674 --> 00:15:51.554
teaching other people how to fly ...

00:15:52.678 --> 00:15:56.792
just under 18 months
after I'd left the spinal ward.

00:15:56.816 --> 00:16:03.816
(Applause)

00:16:06.579 --> 00:16:08.634
(Applause ends)

00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:10.661
And then I thought, "Why stop there?

00:16:10.685 --> 00:16:12.707
Why not learn to fly upside down?"

00:16:12.731 --> 00:16:13.833
(Laughter)

00:16:13.857 --> 00:16:16.643
And I did, and I learned
to fly upside down

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:18.992
and became an aerobatics
flying instructor.

00:16:19.016 --> 00:16:20.864
(Laughter)

00:16:20.888 --> 00:16:23.871
And Mom and Dad? Never been up.

00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:27.363
(Laughter)

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:32.616
But then I knew for certain
that although my body might be limited,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.402
it was my spirit that was unstoppable.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.759
The philosopher Lao Tzu once said,

00:16:41.743 --> 00:16:43.742
"When you let go of what you are,

00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:46.251
you become what you might be."

00:16:47.197 --> 00:16:52.473
I now know that it wasn't until I let go
of who I thought I was

00:16:52.497 --> 00:16:55.581
that I was able to create
a completely new life.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.718
It wasn't until I let go
of the life I thought I should have ...

00:17:01.861 --> 00:17:04.866
that I was able to embrace
the life that was waiting for me.

00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:08.921
I now know that my real strength

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.007
never came from my body.

00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:17.240
And although my physical capabilities
have changed dramatically,

00:17:17.264 --> 00:17:20.303
who I am is unchanged.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:25.267
The pilot light inside of me
was still alight,

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:28.171
just as it is in each and every one of us.

00:17:30.262 --> 00:17:32.062
I know that I'm not my body.

00:17:33.244 --> 00:17:35.637
And I also know that you're not yours.

00:17:36.812 --> 00:17:40.966
And then it no longer matters
what you look like,

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.461
where you come from,
or what you do for a living.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:51.081
All that matters is that we continue
to fan the flame of humanity

00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:55.035
by living our lives
as the ultimate creative expression

00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:57.132
of who we really are,

00:17:58.607 --> 00:18:00.677
because we are all connected

00:18:01.324 --> 00:18:04.226
by millions and millions of straws.

00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:08.832
And it's time to join those up

00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:10.175
and to hang on.

00:18:10.901 --> 00:18:14.139
And if we are to move
towards our collective bliss ...

00:18:15.155 --> 00:18:17.711
it's time we shed our focus
on the physical

00:18:17.735 --> 00:18:21.097
and instead embrace
the virtues of the heart.

00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:23.849
So raise your straws if you'll join me.

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:25.854
(Applause)

00:18:25.878 --> 00:18:27.039
Thank you.

00:18:27.063 --> 00:18:32.110
(Applause)

00:18:32.134 --> 00:18:33.460
Thank you.

00:18:33.484 --> 00:18:37.230
(Applause)
