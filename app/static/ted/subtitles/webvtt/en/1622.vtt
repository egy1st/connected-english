00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:03.381
I'm a designer and an educator.

00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:06.277
I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:12.388
to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.

00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:17.353
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:23.058
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:25.973
A couple of examples.

00:00:25.973 --> 00:00:27.401
Look at that.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:31.014
This is my multitasking activity result. (Laughter)

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:34.669
So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS,

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:37.021
and maybe uploading some pictures

00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.539
about this awesome barbecue.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.573
So someone tells us the story about supertaskers,

00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:47.998
so this two percent of people who are able

00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:52.134
to control multitasking environment.

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:56.738
But what about ourselves, and what about our reality?

00:00:56.738 --> 00:00:59.039
When's the last time you really enjoyed

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.309
just the voice of your friend?

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.565
So this is a project I'm working on,

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:10.609
and this is a series of front covers

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.116
to downgrade our super, hyper â€”

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:20.033
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.841
to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:25.872
into the essence of their function.

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:28.649
Another example: Have you ever been to Venice?

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.962
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:35.345
on the island.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.787
But our multitasking reality is pretty different,

00:01:38.787 --> 00:01:43.059
and full of tons of information.

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:45.596
So what about something like that

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:49.763
to rediscover our sense of adventure?

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:53.036
I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:57.587
when the number of possibilities is so huge,

00:01:57.587 --> 00:02:02.186
but I push you to consider the option of

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:05.303
focusing on just one task,

00:02:05.303 --> 00:02:11.260
or maybe turning your digital senses totally off.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.276
So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:21.020
Why not? So find your monotask spot

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.604
within the multitasking world.

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:25.137
Thank you.

00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:31.815
(Applause)
