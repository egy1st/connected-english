00:00:00.891 --> 00:00:04.105
I'm going to talk about the power of a word:

00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:07.161
jihad.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:11.517
To the vast majority of practicing Muslims,

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:15.541
jihad is an internal struggle for the faith.

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:20.227
It is a struggle within, a struggle against vice, sin,

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:22.517
temptation, lust, greed.

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:26.146
It is a struggle to try and live a life

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:32.844
that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.

00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:38.314
In that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:44.172
to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.

00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:47.918
It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect,

00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:52.900
and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.286
And that's the reason why, for hundreds of years,

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:58.105
Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad,

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:00.627
their daughters as much as their sons, in the same way

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.449
that, say, Christians name their daughters Grace,

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.417
and Hindus, my people, name our daughters Bhakti,

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:13.889
which means, in Sanskrit, spiritual worship.

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:16.654
But there have always been, in Islam, a small group,

00:01:16.654 --> 00:01:19.123
a minority, who believe that jihad

00:01:19.123 --> 00:01:22.097
is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:28.473
against forces that would threaten the faith, or the faithul.

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:31.594
And some of these people believe that in that struggle,

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:35.193
it is sometimes okay to take up arms.

00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:37.900
And so the thousands of young Muslim men

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.817
who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:44.545
to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country,

00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:47.273
in their minds they were fighting a jihad,

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.689
they were doing jihad,

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.481
and they named themselves the Mujahideen,

00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:57.265
which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad.

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:00.105
And we forget this now, but back then

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:04.063
the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country, in America.

00:02:04.063 --> 00:02:06.561
We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:10.317
the good fight to the ungodly communists.

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:12.362
America gave them weapons, gave them money,

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:15.361
gave them support, encouragement.

00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:17.687
But within that group, a tiny, smaller group,

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:21.569
a minority within a minority within a minority,

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.554
were coming up with a new and dangerous

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:27.373
conception of jihad,

00:02:27.373 --> 00:02:32.682
and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden,

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:34.182
and he refined the idea.

00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:38.820
His idea of jihad was a global war of terror,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.330
primarily targeted at the far enemy,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.729
at the crusaders from the West, against America.

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.568
And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.248
were so horrendous, so monstrous,

00:02:51.248 --> 00:02:53.223
and had such great impact,

00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:57.427
that his definition was the one that stuck,

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.706
not just here in the West.

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:02.565
We didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:07.135
We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:12.345
were calling what they did jihad, then that's what jihad must mean.

00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:15.602
But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world,

00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:20.273
his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance.

00:03:20.273 --> 00:03:23.625
A year ago I was in Tunis, and I met the imam

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:25.565
of a very small mosque, an old man.

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:29.530
Fifteen years ago, he named his granddaughter Jihad,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.497
after the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that

00:03:32.497 --> 00:03:36.929
would inspire her to live a spiritual life.

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:39.609
But he told me that after 9/11,

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.289
he began to have second thoughts.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.235
He worried that if he called her by that name,

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:46.760
especially outdoors, outside in public,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.678
he might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad.

00:03:52.678 --> 00:03:55.141
On Fridays in his mosque, he gave sermons

00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:59.558
trying to reclaim the meaning of the word,

00:03:59.558 --> 00:04:03.297
but his congregants, the people who came to his mosque,

00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:05.525
they had seen the videos. They had seen pictures

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:11.267
of the planes going into the towers, the towers coming down.

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:14.293
They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad,

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:17.254
and claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried

00:04:17.254 --> 00:04:21.550
that his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.822
He was wrong. Some people were paying attention,

00:04:24.822 --> 00:04:26.728
but for the wrong reasons.

00:04:26.728 --> 00:04:29.502
The United States, at this point, was putting pressure

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.941
on all its Arab allies, including Tunisia,

00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:36.278
to stamp out extremism in their societies,

00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:39.745
and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:42.616
of the Tunisian intelligence service.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.072
They had never paid him any attention before --

00:04:44.072 --> 00:04:47.297
old man, small mosque --

00:04:47.297 --> 00:04:49.507
but now they began to pay visits,

00:04:49.507 --> 00:04:51.169
and sometimes they would drag him in for questions,

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.517
and always the same question:

00:04:52.517 --> 00:04:56.728
"Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad?

00:04:56.728 --> 00:05:01.327
Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons?

00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:03.392
Do you hate Americans?

00:05:03.392 --> 00:05:07.512
What is your connection to Osama bin Laden?"

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:09.527
So to the Tunisian intelligence agency,

00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:12.360
and organizations like it all over the Arab world,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.824
jihad equaled extremism,

00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:20.758
Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized.

00:05:20.758 --> 00:05:24.547
That was the power of that word that he was able to do.

00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:30.269
And it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness.

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:33.184
He told me that, of bin Laden's many crimes, this was,

00:05:33.184 --> 00:05:36.256
in his mind, one that didn't get enough attention,

00:05:36.256 --> 00:05:40.054
that he took this word, this beautiful idea.

00:05:40.054 --> 00:05:44.520
He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.400
and debased it and corrupted it

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.760
and turned it into something it was never meant to be,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.437
and then persuaded all of us that it always was

00:05:56.437 --> 00:05:59.079
a global jihad.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:02.622
But the good news is

00:06:02.622 --> 00:06:08.401
that the global jihad is almost over, as bin Laden defined it.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.959
It was dying well before he did,

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:13.268
and now it's on its last legs.

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:15.607
Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show

00:06:15.607 --> 00:06:20.159
that there is very little interest among Muslims

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.669
in a global holy war against the West,

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.983
against the far enemy.

00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:30.193
The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling.

00:06:30.193 --> 00:06:32.888
The supply of money — just as important, more important perhaps —

00:06:32.888 --> 00:06:35.551
the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling.

00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:38.359
The wealthy fanatics who were previously

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:44.975
sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous.

00:06:44.975 --> 00:06:46.408
What does that mean for us in the West?

00:06:46.408 --> 00:06:50.127
Does it mean we can break out the champagne,

00:06:50.127 --> 00:06:55.355
wash our hands of it, disengage, sleep easy at night?

00:06:55.355 --> 00:07:00.439
No. Disengagement is not an option,

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:06.935
because if you let local jihad survive,

00:07:06.935 --> 00:07:09.719
it becomes international jihad.

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:12.400
And so there's now a lot of different

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.936
violent jihads all over the world.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:17.223
In Somalia, in Mali, in Nigeria,

00:07:17.223 --> 00:07:22.374
in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, there are groups that claim

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:27.772
to be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden.

00:07:27.772 --> 00:07:29.288
They use his rhetoric.

00:07:29.288 --> 00:07:34.455
They even use the brand name he created for his jihad.

00:07:34.455 --> 00:07:38.613
So there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,

00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:40.242
there's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,

00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:42.892
there is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.

00:07:42.892 --> 00:07:44.979
There are other groups -- in Nigeria, Boko Haram,

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:51.092
in Somalia, al Shabaab -- and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden.

00:07:51.092 --> 00:07:53.026
But if you look closely,

00:07:53.026 --> 00:07:55.827
they're not fighting a global jihad.

00:07:55.827 --> 00:07:59.913
They're fighting battles over much narrower issues.

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:04.282
Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism,

00:08:04.282 --> 00:08:05.474
or it's a power struggle.

00:08:05.474 --> 00:08:07.314
More often than not, it's a power struggle

00:08:07.314 --> 00:08:10.910
in one country, or even a small region within one country.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.874
Occasionally they will go across a border,

00:08:13.874 --> 00:08:20.153
from Iraq to Syria, from Mali to Algeria,

00:08:20.153 --> 00:08:22.033
from Somalia to Kenya, but they're not fighting

00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:27.074
a global jihad against some far enemy.

00:08:27.074 --> 00:08:30.161
But that doesn't mean

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:32.488
that we can relax.

00:08:32.488 --> 00:08:34.739
I was in Yemen recently, where -- it's the home

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:38.050
of the last al Qaeda franchise

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.162
that still aspires to attack America, attack the West.

00:08:42.162 --> 00:08:44.385
It's old school al Qaeda.

00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:45.572
You may remember these guys.

00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:48.253
They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here,

00:08:48.253 --> 00:08:51.202
and they were using the Internet to try and instigate

00:08:51.202 --> 00:08:54.042
violence among American Muslims.

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.382
But they have been distracted recently.

00:08:55.382 --> 00:08:58.089
Last year, they took control over a portion of southern Yemen,

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:00.846
and ran it, Taliban-style.

00:09:00.846 --> 00:09:03.645
And then the Yemeni military got its act together,

00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:06.962
and ordinary people rose up against these guys

00:09:06.962 --> 00:09:10.248
and drove them out, and since then, most of their activities,

00:09:10.248 --> 00:09:14.449
most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:18.490
So I think we've come to a point now where we can say

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.986
that, just like all politics, all jihad is local.

00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:26.458
But that's still not reason for us to disengage,

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:30.203
because we've seen that movie before, in Afghanistan.

00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:34.002
When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union,

00:09:34.002 --> 00:09:36.698
we disengaged.

00:09:36.698 --> 00:09:43.787
And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne,

00:09:43.787 --> 00:09:46.567
the Taliban had taken over in Kabul,

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:50.481
and we said, "Local jihad, not our problem."

00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:53.207
And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar

00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:55.743
to Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem.

00:09:55.743 --> 00:10:02.024
Local jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad again.

00:10:02.024 --> 00:10:05.631
The good news is that it doesn't have to be.

00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:07.804
We know how to fight it now.

00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:10.575
We have the tools. We have the knowhow,

00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:12.162
and we can take the lessons we've learned

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:16.063
from the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad,

00:10:16.063 --> 00:10:19.543
and apply those to local jihad.

00:10:19.543 --> 00:10:24.335
What are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden:

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:26.270
SEAL Team Six.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.732
Do we know, do we understand, who killed bin Ladenism?

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:34.095
Who ended the global jihad?

00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:37.466
There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad.

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:41.744
Who killed bin Ladenism? Let's start with bin Laden himself.

00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:44.135
He probably thought 9/11 was his greatest achievement.

00:10:44.135 --> 00:10:48.287
In reality, it was the beginning of the end for him.

00:10:48.287 --> 00:10:51.159
He killed 3,000 innocent people, and that filled

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:55.343
the Muslim world with horror and revulsion,

00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:58.536
and what that meant was that his idea of jihad

00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:00.115
could never become mainstream.

00:11:00.115 --> 00:11:03.994
He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes

00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:08.055
of his own community.

00:11:08.055 --> 00:11:13.163
9/11 didn't empower him; it doomed him.

00:11:13.163 --> 00:11:17.981
Who killed bin Ladenism? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it.

00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:21.174
He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq

00:11:21.174 --> 00:11:24.495
who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack

00:11:24.495 --> 00:11:30.967
not Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites.

00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:34.935
Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam

00:11:34.935 --> 00:11:37.778
against the Western crusaders

00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:43.452
was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims.

00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:46.855
Who killed Osama bin Laden? The SEAL Team Six.

00:11:46.855 --> 00:11:49.563
Who killed bin Ladenism? Al Jazeera did,

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:54.623
Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic,

00:11:54.623 --> 00:11:57.640
because they circumvented the old, state-owned

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.135
television stations in a lot of these countries

00:12:01.135 --> 00:12:04.127
which were designed to keep information from people.

00:12:04.127 --> 00:12:07.575
Al Jazeera brought information to them, showed them

00:12:07.575 --> 00:12:10.972
what was being said and done in the name of their religion,

00:12:10.972 --> 00:12:16.245
exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda,

00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:18.151
and allowed them, gave them the information

00:12:18.151 --> 00:12:22.644
that allowed them to come to their own conclusions.

00:12:22.644 --> 00:12:25.980
Who killed bin Ladenism? The Arab Spring did,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.444
because it showed a way for young Muslims

00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:33.292
to bring about change

00:12:33.292 --> 00:12:35.077
in a manner that Osama bin Laden, with his

00:12:35.077 --> 00:12:38.740
limited imagination, could never have conceived.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.138
Who defeated the global jihad? The American military did,

00:12:42.138 --> 00:12:44.620
the American soldiers did, with their allies,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.636
fighting in faraway battlefields.

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:54.812
And perhaps, a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it.

00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:57.869
So all these factors, and many more besides,

00:12:57.869 --> 00:13:01.036
we don't even fully understand some of them yet,

00:13:01.036 --> 00:13:03.869
these came together

00:13:03.869 --> 00:13:07.660
to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism,

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.508
the global jihad, you needed this group effort.

00:13:11.508 --> 00:13:13.588
Now, not all of these things will work in local jihad.

00:13:13.588 --> 00:13:16.510
The American military is not going to march into Nigeria

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.119
to take on Boko Haram,

00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:21.056
and it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel

00:13:21.056 --> 00:13:25.590
into the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.144
But many of these other factors that were in play

00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:35.018
are now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done.

00:13:35.018 --> 00:13:38.039
We don't have to reinvent the wheel.

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:41.510
The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.086
than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited.

00:13:45.086 --> 00:13:48.702
We don't have to go back to that.

00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:52.736
Satellite television and the Internet are informing

00:13:52.736 --> 00:13:57.123
and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways.

00:13:57.123 --> 00:13:59.748
And the Arab Spring has produced governments,

00:13:59.748 --> 00:14:02.852
many of them Islamist governments,

00:14:02.852 --> 00:14:05.817
who know that, for their own self-preservation,

00:14:05.817 --> 00:14:11.727
they need to take on the extremists in their midsts.

00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:14.582
We don't need to persuade them, but we do need to help them,

00:14:14.582 --> 00:14:19.828
because they haven't really come to this place before.

00:14:19.828 --> 00:14:23.582
The good news, again, is that a lot of the things they need

00:14:23.582 --> 00:14:26.381
we already have, and we are very good at giving:

00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:30.304
economic assistance, not just money, but expertise,

00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:32.941
technology, knowhow,

00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:36.979
private investment, fair terms of trade,

00:14:36.979 --> 00:14:41.189
medicine, education, technical support for training

00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:44.280
for their police forces to become more effective,

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.147
for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient.

00:14:49.147 --> 00:14:50.561
We've got plenty of these things.

00:14:50.561 --> 00:14:52.854
Some of the other things that they need

00:14:52.854 --> 00:14:56.309
we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is.

00:14:56.309 --> 00:15:01.506
Time, patience, subtlety, understanding --

00:15:01.506 --> 00:15:03.548
these are harder to give.

00:15:03.548 --> 00:15:05.925
I live in New York now. Just this week,

00:15:05.925 --> 00:15:08.463
posters have gone up in subway stations in New York

00:15:08.463 --> 00:15:14.189
that describe jihad as savage.

00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:18.542
But in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East,

00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:21.774
I have never been as optimistic as I am today

00:15:21.774 --> 00:15:25.437
that the gap between the Muslim world and the West

00:15:25.437 --> 00:15:28.061
is narrowing fast,

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:29.734
and one of the many reasons for my optimism

00:15:29.734 --> 00:15:33.046
is that, because I know there are millions,

00:15:33.046 --> 00:15:36.869
hundreds of millions of people, Muslims like that old imam

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:43.611
in Tunis, who are reclaiming this word

00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:48.959
and restoring to its original, beautiful purpose.

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:51.575
Bin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated.

00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:55.956
His definition of jihad can now be expunged.

00:15:55.956 --> 00:16:00.497
To that jihad we can say, "Goodbye. Good riddance."

00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:07.031
To the real jihad we can say, "Welcome back. Good luck."

00:16:07.031 --> 00:16:10.663
Thank you. (Applause)
