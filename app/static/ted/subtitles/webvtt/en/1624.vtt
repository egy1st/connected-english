00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:03.123
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates

00:00:03.123 --> 00:00:05.408
who had big plans for the future.

00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:07.639
He had a vision. When he got out,

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.494
he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight,

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:15.621
and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:17.135
He'd spent 10,000 dollars

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:20.419
to buy a website that exclusively featured women

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.308
having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars. (Laughter)

00:00:26.308 --> 00:00:29.294
It was my first week in federal prison,

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:33.111
and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:37.014
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:39.755
whose business instincts were in many cases

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:42.157
as sharp as those of the CEOs

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:43.986
who had wined and dined me six months earlier

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:48.538
when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:51.379
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.119
had been drug dealers on the outside,

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:57.527
but when they talked about what they did,

00:00:57.527 --> 00:01:00.230
they talked about it in a different jargon,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.014
but the business concepts that they talked about

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:05.694
weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton:

00:01:05.694 --> 00:01:10.198
promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user,

00:01:10.198 --> 00:01:13.769
focus-grouping new product launches,

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:16.006
territorial expansion.

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.277
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.

00:01:19.277 --> 00:01:22.126
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:24.323
It's a lot harder than you might think.

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:27.110
Contrary to what most people think,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.488
people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:32.278
when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.

00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:35.030
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.328
toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.

00:01:37.328 --> 00:01:38.680
And it's hard for a couple of reasons.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.075
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:42.442
from what you'd pay on the street,

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:45.024
and second, you don't make a lot of money.

00:01:45.024 --> 00:01:47.293
I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job,

00:01:47.293 --> 00:01:49.582
unloading trucks at a food warehouse,

00:01:49.582 --> 00:01:53.935
for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:56.093
So how do you survive?

00:01:56.093 --> 00:01:59.612
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.

00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:01.211
There's legal hustles.

00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:03.379
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:05.795
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:10.698
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:14.920
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.203
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in,

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:22.306
you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography,

00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:25.773
cell phones, and just as in the outer world,

00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:29.276
there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise,

00:02:29.276 --> 00:02:31.140
the more profitable it can potentially be.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.076
You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:39.381
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open

00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:43.027
and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.

00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:45.363
You want a dirty magazine?

00:02:45.363 --> 00:02:48.747
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.

00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:51.853
So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects

00:02:51.853 --> 00:02:55.403
of prison life is ingenuity.

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:57.807
Whether it was concocting delicious meals

00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:02.006
from stolen scraps from the warehouse,

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:05.156
sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers,

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:10.780
or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.549
tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less,

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.220
and many of them want to take this ingenuity

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.406
that they've learned to the outside

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:22.652
and start restaurants, barber shops,

00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:24.997
personal training businesses.

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:28.492
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that,

00:03:28.492 --> 00:03:30.787
no rehabilitation at all in prison,

00:03:30.787 --> 00:03:32.988
no one to help them write a business plan,

00:03:32.988 --> 00:03:36.246
figure out a way to translate the business concepts

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:39.269
they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises,

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.844
no access to the Internet, even.

00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:44.428
And then, when they come out, most states

00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:46.780
don't even have a law prohibiting employers

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.500
from discriminating against people with a background.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.804
So none of us should be surprised

00:03:52.804 --> 00:03:55.648
that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend

00:03:55.648 --> 00:03:58.236
within five years.

00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:03.548
Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.

00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:07.207
But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do

00:04:07.207 --> 00:04:09.033
whatever I could to make sure

00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:11.466
that guys like the ones I was locked up with

00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:15.513
didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.

00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:19.161
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.

00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:21.729
The best thing we can do is figure out ways

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.417
to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:27.661
and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons,

00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:30.736
because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:33.285
that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:36.161
All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.

00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:40.161
Thank you. (Applause)
