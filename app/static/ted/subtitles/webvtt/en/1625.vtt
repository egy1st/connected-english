00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.857
"My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax.

00:00:05.857 --> 00:00:10.405
My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back.

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:13.395
I'm stylin', smilin', lookin' real mean,

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:17.309
because it ain't about being heard, just being seen.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.446
My leather Adidas baseball cap matches

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:23.065
my fake Gucci backpack. (Laughter)

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.614
Ain't nobody who looks as good as me,

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:27.990
but this costs money, it sure ain't free,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.843
and I gots no job, no money at all,

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:32.215
but it's easy to steal all this from the mall.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:35.052
Parents say I shouldn't, but I knows I should.

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:37.743
Got to do what I can to make sure I look good,

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:40.734
and the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man,

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:45.723
I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside.

00:00:45.723 --> 00:00:48.607
When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide,

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:50.538
and I really must get some new gear soon

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:52.509
or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:56.414
But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops.

00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:58.937
My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear.

00:00:58.937 --> 00:01:01.790
School's almost over. Summer is near.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.283
And I'm sportin' torn Jordans.

00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:09.583
I need something new. Only one thing left to do.

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:13.343
Cut school Friday, catch the subway downtown,

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:15.726
check out my victims hangin' around.

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:17.766
Maybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey.

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.952
Got to get some new gear. There's no other way.

00:01:19.952 --> 00:01:22.310
I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.766
This is serious business. This ain't no fun.

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.334
And I can't have my posse laughin' at me.

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:31.089
I'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see.

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:33.674
Come out of the station, West 4th near the park,

00:01:33.674 --> 00:01:35.911
brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks,

00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:37.373
'Hey homes, where you get them Nik's?'

00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:41.767
I says to myself, 'Yeah. I likes 'em, I likes.'

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.535
They were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes.

00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:47.215
The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:49.649
Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.369
Had my pistol and knew just what to do.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.556
Waited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind.

00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:57.159
He made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun,

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.905
and I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!'

00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:02.175
And the punk tried to run.

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:04.937
Took off fast, didn't get far. I fired,'Pow!'

00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:06.855
Fool fell between two parked cars.

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.974
He was coughing, crying, blood spilled on the street.

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:13.759
And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.872
While laying there dying, all he could say

00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:20.935
was, "Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away."

00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:23.664
You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive.

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:27.278
As I took off with his sneakers, there was tears in his eyes.

00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:30.176
Very next day, I bopped into school

00:02:30.176 --> 00:02:33.582
with my brand new Air Jordans, man, I was cool.

00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:36.070
I killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.239
because now I needs a new jacket to wear."

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:49.048
Thank you. (Applause)

00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:53.979
For the last 15 years that I have been performing,

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:58.709
all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.165
See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:03.765
It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition,

00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:06.237
and while those things hold weight,

00:03:06.237 --> 00:03:09.925
it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:13.813
The hunger and thirst was, and still remains:

00:03:13.813 --> 00:03:16.741
How do I get people who hate poetry

00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:19.629
to love me?

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.928
Because I'm an extension of my work,

00:03:21.928 --> 00:03:23.832
and if they love me, then they will love my work,

00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:27.099
and if they love my work, then they will love poetry,

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.245
and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job,

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:33.352
which is to transcend it to the world.

00:03:33.352 --> 00:03:38.207
And in 1996, I found the answer in principles

00:03:38.207 --> 00:03:42.858
in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines,

00:03:42.858 --> 00:03:47.717
who wrote the famous poem, "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans."

00:03:47.717 --> 00:03:51.762
And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room,

00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:54.104
and I read him one of my pieces,

00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:56.350
and you know what he told me?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.307
"Yo' wack.

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:01.341
You know what the problem is with you, homie?

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.781
You don't read other people's poetry,

00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:06.911
and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures

00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:12.636
to tonal consideration." (Laughter)

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:15.833
Now he kept on rambling

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:20.638
about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights.

00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:23.490
Now I could have quit. I should have quit.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.970
I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.355
I didn't know you actually have to have creative control.

00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:34.338
So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.

00:04:34.338 --> 00:04:37.755
When he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:41.135
I would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:43.611
to ask him who's the best poet.

00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:47.851
I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea

00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:50.379
because he told me it was brain food.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.235
Then one day I told him,

00:04:53.235 --> 00:05:00.571
"Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?" (Laughter)

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.691
And he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis

00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:07.619
on a poet named Etheridge Knight

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:10.036
and the oral nature of poetry,

00:05:10.036 --> 00:05:11.575
and from that point,

00:05:11.575 --> 00:05:14.063
Reggie stopped becoming the best to me,

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:17.091
because what Etheridge Knight taught me

00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:20.997
was that I could make my words sound like music,

00:05:20.997 --> 00:05:23.907
even my small ones, the monosyllables,

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.007
the ifs, ands, buts, whats,

00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:30.529
the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear,

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.699
and from then on, I started chasing Etheridge Knight.

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.931
I wanted to know which poet he read,

00:05:35.931 --> 00:05:40.027
and I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"],

00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:44.667
a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:47.251
a poet could ever be:

00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:49.843
Broadway, baby.

00:05:49.843 --> 00:05:53.187
And from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:57.023
and attack the poetry with my body.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.731
But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.

00:05:59.731 --> 00:06:04.105
The biggest lesson I learned was many years later

00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:08.923
when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent

00:06:08.923 --> 00:06:11.374
who looked at me up and down

00:06:11.374 --> 00:06:14.371
and said I don't look like I have any experience

00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:16.729
to be working in this business.

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.798
And I said to him, "Listen, punk fool,

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:23.908
you're a failed actor who became an agent,

00:06:23.908 --> 00:06:25.472
and you know why you failed as an actor?

00:06:25.472 --> 00:06:28.682
Because people like me took your job.

00:06:28.682 --> 00:06:31.450
I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.841
in East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point

00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:38.877
who were in my way on my way to master the art of space,

00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:41.192
and the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.370
you can fit in there only so I can push them

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.161
to the back of the wall with my experience.

00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:48.240
People have bought tickets to my experience

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.945
and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know

00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:53.125
that the revolution is near, so stock up.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:55.505
I'm so experienced that when you went

00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:58.148
to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet,

00:06:58.148 --> 00:07:00.713
I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.

00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:03.513
I can master shock of "The Crying Game" with the awe

00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:07.449
of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.442
that it was his father who gave it to my mother,

00:07:10.442 --> 00:07:12.294
and that's a double entendre.

00:07:12.294 --> 00:07:15.537
I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School

00:07:15.537 --> 00:07:17.908
and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child

00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:20.232
in it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught

00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:23.908
teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans

00:07:23.908 --> 00:07:27.252
and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off.

00:07:27.252 --> 00:07:30.306
Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself,

00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:32.604
"Something's always wrong when nothing's always right."

00:07:32.604 --> 00:07:35.268
Method acting is nothing but a mixture

00:07:35.268 --> 00:07:38.204
of multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality,

00:07:38.204 --> 00:07:41.292
like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop.

00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:43.388
Dude, you go to Riker's Island Academy.

00:07:43.388 --> 00:07:44.855
I could make David Mamet

00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:47.296
psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue,

00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:50.895
Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:54.202
kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw.

00:07:54.202 --> 00:07:57.191
So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?

00:07:57.191 --> 00:07:59.935
Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:02.399
kung fu secret.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.236
Boards don't hit back.

00:08:04.236 --> 00:08:06.474
You think black entertainers have it hard finding work

00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:08.837
in this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto,

00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:11.903
which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.

00:08:11.903 --> 00:08:14.799
Forget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto,

00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:18.943
buried abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face,

00:08:18.943 --> 00:08:21.358
so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack

00:08:21.358 --> 00:08:24.023
go-for-this, go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door,

00:08:24.023 --> 00:08:27.727
whatever slander you send my way,

00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:29.847
your mother.

00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:34.047
Thank you. (Applause)
