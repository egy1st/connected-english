00:00:00.843 --> 00:00:02.888
I'd like to show you a video of some of the models

00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:04.477
I work with.

00:00:04.477 --> 00:00:08.015
They're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:10.553
Did I mention they're gorgeous?

00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:13.683
And they're scientific models? (Laughs)

00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:16.026
As you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer,

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:18.475
and this is a video of some of the beating heart

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:20.691
that I've engineered in the lab.

00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:22.573
And one day we hope that these tissues

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:25.517
can serve as replacement parts for the human body.

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:27.797
But what I'm going to tell you about today

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:32.244
is how these tissues make awesome models.

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:34.971
Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.

00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:37.949
You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing,

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.452
and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing,

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:42.717
before the drugs get to market.

00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:45.860
It costs a lot of money, a lot of time,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.670
and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.605
it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:56.692
And the later it fails, the worse the consequences.

00:00:56.692 --> 00:01:00.876
It all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats,

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:04.964
and two, despite our incredible similarities to one another,

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.405
actually those tiny differences between you and I

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:09.914
have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:11.783
and how those drugs affect us.

00:01:11.783 --> 00:01:14.615
So what if we had better models in the lab

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:17.885
that could not only mimic us better than rats

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:21.805
but also reflect our diversity?

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:25.732
Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering.

00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:28.261
One of the key technologies that's really important

00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:31.453
is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:33.971
They were developed in Japan pretty recently.

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.418
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:38.531
They're a lot like embryonic stem cells

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.748
except without the controversy.

00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:43.647
We induce cells, okay, say, skin cells,

00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:46.154
by adding a few genes to them, culturing them,

00:01:46.154 --> 00:01:47.775
and then harvesting them.

00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:50.482
So they're skin cells that can be tricked,

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:53.266
kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:55.978
So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.

00:01:55.978 --> 00:01:58.527
Cool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue

00:01:58.527 --> 00:02:01.082
out of them: brain, heart, liver, you get the picture,

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:03.605
but out of your cells.

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:07.170
So we can make a model of your heart, your brain

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.802
on a chip.

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:12.658
Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior

00:02:12.658 --> 00:02:15.490
is the second piece, and will be really key towards

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.162
getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery.

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:21.274
And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.722
to help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way.

00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:28.121
Going forward, imagine a massively parallel version of this

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:30.458
with thousands of pieces of human tissue.

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:34.506
It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip.

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:38.301
But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells

00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:40.850
is that if we take some skin cells, let's say,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.026
from people with a genetic disease

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:45.282
and we engineer tissues out of them,

00:02:45.282 --> 00:02:47.250
we can actually use tissue-engineering techniques

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.651
to generate models of those diseases in the lab.

00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:54.235
Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:56.525
He generated neurons

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:59.240
from these induced pluripotent stem cells

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.869
from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease,

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.312
and he differentiated them into neurons, and what's amazing

00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:07.464
is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease.

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:09.563
So with disease models like these, we can fight back

00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:12.145
faster than ever before and understand the disease better

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:16.108
than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.

00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:19.488
This is another example of patient-specific stem cells

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:23.497
that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.

00:03:23.497 --> 00:03:25.251
This is a degeneration of the retina.

00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:28.008
It's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.232
that cells like these will help us find a cure.

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:33.040
So some people think that these models sound well and good,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.481
but ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?"

00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:39.469
The rat is an entire organism, after all,

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.175
with interacting networks of organs.

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:45.096
A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver,

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:47.936
and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:52.463
Don't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?

00:03:52.463 --> 00:03:54.577
Well, this is another trend in the field.

00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:57.444
By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics,

00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:59.608
the field is actually evolving towards just that,

00:03:59.608 --> 00:04:02.114
a model of the entire ecosystem of the body,

00:04:02.114 --> 00:04:04.514
complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:06.117
how a drug you might take for your blood pressure

00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:09.384
might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart.

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:13.456
These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there,

00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:16.760
and so, watch out.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.392
But that's not even all of it, because once a drug is approved,

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:23.074
tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments.

00:04:23.074 --> 00:04:26.816
This is an example that you might care about someday,

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:28.936
and I hope you never do,

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:31.456
because imagine if you ever get that call

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:34.664
that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer.

00:04:34.664 --> 00:04:37.200
Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.960
you're going to take are going to work on your cancer?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.382
This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:45.288
using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells

00:04:45.288 --> 00:04:47.759
and study its progressions and treatments.

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.312
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models

00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:53.400
like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.120
might spread from one part of the body to the next,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.504
and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips

00:04:58.504 --> 00:05:01.489
to be the next generation of these kinds of studies.

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:03.911
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed,

00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:05.824
you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering

00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:08.280
is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.058
at every single step of the path:

00:05:11.058 --> 00:05:13.632
disease models making for better drug formulations,

00:05:13.632 --> 00:05:17.503
massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing,

00:05:17.503 --> 00:05:21.728
reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials,

00:05:21.728 --> 00:05:23.420
and individualized therapies that disrupt

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.008
what we even consider to be a market at all.

00:05:27.008 --> 00:05:29.552
Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback

00:05:29.552 --> 00:05:31.875
between developing a molecule and learning about

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:34.224
how it acts in the human body.

00:05:34.224 --> 00:05:36.552
Our process for doing this is essentially transforming

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:41.413
biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology,

00:05:41.413 --> 00:05:44.392
helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster,

00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:47.608
more cheaply and more effectively.

00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:51.688
It gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it?

00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:58.503
Thank you. (Applause)
