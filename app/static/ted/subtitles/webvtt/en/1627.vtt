00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:05.755
In 2002, a group of treatment activists met

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:09.785
to discuss the early development of the airplane.

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:14.486
The Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century,

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:16.188
had for the first time managed

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.760
to make one of those devices fly.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.023
They also had taken out numerous patents

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:23.999
on essential parts of the airplane.

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.440
They were not the only ones.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.024
That was common practice in the industry,

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:31.316
and those who held patents on airplanes

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:32.472
were defending them fiercely

00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:35.894
and suing competitors left and right.

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:40.811
This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry,

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:44.117
and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government

00:00:44.117 --> 00:00:46.674
was interested in ramping up

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:49.363
the production of military airplanes.

00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:52.074
So there was a bit of a conflict there.

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:55.313
The U.S. government decided to take action,

00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:57.645
and forced those patent holders

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.806
to make their patents available to share with others

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:07.315
to enable the production of airplanes.

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:10.285
So what has this

00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:14.305
got to do with this?

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:19.368
In 2002, Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist,

00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:24.509
discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment.

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.744
He was told that a cure did not exist.

00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:31.947
AIDS, he heard, was lethal,

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:35.140
and treatment was not offered. This was at a time

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.908
that treatment actually existed in rich countries.

00:01:37.908 --> 00:01:40.903
AIDS had become a chronic disease.

00:01:40.903 --> 00:01:44.504
People in our countries here in Europe, in North America,

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.449
were living with HIV, healthy lives.

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:50.284
Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough,

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:54.256
and not so for his three-year-old son, who he discovered a year later

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:57.496
also had HIV.

00:01:57.496 --> 00:02:00.916
Nelson decided to become a treatment activist

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.045
and join up with other groups.

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:09.388
In 2002, they were facing a different battle.

00:02:09.388 --> 00:02:14.103
Prices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV,

00:02:14.103 --> 00:02:18.500
cost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.025
The patents on those drugs were held

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:26.796
by a number of Western pharmaceutical companies

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.717
that were not necessarily willing

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:32.958
to make those patents available.

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.130
When you have a patent, you can exclude

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.859
anyone else from making, from producing or making

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.857
low-cost versions, for example,

00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:46.433
available of those medications.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.694
Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out

00:02:50.694 --> 00:02:53.652
all over the globe.

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:57.313
Luckily, those patents did not exist everywhere.

00:02:57.313 --> 00:02:59.705
There were countries that did not recognize

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:02.624
pharmaceutical product patents, such as India,

00:03:02.624 --> 00:03:05.145
and Indian pharmaceutical companies

00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:09.104
started to produce so-called generic versions,

00:03:09.104 --> 00:03:13.571
low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines,

00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.868
and make them available in the developing world,

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.584
and within a year the price had come down

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:23.370
from 10,000 dollars per patient per year

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.872
to 350 dollars per patient per year,

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.388
and today that same triple pill cocktail

00:03:29.388 --> 00:03:32.224
is available for 60 dollars per patient per year,

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:35.588
and of course that started to have an enormous effect

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:38.677
on the number of people who could afford access

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.167
to those medicines.

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:42.745
Treatment programs became possible,

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:45.859
funding became available, and the number of people

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:52.620
on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.333
Today, eight million people

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:58.449
have access to antiretroviral drugs.

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.431
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV.

00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:04.430
Never has this number been so high,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.672
but actually this is good news,

00:04:05.672 --> 00:04:08.305
because what it means is people stop dying.

00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:10.625
People who have access to these drugs stop dying.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.961
And there's something else.

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:14.745
They also stop passing on the virus.

00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:18.407
This is fairly recent science that has shown that.

00:04:18.407 --> 00:04:21.063
What that means is we have the tools

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:24.820
to break the back of this epidemic.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.089
So what's the problem?

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:31.955
Well, things have changed.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:35.783
First of all, the rules have changed.

00:04:35.783 --> 00:04:41.714
Today, all countries are obliged to provide

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:46.236
patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.

00:04:46.236 --> 00:04:49.172
This is as a result of the intellectual property rules

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:51.520
of the World Trade Organization.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.699
So what India did is no longer possible.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.036
Second, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.

00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:04.420
Here you see the patent practices

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.509
before the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95,

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.894
before antiretroviral drugs.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.594
This is what you see today,

00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:16.282
and this is in developing countries, so what that means is,

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.705
unless we do something deliberate

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:21.088
and unless we do something now,

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:26.204
we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis,

00:05:26.204 --> 00:05:28.424
because new drugs are developed,

00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:31.786
new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented

00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:34.855
in a much wider range of countries.

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:39.492
So unless we act, unless we do something today,

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:43.424
we will soon be faced [with] what some have termed

00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:46.468
the treatment time bomb.

00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:51.327
It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented.

00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:54.110
There's something else that can really scare

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.951
generic manufacturers away.

00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.952
This shows you a patent landscape.

00:05:59.952 --> 00:06:03.636
This is the landscape of one medicine.

00:06:03.636 --> 00:06:06.237
So you can imagine that if you are a generic company

00:06:06.237 --> 00:06:08.230
about to decide whether to invest

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.366
in the development of this product, unless you know

00:06:11.366 --> 00:06:13.869
that the licenses to these patents

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:16.367
are actually going to be available,

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:19.419
you will probably choose to do something else.

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.352
Again, deliberate action is needed.

00:06:23.352 --> 00:06:25.749
So surely

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:29.676
if a patent pool could be established

00:06:29.676 --> 00:06:33.737
to ramp up the production of military airplanes,

00:06:33.737 --> 00:06:37.271
we should be able to do something similar

00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:40.978
to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:43.041
And we did.

00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:48.430
In 2010, UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.913
for HIV.

00:06:51.913 --> 00:06:53.542
And this is how it works:

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:57.213
Patent holders, inventors

00:06:57.213 --> 00:07:01.058
that develop new medicines

00:07:01.058 --> 00:07:03.624
patent those inventions,

00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:05.375
but make those patents available

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:08.348
to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool

00:07:08.348 --> 00:07:12.163
then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents.

00:07:12.163 --> 00:07:13.839
That can be generic manufacturers.

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:17.652
It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies,

00:07:17.652 --> 00:07:19.129
for example.

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:21.643
Those manufacturers can then sell those medicines

00:07:21.643 --> 00:07:26.692
at much lower cost to people who need access to them,

00:07:26.692 --> 00:07:29.264
to treatment programs that need access to them.

00:07:29.264 --> 00:07:33.440
They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:43.769
so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.

00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:47.827
There is one key difference

00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:51.187
with the airplane patent pool.

00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:56.104
The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism.

00:07:56.104 --> 00:07:59.536
The airplane patent holders were not left a choice

00:07:59.536 --> 00:08:01.176
whether they'd license their patents or not.

00:08:01.176 --> 00:08:03.380
They were forced to do so.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.302
That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do.

00:08:07.302 --> 00:08:10.654
It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies

00:08:10.654 --> 00:08:14.224
to license their patents and make them available

00:08:14.224 --> 00:08:18.764
for others to use.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:23.929
Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.

00:08:23.929 --> 00:08:27.911
He has access to antiretroviral drugs.

00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:31.688
His son will soon be 14 years old.

00:08:31.688 --> 00:08:34.258
Nelson is a member of the expert advisory group

00:08:34.258 --> 00:08:36.717
of the Medicines Patent Pool,

00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:38.818
and he told me not so long ago,

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:44.359
"Ellen, we rely in Kenya and in many other countries

00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:47.758
on the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure

00:08:47.758 --> 00:08:53.270
that new medicines also become available to us,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:58.659
that new medicines, without delay, become available to us."

00:08:58.659 --> 00:09:02.018
And this is no longer fantasy.

00:09:02.018 --> 00:09:06.497
Already, I'll give you an example.

00:09:06.497 --> 00:09:09.955
In August of this year, the United States drug agency

00:09:09.955 --> 00:09:13.904
approved a new four-in-one AIDS medication.

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:16.609
The company, Gilead, that holds the patents,

00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:20.845
has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.

00:09:20.845 --> 00:09:24.772
The pool is already working today, two months later,

00:09:24.772 --> 00:09:27.877
with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product

00:09:27.877 --> 00:09:31.026
can go to market at low cost

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:34.436
where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.

00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:36.376
This has never been done before.

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:40.095
The rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product

00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:43.066
to go to market in developing countries, if at all.

00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:47.099
This has never been seen before.

00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:50.603
Nelson's expectations are very high,

00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:54.872
and quite rightly so. He and his son will need access

00:09:54.872 --> 00:09:57.961
to the next generation of antiretrovirals

00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:01.068
and the next, throughout their lifetime,

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:05.746
so that he and many others in Kenya and other countries

00:10:05.746 --> 00:10:10.178
can continue to live healthy, active lives.

00:10:10.178 --> 00:10:13.398
Now we count on the willingness of drug companies

00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:16.020
to make that happen. We count on those companies

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.440
that understand that it is in the interest, not only in the interest

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.624
of the global good, but also in their own interest,

00:10:22.624 --> 00:10:28.338
to move from conflict to collaboration,

00:10:28.338 --> 00:10:31.219
and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen.

00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:34.615
They can also choose not to do that,

00:10:34.615 --> 00:10:40.826
but those that go down that road may end up

00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:43.750
in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.584
early last century, facing forcible measures

00:10:47.584 --> 00:10:52.766
by government. So they'd better jump now.

00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:56.103
Thank you. (Applause)
