00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:02.972
This is poo,

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:05.455
and what I want to do today is share my passion

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:08.598
for poo with you,

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:11.411
which might be quite difficult,

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.504
but I think what you might find more fascinating

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:17.705
is the way these small animals deal with poo.

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:20.057
So this animal here has got a brain

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:24.017
about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things

00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:27.767
that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.889
And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source,

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:34.023
which is dung.

00:00:34.023 --> 00:00:36.602
So the question is, where do we start this story?

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:39.627
And it seems appropriate to start at the end,

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:42.412
because this is a waste product that comes out

00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:45.985
of other animals, but it still contains nutrients

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:47.942
and there are sufficient nutrients in there

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.905
for dung beetles basically to make a living,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.840
and so dung beetles eat dung, and their larvae

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.995
are also dung-feeders.

00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:59.225
They are grown completely in a ball of dung.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:03.020
Within South Africa, we've got about 800 species of dung beetles,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.290
in Africa we've got 2,000 species of dung beetles,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.888
and in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles.

00:01:10.888 --> 00:01:16.026
So, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.

00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:18.698
Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:21.467
and root through the dung itself, you'll never see

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:23.758
90 percent of the dung beetle species,

00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:26.164
because they go directly into the dung,

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:28.776
straight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forth

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:30.831
between the dung at the soil surface

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:33.771
and a nest they make underground.

00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:39.016
So the question is, how do they deal with this material?

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:42.996
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:46.676
Ten percent of the species actually make a ball,

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:50.838
and this ball they roll away from the dung source,

00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:54.274
usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source,

00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:57.579
and they have a very particular behavior

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.554
by which they are able to roll their balls.

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:06.147
So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.

00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:07.382
You can see it's a male

00:02:07.382 --> 00:02:09.623
because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there,

00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:14.692
and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there.

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:16.604
And then he's about to become a victim

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:21.853
of a vicious smash-and-grab. (Laughter)

00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:24.551
And this is a clear indication

00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:27.162
that this is a valuable resource.

00:02:27.162 --> 00:02:31.287
And so valuable resources have to be looked after

00:02:31.287 --> 00:02:34.606
and guarded in a particular way, and we think

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:37.908
the reason they roll the balls away is because of this,

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.318
because of the competition that is involved

00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:42.193
in getting hold of that dung.

00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:45.390
So this dung pat was actually -- well, it was a dung pat

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.836
15 minutes before this photograph was taken,

00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:50.885
and we think it's the intense competition

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:54.765
that makes the beetles so well-adapted

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:57.454
to rolling balls of dung.

00:02:57.454 --> 00:02:59.487
So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here

00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:03.090
moving across the African veld.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.438
Its head is down. It's walking backwards.

00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:11.809
It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction,

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.675
and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat.

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:16.663
This is Africa. It's hot.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.370
So what I want to share with you now

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.545
are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:26.386
have used to investigate how dung beetles

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:28.438
deal with these problems.

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:30.975
So watch this beetle,

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:35.119
and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.681
The first is how it deals with this obstacle

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:40.569
that we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance,

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.503
and then it carries on in exactly the same direction

00:03:43.503 --> 00:03:47.193
that it took in the first place.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:50.959
A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.336
So clearly this animal knows where it's going

00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:55.675
and it knows where it wants to go,

00:03:55.675 --> 00:03:57.560
and that's a very, very important thing,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.975
because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile,

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:04.498
you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else,

00:04:04.498 --> 00:04:07.391
and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.

00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:11.770
So we gave them some more tasks to deal with,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.930
and what we did here is we turned the world

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.609
under their feet. And watch its response.

00:04:25.287 --> 00:04:28.083
So this animal has actually had the whole world

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:30.930
turned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.402
But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go,

00:04:33.402 --> 00:04:36.370
and it heads off in that particular direction.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.562
So our next question then was,

00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:40.522
how are they doing this?

00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:43.971
What are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:47.098
It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball

00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:49.730
and they'd take a look at the world around them.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.450
And what do you think they could be looking at

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.126
as they climb on top of the ball?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:56.681
What are the obvious cues that this animal could use

00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.859
to direct its movement? And the most obvious one

00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:05.078
is to look at the sky, and so we thought,

00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:07.342
now what could they be looking at in the sky?

00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:11.451
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun.

00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:14.405
So a classic experiment here,

00:05:14.405 --> 00:05:17.944
in that what we did was we moved the sun.

00:05:17.944 --> 00:05:20.685
What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board

00:05:20.685 --> 00:05:22.655
and then move the sun with a mirror

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.521
to a completely different position.

00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:26.433
And look at what the beetle does.

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:29.264
It does a little double dance,

00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:31.543
and then it heads back in exactly the same direction

00:05:31.543 --> 00:05:33.952
it went in the first place.

00:05:33.952 --> 00:05:37.679
What happens now? So clearly they're looking at the sun.

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:40.941
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:43.566
The thing is the sun is not always available to you,

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:47.982
because at sunset it disappears below the horizon.

00:05:47.982 --> 00:05:50.566
What is happening in the sky here

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:54.225
is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky

00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:57.976
that you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built.

00:05:57.976 --> 00:06:01.679
But the sun is at the horizon over here

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:04.646
and we know that when the sun is at the horizon,

00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:06.190
say it's over on this side,

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.775
there is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:13.248
of polarized light that we can't see

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:16.046
that the beetles can see.

00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:18.905
So how do we test that? Well, that's easy.

00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:21.847
What we do is we get a great big polarization filter,

00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:26.271
pop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles

00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:28.921
to the polarization pattern of the sky.

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:33.091
The beetle comes out from underneath the filter

00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:35.594
and it does a right-hand turn,

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:37.788
because it comes back under the sky

00:06:37.788 --> 00:06:40.607
that it was originally orientated to

00:06:40.607 --> 00:06:42.952
and then reorientates itself back

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:46.874
to the direction it was originally going in.

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:52.691
So obviously beetles can see polarized light.

00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:55.448
Okay, so what we've got so far is,

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.224
what are beetles doing? They're rolling balls.

00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:01.239
How are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line.

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:04.817
How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?

00:07:04.817 --> 00:07:07.512
Well, they're looking at celestial cues in the sky,

00:07:07.512 --> 00:07:09.756
some of which you and I can't see.

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:11.440
But how do they pick up those celestial cues?

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.484
That was what was of interest to us next.

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:17.672
And it was this particular little behavior, the dance,

00:07:17.672 --> 00:07:20.591
that we thought was important, because look,

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:22.147
it takes a pause every now and then,

00:07:22.147 --> 00:07:26.626
and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.

00:07:26.626 --> 00:07:30.863
So what are they doing when they do this dance?

00:07:30.863 --> 00:07:35.205
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:38.701
And in this experiment here, what we did was we forced them

00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:41.363
into a channel, and you can see he wasn't

00:07:41.363 --> 00:07:44.101
particularly forced into this particular channel,

00:07:44.101 --> 00:07:49.399
and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:53.135
until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction

00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:55.700
that it wanted to go in, in the first place.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.501
And let's see what his reaction is

00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:01.111
as he's headed through 90 degrees here,

00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:03.215
and now he's going to -- when he ends up down here,

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:06.262
he's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.

00:08:06.262 --> 00:08:08.560
And see what his response is.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.753
He does a little dance, he turns around,

00:08:11.753 --> 00:08:15.487
and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going.

00:08:15.487 --> 00:08:17.766
He knows exactly what the problem is,

00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:19.361
and he knows exactly how to deal with it,

00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:22.062
and the dance is this transition behavior

00:08:22.062 --> 00:08:24.871
that allows them to reorientate themselves.

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:29.663
So that's the dance, but after spending many years

00:08:29.663 --> 00:08:33.319
sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days,

00:08:33.319 --> 00:08:35.670
we noticed that there was another behavior

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.159
associated with the dance behavior.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:42.097
Every now and then, when they climb on top of the ball,

00:08:42.097 --> 00:08:45.503
they wipe their face.

00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:48.466
And you see him do it again.

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:51.447
Now we thought, now what could be going on here?

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:54.351
Clearly the ground is very hot, and when the ground is hot,

00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:57.086
they dance more often, and when they do this particular dance,

00:08:57.086 --> 00:08:59.056
they wipe the bottom of their face.

00:08:59.056 --> 00:09:01.755
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior.

00:09:01.755 --> 00:09:03.765
We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:07.206
get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face

00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:09.622
to cool their head down.

00:09:09.622 --> 00:09:14.064
So what we did was design a couple of arenas.

00:09:14.064 --> 00:09:16.163
one was hot, one was cold.

00:09:16.163 --> 00:09:18.540
We shaded this one. We left that one hot.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.007
And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera.

00:09:22.007 --> 00:09:26.423
So what you're looking at here is a heat image

00:09:26.423 --> 00:09:30.344
of the system, and what you can see here emerging

00:09:30.344 --> 00:09:33.953
from the poo is a cool dung ball.

00:09:33.953 --> 00:09:37.232
So the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here,

00:09:37.232 --> 00:09:42.212
dung is cool. (Laughter)

00:09:42.212 --> 00:09:45.430
So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.070
of the beetle against the background.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.014
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.

00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:54.622
The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about

00:09:54.622 --> 00:09:56.693
30 to 35 degrees centigrade,

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:59.359
so this is a great big ball of ice cream

00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:02.486
that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.

00:10:02.486 --> 00:10:05.189
It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:08.030
its body temperature is actually relatively low.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.103
It's about the same as yours and mine.

00:10:11.103 --> 00:10:16.067
And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.

00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:20.374
But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment,

00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:22.524
look at the temperature of the soil.

00:10:22.524 --> 00:10:25.974
It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.

00:10:25.974 --> 00:10:29.416
Watch how often the beetle dances.

00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:33.958
And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.

00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.881
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow,

00:10:36.881 --> 00:10:38.815
and the beetle climbs on top of the ball

00:10:38.815 --> 00:10:43.454
and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down,

00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:49.124
we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across.

00:10:49.124 --> 00:10:53.056
And what we did then was put little boots on these legs,

00:10:53.056 --> 00:10:56.018
because this was a way to test if the legs

00:10:56.018 --> 00:10:59.776
were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil.

00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:03.753
And if you look over here, with boots they climb onto the ball

00:11:03.753 --> 00:11:07.944
far less often when they had no boots on.

00:11:07.944 --> 00:11:10.271
So we described these as cool boots.

00:11:10.271 --> 00:11:13.193
It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots.

00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:16.080
And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.729
to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball,

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:22.280
and they climbed onto that ball far less often

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.816
than when they had a hot ball.

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.790
So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.698
that you and I do if we cross the beach,

00:11:28.698 --> 00:11:31.416
we jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel --

00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:32.639
"Sorry, I've jumped onto your towel." --

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:35.203
and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel,

00:11:35.203 --> 00:11:37.408
and that way you don't burn your feet.

00:11:37.408 --> 00:11:40.209
And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:43.424
However, there's one more story I'd like to share with you,

00:11:43.424 --> 00:11:44.996
and that's this particular species.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.789
It's from a genus called Pachysoma.

00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:50.821
There are 13 species in the genus, and they have

00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:56.959
a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting.

00:11:56.959 --> 00:12:01.619
This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing.

00:12:01.619 --> 00:12:04.309
Can you spot the difference?

00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:07.541
They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion.

00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:09.335
but it's walking forwards,

00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:12.896
and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.

00:12:12.896 --> 00:12:15.350
This is a different species in the same genus

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.222
but exactly the same foraging behavior.

00:12:19.222 --> 00:12:22.013
There's one more interesting aspect of this

00:12:22.013 --> 00:12:26.316
dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating,

00:12:26.316 --> 00:12:30.822
and that's that it forages and provisions a nest.

00:12:30.822 --> 00:12:33.513
So watch this individual here, and what he's trying to do

00:12:33.513 --> 00:12:36.233
is set up a nest.

00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:37.942
And he doesn't like this first position,

00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:39.565
but he comes up with a second position,

00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:43.422
and about 50 minutes later, that nest is finished,

00:12:43.422 --> 00:12:47.149
and he heads off to forage and provision

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:49.503
at a pile of dry dung pellets.

00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:52.669
And what I want you to notice is the outward path

00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:57.278
compared to the homeward path, and compare the two.

00:12:57.278 --> 00:12:59.938
And by and large, you'll see that the homeward path

00:12:59.938 --> 00:13:02.769
is far more direct than the outward path.

00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:05.584
On the outward path, he's always on the lookout

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:08.049
for a new blob of dung.

00:13:08.049 --> 00:13:09.600
On the way home, he knows where home is,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.818
and he wants to go straight to it.

00:13:12.818 --> 00:13:16.393
The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip,

00:13:16.393 --> 00:13:19.783
as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated

00:13:19.783 --> 00:13:24.088
back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.

00:13:24.088 --> 00:13:25.030
And watch, you're going to see

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.040
another South African crime taking place right now. (Laughter)

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.654
And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.

00:13:33.654 --> 00:13:36.791
So what we're looking at here

00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:40.119
is a behavior called path integration.

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:42.736
And what's taking place is that the beetle

00:13:42.736 --> 00:13:47.039
has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:50.130
looking for food, and then when it finds food,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.438
it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.

00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:57.463
Now there's two ways it could be doing that,

00:13:57.463 --> 00:14:00.423
and we can test that by displacing the beetle

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:03.120
to a new position when it's at the foraging site.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.414
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.

00:14:06.414 --> 00:14:09.829
If it is using something called path integration,

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:13.613
it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot,

00:14:13.613 --> 00:14:16.037
and what it's doing here if it's using path integration

00:14:16.037 --> 00:14:19.908
is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.

00:14:19.908 --> 00:14:23.605
It knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.

00:14:23.605 --> 00:14:26.733
If you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place.

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.310
So let's see what happens when we put this beetle

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.626
to the test with a similar experiment.

00:14:32.626 --> 00:14:37.012
So here's our cunning experimenter.

00:14:37.012 --> 00:14:39.413
He displaces the beetle,

00:14:39.413 --> 00:14:44.262
and now we have to see what is going to take place.

00:14:44.262 --> 00:14:47.356
What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was.

00:14:47.356 --> 00:14:50.303
The forage has been displaced to a new position.

00:14:50.303 --> 00:14:52.662
If he's using landmark orientation,

00:14:52.662 --> 00:14:54.422
he should be able to find the burrow,

00:14:54.422 --> 00:14:57.145
because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it.

00:14:57.145 --> 00:15:00.188
If he's using path integration,

00:15:00.188 --> 00:15:03.912
then it should end up in the wrong spot over here.

00:15:03.912 --> 00:15:06.222
So let's watch what happens

00:15:06.222 --> 00:15:09.513
when we put the beetle through the whole test.

00:15:09.513 --> 00:15:11.509
So there he is there.

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:17.769
He's about to head home, and look what happens.

00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:20.262
Shame.

00:15:20.262 --> 00:15:22.496
It hasn't a clue.

00:15:22.496 --> 00:15:25.416
It starts to search for its house in the right distance

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:31.391
away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.

00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:35.609
So we know now that this animal uses path integration

00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:39.688
to find its way around, and the callous experimenter

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:42.809
leads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter)

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:46.864
So what we're looking at here are a group of animals

00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:48.943
that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass

00:15:48.943 --> 00:15:50.583
to find their way around,

00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:53.108
and they have some sort of system

00:15:53.108 --> 00:15:55.071
for measuring that distance,

00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:58.408
and we know that these species here actually

00:15:58.408 --> 00:16:01.089
count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer,

00:16:01.089 --> 00:16:06.226
a step-counting system, to find their way back home.

00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:09.049
We don't know yet what dung beetles use.

00:16:09.049 --> 00:16:11.328
So what have we learned from these animals

00:16:11.328 --> 00:16:14.329
with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice?

00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:18.440
Well, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.585
using celestial cues.

00:16:20.585 --> 00:16:23.713
We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior

00:16:23.713 --> 00:16:26.127
and it's also a thermoregulation behavior,

00:16:26.127 --> 00:16:30.325
and we also know that they use a path integration system

00:16:30.325 --> 00:16:32.414
for finding their way home.

00:16:32.414 --> 00:16:36.584
So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance

00:16:36.584 --> 00:16:39.353
we can actually learn an awful lot from these things

00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:42.985
doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do.

00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:46.985
Thank you. (Applause)
