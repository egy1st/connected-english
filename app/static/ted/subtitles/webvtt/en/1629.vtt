00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:02.690
Hello, Doha. Hello!

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:04.805
Salaam alaikum.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.806
I love coming to Doha.
It's such an international place.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.358
It feels like the United Nations here.

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:17.651
You land at the airport,
and you're welcomed by an Indian lady

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:21.538
who takes you to Al Maha Services,
where you meet a Filipino lady

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:23.776
who hands you off to a South African lady

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.523
who then takes you to a Korean

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:28.344
who takes you to a Pakistani guy
with the luggage

00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:30.382
who takes you to the car
with a Sri Lankan.

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:33.216
You go to the hotel and you check in.
There's a Lebanese.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.420
Yeah? And then a Swedish guy
showed me my room.

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:38.266
I said, "Where are the Qataris?"

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.936
(Laughter)

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.906
(Applause)

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.265
They said, "No, no, it's too hot.
They come out later. They're smart."

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.440
"They know."

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.180
(Laughter)

00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:52.993
And of course, it's growing so fast,
sometimes there's growing pains.

00:00:53.017 --> 00:00:55.295
You know, like sometimes
you run into people

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.580
that you think know the city well,
but they don't know it that well.

00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:01.176
My Indian cab driver showed up at the W,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.467
and I asked him to take me
to the Sheraton,

00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:05.122
and he said, "No problem, sir."

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:08.081
And then we sat there for two minutes.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:10.609
I said, "What's wrong?"
He said, "One problem, sir."

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:11.672
(Laughter)

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.561
I said, "What?" He goes, "Where is it?"

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:15.998
(Laughter)

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:18.061
I go, "You're the driver,
you should know."

00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:19.815
He goes, "No, I just arrived, sir."

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.705
I go, "You just arrived at the W?"
"No, I just arrived in Doha, sir."

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.767
(Laughter)

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:26.688
"I was on my way home from the airport,

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:28.339
I got a job. I'm working already."

00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:29.854
(Laughter)

00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:32.018
He goes, "Sir, why don't you drive?"

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:33.070
(Laughter)

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:34.674
"I don't know where we're going."

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:36.802
"Neither do I. It will be
an adventure, sir."

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.618
(Laughter)

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.276
The Middle East has been
an adventure the past couple of years.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.451
It is going crazy with the Arab Spring
and revolution and all this.

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:48.853
Are there any Lebanese
here tonight, by applause?

00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:49.886
(Cheering)

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.062
Lebanese, yeah.

00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:52.593
The Middle East is going crazy.

00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:54.538
You know the Middle East is going crazy

00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:57.251
when Lebanon is the most peaceful
place in the region.

00:01:57.275 --> 00:01:59.839
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:01.259
Who would have thought?

00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:02.776
(Laughter)

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.313
Oh my gosh.

00:02:04.948 --> 00:02:06.908
No, there's serious issues in the region.

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:10.654
Some people don't want to talk about them.
I'm here to talk about them tonight.

00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:13.693
Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East,
here's a serious issue.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:16.027
When we see each other, when we say hello,

00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:17.800
how many kisses are we going to do?

00:02:17.824 --> 00:02:19.275
(Laughter)

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.776
Every country is different
and it's confusing, okay?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.606
In Lebanon, they do three.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.337
In Egypt, they do two.

00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:27.609
I was in Lebanon, I got used to three.

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.245
I went to Egypt. I went to say hello
to this one Egyptian guy,

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.117
I went, one, two. I went for three --

00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:34.345
He wasn't into it.

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:39.267
(Laughter)

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.743
I told him, I said, "No, no,
I was just in Lebanon."

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:45.371
He goes, "I don't care where you were.
You just stay where you are, please."

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.404
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:50.358
I went to Saudi Arabia.

00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:53.786
In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two,
and then they stay on the same side:

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.327
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine,

00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:59.044
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 --

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:01.735
(Laughter)

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.681
Next time you see a Saudi, look closely.

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:05.375
They're just a little bit tilted.

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:07.093
(Laughter)

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:08.291
"Abdul, are you okay?"

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:10.983
"I was saying hello
for half an hour. I'll be all right."

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:12.157
(Laughter)

00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:15.735
Qataris, you guys do the nose to nose.

00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:19.043
Why is that? Are you too tired
to go all the way around?

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:20.103
(Laughter)

00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:23.223
"Habibi, it's so hot. Just come here
for a second. Say hello.

00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:25.989
Hello, Habibi. Just don't move.
Just stay there, please.

00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:27.239
I need to rest."

00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:29.378
(Laughter)

00:03:29.402 --> 00:03:33.490
Iranians, sometimes we do two,
sometimes we do three.

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:36.953
A friend of mine explained to me,
before the '79 revolution, it was two.

00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:38.014
(Laughter)

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:40.000
After the revolution, three.

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:42.749
So with Iranians, you can tell
whose side the person is on

00:03:42.773 --> 00:03:44.857
based on the number
of kisses they give you.

00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:48.524
Yeah, if you go one, two, three --
"I can't believe you support this regime!"

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:49.549
(Laughter)

00:03:49.573 --> 00:03:51.097
"With your three kisses."

00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:53.789
(Laughter)

00:03:53.813 --> 00:03:56.294
But no, guys, really,
it is exciting to be here,

00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:59.173
and like I said, you guys
are doing a lot culturally,

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.868
you know, and it's amazing,

00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:03.753
and it helps change the image
of the Middle East in the West.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:07.297
A lot of Americans don't know
a lot about us, about the Middle East.

00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:10.760
I'm Iranian and American. I'm there.
I know, I've traveled here.

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:12.496
There's so much, we laugh, right?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.883
People don't know we laugh.

00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:17.248
When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour,
it came out on Comedy Central,

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:19.380
I went online to see
what people were saying.

00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:21.191
I ended up on a conservative website.

00:04:21.215 --> 00:04:24.597
One guy wrote another guy. He said,
"I never knew these people laughed."

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:28.846
Think about it. You never see us laughing
in American film or television, right?

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.464
Maybe like an evil laugh: "Wuhahaha."

00:04:31.488 --> 00:04:32.539
(Laughter)

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:35.666
"I will kill you in the name
of Allah, wuhahahahaha."

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.848
(Laughter)

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:38.773
But never like, "Ha ha ha ha la."

00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:40.524
(Laughter)

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:43.211
We like to laugh.
We like to celebrate life.

00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:45.291
And I wish more Americans
would travel here.

00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:46.759
I always encourage my friends:

00:04:46.783 --> 00:04:48.233
"Travel, see the Middle East,

00:04:48.257 --> 00:04:50.399
there's so much to see,
so many good people."

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:52.673
And it's vice versa,
and it helps stop problems

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:55.720
of misunderstanding
and stereotypes from happening.

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:58.098
For example, I don't know
if you heard about this,

00:04:58.122 --> 00:05:00.756
a little while ago in the US,
there was a Muslim family

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.771
walking down the aisle of an airplane,

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:05.189
talking about the safest place
to sit on the plane.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.047
Some passengers overheard them,

00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:10.317
somehow misconstrued that
as terrorist talk,

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:12.133
got them kicked off the plane.

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:15.443
It was a family, a mother, father, child,
talking about the seating.

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:16.723
As a Middle Eastern male,

00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:19.493
I know there's certain things
I'm not supposed to say

00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:21.206
on an airplane in the US, right?

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.405
I'm not supposed to be
walking down the aisle,

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:25.437
and be like, "Hi, Jack." That's not cool.

00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:26.883
(Laughter)

00:05:26.907 --> 00:05:29.336
Even if I'm there with my friend
named Jack, I say,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.316
"Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack."

00:05:31.844 --> 00:05:33.039
Never "Hi, Jack."

00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:35.956
(Laughter)

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.168
But now, apparently we can't even talk

00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:40.368
about the safest place
to sit on an airplane.

00:05:40.693 --> 00:05:43.778
So my advice to all my Middle Eastern
friends and Muslim friends

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.089
and anyone who looks
Middle Eastern or Muslim,

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:49.611
so to, you know, Indians, and Latinos,
everyone, if you're brown --

00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:51.323
(Laughter)

00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:53.609
Here's my advice to my brown friends.

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:54.686
(Laughter)

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.079
The next time you're
on an airplane in the US,

00:05:57.103 --> 00:05:58.720
just speak your mother tongue.

00:05:59.132 --> 00:06:01.710
That way no one knows
what you're saying. Life goes on.

00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:02.756
(Laughter)

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.689
Granted, some mother tongues
might sound a little threatening

00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:06.875
to the average American.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.208
If you're walking
down the aisle speaking Arabic,

00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:10.594
you might freak them out --

00:06:10.618 --> 00:06:12.920
(Imitating Arabic)

00:06:12.944 --> 00:06:14.999
They might say, "What's he talking about?"

00:06:15.023 --> 00:06:17.012
The key, to my Arab brothers and sisters,

00:06:17.036 --> 00:06:19.576
is to throw in random
good words to put people at ease

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.184
as you're walking down the aisle.

00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:22.638
Just as you're walking down --

00:06:22.662 --> 00:06:24.007
(Imitating Arabic)

00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:25.209
Strawberry!

00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:32.169
(Laughter)

00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:33.902
(Imitating Arabic)

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.077
Rainbow!

00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:37.070
(Laughter)

00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:38.351
(Imitating Arabic)

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:39.526
Tutti Frutti!

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.660
(Laughter)

00:06:40.684 --> 00:06:43.826
"I think he's going to hijack
the plane with some ice cream."

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.790
Thank you very much. Have a good night.

00:06:45.814 --> 00:06:46.965
Thank you, TED.

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.817
(Cheers) (Applause)
