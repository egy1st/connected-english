00:00:00.635 --> 00:00:03.256
I've been a journalist now since I was about 17,

00:00:03.256 --> 00:00:06.816
and it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment,

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.152
because as you all know, there's a huge amount of upheaval

00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:11.632
going on in media, and most of you probably know this

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:14.855
from the business angle, which is that the business model

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:17.798
is pretty screwed, and as my grandfather would say,

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:20.512
the profits have all been gobbled up by Google.

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:22.856
So it's a really interesting time to be a journalist,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.940
but the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.035
It's on the input side. It's concern with

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:31.533
how we get information and how we gather the news.

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.604
And that's changed, because we've had a huge shift

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.842
in the balance of power from

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:38.859
the news organizations to the audience.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.074
And the audience for such a long time was in a position

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.764
where they didn't have any way of affecting news

00:00:43.764 --> 00:00:46.031
or making any change. They couldn't really connect.

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:47.507
And that's changed irrevocably.

00:00:47.507 --> 00:00:50.396
My first connection with the news media was

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:54.207
in 1984, the BBC had a one-day strike.

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.495
I wasn't happy. I was angry. I couldn't see my cartoons.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:00.042
So I wrote a letter.

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:02.891
And it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail:

00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:05.978
"Love Markham, Aged 4." Still works.

00:01:05.978 --> 00:01:08.989
I'm not sure if I had any impact on the one-day strike,

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.671
but what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.831
And that was the round journey. It took that long for anyone

00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:16.024
to have any impact and get some feedback.

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:18.506
And that's changed now because, as journalists,

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:21.672
we interact in real time. We're not in a position

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:24.006
where the audience is reacting to news.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.763
We're reacting to the audience, and we're actually relying on them.

00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:30.149
They're helping us find the news. They're helping us

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.919
figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear.

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:38.823
So it's a real-time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:44.740
on a constant basis, and the journalist is always playing catch up.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.373
To give an example of how we rely on the audience,

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:51.910
on the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.236
It was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:57.116
And 60 seconds is the amount of time it took

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.681
for it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.

00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:03.826
So the ground shook in Managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter.

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:06.482
Thirty seconds later, the first message went onto Twitter,

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:09.343
and this was someone saying "temblor," which means earthquake.

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:11.680
So 60 seconds was how long it took

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.586
for the physical earthquake to travel.

00:02:13.586 --> 00:02:16.146
Thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled

00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:19.120
all around the world, instantly. Everyone in the world,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.317
hypothetically, had the potential to know that an earthquake

00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:24.731
was happening in Managua.

00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.082
And that happened because this one person had

00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:31.031
a documentary instinct, which was to post a status update,

00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:33.563
which is what we all do now, so if something happens,

00:02:33.563 --> 00:02:35.645
we put our status update, or we post a photo,

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:39.423
we post a video, and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream.

00:02:39.423 --> 00:02:42.184
And what that means is just constant,

00:02:42.184 --> 00:02:44.590
huge volumes of data going up.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.871
It's actually staggering. When you look at the numbers,

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:49.862
every minute there are 72 more hours

00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:51.244
of video on YouTube.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:54.526
So that's, every second, more than an hour of video gets uploaded.

00:02:54.526 --> 00:02:58.782
And in photos, Instagram, 58 photos are uploaded to Instagram a second.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:02.538
More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook.

00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:06.246
So by the time I'm finished talking here, there'll be 864

00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:09.864
more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started,

00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:13.727
and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.659
So it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist,

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.075
because we should have access to everything.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.973
Any event that happens anywhere in the world, I should be able to know about it

00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:26.904
pretty much instantaneously, as it happens, for free.

00:03:26.904 --> 00:03:30.069
And that goes for every single person in this room.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.679
The only problem is, when you have that much information,

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.966
you have to find the good stuff, and that can be

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:36.954
incredibly difficult when you're dealing with those volumes.

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:39.273
And nowhere was this brought home more than during

00:03:39.273 --> 00:03:42.177
Hurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was

00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:45.204
a superstorm, the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time,

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:48.347
hitting the iPhone capital of the universe -- (Laughter) --

00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:52.562
and you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before.

00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:55.306
And that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes,

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:58.222
so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted.

00:03:58.222 --> 00:04:00.470
We had to deal with composite images

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.653
that were merging photos from previous storms.

00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:08.887
We had to deal with images from films like "The Day After Tomorrow." (Laughter)

00:04:08.887 --> 00:04:11.721
And we had to deal with images that were so realistic

00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:14.091
it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all.

00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:18.404
(Laughter)

00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:22.128
But joking aside, there were images like this one from Instagram

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:24.404
which was subjected to a grilling by journalists.

00:04:24.404 --> 00:04:26.637
They weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram.

00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:29.160
The lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.453
And it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C

00:04:31.453 --> 00:04:33.613
in downtown Manhattan, which was flooded.

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:35.713
And the reason that they could tell that it was real

00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:37.802
was because they could get to the source, and in this case,

00:04:37.802 --> 00:04:39.909
these guys were New York food bloggers.

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.939
They were well respected. They were known.

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:45.031
So this one wasn't a debunk, it was actually something that they could prove.

00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:47.949
And that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff.

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.660
And you were, instead of going and finding the information

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.227
and bringing it back to the reader, you were holding back

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:55.287
the stuff that was potentially damaging.

00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:58.245
And finding the source becomes more and more important --

00:04:58.245 --> 00:05:01.979
finding the good source -- and Twitter is where most journalists now go.

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.132
It's like the de facto real-time newswire,

00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:08.099
if you know how to use it, because there is so much on Twitter.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.484
And a good example of how useful it can be

00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:14.017
but also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in 2011.

00:05:14.017 --> 00:05:16.663
As a non-Arabic speaker, as someone who was looking

00:05:16.663 --> 00:05:18.964
from the outside, from Dublin,

00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:20.756
Twitter lists, and lists of good sources,

00:05:20.756 --> 00:05:24.378
people we could establish were credible, were really important.

00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:26.887
And how do you build a list like that from scratch?

00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:29.317
Well, it can be quite difficult, but you have to know what to look for.

00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:32.175
This visualization was done by an Italian academic.

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:35.569
He's called AndrÃ© Pannison, and he basically

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.744
took the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square

00:05:37.744 --> 00:05:41.198
on the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign,

00:05:41.198 --> 00:05:43.830
and the dots you can see are retweets, so when someone

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.609
retweets a message, a connection is made between two dots,

00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:49.219
and the more times that message is retweeted by other people,

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.425
the more you get to see these nodes, these connections being made.

00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:54.347
And it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation,

00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:57.058
but what you get is hints at who is more interesting

00:05:57.058 --> 00:05:59.739
and who is worth investigating.

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:02.618
And as the conversation grew and grew, it became

00:06:02.618 --> 00:06:04.902
more and more lively, and eventually you were left

00:06:04.902 --> 00:06:09.683
with this huge, big, rhythmic pointer of this conversation.

00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:11.492
You could find the nodes, though, and then you went,

00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:13.786
and you go, "Right, I've got to investigate these people.

00:06:13.786 --> 00:06:15.500
These are the ones that are obviously making sense.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.809
Let's see who they are."

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:20.499
Now in the deluge of information, this is where

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:23.706
the real-time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself,

00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:25.680
because we have more tools than ever

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.437
to do that kind of investigation.

00:06:28.437 --> 00:06:31.446
And when you start digging into the sources, you can go

00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:33.745
further and further than you ever could before.

00:06:33.745 --> 00:06:37.097
Sometimes you come across a piece of content that

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:40.557
is so compelling, you want to use it, you're dying to use it,

00:06:40.557 --> 00:06:43.232
but you're not 100 percent sure if you can because

00:06:43.232 --> 00:06:44.439
you don't know if the source is credible.

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:46.621
You don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re-upload.

00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:48.330
And you have to do that investigative work.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.674
And this video, which I'm going to let run through,

00:06:50.674 --> 00:06:53.663
was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.862
Video: Getting real windy in just a second.

00:06:55.862 --> 00:07:00.750
(Rain and wind sounds)

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.917
(Explosion) Oh, shit!

00:07:03.917 --> 00:07:06.854
Markham Nolan: Okay, so now if you're a news producer, this is something

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:09.406
you'd love to run with, because obviously, this is gold.

00:07:09.406 --> 00:07:11.669
You know? This is a fantastic reaction from someone,

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.239
very genuine video that they've shot in their back garden.

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:17.733
But how do you find if this person, if it's true, if it's faked,

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:20.391
or if it's something that's old and that's been reposted?

00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:22.617
So we set about going to work on this video, and

00:07:22.617 --> 00:07:25.477
the only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account.

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:27.828
There was only one video posted to that account,

00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:29.316
and the username was Rita Krill.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:32.608
And we didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name.

00:07:32.608 --> 00:07:35.521
But we started looking, and we used free Internet tools to do so.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.829
The first one was called Spokeo, which allowed us to look for Rita Krills.

00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:41.211
So we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York,

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.973
we found them in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Florida.

00:07:43.973 --> 00:07:46.622
So we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool

00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:49.089
called Wolfram Alpha, and we checked the weather reports

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:51.586
for the day in which this video had been uploaded,

00:07:51.586 --> 00:07:53.469
and when we went through all those various cities,

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:56.965
we found that in Florida, there were thunderstorms and rain on the day.

00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:59.610
So we went to the white pages, and we found,

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.534
we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook,

00:08:02.534 --> 00:08:04.106
and we looked through a couple of different addresses,

00:08:04.106 --> 00:08:07.422
and that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house.

00:08:07.422 --> 00:08:09.337
And we found a house with a swimming pool that looked

00:08:09.337 --> 00:08:12.255
remarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video,

00:08:12.255 --> 00:08:15.226
and we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.

00:08:15.226 --> 00:08:18.441
So if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella,

00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:20.286
there's a white lilo in the pool,

00:08:20.286 --> 00:08:22.726
there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool,

00:08:22.726 --> 00:08:24.780
and there's two trees in the background.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.207
And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer,

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:29.878
and sure enough, there's the white lilo,

00:08:29.878 --> 00:08:32.872
there are the two trees,

00:08:32.872 --> 00:08:34.858
there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo.

00:08:34.858 --> 00:08:38.636
Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.

00:08:38.636 --> 00:08:41.786
So we were able to call Rita, clear the video,

00:08:41.786 --> 00:08:43.872
make sure that it had been shot, and then our clients

00:08:43.872 --> 00:08:47.066
were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:48.841
Sometimes the search for truth, though,

00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:53.250
is a little bit less flippant, and it has much greater consequences.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.233
Syria has been really interesting for us, because obviously

00:08:56.233 --> 00:08:58.914
a lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be

00:08:58.914 --> 00:09:02.713
potentially war crime evidence, so this is where YouTube

00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:05.070
actually becomes the most important repository

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.220
of information about what's going on in the world.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.974
So this video, I'm not going to show you the whole thing,

00:09:11.974 --> 00:09:14.695
because it's quite gruesome, but you'll hear some of the sounds.

00:09:14.695 --> 00:09:17.023
This is from Hama.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:19.993
Video: (Shouting)

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:23.897
And what this video shows, when you watch the whole thing through,

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.658
is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck

00:09:26.658 --> 00:09:29.263
and thrown off a bridge.

00:09:29.263 --> 00:09:32.044
The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood

00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:34.919
and they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:37.853
off the bridge, and they were cursing and using blasphemous language,

00:09:37.853 --> 00:09:40.235
and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were,

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:42.477
and whether or not they were what the video said it was.

00:09:42.477 --> 00:09:45.743
So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been

00:09:45.743 --> 00:09:48.076
back and forth with on Twitter, and we asked them about this,

00:09:48.076 --> 00:09:51.890
and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.804
Three different sources said three different things about the bridge.

00:09:54.804 --> 00:09:57.066
They said, one, the bridge doesn't exist.

00:09:57.066 --> 00:10:00.590
Another one said the bridge does exist, but it's not in Hama. It's somewhere else.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.152
And the third one said, "I think the bridge does exist,

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:06.516
but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed,

00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:09.913
so the river should actually have been dry, so this doesn't make sense."

00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:12.525
So that was the only one that gave us a clue.

00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:13.750
We looked through the video for other clues.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.839
We saw the distinctive railings, which we could use.

00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:20.583
We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south,

00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:22.900
so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.856
It had black-and-white curbs.

00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:26.842
As we looked at the river itself, you could see there's

00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:29.796
a concrete stone on the west side. There's a cloud of blood.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.530
That's blood in the river. So the river is flowing

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.227
south to north. That's what that tells me.

00:10:33.227 --> 00:10:35.576
And also, as you look away from the bridge,

00:10:35.576 --> 00:10:37.225
there's a divot on the left-hand side of the bank,

00:10:37.225 --> 00:10:39.655
and the river narrows.

00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:42.234
So onto Google Maps we go, and we start

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:44.292
looking through literally every single bridge.

00:10:44.292 --> 00:10:47.772
We go to the dam that we talked about, we start just

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:51.382
literally going through every time that road crosses the river,

00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:53.120
crossing off the bridges that don't match.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.883
We're looking for one that crosses east-west.

00:10:54.883 --> 00:10:56.835
And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam

00:10:56.835 --> 00:10:58.838
to Hama and there's no bridge.

00:10:58.838 --> 00:11:01.322
So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view,

00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:04.242
and we find another bridge, and everything starts to line up.

00:11:04.242 --> 00:11:07.280
The bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.441
So this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in.

00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.343
We start to see that it's got a median, so it's a two-lane bridge.

00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:16.989
And it's got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video,

00:11:16.989 --> 00:11:19.301
and as we click through it, you can see someone's

00:11:19.301 --> 00:11:22.255
uploaded photos to go with the map, which is very handy,

00:11:22.255 --> 00:11:24.942
so we click into the photos. And the photos start showing us

00:11:24.942 --> 00:11:27.564
more detail that we can cross-reference with the video.

00:11:27.564 --> 00:11:31.287
The first thing that we see is we see black-and-white curbing,

00:11:31.287 --> 00:11:33.392
which is handy because we've seen that before.

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:36.891
We see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys

00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:39.242
throwing the bodies over.

00:11:39.242 --> 00:11:41.897
And we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge.

00:11:41.897 --> 00:11:43.421
So what does that tell me? I've got to go back now

00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:45.734
to my three sources and look at what they told me:

00:11:45.734 --> 00:11:47.459
the one who said the bridge didn't exist,

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:49.318
the one who said the bridge wasn't in Hama,

00:11:49.318 --> 00:11:53.271
and the one guy who said, "Yes, the bridge does exist, but I'm not sure about the water levels."

00:11:53.271 --> 00:11:56.602
Number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden,

00:11:56.602 --> 00:11:59.583
and we've been able to find that out using some free Internet tools

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:02.103
sitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublin

00:12:02.103 --> 00:12:03.590
in the space of 20 minutes.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.029
And that's part of the joy of this. Although the web

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:09.294
is running like a torrent, there's so much information there

00:12:09.294 --> 00:12:12.481
that it's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day,

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:15.808
if you use them intelligently, you can find out incredible information.

00:12:15.808 --> 00:12:18.203
Given a couple of clues, I could probably find out

00:12:18.203 --> 00:12:21.737
a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out.

00:12:21.737 --> 00:12:24.742
But what it tells me is that, at a time when

00:12:24.742 --> 00:12:28.771
there's more -- there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been,

00:12:28.771 --> 00:12:31.404
it's harder to filter, we have greater tools.

00:12:31.404 --> 00:12:33.267
We have free Internet tools that allow us,

00:12:33.267 --> 00:12:35.493
help us do this kind of investigation.

00:12:35.493 --> 00:12:37.316
We have algorithms that are smarter than ever before,

00:12:37.316 --> 00:12:39.737
and computers that are quicker than ever before.

00:12:39.737 --> 00:12:43.164
But here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary.

00:12:43.164 --> 00:12:44.949
They're yes or no, they're black or white.

00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:48.503
Truth is never binary. Truth is a value.

00:12:48.503 --> 00:12:53.167
Truth is emotional, it's fluid, and above all, it's human.

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:55.274
No matter how quick we get with computers, no matter

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:57.658
how much information we have, you'll never be able

00:12:57.658 --> 00:13:00.654
to remove the human from the truth-seeking exercise,

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:04.312
because in the end, it is a uniquely human trait.

00:13:04.312 --> 00:13:08.312
Thanks very much. (Applause)
