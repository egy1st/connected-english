00:00:01.657 --> 00:00:05.419
Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.265
Zipcar buys cars and parks them

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.841
throughout dense metropolitan areas

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:13.969
for people to use, by the hour and by the day,

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.258
instead of owning their own cars.

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:20.142
Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars,

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:23.246
and each driver drives about 80 percent less

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.606
because they're now paying the full cost,

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:28.182
all at once, in real time.

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:32.427
But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:36.678
Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,

00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:38.663
and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:41.342
with my husband and youngest child,

00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:44.562
and we launched Buzzcar a year ago.

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:47.819
Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.486
to their friends and neighbors.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:54.742
Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:57.069
We bring the power of a corporation

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.182
to individuals who add their cars to the network.

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:03.870
Some people call this peer-to-peer.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.158
This does express the humanity of what's going on,

00:01:07.158 --> 00:01:09.595
and the personal relationships,

00:01:09.595 --> 00:01:12.291
but that is also like saying that it's the same thing

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:15.144
as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.

00:01:15.144 --> 00:01:16.369
That's peer-to-peer.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.256
It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay,

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:28.828
or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy.

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:31.190
But what's really happening is that we've got the power

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.395
of a free and open Internet,

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:36.600
and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.287
and the peers are now in partnership with the company,

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:43.504
creating shared value on shared values,

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:48.473
and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.

00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:51.515
I call this Peers, Inc.

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:54.076
The incorporated side, the company,

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.893
is doing things that it does really well.

00:01:56.893 --> 00:02:00.662
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.405
significant and long-term resource investment,

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:07.210
the expertise of many different kinds of people

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.198
and different kinds of minds, and for individuals,

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:13.462
consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse

00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:15.782
that we really want as consumers,

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:18.725
and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:23.765
and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:26.102
Peers are giving and doing things

00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:29.109
that are incredibly expensive for companies to do.

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.933
What do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:35.590
expensive for companies. And what does that deliver?

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.351
It delivers localization and customization,

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:41.758
specialization, and all of this aspect about social networks

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:44.606
and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:48.702
It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:52.265
And it also delivers really fabulous innovation,

00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:53.681
and I'll talk about that later.

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:57.097
So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,

00:02:57.097 --> 00:03:01.677
and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.

00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:06.041
The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.

00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.029
Some of my favorite examples:

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.982
in transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,

00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:13.385
three and a half million people have joined up,

00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.943
and a million rides are shared every day.

00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:19.175
It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:22.262
of 2,500 TGV trains,

00:03:22.262 --> 00:03:26.238
and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.982
This is all happening with excess capacity.

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:32.469
And it's not just with transportation, my love,

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.622
but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com.

00:03:35.622 --> 00:03:38.433
I met these founders just weeks after they had launched,

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:42.889
and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.157
Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years,

00:03:47.157 --> 00:03:49.982
what people would do for five dollars.

00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:53.668
And not just easy things that anyone can do.

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:58.444
This Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.

00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:02.640
TopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.440
complex design and engineering services.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.993
When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.

00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:13.783
He said, "We have a community that owns its own company."

00:04:13.783 --> 00:04:16.055
And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:19.326
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:20.992
and they're selling it in a marketplace.

00:04:20.992 --> 00:04:24.407
It just celebrated its seventh anniversary,

00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:26.975
and after seven years, last year it delivered

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:32.467
530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:35.623
who have been making those objects.

00:04:35.623 --> 00:04:38.382
I know you guys out there who are businesspeople,

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:40.798
are thinking, "Oh my God, I want to build one of those.

00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:42.475
I see this incredible speed and scale.

00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:44.984
You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:47.752
to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"

00:04:47.752 --> 00:04:52.803
Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.

00:04:52.803 --> 00:04:56.816
I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube.

00:04:56.816 --> 00:05:00.005
Who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up

00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:02.188
would beat out Google Video? Why?

00:05:02.188 --> 00:05:04.280
I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.912
But I'm thinking, you know, they probably had

00:05:06.912 --> 00:05:08.891
the "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right,

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.885
and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides

00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:14.965
that are always participating on these networks.

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:19.164
So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now,

00:05:19.164 --> 00:05:21.025
and a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent

00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:24.424
the last two years doing that in Paris.

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:27.845
So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different

00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:30.720
building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.000
because now every single thing we do has these two

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.427
different bodies that I have to be thinking about:

00:05:35.427 --> 00:05:38.291
the owners who are going to provide the cars

00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:40.738
and the drivers who are going to rent them.

00:05:40.738 --> 00:05:44.210
Every single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.674
There are many, many examples and I'll give you one

00:05:46.674 --> 00:05:49.996
that is not my favorite example: insurance.

00:05:49.996 --> 00:05:54.525
It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.

00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:57.514
Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies

00:05:57.514 --> 00:06:01.260
and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.091
they'd never thought of it before.

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:06.458
Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,

00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:09.242
trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom,

00:06:09.242 --> 00:06:12.830
and the result was that we were able to provide owners

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.122
protection for their own driving records and their own history.

00:06:17.122 --> 00:06:18.938
The cars are completely insured during the rental,

00:06:18.938 --> 00:06:22.602
and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?

00:06:22.602 --> 00:06:25.107
They need a low deductible,

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:27.355
and 24-hour roadside assistance.

00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:30.239
So this was a trick to get these two sides.

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:34.487
So now I want to take you to the moment of --

00:06:34.487 --> 00:06:38.455
When you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company,

00:06:38.455 --> 00:06:40.849
there's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand,

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.775
and then the service launches. What happens?

00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:49.175
So all those months of work, they come into play.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:53.373
Last June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.

00:06:53.373 --> 00:06:56.983
And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.409
All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:03.855
The reservations start coming in, and here,

00:07:03.855 --> 00:07:06.922
owners who were getting text messages and emails

00:07:06.922 --> 00:07:10.015
that said, "Hey, Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend.

00:07:10.015 --> 00:07:14.419
You can earn 60 euros. Isn't that great? Yes or no?"

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.916
No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:21.926
couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.

00:07:21.926 --> 00:07:25.554
So I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between

00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:28.697
industrial production and peer production."

00:07:28.697 --> 00:07:31.809
Industrial production, the whole point of industrial production

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:35.283
is to provide a standardized, exact service model

00:07:35.283 --> 00:07:37.495
that is consistent every single time,

00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:40.496
and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made

00:07:40.496 --> 00:07:41.869
using industrial production.

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:44.607
And Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service

00:07:44.607 --> 00:07:46.191
that works fabulously.

00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:49.333
But what does peer production do? Peer production

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:52.626
is this completely different way of doing things,

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:57.698
and you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly,

00:07:57.698 --> 00:08:01.019
the first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:05.617
they figured out early on, we need to have ratings

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:09.001
and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.

00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:12.249
We can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:16.564
who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.

00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:21.622
So going back, this is my look of excitement and joy,

00:08:21.622 --> 00:08:24.056
because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for

00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:26.083
actually really did happen, and what's that?

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:28.896
That is the diversity of what's going on.

00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:31.528
You have these different fabulous owners

00:08:31.528 --> 00:08:34.958
and their different cars, different prices,

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.096
different locations. (Laughter)

00:08:37.096 --> 00:08:42.243
They dress differently, and they look different,

00:08:42.243 --> 00:08:47.963
and, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.

00:08:47.963 --> 00:08:51.073
Cool guys, excited guys,

00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:55.852
and here is Selma, who -- I love this driver.

00:08:55.852 --> 00:08:58.472
And after a year, we have 1,000 cars

00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:01.872
that are parked across France and 6,000 people

00:09:01.872 --> 00:09:04.240
who are members and eager to drive them.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.409
This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion

00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:10.770
for a traditional company.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.912
Back to this spectrum.

00:09:12.912 --> 00:09:15.628
So what's happening is, we had the yuck side,

00:09:15.628 --> 00:09:17.852
but we actually had this real wow side.

00:09:17.852 --> 00:09:20.592
And I can tell you two great stories.

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:23.559
A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:27.294
to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them,

00:09:27.294 --> 00:09:29.286
and said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are,

00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:31.806
and here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach,

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:34.606
and this is where the best fish restaurant is."

00:09:34.606 --> 00:09:37.442
And the peers also become,

00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:39.703
peers and owners create relationships,

00:09:39.703 --> 00:09:41.974
and so at the last minute people can --

00:09:41.974 --> 00:09:44.631
a driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car,

00:09:44.631 --> 00:09:46.121
is it available?" And that person will say,

00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:49.232
"Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it."

00:09:49.232 --> 00:09:52.631
So you can have these really nice things that can't happen,

00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:56.463
and it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:58.943
type of thing that's happening here, because individuals,

00:09:58.943 --> 00:10:01.814
if you're a company, what happens is you might have

00:10:01.814 --> 00:10:03.564
10 people who are in charge of innovation,

00:10:03.564 --> 00:10:05.522
or 100 people who are in charge of innovation.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:09.026
What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have

00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:12.098
tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions

00:10:12.098 --> 00:10:15.201
of people who are creating experiments on this model,

00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:17.786
and so out of all that influence and that effort,

00:10:17.786 --> 00:10:22.177
you are having this exceptional amount of innovation

00:10:22.177 --> 00:10:24.596
that is coming out.

00:10:24.596 --> 00:10:27.964
So one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I

00:10:27.964 --> 00:10:30.805
call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us

00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:33.681
about the power of the hive,

00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:36.617
and its incredible facility to create this platform

00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:40.638
that individuals want to participate and innovate on.

00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:44.058
And for me, when I think about our future,

00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:47.386
and all of those problems that seem incredibly large,

00:10:47.386 --> 00:10:50.472
the scale is impossible, the urgency is there,

00:10:50.472 --> 00:10:53.506
Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale

00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:58.092
and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.

00:10:58.092 --> 00:11:03.409
All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial.

00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:06.186
So I continue to think that

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:09.441
transportation is the center of the hard universe.

00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:11.765
All problems come back to transportation for me.

00:11:11.765 --> 00:11:15.612
But there are all these other areas that are these profound,

00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:18.977
big problems that I know that we can work on,

00:11:18.977 --> 00:11:21.753
and people are working on them in many different sectors,

00:11:21.753 --> 00:11:24.298
but there's this really fabulous group of things

00:11:24.298 --> 00:11:28.784
with the power of this Peers, Inc. model.

00:11:28.784 --> 00:11:35.269
So over the last decade, we've been reveling in

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:38.772
the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals,

00:11:38.772 --> 00:11:41.368
and for me, what Peers, Inc. does

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:45.204
is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:48.200
of the company and the corporation

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.065
and supercharging individuals.

00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:54.610
So for me, it's a collaboration.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.895
Together, we can. (Applause)

00:11:58.895 --> 00:12:01.480
Thank you. (Applause)
