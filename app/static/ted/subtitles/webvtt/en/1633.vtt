00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:04.710
I'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.017
I do experiments to test how different chemicals

00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:10.617
in the brain influence the choices we make.

00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:17.365
I'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making:

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:19.603
a cheese sandwich.

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:23.263
That's right. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich

00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:26.885
is the solution to all your tough decisions.

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:31.942
How do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study.

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:34.242
A few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.535
in how a brain chemical called serotonin

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.805
would influence people's decisions in social situations.

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.900
Specifically, we wanted to know how serotonin would affect

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.715
the way people react when they're treated unfairly.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:48.253
So we did an experiment.

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:51.399
We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.022
this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:59.654
that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:00.832
in the brain.

00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:03.809
This is the amino acid tryptophan.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170
So what we found was, when tryptophan was low,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.622
people were more likely to take revenge

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:12.170
when they're treated unfairly.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.993
That's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:18.722
that came out afterwards.

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:21.217
("A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making")

00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:23.312
("What a friend we have in cheeses")

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:26.512
("Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?

00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:31.907
("Official! Chocolate stops you being grumpy") Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?

00:01:31.907 --> 00:01:34.040
And I thought the same thing myself when these came out,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.285
because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.614
We gave people this horrible-tasting drink

00:01:40.614 --> 00:01:43.816
that affected their tryptophan levels.

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:47.497
But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found

00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:50.298
in cheese and chocolate.

00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:52.608
And of course when science says cheese and chocolate

00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:56.689
help you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.656
So there you have it:

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:02.163
the evolution of a headline.

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:04.505
When this happened, a part of me thought, well,

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:06.509
what's the big deal?

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.388
So the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end,

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:12.464
it's just a news story.

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:15.817
And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.

00:02:15.817 --> 00:02:19.714
But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time,

00:02:19.714 --> 00:02:22.841
and it affects not just the stories you read in the news

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:25.620
but also the products you see on the shelves.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.287
When the headlines rolled, what happened was,

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:31.113
the marketers came calling.

00:02:31.113 --> 00:02:34.332
Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement

00:02:34.332 --> 00:02:37.593
of a mood-boosting bottled water?

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:39.737
Or would I go on television to demonstrate,

00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:40.762
in front of a live audience,

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:44.361
that comfort foods really do make you feel better?

00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:48.322
I think these folks meant well, but had I taken them up on their offers,

00:02:48.322 --> 00:02:50.696
I would have been going beyond the science,

00:02:50.696 --> 00:02:53.953
and good scientists are careful not to do this.

00:02:53.953 --> 00:02:58.321
But nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.

00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.881
Here's one example: Neuro drinks,

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.122
a line of products, including Nuero Bliss here,

00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:07.023
which according to its label helps reduce stress,

00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:10.449
enhances mood, provides focused concentration,

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.137
and promotes a positive outlook.

00:03:13.137 --> 00:03:17.762
I have to say, this sounds awesome. (Laughter)

00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:21.638
I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:25.068
So when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was

00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:28.617
curious about some of the research backing these claims.

00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:31.543
So I went to the company's website looking to find

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:34.969
some controlled trials of their products.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.646
But I didn't find any.

00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:40.384
Trial or no trial, these claims are front and center

00:03:40.384 --> 00:03:44.346
on their label right next to a picture of a brain.

00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:50.049
And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.511
A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people

00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:55.202
to read a scientific article.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:58.529
For half the people, the article included a brain image,

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.392
and for the other half, it was the same article

00:04:00.392 --> 00:04:03.096
but it didn't have a brain image.

00:04:03.096 --> 00:04:04.728
At the end — you see where this is going —

00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:06.838
people were asked whether they agreed

00:04:06.838 --> 00:04:10.160
with the conclusions of the article.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.433
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.346
with no image.

00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:17.993
And this is how much they agree with the same article

00:04:17.993 --> 00:04:20.760
that did include a brain image.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.709
So the take-home message here is,

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:27.616
do you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.

00:04:27.616 --> 00:04:29.729
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.427
neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades,

00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:35.880
and we're constantly discovering amazing things

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.153
about the brain.

00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:40.297
Like, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT

00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:43.097
figured out how to break habits in rats

00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:47.090
just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.680
Really cool stuff.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.973
But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really

00:04:51.973 --> 00:04:57.209
high expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:00.248
So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot

00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:03.794
a couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really,

00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:06.590
for what's variously been called neuro-bunk,

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.282
neuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle.

00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:16.620
So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.532
to read people's thoughts and emotions.

00:05:20.532 --> 00:05:23.579
Here's a study published by a team of researchers

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:26.412
as an op-ed in The New York Times.

00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:30.657
The headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."

00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:35.107
It quickly became the most emailed article on the site.

00:05:35.107 --> 00:05:37.276
So how'd they figure this out?

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:40.304
They put 16 people inside a brain scanner

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:43.586
and showed them videos of ringing iPhones.

00:05:43.586 --> 00:05:47.048
The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain

00:05:47.048 --> 00:05:49.700
called the insula, a region they say

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.484
is linked to feelings of love and compassion.

00:05:53.484 --> 00:05:57.144
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula,

00:05:57.144 --> 00:06:01.431
this meant the subjects loved their iPhones.

00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:03.575
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning,

00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:07.091
and that's that the insula does a lot.

00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:09.396
Sure, it is involved in positive emotions

00:06:09.396 --> 00:06:11.738
like love and compassion,

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:14.411
but it's also involved in tons of other processes,

00:06:14.411 --> 00:06:17.484
like memory, language, attention,

00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:21.520
even anger, disgust and pain.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.983
So based on the same logic, I could equally conclude

00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:28.436
you hate your iPhone.

00:06:28.436 --> 00:06:31.280
The point here is, when you see activation in the insula,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.306
you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation

00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:38.972
from off this list, and it's a really long list.

00:06:38.972 --> 00:06:41.306
My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack

00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:44.428
have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third

00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:49.164
of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.

00:06:49.164 --> 00:06:50.678
So chances are really, really good

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:53.804
that your insula is going off right now,

00:06:53.804 --> 00:06:55.426
but I won't kid myself

00:06:55.426 --> 00:06:59.103
to think this means you love me.

00:06:59.103 --> 00:07:02.010
So speaking of love and the brain,

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.875
there's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love,

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:09.360
who claims that scientists have found the glue

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.007
that holds society together,

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:15.783
the source of love and prosperity.

00:07:15.783 --> 00:07:17.972
This time it's not a cheese sandwich.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:21.829
No, it's a hormone called oxytocin.

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:23.696
You've probably heard of it.

00:07:23.696 --> 00:07:26.588
So, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing

00:07:26.588 --> 00:07:29.533
that when you boost people's oxytocin,

00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:33.706
this increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.

00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:37.786
So he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule."

00:07:37.786 --> 00:07:40.628
Now these studies are scientifically valid,

00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:44.764
and they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:47.477
Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin

00:07:47.477 --> 00:07:52.220
increases envy. It increases gloating.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.536
Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:58.628
at the expense of other groups.

00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:02.880
And in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.700
So based on these studies, I could say oxytocin

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.451
is an immoral molecule, and call myself Dr. Strangelove.

00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:14.811
(Laughter)

00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:18.921
So we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines.

00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:21.699
We see it in supermarkets, on book covers.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:24.370
What about the clinic?

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.785
SPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology

00:08:27.785 --> 00:08:29.854
that uses a radioactive tracer

00:08:29.854 --> 00:08:32.894
to track blood flow in the brain.

00:08:32.894 --> 00:08:35.978
For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars,

00:08:35.978 --> 00:08:40.096
there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you

00:08:40.096 --> 00:08:43.549
one of these SPECT scans and use the image

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.186
to help diagnose your problems.

00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:48.715
These scans, the clinics say, can help

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.617
prevent Alzheimer's disease,

00:08:51.617 --> 00:08:54.081
solve weight and addiction issues,

00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:56.753
overcome marital conflicts,

00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:59.903
and treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses

00:08:59.903 --> 00:09:03.482
ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.

00:09:03.482 --> 00:09:06.052
This sounds great. A lot of people agree.

00:09:06.052 --> 00:09:08.218
Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions

00:09:08.218 --> 00:09:11.522
of dollars a year in business.

00:09:11.522 --> 00:09:13.606
There's just one problem.

00:09:13.606 --> 00:09:16.283
The broad consensus in neuroscience

00:09:16.283 --> 00:09:19.468
is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness

00:09:19.468 --> 00:09:22.251
from a single brain scan.

00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:24.482
But these clinics have treated

00:09:24.482 --> 00:09:26.922
tens of thousands of patients to date,

00:09:26.922 --> 00:09:28.684
many of them children,

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:32.162
and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection,

00:09:32.162 --> 00:09:38.159
so exposing people to radiation, potentially harmful.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:41.273
I am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist,

00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:45.554
about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness

00:09:45.554 --> 00:09:50.278
and even maybe to make us better and smarter.

00:09:50.278 --> 00:09:52.978
And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate

00:09:52.978 --> 00:09:57.282
help us make better decisions, count me in.

00:09:57.282 --> 00:09:59.858
But we're not there yet.

00:09:59.858 --> 00:10:03.593
We haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain,

00:10:03.593 --> 00:10:07.291
we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:10.674
just by looking at their brain scans,

00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:14.938
and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.

00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:17.142
Maybe someday we will, but until then,

00:10:17.142 --> 00:10:19.985
we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims

00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:23.371
detract resources and attention away from the real science

00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:27.130
that's playing a much longer game.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.568
So here's where you come in.

00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:32.739
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it,

00:10:32.739 --> 00:10:35.618
don't just take them at their word.

00:10:35.618 --> 00:10:38.864
Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.

00:10:38.864 --> 00:10:42.762
Ask for the part of the story that's not being told.

00:10:42.762 --> 00:10:47.850
The answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.345
But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:56.345
Thank you. (Applause)
