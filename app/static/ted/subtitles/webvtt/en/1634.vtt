00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.056
Photography has been my passion

00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:04.834
ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera,

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:07.194
but today I want to share with you

00:00:07.194 --> 00:00:10.476
the 15 most treasured photos of mine,

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:12.071
and I didn't take any of them.

00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:14.962
There were no art directors, no stylists,

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:19.398
no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting.

00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:23.674
In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.

00:00:23.674 --> 00:00:25.186
My story begins

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:27.704
when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement,

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.467
and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:34.903
on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th.

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:38.444
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later,

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:41.843
so we decided to take the same picture.

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:44.092
Well you can see where this is going.

00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:45.826
Approaching my daughter's third birthday,

00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:48.268
my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York

00:00:48.268 --> 00:00:52.399
and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?"

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.426
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:58.743
You know, it's remarkable how universal

00:00:58.743 --> 00:01:01.859
the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.761
No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera.

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:10.425
Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives.

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.426
It's really become sacred to us.

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:15.057
This one was taken just weeks after 9/11,

00:01:15.057 --> 00:01:19.272
and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:22.032
in ways a five-year-old could understand.

00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:24.639
So these photos are far more than proxies

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.780
for a single moment, or even a specific trip.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.943
They're also ways for us to freeze time

00:01:30.943 --> 00:01:34.859
for one week in October

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.207
and reflect on our times

00:01:37.207 --> 00:01:39.359
and how we change from year to year,

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.480
and not just physically, but in every way.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.847
Because while we take the same photo,

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:47.055
our perspectives change,

00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:50.408
and she reaches new milestones,

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:52.887
and I get to see life through her eyes,

00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:57.612
and how she interacts with and sees everything.

00:01:57.612 --> 00:02:00.375
This very focused time we get to spend together

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:05.862
is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year.

00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:08.923
Recently, on one trip, we were walking,

00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:11.095
and she stops dead in her tracks,

00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:14.566
and she points to a red awning of the doll store

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.990
that she loved when she was little

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.262
on our earlier trips.

00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:21.894
And she describes to me the feeling she felt

00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:25.278
as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:28.307
She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.968
when she saw that place for the very first time

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:33.640
nine years earlier.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.768
And now what she's looking at in New York

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:37.692
are colleges,

00:02:37.692 --> 00:02:40.992
because she's determined to go to school in New York.

00:02:40.992 --> 00:02:43.873
And it hit me: One of the most important things

00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:47.882
we all make are memories.

00:02:47.882 --> 00:02:51.106
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:55.039
in consciously creating memories.

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.818
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots,

00:02:57.818 --> 00:02:59.472
I'm not in many of the family photos.

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:01.971
I'm always the one taking the picture.

00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:04.426
So I want to encourage everyone today

00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:06.525
to get in the shot,

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:09.304
and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask,

00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:11.346
"Will you take our picture?"

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:17.084
Thank you. (Applause)
