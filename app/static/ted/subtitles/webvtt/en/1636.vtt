00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.418
On March 14, this year,

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:06.298
I posted this poster on Facebook.

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:08.723
This is an image of me and my daughter

00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:11.457
holding the Israeli flag.

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.542
I will try to explain to you about the context of why

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:17.148
and when I posted.

00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:20.269
A few days ago, I was sitting waiting

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.573
on the line at the grocery store,

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:25.859
and the owner and one of the clients

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.549
were talking to each other,

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:29.607
and the owner was explaining to the client

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:33.083
that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:37.796
And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:40.457
(Laughter)

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:45.458
("10,000 missiles") This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel.

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:49.046
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now,

00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:52.421
and we have people, you know, afraid.

00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:55.984
It's like every year it's the last minute

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:58.459
that we can do something about the war with Iran.

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:02.131
It's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever,

00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.383
for 10 years now.

00:01:04.383 --> 00:01:06.780
So at some point it became, you know, to me,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.830
I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.805
and I posted the one I just showed you before.

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.867
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook,

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:18.524
my friends like it, don't like it,

00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:20.255
most of the time don't like it, don't share it,

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:22.478
don't nothing,

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:24.471
and it's another day.

00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:28.423
So I went to sleep, and that was it for me.

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:31.339
And later on in the night, I woke up

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:33.172
because I'm always waking up in the night,

00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:35.747
and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots,

00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:38.899
you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:39.982
(Laughter)

00:01:39.982 --> 00:01:42.319
And I was like, "What's going on?"

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.823
So I come to the computer and I start looking on,

00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:48.848
and suddenly I see many people talking to me,

00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:51.211
most of them I don't know,

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.796
and a few of them from Iran,

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:57.277
which is -- What?

00:01:57.277 --> 00:01:59.894
Because you have to understand,

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:03.548
in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:05.518
We don't know people from Iran.

00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:09.883
It's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from --

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:13.337
it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.

00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:16.074
And now people from Iran are talking to me.

00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:19.583
So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:24.443
she saw the poster and she asked her family to come,

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.059
because they don't have a computer, she asked her family

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.607
to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.

00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:32.289
So I'm like, whoa.

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.707
I ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:38.756
People are crying, and she came, she read the text,

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:41.456
and she started to cry.

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:44.094
And everybody's crying now. (Laughter)

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:46.894
So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex,

00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:50.208
as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:53.906
what I'd just seen, and people started to see them

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:56.506
and to share them, and that's how it started.

00:02:56.506 --> 00:03:00.245
The day after, when really it became a lot of talking,

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.468
I said to myself, and my wife said to me,

00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:03.734
I also want a poster,

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:07.196
so this is her. (Laughter)

00:03:07.196 --> 00:03:12.178
Because it's working, put me in a poster now.

00:03:12.178 --> 00:03:15.288
But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work,

00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:18.586
but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:19.489
who want to say something.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.326
So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want,

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:24.414
and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:28.096
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students

00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:32.187
and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.

00:03:32.187 --> 00:03:35.084
And that's how it started. And that's how, really,

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:38.497
it's unleashed, because suddenly people

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:40.947
from Facebook, friends and others,

00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:43.904
just understand that they can be part of it.

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:45.638
It's not just one dude making one poster,

00:03:45.638 --> 00:03:49.151
it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures

00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:51.527
and ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it.

00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:56.161
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."

00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:59.529
It became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense.

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:03.844
I mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:06.967
to come, graphic designers most of them,

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:09.570
to make posters with me, because I didn't have the time.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.226
It was a huge amount of pictures.

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:15.621
So for a few days, that's how my living room was.

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:20.144
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images,

00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:24.830
but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.512
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it,

00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:31.977
because I know people: They don't read, they see images.

00:04:31.977 --> 00:04:34.953
If it's an image, they may read it.

00:04:34.953 --> 00:04:37.670
So here are a few of them.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.943
("You are my first Israelian friend. I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians, anyway nice to see you!")

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:43.479
("I love that blue. I love that star. I love that flag.") This one is really moving for me because it's the story

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.293
of a girl who has been raised in Iran

00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:52.571
to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning,

00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:55.902
and now that she sees the posters that we're sending,

00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:58.577
she starts -- she said that she changed her mind,

00:04:58.577 --> 00:05:01.918
and now she loves that blue, she loves that star,

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:04.253
and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag,

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:08.073
and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another,

00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:13.156
and just a few days after I posted the first poster.

00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:15.768
The day after,

00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:18.485
Iranians started to respond with their own posters.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.911
They have graphic designers. What? (Laughter)

00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:24.253
Crazy, crazy.

00:05:24.253 --> 00:05:27.778
So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces,

00:05:27.778 --> 00:05:29.350
but they want to spread the message.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.486
They want to respond. They want to say the same thing.

00:05:31.486 --> 00:05:34.591
So. And now it's communication.

00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:38.017
It's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians

00:05:38.017 --> 00:05:40.673
sending the same message, one to each other.

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.351
("My Israeli Friends. I don't hate you. I don't want War.")

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:46.511
This never happened before, and this is two people

00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.428
supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war,

00:05:49.428 --> 00:05:52.047
and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say,

00:05:52.047 --> 00:05:56.198
"I like this guy. I love those guys."

00:05:56.198 --> 00:06:00.636
And it became really big at some point.

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:03.948
And then it became news.

00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:08.148
Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.

00:06:08.148 --> 00:06:10.447
And suddenly, there is something that was happening

00:06:10.447 --> 00:06:13.273
that was good news. So the guys on the news,

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:14.961
they say, "Okay, let's talk about this."

00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:18.160
And they just came, and it was so much,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.599
I remember one day, Michal,

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.399
she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him,

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.457
"Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody."

00:06:27.457 --> 00:06:32.954
So she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?

00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:35.870
Who is everybody?""Everybody."

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.484
They said, "Syria?" "Syria."

00:06:37.484 --> 00:06:39.224
"Lebanon?""Lebanon."

00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:43.195
At some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today.

00:06:43.195 --> 00:06:45.907
It's everybody." The Chinese.

00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:51.533
And we were just at the beginning of the story.

00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:53.615
Something crazy also happened.

00:06:53.615 --> 00:06:56.803
Every time a country started talking about it,

00:06:56.803 --> 00:07:00.072
like Germany, America, wherever,

00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:05.500
a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.257
with the same stories, so at the beginning

00:07:07.257 --> 00:07:11.072
we had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian

00:07:11.072 --> 00:07:16.150
sitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran?

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.060
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.662
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel.

00:07:19.662 --> 00:07:22.290
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.758
And this whole list of pages on Facebook

00:07:25.758 --> 00:07:27.858
dedicated to the same message,

00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:33.695
to people sending their love, one to each other.

00:07:33.695 --> 00:07:37.391
The moment I really understood that something was happening,

00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:39.841
a friend of mine told me,

00:07:39.841 --> 00:07:41.843
"Google the word 'Israel.'"

00:07:41.843 --> 00:07:45.550
And those were the first images on those days

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.829
that popped up from Google

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:51.435
when you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran."

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:55.749
We really changed how people see the Middle East.

00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:57.518
Because you're not in the Middle East.

00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.809
You're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East,

00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:01.465
so you go on Google and you say, "Israel,"

00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:02.674
and they give you the bad stuff.

00:08:02.674 --> 00:08:07.443
And for a few days you got those images.

00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:09.842
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page

00:08:09.842 --> 00:08:15.230
is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.093
went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know,

00:08:18.093 --> 00:08:20.685
commented on one of the photos.

00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:25.193
So for five months now, that's what we are doing,

00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:29.943
me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:32.230
We're showing a new reality

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.433
by just making images

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:37.330
because that's how the world perceives us.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.131
They see images of us, and they see bad images.

00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:45.182
So we're working on making good images. End of story.

00:08:45.182 --> 00:08:50.097
Look at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page.

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:52.615
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:56.394
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance

00:08:56.394 --> 00:08:58.936
of the Israeli fallen soldier

00:08:58.936 --> 00:09:02.899
putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page.

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:06.290
This is the enemy.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.762
What?

00:09:07.762 --> 00:09:09.804
("Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in Bulgaria")

00:09:09.804 --> 00:09:11.509
And it's going both ways.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:16.047
It's like, we are showing respect, one to each other.

00:09:16.047 --> 00:09:21.033
And we're understanding. And you show compassion.

00:09:21.033 --> 00:09:25.794
And you become friends.

00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:29.021
And at some point, you become friends on Facebook,

00:09:29.021 --> 00:09:30.798
and you become friends in life.

00:09:30.798 --> 00:09:33.614
You can go and travel and meet people.

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:36.992
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago.

00:09:36.992 --> 00:09:40.819
I went there to open an exposition about Iran

00:09:40.819 --> 00:09:43.276
and I met there with people from the page

00:09:43.276 --> 00:09:45.582
that told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe,

00:09:45.582 --> 00:09:48.186
I'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland,

00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:50.907
from Germany," of course, and from Israel people came,

00:09:50.907 --> 00:09:55.482
and we just met there for the first time in real life.

00:09:55.482 --> 00:09:59.999
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:02.613
for the first time. And we just shake hands,

00:10:02.613 --> 00:10:04.616
and have a coffee and a nice discussion,

00:10:04.616 --> 00:10:07.336
and we talk about food and basketball.

00:10:07.336 --> 00:10:09.074
And that was the end of it.

00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:11.828
Remember that image from the beginning?

00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:20.209
At some point we met in real life, and we became friends.

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:22.873
And it goes the other way around.

00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:25.666
Some girl that we met on Facebook

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:28.576
never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran,

00:10:28.576 --> 00:10:32.134
lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis

00:10:32.134 --> 00:10:34.364
because of what she knows about us,

00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:37.978
decides after a few months of talking on the Internet

00:10:37.978 --> 00:10:41.022
with some Israelis to come to Israel,

00:10:41.022 --> 00:10:45.519
and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:51.646
and says, "Okay, not that big a deal."

00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:55.233
So a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher,

00:10:55.233 --> 00:10:57.706
so we start this new campaign

00:10:57.706 --> 00:11:01.078
called "Not ready to die in your war."

00:11:01.078 --> 00:11:03.891
I mean, it's plus/minus the same message,

00:11:03.891 --> 00:11:07.565
but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.

00:11:07.565 --> 00:11:10.516
And again, something amazing happened,

00:11:10.516 --> 00:11:13.854
something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.

00:11:13.854 --> 00:11:18.124
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy

00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:20.229
at the first campaign and just sent, you know,

00:11:20.229 --> 00:11:22.417
their foot and half their faces,

00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:24.817
now they're sending their faces, and they're saying,

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:33.882
"Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."

00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:37.402
Just read where those guys are from.

00:11:37.402 --> 00:11:39.717
And for every guy from Israel,

00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:43.008
you've got someone from Iran.

00:11:51.084 --> 00:11:53.808
Just people sending their pictures.

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:13.314
Crazy, yes?

00:12:13.314 --> 00:12:14.950
So --

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:23.292
(Applause)

00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:31.604
So you may ask yourself, who is this dude?

00:12:31.604 --> 00:12:35.258
My name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli,

00:12:35.258 --> 00:12:39.538
I'm a father of two, I'm a husband,

00:12:39.538 --> 00:12:44.518
and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design.

00:12:44.518 --> 00:12:48.286
And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time

00:12:48.286 --> 00:12:51.669
I've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but,

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:54.895
this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean — "

00:12:54.895 --> 00:12:58.946
I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years,

00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:02.496
and I know how it looks from the ground.

00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:06.822
I know how it can look really bad.

00:13:06.822 --> 00:13:10.959
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do,

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:14.398
to try to reach the other side before it's too late,

00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:16.313
because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.

00:13:16.313 --> 00:13:20.734
And sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes,

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:24.804
but maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:28.159
Maybe as people, because especially in Israel,

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:31.572
we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech,

00:13:31.572 --> 00:13:35.015
and maybe that little thing can change something.

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:39.360
And really, we can be our own ambassadors.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:46.096
We can just send a message and hope for the best.

00:13:46.096 --> 00:13:48.438
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me

00:13:48.438 --> 00:13:53.218
on the stage just to make with you one image,

00:13:53.218 --> 00:13:55.343
because it's all about images.

00:13:55.343 --> 00:13:59.914
And maybe that image will help us change something.

00:13:59.914 --> 00:14:03.421
Just raise that. Exactly.

00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:05.922
And I'm just going to take a picture of it,

00:14:05.922 --> 00:14:08.724
and I'm just going to post it on Facebook

00:14:08.724 --> 00:14:13.855
with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.150
Oh my God.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.512
Don't cry.

00:14:21.512 --> 00:14:23.203
Thank you guys.

00:14:23.203 --> 00:14:35.241
(Applause)
