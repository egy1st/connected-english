00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:02.765
One day in 1819,

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:05.524
3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:08.454
in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,

00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:12.494
20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater.

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:14.674
They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped

00:00:14.674 --> 00:00:17.575
a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:19.904
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells,

00:00:19.904 --> 00:00:24.217
the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:26.480
These men were 10,000 miles from home,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.703
more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:31.907
In their small boats, they carried only

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:33.473
rudimentary navigational equipment

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:37.121
and limited supplies of food and water.

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:39.325
These were the men of the whaleship Essex,

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:41.980
whose story would later inspire parts of "Moby Dick."

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.929
Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.855
but think about how much worse it would have been then.

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:50.080
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.992
No search party was coming to look for these men.

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:55.854
So most of us have never experienced a situation

00:00:55.854 --> 00:00:59.357
as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:01.224
but we all know what it's like to be afraid.

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:03.518
We know how fear feels,

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:05.622
but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:07.267
what our fears mean.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.104
As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear

00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:13.017
as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:15.835
like baby teeth or roller skates.

00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:18.330
And I think it's no accident that we think this way.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.937
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings

00:01:20.937 --> 00:01:23.676
are hard-wired to be optimists.

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:26.459
So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.437
as a danger in and of itself.

00:01:28.437 --> 00:01:31.434
"Don't worry," we like to say to one another. "Don't panic."

00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:34.083
In English, fear is something we conquer.

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:37.916
It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:40.121
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?

00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:44.264
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,

00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:46.642
something that can be as profound and insightful

00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:49.296
as storytelling itself?

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:51.889
It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.168
in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.449
When I was a child, I lived in California,

00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:00.138
which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,

00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:04.146
but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:07.187
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier

00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:09.620
that hung above our dining table swing back and forth

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.795
during every minor earthquake,

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:14.098
and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified

00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:16.619
that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.491
And what we say about kids who have fears like that

00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:22.719
is that they have a vivid imagination.

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.109
But at a certain point, most of us learn

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.995
to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.752
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,

00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:33.732
and not every earthquake brings buildings down.

00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:37.140
But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.251
fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.

00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.112
The same incredible imaginations that produced "The Origin of Species,"

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:46.969
"Jane Eyre" and "The Remembrance of Things Past,"

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.308
also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives

00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:54.764
of Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:57.693
So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear

00:02:57.693 --> 00:03:00.997
from visionaries and young children?

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.857
Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:07.544
to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.

00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:09.663
Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations

00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:13.419
were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.968
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:19.671
The time had come for the men to make a plan,

00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:22.397
but they had very few options.

00:03:22.397 --> 00:03:24.828
In his fascinating account of the disaster,

00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:27.568
Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:31.968
as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.

00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:34.268
The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach

00:03:34.268 --> 00:03:38.044
were the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.

00:03:38.044 --> 00:03:40.566
But they'd heard some frightening rumors.

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.244
They'd been told that these islands,

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:46.488
and several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.

00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:48.864
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:50.505
and eaten for dinner.

00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:53.257
Another possible destination was Hawaii,

00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:55.129
but given the season, the captain was afraid

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.350
they'd be struck by severe storms.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.142
Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:05.766
to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:07.655
a certain band of winds that could eventually

00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:09.919
push them toward the coast of South America.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.640
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.151
would stretch their supplies of food and water.

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.557
To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,

00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.918
to starve to death before reaching land.

00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:26.310
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.209
and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:31.863
would govern whether they lived or died.

00:04:31.863 --> 00:04:36.073
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.

00:04:36.073 --> 00:04:38.351
What if instead of calling them fears,

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.962
we called them stories?

00:04:39.962 --> 00:04:42.195
Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.

00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:45.255
It's a kind of unintentional storytelling

00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:48.185
that we are all born knowing how to do.

00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:50.948
And fears and storytelling have the same components.

00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:52.813
They have the same architecture.

00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:55.490
Like all stories, fears have characters.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.913
In our fears, the characters are us.

00:04:57.913 --> 00:05:02.215
Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:06.331
You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.

00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:08.899
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.248
every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.

00:05:12.248 --> 00:05:15.204
Picture a cannibal, human teeth

00:05:15.204 --> 00:05:17.411
sinking into human skin,

00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:20.465
human flesh roasting over a fire.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:23.201
Fears also have suspense.

00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.491
If I've done my job as a storyteller today,

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.999
you should be wondering what happened

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.100
to the men of the whaleship Essex.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.345
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.

00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:36.898
Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention

00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:40.837
on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:

00:05:40.837 --> 00:05:43.594
What will happen next?

00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:46.298
In other words, our fears make us think about the future.

00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:48.316
And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable

00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:49.986
of thinking about the future in this way,

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:52.877
of projecting ourselves forward in time,

00:05:52.877 --> 00:05:55.289
and this mental time travel is just one more thing

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.911
that fears have in common with storytelling.

00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:01.404
As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction

00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:03.287
is learning to predict how one event in a story

00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:05.031
will affect all the other events,

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.080
and fear works in that same way.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.257
In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.

00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:14.903
When I was writing my first novel, "The Age Of Miracles,"

00:06:14.903 --> 00:06:17.864
I spent months trying to figure out what would happen

00:06:17.864 --> 00:06:21.053
if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.

00:06:21.053 --> 00:06:23.945
What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:25.988
What would happen to our minds?

00:06:25.988 --> 00:06:29.094
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar

00:06:29.094 --> 00:06:31.215
these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:33.452
as a child frightened in the night.

00:06:33.452 --> 00:06:35.983
If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,

00:06:35.983 --> 00:06:39.849
what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.549
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:47.052
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears

00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:49.979
but as stories, we should think of ourselves

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.210
as the authors of those stories.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.172
But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves

00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:56.676
as the readers of our fears, and how we choose

00:06:56.676 --> 00:07:01.011
to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.

00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.012
Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.

00:07:04.012 --> 00:07:06.933
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:09.559
and the author found that these people shared a habit

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.918
that he called "productive paranoia," which meant that

00:07:12.918 --> 00:07:15.439
these people, instead of dismissing their fears,

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.102
these people read them closely, they studied them,

00:07:18.102 --> 00:07:21.702
and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.

00:07:21.702 --> 00:07:23.619
So that way, if their worst fears came true,

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:25.697
their businesses were ready.

00:07:25.697 --> 00:07:30.048
And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:33.207
That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.

00:07:33.207 --> 00:07:38.129
Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:41.524
But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears

00:07:41.524 --> 00:07:43.922
that our imaginations concoct.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.906
So how can we tell the difference between

00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:49.726
the fears worth listening to and all the others?

00:07:49.726 --> 00:07:52.203
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex

00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:56.486
offers an illuminating, if tragic, example.

00:07:56.486 --> 00:08:01.213
After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:05.086
Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:07.413
and instead embarked on the longer

00:08:07.413 --> 00:08:10.540
and much more difficult route to South America.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.010
After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.089
as they knew they might,

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:17.784
and they were still quite far from land.

00:08:17.784 --> 00:08:20.671
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up

00:08:20.671 --> 00:08:25.157
by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,

00:08:25.157 --> 00:08:30.060
and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.423
Herman Melville, who used this story as research for "Moby Dick,"

00:08:33.423 --> 00:08:37.303
wrote years later, and from dry land, quote,

00:08:37.303 --> 00:08:39.927
"All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex

00:08:39.927 --> 00:08:42.616
might in all human probability have been avoided

00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:45.183
had they, immediately after leaving the wreck,

00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:47.064
steered straight for Tahiti.

00:08:47.064 --> 00:08:51.629
But," as Melville put it, "they dreaded cannibals."

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:54.675
So the question is, why did these men dread cannibals

00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:58.864
so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?

00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:00.731
Why were they swayed by one story

00:09:00.731 --> 00:09:03.370
so much more than the other?

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.892
Looked at from this angle,

00:09:04.892 --> 00:09:08.191
theirs becomes a story about reading.

00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.847
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader

00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:13.646
has a combination of two very different temperaments,

00:09:13.646 --> 00:09:16.496
the artistic and the scientific.

00:09:16.496 --> 00:09:19.000
A good reader has an artist's passion,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.423
a willingness to get caught up in the story,

00:09:21.423 --> 00:09:23.534
but just as importantly, the readers also needs

00:09:23.534 --> 00:09:26.745
the coolness of judgment of a scientist,

00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:28.236
which acts to temper and complicate

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:31.634
the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.

00:09:31.634 --> 00:09:34.839
As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:38.479
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:42.468
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story.

00:09:42.468 --> 00:09:44.592
Of all the narratives their fears wrote,

00:09:44.592 --> 00:09:48.243
they responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,

00:09:48.243 --> 00:09:51.462
the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:

00:09:51.462 --> 00:09:53.413
cannibals.

00:09:53.413 --> 00:09:55.694
But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:59.175
more like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,

00:09:59.175 --> 00:10:01.935
they would have listened instead to the less violent

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:05.223
but the more likely tale, the story of starvation,

00:10:05.223 --> 00:10:10.803
and headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.

00:10:10.803 --> 00:10:13.671
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears,

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:15.648
we too would be less often swayed

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.524
by the most salacious among them.

00:10:17.524 --> 00:10:19.192
Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about

00:10:19.192 --> 00:10:21.380
serial killers and plane crashes,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.246
and more time concerned with the subtler

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:25.300
and slower disasters we face:

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.048
the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,

00:10:28.048 --> 00:10:30.591
the gradual changes in our climate.

00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:34.240
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.688
so too might our subtlest fears be the truest.

00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:41.585
Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift

00:10:41.585 --> 00:10:44.517
of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,

00:10:44.517 --> 00:10:46.752
a way of glimpsing what might be the future

00:10:46.752 --> 00:10:50.187
when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.

00:10:50.187 --> 00:10:53.583
Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:55.740
as our favorite works of literature:

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.785
a little wisdom, a bit of insight

00:10:58.785 --> 00:11:01.359
and a version of that most elusive thing --

00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:02.610
the truth.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.641
Thank you. (Applause)
