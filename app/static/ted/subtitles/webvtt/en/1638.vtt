00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:03.825
So a friend of mine who's a political scientist,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.428
he told me several months ago

00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:07.496
exactly what this month would be like.

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:10.410
He said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.016
it's going to come at the beginning of 2013.

00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:16.776
Both parties absolutely need to resolve it,

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:19.601
but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:23.818
Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due,

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:26.438
so he said, December, you're just going to see lots of

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:29.658
angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart,

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:32.407
reports of phone calls that aren't going well,

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.569
people saying nothing's happening at all,

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:37.115
and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's,

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:39.723
we're going to hear, "Okay, they resolved everything."

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:44.311
He told me that a few months ago. He said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it,

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.745
and I got an email from him today saying, all right,

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:50.724
we're basically on track, but now I'm 80 percent positive

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:52.400
that they're going to resolve it.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.944
And it made me think. I love studying

00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:56.937
these moments in American history

00:00:56.937 --> 00:01:00.837
when there was this frenzy of partisan anger,

00:01:00.837 --> 00:01:03.978
that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:08.218
The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:11.779
and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:14.100
and how it would be backed up, with Alexander Hamilton

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.344
saying, "We need a central bank, the First Bank of the United States,

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:19.143
or else the dollar will have no value.

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:20.768
This economy won't work,"

00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:23.177
and Thomas Jefferson saying, "The people won't trust that.

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:26.965
They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority."

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:32.487
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy,

00:01:32.487 --> 00:01:36.137
and at every moment, different partisans saying,

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:38.325
"Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse,"

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.474
and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:43.698
on whatever it is we wanted to buy.

00:01:43.698 --> 00:01:46.431
To give you a quick primer on where we are,

00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:48.210
a quick refresher on where we are.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.774
So the fiscal cliff, I was told

00:01:50.774 --> 00:01:53.240
that that's too partisan a thing to say,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.662
although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking.

00:01:56.662 --> 00:01:59.023
People say we should call it the fiscal slope,

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:01.069
or we should call it an austerity crisis,

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.455
but then other people say, no, that's even more partisan.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:06.232
So I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:10.929
arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.556
And this is what the inevitable problem looks like.

00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:18.914
So this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage

00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:21.276
of our overall economy, of GDP.

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:24.644
The light blue dotted line represents

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.773
the Congressional Budget Office's best guess

00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:30.848
of what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything,

00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:34.364
and as you can see, sometime around 2027,

00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:36.652
we reach Greek levels of debt,

00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:39.540
somewhere around 130 percent of GDP,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.900
which tells you that some time in the next 20 years,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.270
if Congress does absolutely nothing,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.944
we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors,

00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:50.545
the world's bond buyers, are going to say,

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:53.335
"We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money,

00:02:53.335 --> 00:02:55.374
except at really high interest rates."

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:58.240
And at that moment our economy collapses.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.089
But remember, Greece is there today.

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.991
We're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time

00:03:03.991 --> 00:03:06.212
to avoid that crisis,

00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:09.907
and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:13.444
at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis.

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:16.852
Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem.

00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:19.796
The dark blue line is how much the government spends.

00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:23.253
The light blue line is how much the government gets in.

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:26.013
And as you can see, for most of recent history,

00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:29.645
except for a brief period, we have consistently spent

00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:32.845
more than we take in. Thus the national debt.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:36.724
But as you can also see, projected going forward,

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:39.740
the gap widens a bit and raises a bit,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.789
and this graph is only through 2021.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:45.452
It gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.

00:03:45.452 --> 00:03:49.577
And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is.

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:52.666
The Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:56.784
We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap,

00:03:56.784 --> 00:03:59.040
especially if we raise taxes on the rich.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.663
The Republicans say, hey, no, no, we've got a better idea.

00:04:01.663 --> 00:04:03.102
Why don't we lower both lines?

00:04:03.102 --> 00:04:07.057
Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes,

00:04:07.057 --> 00:04:10.506
and then we'll be on an even more favorable

00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:12.985
long-term deficit trajectory?

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:17.564
And behind this powerful disagreement between

00:04:17.564 --> 00:04:19.344
how to close that gap,

00:04:19.344 --> 00:04:22.729
there's the worst kind of cynical party politics,

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.102
the worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff,

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:32.363
but there's also this powerfully interesting,

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:34.796
respectful disagreement between

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:38.323
two fundamentally different economic philosophies.

00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:43.146
And I like to think, when I picture how Republicans

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:48.277
see the economy, what I picture is just some amazingly

00:04:48.277 --> 00:04:51.588
well-engineered machine, some perfect machine.

00:04:51.588 --> 00:04:56.066
Unfortunately, I picture it made in Germany or Japan,

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:58.919
but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.015
every bit of human endeavor and taking resources,

00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:06.364
money, labor, capital, machinery,

00:05:06.364 --> 00:05:10.614
away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts,

00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:12.210
and while this might cause temporary dislocation,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.704
what it does is it builds up the more productive areas

00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:18.334
and lets the less productive areas fade away and die,

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:21.110
and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.448
so much richer for everybody.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:27.361
And this view generally believes that there is a role for government,

00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:30.181
a small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying

00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:32.430
and cheating and hurting each other,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.734
maybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department

00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:38.734
and an army, but to have a very limited reach

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:41.734
into the mechanisms of this machinery.

00:05:41.734 --> 00:05:45.910
And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic-leaning

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.878
economists picture this economy,

00:05:48.878 --> 00:05:51.434
most Democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists,

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.174
they believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time.

00:05:54.174 --> 00:05:58.294
It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.

00:05:58.294 --> 00:06:02.210
But that system has tons of problems.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.539
Wealth piles up in the wrong places.

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.813
Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive.

00:06:08.813 --> 00:06:11.681
That's not going to create an equitable, fair society.

00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:14.553
That machine doesn't care about the environment,

00:06:14.553 --> 00:06:16.619
about racism, about all these issues

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.417
that make this life worse for all of us,

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:22.496
and so the government does have a role to take resources

00:06:22.496 --> 00:06:25.777
from more productive uses, or from richer sources,

00:06:25.777 --> 00:06:28.445
and give them to other sources.

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:33.500
And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.558
you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve,

00:06:37.558 --> 00:06:41.547
because the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are,

00:06:41.547 --> 00:06:44.315
the more each side thinks they know the answer

00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:47.668
and the other side is just going to ruin everything.

00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:50.803
And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot

00:06:50.803 --> 00:06:53.866
of the last few years really depressed about this,

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:56.915
until this year, I learned something that

00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:00.395
I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news,

00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:03.256
and it's so shocking, I don't like saying it, because I think

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.761
people won't believe me.

00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:06.079
But here's what I learned.

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:08.499
The American people, taken as a whole,

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:11.699
when it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues,

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.422
are moderate, pragmatic centrists.

00:07:15.422 --> 00:07:17.687
And I know that's hard to believe, that the American people

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.120
are moderate, pragmatic centrists.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.701
But let me explain what I'm thinking.

00:07:21.701 --> 00:07:24.998
When you look at how the federal government spends money,

00:07:24.998 --> 00:07:27.572
so this is the battle right here,

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.265
55 percent, more than half, is on Social Security,

00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:32.633
Medicare, Medicaid, a few other health programs,

00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:35.652
20 percent defense, 19 percent discretionary,

00:07:35.652 --> 00:07:37.558
and six percent interest.

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:42.276
So when we're talking about cutting government spending,

00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:44.282
this is the pie we're talking about,

00:07:44.282 --> 00:07:47.869
and Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:51.402
what party they're in, overwhelmingly like

00:07:51.402 --> 00:07:53.841
that big 55 percent chunk.

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.833
They like Social Security. They like Medicare.

00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:59.361
They even like Medicaid, even though that goes to the poor and indigent,

00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:01.785
which you might think would have less support.

00:08:01.785 --> 00:08:05.736
And they do not want it fundamentally touched,

00:08:05.736 --> 00:08:09.927
although the American people are remarkably comfortable,

00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:12.839
and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans,

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:17.604
with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.

00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:20.365
Social Security is fairly easy to fix.

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:24.149
The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:26.443
So gradually raise Social Security retirement age,

00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:28.816
maybe only on people not yet born.

00:08:28.816 --> 00:08:31.241
Americans are about 50/50,

00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:33.237
whether they're Democrats or Republicans.

00:08:33.237 --> 00:08:35.589
Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors,

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:38.910
seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:43.925
People generally are comfortable with it, Democrats and Republicans.

00:08:43.925 --> 00:08:46.232
Raise medical health care contributions?

00:08:46.232 --> 00:08:48.661
Everyone hates that equally, but Republicans

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:51.333
and Democrats hate that together.

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:54.447
And so what this tells me is, when you look at

00:08:54.447 --> 00:08:58.277
the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems,

00:08:58.277 --> 00:09:05.662
we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue.

00:09:05.662 --> 00:09:08.943
We're comfortable with it needing some tweaks, but we want to keep it.

00:09:08.943 --> 00:09:11.738
We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.

00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:16.024
Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan,

00:09:16.024 --> 00:09:19.506
and where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend,

00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:21.389
we don't care, spend some more,

00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:23.295
and that of course is Republicans

00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:25.275
when it comes to military defense spending.

00:09:25.275 --> 00:09:27.770
They way outweigh Democrats.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.565
The vast majority want to protect military defense spending.

00:09:32.565 --> 00:09:34.786
That's 20 percent of the budget,

00:09:34.786 --> 00:09:38.469
and that presents a more difficult issue.

00:09:38.469 --> 00:09:41.394
I should also note that the [discretionary] spending,

00:09:41.394 --> 00:09:43.528
which is about 19 percent of the budget,

00:09:43.528 --> 00:09:45.898
that is Democratic and Republican issues,

00:09:45.898 --> 00:09:48.266
so you do have welfare, food stamps, other programs

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:50.300
that tend to be popular among Democrats,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.265
but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior

00:09:53.265 --> 00:09:56.210
inducements for oil drilling and other things,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.825
which tend to be popular among Republicans.

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:03.149
Now when it comes to taxes, there is more disagreement.

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:05.013
That's a more partisan area.

00:10:05.013 --> 00:10:08.407
You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:12.456
of raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year,

00:10:12.456 --> 00:10:17.696
Republicans sort of against it, although if you break it out by income,

00:10:17.696 --> 00:10:22.389
Republicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea.

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:26.744
So basically Republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don't want to be taxed.

00:10:26.744 --> 00:10:30.000
Raising taxes on investment income, you also see

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.864
about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans

00:10:32.864 --> 00:10:36.663
are comfortable with that idea.

00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:39.688
This brings up a really important point, which is that

00:10:39.688 --> 00:10:42.304
we tend in this country to talk about Democrats

00:10:42.304 --> 00:10:44.115
and Republicans and think there's this little group

00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:46.480
over there called independents that's, what, two percent?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.592
If you add Democrats, you add Republicans,

00:10:48.592 --> 00:10:50.086
you've got the American people.

00:10:50.086 --> 00:10:53.032
But that is not the case at all.

00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:58.177
And it has not been the case for most of modern American history.

00:10:58.177 --> 00:11:01.994
Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats.

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:04.843
Around a quarter say that they are Republicans.

00:11:04.843 --> 00:11:09.323
A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians, or socialists,

00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:12.010
or some other small third party,

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.217
and the largest block, 40 percent, say they're independents.

00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:20.138
So most Americans are not partisan,

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.306
and most of the people in the independent camp

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:25.997
fall somewhere in between, so even though we have

00:11:25.997 --> 00:11:29.557
tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues

00:11:29.557 --> 00:11:31.853
of Democrats and Republicans,

00:11:31.853 --> 00:11:35.645
we have even more overlap when you add in the independents.

00:11:35.645 --> 00:11:38.885
Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues.

00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:40.998
We get to hate each other on gun control

00:11:40.998 --> 00:11:43.278
and abortion and the environment,

00:11:43.278 --> 00:11:46.150
but on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.982
we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say.

00:11:49.982 --> 00:11:52.014
And in fact, there's this other group of people

00:11:52.014 --> 00:11:55.352
who are not as divided as people might think,

00:11:55.352 --> 00:11:57.365
and that group is economists.

00:11:57.365 --> 00:12:02.668
I talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s

00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:05.766
and '80s it was ugly being an economist.

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:08.941
You were in what they called the saltwater camp,

00:12:08.941 --> 00:12:13.555
meaning Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley,

00:12:13.555 --> 00:12:16.523
or you were in the freshwater camp, University of Chicago,

00:12:16.523 --> 00:12:17.975
University of Rochester.

00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:20.971
You were a free market capitalist economist

00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:23.104
or you were a Keynesian liberal economist,

00:12:23.104 --> 00:12:25.279
and these people didn't go to each other's weddings,

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:27.171
they snubbed each other at conferences.

00:12:27.171 --> 00:12:30.180
It's still ugly to this day, but in my experience,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.781
it is really, really hard to find an economist under 40

00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:37.805
who still has that kind of way of seeing the world.

00:12:37.805 --> 00:12:40.757
The vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool

00:12:40.757 --> 00:12:43.598
to call yourself an ideologue of either camp.

00:12:43.598 --> 00:12:46.119
The phrase that you want, if you're a graduate student

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:48.646
or a postdoc or you're a professor,

00:12:48.646 --> 00:12:51.623
a 38-year-old economics professor, is, "I'm an empiricist.

00:12:51.623 --> 00:12:53.167
I go by the data."

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:55.571
And the data is very clear.

00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:59.592
None of these major theories have been completely successful.

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:01.240
The 20th century, the last hundred years,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.191
is riddled with disastrous examples

00:13:04.191 --> 00:13:07.863
of times that one school or the other tried to explain

00:13:07.863 --> 00:13:10.183
the past or predict the future

00:13:10.183 --> 00:13:12.069
and just did an awful, awful job,

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:17.258
so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.

00:13:17.258 --> 00:13:20.852
They still are an awfully arrogant group of people, I will assure you,

00:13:20.852 --> 00:13:23.729
but they're now arrogant about their impartiality,

00:13:23.729 --> 00:13:30.520
and they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.620
And this nonpartisanship is something that exists,

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.359
that has existed in secret

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.075
in America for years and years and years.

00:13:39.075 --> 00:13:43.039
I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:46.935
organizations that survey American political attitudes:

00:13:46.935 --> 00:13:48.489
Pew Research,

00:13:48.489 --> 00:13:52.137
the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center,

00:13:52.137 --> 00:13:54.985
and the most important but the least known

00:13:54.985 --> 00:13:57.960
is the American National Election Studies group

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.306
that is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes.

00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:04.268
They've been doing it since 1948,

00:14:04.268 --> 00:14:07.755
and what they show consistently throughout

00:14:07.755 --> 00:14:12.202
is that it's almost impossible to find Americans

00:14:12.202 --> 00:14:15.363
who are consistent ideologically,

00:14:15.363 --> 00:14:19.099
who consistently support, "No we mustn't tax,

00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:21.779
and we must limit the size of government,"

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:25.479
or, "No, we must encourage government to play a larger role

00:14:25.479 --> 00:14:29.475
in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism."

00:14:29.475 --> 00:14:31.353
Those groups are very, very small.

00:14:31.353 --> 00:14:34.349
The vast majority of people, they pick and choose,

00:14:34.349 --> 00:14:36.913
they see compromise and they change over time

00:14:36.913 --> 00:14:39.446
when they hear a better argument or a worse argument.

00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:42.807
And that part of it has not changed.

00:14:42.807 --> 00:14:46.760
What has changed is how people respond to vague questions.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.358
If you ask people vague questions, like,

00:14:49.358 --> 00:14:52.350
"Do you think there should be more government or less government?"

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.664
"Do you think government should" — especially if you use loaded language --

00:14:56.664 --> 00:14:59.143
"Do you think the government should provide handouts?"

00:14:59.143 --> 00:15:01.072
Or, "Do you think the government should redistribute?"

00:15:01.072 --> 00:15:03.673
Then you can see radical partisan change.

00:15:03.673 --> 00:15:06.367
But when you get specific, when you actually ask

00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:10.407
about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration,

00:15:10.407 --> 00:15:13.015
people are remarkably centrist,

00:15:13.015 --> 00:15:15.880
they're remarkably open to compromise.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.665
So what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff,

00:15:19.665 --> 00:15:24.191
don't think of it as the American people fundamentally

00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:26.367
can't stand each other on these issues

00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:27.922
and that we must be ripped apart

00:15:27.922 --> 00:15:30.244
into two separate warring nations.

00:15:30.244 --> 00:15:36.170
Think of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient economists

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.016
and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process.

00:15:40.016 --> 00:15:42.592
And they've captured the process through familiar ways,

00:15:42.592 --> 00:15:45.544
through a primary system which encourages

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.776
that small group of people's voices,

00:15:47.776 --> 00:15:49.881
because that small group of people,

00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:52.953
the people who answer all yeses or all noes

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.360
on those ideological questions,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.967
they might be small but every one of them has a blog,

00:15:57.967 --> 00:16:01.721
every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week.

00:16:01.721 --> 00:16:04.874
Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice,

00:16:04.874 --> 00:16:07.006
but they don't represent us.

00:16:07.006 --> 00:16:10.107
They don't represent what our views are.

00:16:10.107 --> 00:16:11.913
And that gets me back to the dollar,

00:16:11.913 --> 00:16:15.138
and it gets me back to reminding myself that

00:16:15.138 --> 00:16:17.148
we know this experience.

00:16:17.148 --> 00:16:18.793
We know what it's like

00:16:18.793 --> 00:16:24.148
to have these people on TV, in Congress,

00:16:24.148 --> 00:16:26.875
yelling about how the end of the world is coming

00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:30.101
if we don't adopt their view completely,

00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:32.095
because it's happened about the dollar

00:16:32.095 --> 00:16:34.098
ever since there's been a dollar.

00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:37.992
We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton.

00:16:37.992 --> 00:16:42.662
In 1913, we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve,

00:16:42.662 --> 00:16:46.536
when it was created, with vicious, angry arguments

00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:48.408
over how it would be constituted,

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:50.185
and a general agreement that the way it was constituted

00:16:50.185 --> 00:16:53.092
was the worst possible compromise,

00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:56.452
a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing,

00:16:56.452 --> 00:16:58.809
this dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay,

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:01.320
so long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.370
The Fed can't mess it up so badly.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.507
But then we got off the gold standard for individuals

00:17:07.507 --> 00:17:09.921
during the Depression and we got off the gold standard

00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:14.019
as a source of international currency coordination

00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:16.251
during Richard Nixon's presidency.

00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:20.224
Each of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.

00:17:20.224 --> 00:17:22.378
And nothing happened at all.

00:17:22.378 --> 00:17:24.316
Throughout it all, the dollar has been

00:17:24.316 --> 00:17:26.624
one of the most long-standing,

00:17:26.624 --> 00:17:28.759
stable, reasonable currencies,

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:30.926
and we all use it every single day,

00:17:30.926 --> 00:17:33.951
no matter what the people screaming about tell us,

00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:36.995
no matter how scared we're supposed to be.

00:17:36.995 --> 00:17:40.940
And this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now,

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.869
I think what is most maddening about it is,

00:17:44.869 --> 00:17:48.808
if Congress were simply able

00:17:48.808 --> 00:17:51.181
to show not that they agree with each other,

00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:54.461
not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise,

00:17:54.461 --> 00:17:57.543
but that they are able to just begin the process

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:02.024
towards compromise, we all instantly are better off.

00:18:02.024 --> 00:18:06.158
The fear is that the world is watching.

00:18:06.158 --> 00:18:09.615
The fear is that the longer we delay any solution,

00:18:09.615 --> 00:18:11.403
the more the world will look to the U.S.

00:18:11.403 --> 00:18:15.023
not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy,

00:18:15.023 --> 00:18:18.598
but as a place that can't resolve its own fights,

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:22.424
and the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous,

00:18:22.424 --> 00:18:24.207
the higher interest rates are going to be,

00:18:24.207 --> 00:18:26.911
the quicker we're going to have to face a day

00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:29.018
of horrible calamity.

00:18:29.018 --> 00:18:32.582
And so just the act of compromise itself,

00:18:32.582 --> 00:18:34.483
and sustained, real compromise,

00:18:34.483 --> 00:18:36.297
would give us even more time,

00:18:36.297 --> 00:18:39.259
would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain

00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:41.894
and reach even more compromise down the road.

00:18:41.894 --> 00:18:45.006
So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen

00:18:45.006 --> 00:18:49.299
is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise,

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:53.411
to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms

00:18:53.411 --> 00:18:54.972
that do polarize us,

00:18:54.972 --> 00:18:57.581
but to just talk about it like what it is,

00:18:57.581 --> 00:18:59.524
not an existential crisis,

00:18:59.524 --> 00:19:04.497
not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views,

00:19:04.497 --> 00:19:07.099
but a math problem, a really solvable math problem,

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:09.175
one where we're not all going to get what we want

00:19:09.175 --> 00:19:13.130
and one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.645
But the more we address it as a practical concern,

00:19:16.645 --> 00:19:18.156
the sooner we can resolve it,

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:21.623
and the more time we have to resolve it, paradoxically.

00:19:21.623 --> 00:19:26.607
Thank you. (Applause)
