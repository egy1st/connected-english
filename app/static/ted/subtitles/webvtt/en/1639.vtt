00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.881
The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:13.641
Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic.

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:19.122
With complete control of everything the audience can see,

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:23.479
moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:27.773
to further their deceptions.

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:32.588
Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life,

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:36.431
produced by the sequential projection of still frames,

00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:41.299
and they astonished the Lumière brothers' early audiences.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.995
Even today's sophisticated moviegoers

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:46.915
still lose themselves to the screen,

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:50.595
and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality

00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:53.142
to great effect.

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:57.452
Now imaginative people have been having fun with this

00:00:57.452 --> 00:00:59.521
for over 400 years.

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:03.322
Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:08.924
in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:12.571
and saw how it could be manipulated.

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:15.987
Playing with the world, and our perception of it,

00:01:15.987 --> 00:01:19.277
really is the essence of visual effects.

00:01:19.277 --> 00:01:21.459
So digging deeper into this

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.811
with the Science and Technology Council

00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:26.971
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:31.459
reveals some truth behind the trickery.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.803
Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions:

00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:40.483
assumption, things are as we know them;

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:44.556
presumption, things will behave as we expect;

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:47.053
and context in reality,

00:01:47.053 --> 00:01:49.645
our knowledge of the world as we know it,

00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:51.247
such as scale.

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:55.324
Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession,

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:59.429
which is, never betray the illusion.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.532
And that last point has made visual effects

00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:05.884
a constant quest for perfection.

00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:10.611
So from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:15.691
to last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps

00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:20.898
and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects.

00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:24.386
I hope you will enjoy.

Isabelle: "The filmmaker Georges Méliès

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.725
