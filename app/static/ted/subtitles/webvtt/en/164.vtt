00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is a picture of Maurice Druon,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the French Academy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
befitting the role of the French Academy

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as legislating the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
correct usage in French

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and perpetuating the language.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The French Academy has two main tasks:

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it compiles a dictionary of official French.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They're now working on their ninth edition,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They also legislate on correct usage,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
such as the proper term for what the French call "email,"

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which ought to be "courriel."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The World Wide Web, the French are told,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
ought to be referred to as

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
"la toile d'araignee mondiale" -- the Global Spider Web --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
recommendations that the French gaily ignore.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, this is one model of how language comes to be:

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
namely, it's legislated by an academy.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But anyone who looks at language realizes

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that this is a rather silly conceit,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
it will already be well out of date.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We see it in the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
constant appearance of slang and jargon,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of the historical change in languages,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in divergence of dialects

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and the formation of new languages.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so much as a window onto human nature.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In a book that I'm currently working on,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I hope to use language to shed light on

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
a number of aspects of human nature,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
including the cognitive machinery

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
with which humans conceptualize the world

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and the relationship types that govern human interaction.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Let me start off with a technical problem in language

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that I've worried about for quite some time --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and indulge me

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in my passion for verbs and how they're used.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Let me give you a quick reminder

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
of something that you've long forgotten.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
An intransitive verb, such as "dine," for example,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
can't take a direct object.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You have to say, "Sam dined," not, "Sam dined the pizza."

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
A transitive verb mandates

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that there has to be an object there:

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
"Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured."

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
each of which shapes its sentence.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So, a problem in explaining how children learn language,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and a problem in programming computers to use language is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
which verbs go in which constructions.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
For example, the dative construction in English.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You can say, "Give a muffin to a mouse," the prepositional dative.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Or, "Give a mouse a muffin," the double-object dative.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So a tempting generalization for a child,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for an adult, for a computer

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is that any verb that can appear in the construction,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
"subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient"

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
can also be expressed as "subject-verb-recipient-thing."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
A handy thing to have,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
because language is infinite,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You've got to extract generalizations

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
so you can produce and understand new sentences.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
This would be an example of how to do that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Unfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
You can say, "Biff drove the car to Chicago,"

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but not, "Biff drove Chicago the car."

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You can say, "Sal gave Jason a headache,"

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
but it's a bit odd to say, "Sal gave a headache to Jason."

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
are not synonymous,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that when you crank up the microscope

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in meaning between them.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So, "give the X to the Y,"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that construction corresponds to the thought

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
"cause X to go to Y." Whereas "give the Y the X"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
corresponds to the thought "cause Y to have X."

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Now, many events can be subject to either construal,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
in which you can either pay attention

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
to the particular object,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in which case the space around it recedes from attention,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
or you can see the faces in the empty space,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
in which case the object recedes out of consciousness.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
How are these construals reflected in language?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
is expressed as the direct object,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the noun after the verb.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
where you're doing something to the muffin --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
When you construe it as "cause the mouse to have something,"

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
you're doing something to the mouse,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and therefore you express it as, "Give the mouse the muffin."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So which verbs go in which construction --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the problem with which I began --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
or a kind of possession change.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
To give something involves both causing something to go

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and causing someone to have.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
To drive the car only causes something to go,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Only humans can possess things.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and causing it to go to the other person,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and implanting it in them.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
You may just be loud or obnoxious,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
or some other way causing them to have the headache.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So, that's

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So why should anyone care?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
from this and many similar kinds of analyses

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
of hundreds of English verbs.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
First, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
which we automatically and unconsciously compute

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
every time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You can think of this as the language of thought, or "mentalese."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
not only in English, but in all other languages --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
fundamental concepts such as space,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
time, causation and human intention,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
such as, what is the means and what is the ends?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that Immanuel Kant argued

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
are the basic framework for human thought,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
seems to reflect these Kantian categories.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Doesn't care about perceptual qualities,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
such as color, texture, weight and speed,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
which virtually never differentiate

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the use of verbs in different constructions.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
are used not only literally,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
but in a quasi-metaphorical way.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
For example, this construction, the dative,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
is used not only to transfer things,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
as when we say, "She told a story to me"

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
or "told me a story,"

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
"Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish."

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's exactly the same construction,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
but no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It evokes the container metaphor of communication,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
in which we conceive of ideas as objects,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
sentences as containers,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and communication as a kind of sending.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
As when we say we "gather" our ideas, to "put" them "into" words,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and if our words aren't "empty" or "hollow,"

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
we might get these ideas "across" to a listener,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
who can "unpack" our words to "extract" their "content."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It's very hard to find any example of abstract language

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that is not based on some concrete metaphor.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
For example, you can use the verb "go"

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and the prepositions "to" and "from"

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
in a literal, spatial sense.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You can also say, "Biff went from sick to well."

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but it's as if his health is a point in state space

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that you conceptualize as moving.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Or, "The meeting went from three to four,"

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Likewise, we use "force" to indicate

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
not only physical force,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
as in, "Rose forced the door to open,"

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
but also interpersonal force,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
as in, "Rose forced Sadie to go," not necessarily by manhandling her,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
but by issuing a threat.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Or, "Rose forced herself to go,"

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
as if there were two entities inside Rose's head,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
engaged in a tug of a war.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of a given event in two different ways,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
such as "cause something to go to someone"

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and "causing someone to have something,"

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I think is a fundamental feature of human thought,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and it's the basis for much human argumentation,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in which people don't differ so much on the facts

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
as on how they ought to be construed.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Just to give you a few examples:

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
"ending a pregnancy" versus "killing a fetus;"

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
"a ball of cells" versus "an unborn child;"

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
"invading Iraq" versus "liberating Iraq;"

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"redistributing wealth" versus "confiscating earnings."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And I think the biggest picture of all

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
would take seriously the fact

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
that so much of our verbiage about abstract events

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
is based on a concrete metaphor

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and see human intelligence itself

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
as consisting of a repertoire of concepts --

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
such as objects, space, time, causation and intention --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
whose evolution you can well imagine,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and a process of metaphorical abstraction

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that allows us to bleach these concepts

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
of their original conceptual content --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
space, time and force --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and apply them to new abstract domains,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
therefore allowing a species that evolved

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
to deal with rocks and tools and animals,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and other abstract domains.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Well, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that govern human social interaction,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
again, as reflected in language.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie "Fargo."

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And you might remember the scene in which

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
is asked to show his driver's license

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and holds his wallet out

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
with a 50-dollar bill extending

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
at a slight angle out of the wallet.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And he says, "I was just thinking

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,"

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
which everyone, including the audience,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
interprets as a veiled bribe.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
For example, in polite requests,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
if someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that would be awesome,"

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
we know exactly what he means,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
even though that's a rather bizarre

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
concept being expressed.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
(Laughter)

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I think most people

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
understand the intent behind that.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And likewise, if someone says,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
"Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it" --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
(Laughter) --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
we understand that as a veiled threat,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So the puzzle is, why are bribes,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
No one's fooled.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Both parties know exactly what the speaker means,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and the speaker knows the listener knows

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So what's going on?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I think the key idea is that language

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
is a way of negotiating relationships,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and human relationships fall into a number of types.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
in which relationships can be categorized, more or less,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
into communality, which works on the principle

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
"what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,"

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
dominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;"

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
reciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;"

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Now, relationship types can be negotiated.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Even though there are default situations

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
in which one of these mindsets can be applied,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
they can be stretched and extended.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
For example, communality applies most naturally

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
within family or friends,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
but it can be used to try to transfer

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
the mentality of sharing

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
sororities, locutions like "the family of man,"

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
you try to get people who are not related

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
to use the relationship type that would ordinarily

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
be appropriate to close kin.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
If you went over and you helped yourself

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
to a shrimp off your boss' plate,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
for example, that would be an awkward situation.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Or if a dinner guest after the meal

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that would be rather awkward as well.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
In less blatant cases,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
In the workplace, for example,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
there's often a tension over whether an employee

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
can socialize with the boss,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
or refer to him or her

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
on a first-name basis.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
If two friends have a

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
reciprocal transaction, like selling a car,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
it's well known that this can be a source

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
of tension or awkwardness.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
In dating, the transition

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
from friendship to sex

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
can lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and as can sex in the workplace,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
in which we call the conflict between a

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
dominant and a sexual relationship "sexual harassment."

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Well, what does this have to do with language?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Well, language, as a social interaction,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
has to satisfy two conditions.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
You have to convey the actual content --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
here we get back to the container metaphor.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
the solicitation and so on,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but you also have to negotiate

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and maintain the kind of relationship

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
you have with the other person.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the literal form signals

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
the safest relationship with the listener,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
whereas the implicated content --

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform --

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
allows the listener to derive the interpretation

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
which is most relevant in context,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
which possibly initiates a changed relationship.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
The simplest example of this is in the polite request.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
If you express your request as a conditional --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
"if you could open the window, that would be great" --

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
even though the content is an imperative,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
the fact that you're not using the imperative voice

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
By expressing it as an if-then statement,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
you can get the message across

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
without appearing to boss another person around.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And in a more subtle way, I think, this works

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
for all of the veiled speech acts

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
involving plausible deniability:

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
the bribes, threats, propositions,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
solicitations and so on.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
if language -- where it could only be used literally.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And you can think of it in terms of a

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
game-theoretic payoff matrix.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Put yourself in the position of the

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
There's a high stakes

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
in the two possibilities

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
If you don't bribe the officer,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
then you will get a traffic ticket --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
or, as is the case of "Fargo," worse --

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
whether the honest officer

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
is honest or dishonest.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
In that case, the consequences are rather severe.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
On the other hand, if you extend the bribe,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
if the officer is dishonest,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
you get a huge payoff of going free.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
If the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
of being arrested for bribery.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So this is a rather fraught situation.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
On the other hand, with indirect language,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
if you issue a veiled bribe,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
then the dishonest officer

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
could interpret it as a bribe,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
in which case you get the payoff of going free.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So you get the best of both worlds.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And a similar analysis, I think,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
can apply to the potential awkwardness

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
of a sexual solicitation,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I think this affirms

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
something that's long been known by diplomats --

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
namely, that the vagueness of language,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
far from being a bug or an imperfection,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
actually might be a feature of language,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
one that we use to our advantage in social interactions.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So to sum up: language is a collective human creation,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
reflecting human nature,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
how we conceptualize reality,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
how we relate to one another.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
(Applause)
