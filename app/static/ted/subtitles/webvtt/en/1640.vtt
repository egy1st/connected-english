WEBVTT

00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:03.049
We live in an incredibly busy world.

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:06.570
The pace of life is often frantic,
our minds are always busy,

00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:08.341
and we're always doing something.

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:11.487
So with that in mind,
I'd like you just to take a moment

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:16.101
to think, when did you last take
any time to do nothing?

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:19.046
Just 10 minutes, undisturbed?

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.601
And when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.221
So that's no emailing,
texting, no Internet,

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:27.021
no TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading.

00:00:28.303 --> 00:00:30.589
Not even sitting there
reminiscing about the past

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:31.977
or planning for the future.

00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:35.374
Simply doing nothing.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.999
I see a lot of very blank faces.

00:00:38.023 --> 00:00:39.024
(Laughter)

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:40.967
You probably have to go a long way back.

00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:42.999
And this is an extraordinary thing, right?

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:44.445
We're talking about our mind.

00:00:45.143 --> 00:00:48.407
The mind, our most valuable
and precious resource,

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:51.470
through which we experience
every single moment of our life.

00:00:52.447 --> 00:00:54.599
The mind that we rely upon

00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:59.097
to be happy, content,
emotionally stable as individuals,

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.501
and at the same time,
to be kind and thoughtful

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:04.675
and considerate
in our relationships with others.

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:07.337
This is the same mind that we depend upon

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:10.833
to be focused, creative, spontaneous,

00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:14.531
and to perform at our very best
in everything that we do.

00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:18.512
And yet, we don't take
any time out to look after it.

00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:22.026
In fact, we spend more time
looking after our cars,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.033
our clothes and our hair than we --

00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:25.304
okay, maybe not our hair,

00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:26.329
(Laughter)

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:27.803
but you see where I'm going.

00:01:28.127 --> 00:01:30.480
The result, of course,
is that we get stressed.

00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:33.539
You know, the mind whizzes away
like a washing machine

00:01:33.563 --> 00:01:36.955
going round and round,
lots of difficult, confusing emotions,

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.011
and we don't really know
how to deal with that.

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:45.780
And the sad fact
is that we are so distracted

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:49.600
that we're no longer present
in the world in which we live.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.667
We miss out on the things
that are most important to us,

00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:56.098
and the crazy thing
is that everybody just assumes,

00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:59.461
that's the way life is, so we've just
kind of got to get on with it.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:01.264
That's really not how it has to be.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.684
So I was about 11 when I went along
to my first meditation class.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.359
And trust me, it had all the stereotypes
that you can imagine,

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:11.754
the sitting cross-legged on the floor,

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:15.153
the incense, the herbal tea,
the vegetarians, the whole deal,

00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:18.946
but my mom was going and I was intrigued,
so I went along with her.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.951
I'd also seen a few kung fu movies,

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:24.321
and secretly I kind of thought
I might be able to learn how to fly,

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:26.443
but I was very young at the time.

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.146
Now as I was there, I guess,
like a lot of people,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.810
I assumed that it was just
an aspirin for the mind.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.787
You get stressed, you do some meditation.

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:39.632
I hadn't really thought that it could be
sort of preventative in nature,

00:02:39.656 --> 00:02:43.291
until I was about 20, when a number
of things happened in my life

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:45.725
in quite quick succession,

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.192
really serious things
which just flipped my life upside down

00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:52.114
and all of a sudden
I was inundated with thoughts,

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:55.695
inundated with difficult emotions
that I didn't know how to cope with.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.735
Every time I sort of pushed one down,

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.560
another one would pop back up again.

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:01.395
It was a really very stressful time.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.095
I guess we all deal with stress
in different ways.

00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:10.188
Some people will bury themselves in work,
grateful for the distraction.

00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:14.034
Others will turn to their friends,
their family, looking for support.

00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:17.274
Some people hit the bottle,
start taking medication.

00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:20.484
My own way of dealing with it
was to become a monk.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.633
So I quit my degree,
I headed off to the Himalayas,

00:03:24.657 --> 00:03:27.396
I became a monk, and I started
studying meditation.

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:32.210
People often ask me
what I learned from that time.

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:34.446
Well, obviously it changed things.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.460
Let's face it, becoming a celibate monk
is going to change a number of things.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.732
But it was more than that.

00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:44.379
It taught me -- it gave me
a greater appreciation,

00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:47.625
an understanding for the present moment.

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:51.998
By that I mean not being lost in thought,

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:53.834
not being distracted,

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:57.649
not being overwhelmed
by difficult emotions,

00:03:57.673 --> 00:04:01.202
but instead learning how to be
in the here and now,

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:03.577
how to be mindful, how to be present.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.159
I think the present moment
is so underrated.

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.388
It sounds so ordinary,

00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:13.107
and yet we spend so little time
in the present moment

00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:15.472
that it's anything but ordinary.

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:19.281
There was a research paper that came
out of Harvard, just recently,

00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:22.071
that said on average, our minds
are lost in thought

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.458
almost 47 percent of the time.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.381
47 percent.

00:04:27.127 --> 00:04:29.976
At the same time, this sort
of constant mind-wandering

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.635
is also a direct cause of unhappiness.

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.703
Now we're not here for that long anyway,

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:41.929
but to spend almost half
of our life lost in thought

00:04:41.953 --> 00:04:43.935
and potentially quite unhappy,

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:46.632
I don't know, it just kind
of seems tragic, actually,

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:49.589
especially when there's something
we can do about it,

00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:53.237
when there's a positive,
practical, achievable,

00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:56.221
scientifically proven technique

00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:58.447
which allows our mind to be more healthy,

00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:02.075
to be more mindful and less distracted.

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.014
And the beauty of it is that even though

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:07.413
it need only take about 10 minutes a day,

00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:10.157
it impacts our entire life.

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:12.891
But we need to know how to do it.

00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:14.151
We need an exercise.

00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:17.293
We need a framework
to learn how to be more mindful.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.216
That's essentially what meditation is.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.731
It's familiarizing ourselves
with the present moment.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.786
But we also need to know
how to approach it in the right way

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.183
to get the best from it.

00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:29.637
And that's what these are for,
in case you've been wondering,

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.898
because most people assume

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:34.653
that meditation
is all about stopping thoughts,

00:05:34.677 --> 00:05:37.714
getting rid of emotions,
somehow controlling the mind,

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:39.912
but actually it's quite
different from that.

00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:42.699
It's more about stepping back,

00:05:42.723 --> 00:05:45.059
sort of seeing the thought clearly,

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.798
witnessing it coming and going,
emotions coming and going

00:05:47.822 --> 00:05:52.799
without judgment,
but with a relaxed, focused mind.

00:05:53.462 --> 00:05:55.573
So for example, right now,

00:05:55.597 --> 00:05:58.034
if I focus too much on the balls,

00:05:58.058 --> 00:06:01.185
then there's no way I can relax
and talk to you at the same time.

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:03.313
Equally, if I relax too much
talking to you,

00:06:03.337 --> 00:06:05.243
there's no way I can focus on the balls.

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:06.449
I'm going to drop them.

00:06:06.473 --> 00:06:09.091
Now in life, and in meditation,

00:06:09.115 --> 00:06:12.511
there'll be times when the focus
becomes a little bit too intense,

00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:16.518
and life starts to feel a bit like this.

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.679
It's a very uncomfortable
way to live life,

00:06:18.703 --> 00:06:20.502
when you get this tight and stressed.

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.300
At other times, we might take our foot off
the gas a little bit too much,

00:06:24.324 --> 00:06:26.896
and things just become a sort
of little bit like this.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.585
Of course in meditation --

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:29.610
(Snores)

00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:31.419
we're going to end up falling asleep.

00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:34.145
So we're looking for a balance,
a focused relaxation

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.181
where we can allow thoughts to come and go

00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:39.348
without all the usual involvement.

00:06:39.938 --> 00:06:43.212
Now, what usually happens
when we're learning to be mindful

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.156
is that we get distracted by a thought.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.952
Let's say this is an anxious thought.

00:06:47.976 --> 00:06:50.602
Everything's going fine,
and we see the anxious thought.

00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:53.149
"Oh, I didn't realize
I was worried about that."

00:06:53.173 --> 00:06:54.625
You go back to it, repeat it.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:55.812
"Oh, I am worried.

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:58.271
I really am worried.
Wow, there's so much anxiety."

00:06:58.295 --> 00:07:00.055
And before we know it, right,

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:03.017
we're anxious about feeling anxious.

00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:04.049
(Laughter)

00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:05.390
You know, this is crazy.

00:07:05.414 --> 00:07:08.553
We do this all the time,
even on an everyday level.

00:07:08.577 --> 00:07:12.705
If you think about the last time
you had a wobbly tooth.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.815
You know it's wobbly,
and you know that it hurts.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.067
But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?

00:07:20.737 --> 00:07:22.618
(Mumbling)

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:23.811
It does hurt.

00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:26.380
And we reinforce the storyline, right?

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.361
And we just keep telling ourselves,
and we do it all the time.

00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:32.073
And it's only in learning
to watch the mind in this way

00:07:32.097 --> 00:07:35.876
that we can start to let go
of those storylines and patterns of mind.

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.206
But when you sit down
and you watch the mind in this way,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.085
you might see many different patterns.

00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:43.742
You might find a mind
that's really restless and --

00:07:43.766 --> 00:07:44.941
the whole time.

00:07:45.607 --> 00:07:48.757
Don't be surprised if you feel
a bit agitated in your body

00:07:48.781 --> 00:07:52.067
when you sit down to do nothing
and your mind feels like that.

00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:54.918
You might find a mind that's very dull

00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:57.254
and boring, and it's just,
almost mechanical,

00:07:57.278 --> 00:08:00.457
it just seems it's as if you're
getting up, going to work,

00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:02.280
eat, sleep, get up, work.

00:08:02.962 --> 00:08:05.462
Or it might just be
that one little nagging thought

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:09.837
that just goes round and round your mind.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.982
Well, whatever it is,

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:17.621
meditation offers the opportunity,
the potential to step back

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:20.159
and to get a different perspective,

00:08:20.183 --> 00:08:24.084
to see that things aren't always
as they appear.

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:30.769
We can't change every little thing
that happens to us in life,

00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:34.200
but we can change
the way that we experience it.

00:08:34.224 --> 00:08:37.937
That's the potential
of meditation, of mindfulness.

00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:40.511
You don't have to burn any incense,

00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:42.916
and you definitely don't have
to sit on the floor.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.829
All you need to do
is to take 10 minutes out a day

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:50.366
to step back, to familiarize yourself
with the present moment

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.052
so that you get to experience
a greater sense

00:08:53.076 --> 00:08:57.023
of focus, calm and clarity in your life.

00:08:57.487 --> 00:08:58.685
Thank you very much.

00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:02.709
(Applause)
