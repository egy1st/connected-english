00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:03.394
So I'd like to start by focusing on

00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:05.930
the world's most dangerous animal.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.090
Now, when you talk about dangerous animals,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.137
most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks.

00:00:11.137 --> 00:00:12.814
But of course the most dangerous animal

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:14.677
is the mosquito.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:16.836
The mosquito has killed more humans

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:19.825
than any other creature in human history.

00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:21.815
In fact, probably adding them all together,

00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:24.001
the mosquito has killed more humans.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.660
And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.359
and plague.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.932
And you would think, would you not,

00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:34.879
that with all our science, with all our advances in society,

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.775
with better towns, better civilizations, better sanitation,

00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:42.991
wealth, that we would get better at controlling mosquitos,

00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:45.684
and hence reduce this disease.

00:00:45.684 --> 00:00:49.026
And that's not really the case.

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:51.146
If it was the case, we wouldn't have

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:55.733
between 200 and 300 million cases of malaria every year,

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.458
and we wouldn't have

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:01.400
a million and a half deaths from malaria,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.100
and we wouldn't have a disease

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.636
that was relatively unknown 50 years ago

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:09.468
now suddenly turned into

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.700
the largest mosquito-borne virus threat that we have,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.393
and that's called dengue fever.

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:18.124
So 50 years ago, pretty much no one had heard of it,

00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:21.116
no one certainly in the European environment.

00:01:21.116 --> 00:01:24.749
But dengue fever now, according to the World Health Organization,

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.236
infects between 50 and 100 million people every year,

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:30.572
so that's equivalent to the whole of the population

00:01:30.572 --> 00:01:33.500
of the U.K. being infected every year.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.612
Other estimates put that number at roughly double

00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:40.570
that number of infections.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.005
And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.055
In the last 50 years, the incidence of dengue

00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:50.273
has grown thirtyfold.

00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:52.776
Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is,

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:54.364
for those who don't know.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.573
Now let's assume you go on holiday.

00:01:56.573 --> 00:01:58.335
Let's assume you go to the Caribbean,

00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:00.728
or you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America,

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:04.687
Asia, Africa, anywhere in Saudi Arabia.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:06.410
You might go to India, the Far East.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.023
It doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito,

00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:11.935
and it's the same disease. You're at risk.

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:14.611
And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:16.172
that's carrying that virus.

00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:19.167
Well, you could develop flu-like symptoms.

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:20.945
They could be quite mild.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:23.046
You could develop nausea, headache,

00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:25.485
your muscles could feel like they're contracting,

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:29.571
and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking.

00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.795
And that's the nickname given to this disease.

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:33.388
It's called breakbone fever,

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:35.732
because that's how you can feel.

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:38.669
Now the odd thing is, is that once you've been bitten

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.931
by this mosquito, and you've had this disease,

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:43.553
your body develops antibodies,

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:47.967
so if you're bitten again with that strain,

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.683
it doesn't affect you.

00:02:49.683 --> 00:02:52.603
But it's not one virus, it's four,

00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:55.579
and the same protection that gives you the antibodies

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.891
and protects you from the same virus that you had before

00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:01.957
actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three.

00:03:01.957 --> 00:03:04.692
So the next time you get dengue fever,

00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:07.332
if it's a different strain, you're more susceptible,

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.963
you're likely to get worse symptoms,

00:03:09.963 --> 00:03:12.564
and you're more likely to get the more severe forms,

00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:15.826
hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome.

00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:17.245
So you don't want dengue once,

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:19.986
and you certainly don't want it again.

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:23.269
So why is it spreading so fast?

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.365
And the answer is this thing.

00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:27.139
This is Aedes aegypti.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.349
Now this is a mosquito that came, like its name suggests,

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.791
out of North Africa, and it's spread round the world.

00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.919
Now, in fact, a single mosquito will only travel

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.648
about 200 yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far.

00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:43.033
What they're very good at doing is hitchhiking,

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:44.443
particularly the eggs.

00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:49.140
They will lay their eggs in clear water, any pool, any puddle,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.090
any birdbath, any flower pot,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.830
anywhere there's clear water, they'll lay their eggs,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.452
and if that clear water is near freight, it's near a port,

00:03:57.452 --> 00:04:00.101
if it's anywhere near transport,

00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.285
those eggs will then get transported around the world.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:05.708
And that's what's happened. Mankind has transported

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:07.714
these eggs all the way around the world,

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:11.412
and these insects have infested over 100 countries,

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:14.110
and there's now 2.5 billion people living in countries

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.102
where this mosquito resides.

00:04:17.102 --> 00:04:18.686
To give you just a couple of examples

00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:21.202
how fast this has happened,

00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:26.718
in the mid-'70s, Brazil declared, "We have no Aedes aegypti,"

00:04:26.718 --> 00:04:29.068
and currently they spend about a billion dollars now

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.868
a year trying to get rid of it, trying to control it,

00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:36.969
just one species of mosquito.

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.512
Two days ago, or yesterday, I can't remember which,

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:42.476
I saw a Reuters report that said

00:04:42.476 --> 00:04:45.110
Madeira had had their first cases of dengue,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.930
about 52 cases, with about 400 probable cases.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.744
That's two days ago.

00:04:50.744 --> 00:04:55.925
Interestingly, Madeira first got the insect in 2005,

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:57.982
and here we are, a few years later,

00:04:57.982 --> 00:04:59.309
first cases of dengue.

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:02.668
So the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes,

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:04.982
dengue will follow.

00:05:04.982 --> 00:05:07.173
Once you've got the mosquito in your area,

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.542
anyone coming into that area with dengue,

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:12.485
mosquito will bite them, mosquito will bite somewhere else,

00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:13.449
somewhere else, somewhere else,

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.564
and you'll get an epidemic.

00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:19.472
So we must be good at killing mosquitos.

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:21.369
I mean, that can't be very difficult.

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:24.189
Well, there's two principle ways.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.561
The first way is that you use larvicides.

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:30.373
You use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed.

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:33.173
Now in an urban environment, that's extraordinarily difficult.

00:05:33.173 --> 00:05:35.358
You've got to get your chemical into every puddle,

00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:37.606
every birdbath, every tree trunk.

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:40.648
It's just not practical.

00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:42.164
The second way you can do it

00:05:42.164 --> 00:05:45.478
is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around.

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:47.704
This is a picture of fogging.

00:05:47.704 --> 00:05:50.149
Here what someone is doing

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:53.063
is mixing up chemical in a smoke

00:05:53.063 --> 00:05:56.077
and basically spreading that through the environment.

00:05:56.077 --> 00:05:59.037
You could do the same with a space spray.

00:05:59.037 --> 00:06:00.605
This is really unpleasant stuff,

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:03.007
and if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase

00:06:03.007 --> 00:06:07.663
in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever.

00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:09.752
So it's not very effective, but it's probably

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:12.647
the best thing we've got at the moment.

00:06:12.647 --> 00:06:14.799
Having said that, actually, your best form of protection

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:17.184
and my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt

00:06:17.184 --> 00:06:20.608
and a little bit of DEET to go with it.

00:06:20.608 --> 00:06:24.297
So let's start again. Let's design a product,

00:06:24.297 --> 00:06:27.573
right from the word go, and decide what we want.

00:06:27.573 --> 00:06:30.168
Well we clearly need something that is effective

00:06:30.168 --> 00:06:32.476
at reducing the mosquito population.

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:34.908
There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there.

00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:38.000
We want something that gets that population right the way down

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.016
so it can't get the disease transmission.

00:06:41.016 --> 00:06:44.320
Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.496
We are going to use it in and around humans.

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:48.059
It has to be safe.

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.289
We don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment.

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.523
We don't want to do anything that you can't undo.

00:06:53.523 --> 00:06:58.616
Maybe a better product comes along in 20, 30 years.

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:01.490
Fine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.762
We want something that's relatively cheap, or cost-effective,

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:06.715
because there's an awful lot of countries involved,

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:08.721
and some of them are emerging markets,

00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:12.283
some of them emerging countries, low-income.

00:07:12.283 --> 00:07:14.658
And finally, you want something that's species-specific.

00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:17.446
You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue,

00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:20.434
but you don't really want to get all the other insects.

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:23.650
Some are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.488
This one's not. It's invaded you.

00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:28.170
But you don't want to get all of the insects.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.829
You just want to get this one.

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:32.688
And most of the time, you'll find this insect

00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:34.123
lives in and around your home,

00:07:34.123 --> 00:07:38.047
so this -- whatever we do has got to get to that insect.

00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:40.430
It's got to get into people's houses, into the bedrooms,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.224
into the kitchens.

00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:45.869
Now there are two features of mosquito biology

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:47.769
that really help us in this project,

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:51.641
and that is, firstly, males don't bite.

00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:54.750
It's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.151
The male can't bite you, won't bite you,

00:07:57.151 --> 00:07:59.454
doesn't have the mouth parts to bite you.

00:07:59.454 --> 00:08:01.113
It's just the female.

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:03.086
And the second is a phenomenon

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:07.302
that males are very, very good at finding females.

00:08:07.302 --> 00:08:09.950
If there's a male mosquito that you release,

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.793
and if there's a female around, that male will find the female.

00:08:14.793 --> 00:08:18.611
So basically, we've used those two factors.

00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:20.279
So here's a typical situation,

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:22.847
male meets female, lots of offspring.

00:08:22.847 --> 00:08:24.576
A single female will lay about

00:08:24.576 --> 00:08:26.371
up to 100 eggs at a time,

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:28.855
up to about 500 in her lifetime.

00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:31.876
Now if that male is carrying a gene

00:08:31.876 --> 00:08:34.494
which causes the death of the offspring,

00:08:34.494 --> 00:08:37.175
then the offspring don't survive,

00:08:37.175 --> 00:08:40.606
and instead of having 500 mosquitos running around,

00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:43.227
you have none.

00:08:43.227 --> 00:08:46.346
And if you can put more, I'll call them sterile,

00:08:46.346 --> 00:08:49.219
that the offspring will actually die at different stages,

00:08:49.219 --> 00:08:50.808
but I'll call them sterile for now.

00:08:50.808 --> 00:08:54.364
If you put more sterile males out into the environment,

00:08:54.364 --> 00:08:57.652
then the females are more likely to find a sterile male

00:08:57.652 --> 00:09:03.491
than a fertile one, and you will bring that population down.

00:09:03.491 --> 00:09:05.886
So the males will go out, they'll look for females,

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:09.710
they'll mate. If they mate successfully, then no offspring.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.713
If they don't find a female, then they'll die anyway.

00:09:12.713 --> 00:09:16.447
They only live a few days.

00:09:16.447 --> 00:09:18.681
And that's exactly where we are.

00:09:18.681 --> 00:09:20.311
So this is technology that was developed

00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:22.863
in Oxford University a few years ago.

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:25.284
The company itself, Oxitec, we've been working

00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:27.833
for the last 10 years, very much on a sort of similar

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.275
development pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company.

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:35.385
So about 10 years of internal evaluation, testing,

00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:38.777
to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready.

00:09:38.777 --> 00:09:41.264
And then we've gone out into the big outdoors,

00:09:41.264 --> 00:09:42.865
always with local community consent,

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:45.050
always with the necessary permits.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.113
So we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands,

00:09:48.113 --> 00:09:49.659
a small one in Malaysia,

00:09:49.659 --> 00:09:53.994
and two more now in Brazil.

00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:55.727
And what's the result?

00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:59.035
Well, the result has been very good.

00:09:59.035 --> 00:10:01.859
In about four months of release,

00:10:01.859 --> 00:10:04.155
we've brought that population of mosquitos

00:10:04.155 --> 00:10:06.698
— in most cases we're dealing with villages here

00:10:06.698 --> 00:10:09.970
of about 2,000, 3,000 people, that sort of size,

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.408
starting small —

00:10:11.408 --> 00:10:13.599
we've taken that mosquito population down

00:10:13.599 --> 00:10:16.823
by about 85 percent in about four months.

00:10:16.823 --> 00:10:18.822
And in fact, the numbers after that get,

00:10:18.822 --> 00:10:22.562
those get very difficult to count, because there just aren't any left.

00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:24.218
So that's been what we've seen in Cayman,

00:10:24.218 --> 00:10:27.480
it's been what we've seen in Brazil

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.466
in those trials.

00:10:29.466 --> 00:10:31.778
And now what we're doing is we're going through a process

00:10:31.778 --> 00:10:34.611
to scale up to a town of about 50,000,

00:10:34.611 --> 00:10:36.984
so we can see this work at big scale.

00:10:36.984 --> 00:10:39.771
And we've got a production unit in Oxford,

00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:43.262
or just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos.

00:10:43.262 --> 00:10:44.466
We can produce them,

00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:46.622
in a space a bit more than this red carpet,

00:10:46.622 --> 00:10:49.146
I can produce about 20 million a week.

00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:51.312
We can transport them around the world.

00:10:51.312 --> 00:10:54.334
It's not very expensive, because it's a coffee cup --

00:10:54.334 --> 00:10:55.623
something the size of a coffee cup

00:10:55.623 --> 00:10:58.950
will hold about three million eggs.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.768
So freight costs aren't our biggest problem. (Laughter)

00:11:02.768 --> 00:11:06.072
So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory.

00:11:06.072 --> 00:11:09.168
And for Brazil, where we've been doing some trials,

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.056
the Brazilian government themselves have now built

00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:13.488
their own mosquito factory, far bigger than ours,

00:11:13.488 --> 00:11:18.963
and we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil.

00:11:18.963 --> 00:11:21.336
There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs.

00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:23.968
We've separated the males from the females.

00:11:23.968 --> 00:11:27.618
The males have been put in little pots

00:11:27.618 --> 00:11:29.702
and the truck is going down the road

00:11:29.702 --> 00:11:32.666
and they are releasing males as they go.

00:11:32.666 --> 00:11:34.316
It's actually a little bit more precise than that.

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:35.797
You want to release them so that

00:11:35.797 --> 00:11:37.878
you get good coverage of your area.

00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:40.669
So you take a Google Map, you divide it up,

00:11:40.669 --> 00:11:42.553
work out how far they can fly,

00:11:42.553 --> 00:11:44.528
and make sure you're releasing such that you get

00:11:44.528 --> 00:11:47.426
coverage of the area, and then you go back,

00:11:47.426 --> 00:11:49.200
and within a very short space of time,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.776
you're bringing that population right the way down.

00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:55.208
We've also done this in agriculture.

00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:59.280
We've got several different species of agriculture coming along,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.188
and I'm hoping that soon

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:03.984
we'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back

00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:07.066
and start looking at malaria.

00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:09.115
So that's where we stand at the moment,

00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:11.644
and I've just got a few final thoughts,

00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:15.088
which is that this is another way in which biology

00:12:15.088 --> 00:12:19.077
is now coming in to supplement chemistry

00:12:19.077 --> 00:12:22.820
in some of our societal advances in this area,

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.108
and these biological approaches are coming in

00:12:25.108 --> 00:12:27.509
in very different forms,

00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:29.831
and when you think about genetic engineering,

00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:32.837
we've now got enzymes for industrial processing,

00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:35.771
enzymes, genetically engineered enzymes in food.

00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:38.573
We have G.M. crops, we have pharmaceuticals,

00:12:38.573 --> 00:12:39.889
we have new vaccines,

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:43.973
all using roughly the same technology, but with very different outcomes.

00:12:43.973 --> 00:12:47.486
And I'm in favor, actually. Of course I am.

00:12:47.486 --> 00:12:50.382
I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies

00:12:50.382 --> 00:12:53.454
don't work well or have become unacceptable.

00:12:53.454 --> 00:12:56.811
And although the techniques are similar,

00:12:56.811 --> 00:12:58.352
the outcomes are very, very different,

00:12:58.352 --> 00:12:59.866
and if you take our approach, for example,

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:02.291
and you compare it to, say, G.M. crops,

00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:06.583
both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit.

00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:08.726
Both have a side benefit,

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:12.435
which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.

00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:16.396
But whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant,

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:19.140
for example, and give it an advantage,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.235
what we're actually doing is taking the mosquito

00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:26.324
and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have,

00:13:26.324 --> 00:13:29.308
rendering it unable to reproduce effectively.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.908
So for the mosquito, it's a dead end.

00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:36.715
Thank you very much. (Applause)
