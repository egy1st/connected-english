00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.457
So if you've been following the news,

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:04.946
you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids

00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:06.019
headed for the United States,

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.486
all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:12.539
Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.046
That actually wouldn't be such a problem,

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.150
because if we were really all going to die,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.188
we would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took,

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:21.318
and we'd find a way to deflect them.

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.156
but they're wrapped in a special energy field

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:30.506
that polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:32.410
Last March, I went to the TED conference,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.246
and I saw Jim Hansen speak, the NASA scientist

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:38.156
who first raised the alarm about global warming in the 1980s,

00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:40.621
and it seems that the predictions he made back then

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:42.462
are coming true.

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:45.949
This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises,

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.558
and if we keep on going the way we're going,

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:51.026
we get a four- or five-degree-Centigrade temperature rise

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:52.374
by the end of this century.

00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:56.162
Hansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels.

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:59.404
This is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like.

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:02.412
Low-lying cities all around the world will disappear

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:06.210
within the lifetime of children born today.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.506
Hansen closed his talk by saying,

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:12.643
"Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth.

00:01:12.643 --> 00:01:14.996
That is the equivalent of what we face now.

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:18.770
Yet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.479
even though the longer we wait,

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.556
the more difficult and expensive it becomes."

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:25.363
Of course, the left wants to take action,

00:01:25.363 --> 00:01:28.699
but the right denies that there's any problem.

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:30.277
All right, so I go back from TED,

00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:33.171
and then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party

00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.636
in Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:38.378
a number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin,

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:41.974
and to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:45.340
in National Affairs called "Beyond the Welfare State."

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.539
Levin writes that all over the world,

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.750
nations are coming to terms with the fact

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.051
that the social democratic welfare state

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:56.570
is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.134
dependent upon dubious economics

00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:02.771
and the demographic model of a bygone era.

00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:05.416
All right, now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid,

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.094
but look at these graphs that Levin showed.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.544
This graph shows the national debt

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:13.626
as a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see,

00:02:13.626 --> 00:02:15.707
if you go all the way back to the founding,

00:02:15.707 --> 00:02:17.823
we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War.

00:02:17.823 --> 00:02:21.161
Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.213
and then, oh, what's this? The Civil War. Even more expensive.

00:02:24.213 --> 00:02:26.946
Borrow a lot of money, pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.668
get down to near zero, and bang! -- World War I.

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:31.370
Once again, the same process repeats.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.278
Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:37.636
We rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP,

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:41.316
really unsustainable, really dangerous.

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:45.943
But we pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, what's this?

00:02:45.943 --> 00:02:48.952
Why has it been rising since the '70s?

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:51.745
It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded,

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:54.439
but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending,

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.593
especially Medicare.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:59.688
We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II,

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:02.679
and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet,

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.949
and when they do, this is what will happen.

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.678
This is data from the Congressional Budget Office

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.505
showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:14.620
if current situations and expectations and trends are extended.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.552
All right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs

00:03:17.552 --> 00:03:22.183
are actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes,

00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:23.378
or in terms of the data they present,

00:03:23.378 --> 00:03:27.851
but in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing.

00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:29.687
Let me translate for you.

00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:33.354
"We are doomed unless we start acting now.

00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:36.334
What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:40.723
Can't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way."

00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:43.004
We can deflect both of these asteroids.

00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:46.394
These problems are both technically solvable.

00:03:46.394 --> 00:03:49.173
Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-partisan times,

00:03:49.173 --> 00:03:52.165
the mere fact that one side says, "Look, there's an asteroid,"

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.406
means that the other side's going to say, "Huh? What?

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:56.984
No, I'm not even going to look up. No."

00:03:56.984 --> 00:04:00.088
To understand why this is happening to us,

00:04:00.088 --> 00:04:04.134
and what we can do about it, we need to learn more about moral psychology.

00:04:04.134 --> 00:04:06.792
So I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality,

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:09.179
and one of the most important principles of morality

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.429
is that morality binds and blinds.

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.863
It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values

00:04:14.863 --> 00:04:18.776
but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality.

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:19.882
Think of it like this.

00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:23.945
Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:26.104
There are only a few species that can do it.

00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:29.104
That's a beehive. That's a termite mound, a giant termite mound.

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:32.204
And when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story.

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:37.101
They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen,

00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:38.960
so they're all in the same boat.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.281
They rise or fall, they live or die, as one.

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.572
There's only one species on the planet that can do this

00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:47.147
without kinship, and that, of course, is us.

00:04:47.147 --> 00:04:49.418
This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon,

00:04:49.418 --> 00:04:51.741
and this is Tenochtitlan.

00:04:51.741 --> 00:04:53.833
Now how did we do this? How did we go

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.827
from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago

00:04:56.827 --> 00:05:00.845
to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years?

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:03.888
It's miraculous, and part of the explanation

00:05:03.888 --> 00:05:08.112
is this ability to circle around sacred values.

00:05:08.112 --> 00:05:12.036
As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.

00:05:12.036 --> 00:05:15.888
This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca.

00:05:15.888 --> 00:05:19.033
It's a sacred rock, and when people circle something together,

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:23.404
they unite, they can trust each other, they become one.

00:05:23.404 --> 00:05:25.585
It's as though you're moving an electrical wire

00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:27.722
through a magnetic field that generates current.

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:30.645
When people circle together, they generate a current.

00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:32.178
We love to circle around things.

00:05:32.178 --> 00:05:35.876
We circle around flags, and then we can trust each other.

00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:38.717
We can fight as a team, as a unit.

00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:41.876
But even as morality binds people together into a unit,

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:45.848
into a team, the circling blinds them.

00:05:45.848 --> 00:05:47.656
It causes them to distort reality.

00:05:47.656 --> 00:05:51.693
We begin separating everything into good versus evil.

00:05:51.693 --> 00:05:55.591
Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.

00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:59.810
But it is a gross distortion of reality.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.218
You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress.

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:05.450
This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.281
in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis,

00:06:08.281 --> 00:06:10.957
so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is,

00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:14.183
you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.

00:06:14.183 --> 00:06:16.237
And what you can see is that,

00:06:16.237 --> 00:06:18.622
in the decades after the Civil War,

00:06:18.622 --> 00:06:21.111
Congress was extraordinarily polarized,

00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.654
as you would expect, about as high as can be.

00:06:23.654 --> 00:06:26.630
But then, after World War I, things dropped,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.535
and we get this historically low level of polarization.

00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:31.227
This was a golden age of bipartisanship,

00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:34.502
at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together

00:06:34.502 --> 00:06:37.510
and solve grand national problems.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.959
But in the 1980s and '90s, the electromagnet turns back on.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:44.800
Polarization rises.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.766
It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals

00:06:47.766 --> 00:06:49.598
could all work together in Congress.

00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:52.439
They could rearrange themselves, form bipartisan committees,

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.712
but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up,

00:06:55.712 --> 00:06:57.982
the force field increased,

00:06:57.982 --> 00:07:00.746
Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart.

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:02.733
It became much harder for them to socialize,

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:04.211
much harder for them to cooperate.

00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:09.052
Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.

00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:12.564
Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates,

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:16.080
Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.066
Do you know why they do this?

00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:22.208
It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for. (Laughter)

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.974
The polarization is strongest among our political elites.

00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:27.152
Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington.

00:07:27.152 --> 00:07:30.588
But for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people.

00:07:30.588 --> 00:07:31.896
Well, in the last 12 years it's become

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:33.983
much more apparent that it is.

00:07:33.983 --> 00:07:37.205
So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey.

00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:39.845
And what they do on that survey is they ask

00:07:39.845 --> 00:07:41.857
what's called a feeling thermometer rating.

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:46.094
So, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know,

00:07:46.094 --> 00:07:48.869
Native Americans, or the military, the Republican Party,

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:51.795
the Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life.

00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:54.477
The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel

00:07:54.477 --> 00:07:56.940
about Democrats, and they like them.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.645
You know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale.

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.660
Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.734
But when you look at cross-party ratings,

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.269
you find, well, that it's lower, but actually,

00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:09.253
when I first saw this data, I was surprised.

00:08:09.253 --> 00:08:12.548
That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations,

00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:17.125
they were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible.

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:19.440
It drifts downwards very slightly,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.301
but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama.

00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:26.053
It plummets. Something is going on here.

00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:28.454
The moral electromagnet is turning back on,

00:08:28.454 --> 00:08:30.614
and nowadays, just very recently,

00:08:30.614 --> 00:08:32.854
Democrats really dislike Republicans.

00:08:32.854 --> 00:08:36.370
Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.220
It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.945
It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart,

00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:46.901
pulling left and right into their own territories

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.710
like the Bloods and the Crips.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.724
Now, there are many reasons why this is happening to us,

00:08:52.724 --> 00:08:55.644
and many of them we cannot reverse.

00:08:55.644 --> 00:08:58.141
We will never again have a political class

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:01.700
that was forged by the experience of fighting together

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.444
in World War II against a common enemy.

00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:07.978
We will never again have just three television networks,

00:09:07.978 --> 00:09:11.151
all of which are relatively centrist.

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:15.991
And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats

00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.782
and liberal northern Republicans making it easy,

00:09:19.782 --> 00:09:24.100
making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.748
So for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War

00:09:26.748 --> 00:09:28.551
were an historically anomalous time.

00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:32.268
We will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.

00:09:32.268 --> 00:09:34.866
But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:38.012
and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better,

00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:40.436
because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:44.059
to things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:49.154
that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution.

00:09:49.154 --> 00:09:51.346
These changes are detailed in many books.

00:09:51.346 --> 00:09:53.586
These are two that I strongly recommend,

00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:55.737
and they list a whole bunch of reforms.

00:09:55.737 --> 00:09:58.507
I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here.

00:09:58.507 --> 00:10:01.545
So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional,

00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:04.889
hyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is,

00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:10.163
do what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place,

00:10:10.163 --> 00:10:11.557
and when you have closed party primaries,

00:10:11.557 --> 00:10:14.621
and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting,

00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:18.617
you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans.

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:22.204
So open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe.

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:26.955
But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress.

00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:30.355
From my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders,

00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:33.335
most of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working,

00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:35.996
intelligent people who really want to solve problems,

00:10:35.996 --> 00:10:38.621
but once they get there, they find that they are forced

00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:41.552
to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship

00:10:41.552 --> 00:10:43.201
and that punishes independent thinking.

00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:45.779
You step out of line, you get punished.

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.546
So there are a lot of reforms we could do

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:48.718
that will counteract this.

00:10:48.718 --> 00:10:51.938
For example, this "Citizens United" ruling is a disaster,

00:10:51.938 --> 00:10:54.137
because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head,

00:10:54.137 --> 00:10:56.902
and if you step out of line, if you try to reach across the aisle,

00:10:56.902 --> 00:10:59.418
there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent

00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:05.083
to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising.

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:07.386
But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change

00:11:07.386 --> 00:11:10.213
the nature of social relationships in Congress.

00:11:10.213 --> 00:11:14.524
The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted,

00:11:14.524 --> 00:11:17.595
friendly, very socially skillful people,

00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:20.949
and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships,

00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:24.228
make deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter,

00:11:24.228 --> 00:11:26.613
you've got to use your personal skills,

00:11:26.613 --> 00:11:29.004
and that's the way politics has always worked.

00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:32.084
But beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives

00:11:32.084 --> 00:11:34.469
changed its legislative calendar

00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:38.125
so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week.

00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:40.354
Nowadays, Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning,

00:11:40.354 --> 00:11:43.203
they do battle for two days, then they fly home Thursday afternoon.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.108
They don't move their families to the District.

00:11:45.108 --> 00:11:47.426
They don't meet each other's spouses or children.

00:11:47.426 --> 00:11:49.940
There's no more relationship there.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.736
And trying to run Congress without human relationships

00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:56.563
is like trying to run a car without motor oil.

00:11:56.563 --> 00:11:59.400
Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.233
and descends into paralysis and polarization?

00:12:03.233 --> 00:12:04.984
A simple change to the legislative calendar,

00:12:04.984 --> 00:12:07.311
such as having business stretch out for three weeks

00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:08.874
and then they get a week off to go home,

00:12:08.874 --> 00:12:12.199
that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress.

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:15.335
So there's a lot we can do, but who's going to push them to do it?

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:17.719
There are a number of groups that are working on this.

00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:19.871
No Labels and Common Cause, I think,

00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:22.010
have very good ideas for changes we need to do

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.175
to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective.

00:12:25.175 --> 00:12:26.998
But I'd like to supplement their work

00:12:26.998 --> 00:12:31.062
with a little psychological trick, and the trick is this.

00:12:31.062 --> 00:12:34.112
Nothing pulls people together like a common threat

00:12:34.112 --> 00:12:37.905
or a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy,

00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:43.227
unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology,

00:12:43.227 --> 00:12:46.181
in which case, as I said before, it can actually pull us apart.

00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:49.104
Sometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.

00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:52.214
But what if the situation we face is not a single threat

00:12:52.214 --> 00:12:54.051
but is actually more like this,

00:12:54.051 --> 00:12:55.481
where there's just so much stuff coming in,

00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:57.562
it's just, "Start shooting, come on, everybody,

00:12:57.562 --> 00:12:59.812
we've got to just work together, just start shooting."

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:02.437
Because actually, we do face this situation.

00:13:02.437 --> 00:13:04.973
This is where we are as a country.

00:13:04.973 --> 00:13:07.167
So here's another asteroid.

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:08.843
We've all seen versions of this graph, right,

00:13:08.843 --> 00:13:12.677
which shows the changes in wealth since 1979,

00:13:12.677 --> 00:13:15.276
and as you can see, almost all the gains in wealth

00:13:15.276 --> 00:13:20.170
have gone to the top 20 percent, and especially the top one percent.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.298
Rising inequality like this is associated

00:13:22.298 --> 00:13:24.971
with so many problems for a democracy.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.939
Especially, it destroys our ability to trust each other,

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:31.392
to feel that we're all in the same boat, because it's obvious we're not.

00:13:31.392 --> 00:13:34.350
Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.940
Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.992
We're not all in the same boat, and that means

00:13:37.992 --> 00:13:42.901
nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good.

00:13:42.901 --> 00:13:45.777
The left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now,

00:13:45.777 --> 00:13:50.719
and the right says, "Huh, what? Hmm? No problem. No problem."

00:13:50.719 --> 00:13:53.298
Now,

00:13:53.298 --> 00:13:55.647
why is that happening to us? Why is the inequality rising?

00:13:55.647 --> 00:13:59.265
Well, one of the largest causes, after globalization,

00:13:59.265 --> 00:14:02.111
is actually this fourth asteroid,

00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:04.086
rising non-marital births.

00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:07.022
This graph shows the steady rise of out-of-wedlock births

00:14:07.022 --> 00:14:09.000
since the 1960s.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.279
Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers.

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:14.687
Whites are headed that way too.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:17.032
Within a decade or two, most American children

00:14:17.032 --> 00:14:19.901
will be born into homes with no father.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.255
This means that there's much less money coming into the house.

00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:26.213
But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos.

00:14:26.213 --> 00:14:28.448
As I know from working with street children in Brazil,

00:14:28.448 --> 00:14:33.510
Mom's boyfriend is often a really, really dangerous person for kids.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.527
Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s,

00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:41.406
and the left has been saying, "It's not a problem. It's not a problem."

00:14:41.406 --> 00:14:43.112
The left has been very reluctant to say

00:14:43.112 --> 00:14:46.717
that marriage is actually good for women and for children.

00:14:46.717 --> 00:14:48.678
Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.

00:14:48.678 --> 00:14:50.172
I'm actually more critical of the men

00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:52.165
who won't take responsibility for their own children

00:14:52.165 --> 00:14:54.996
and of an economic system that makes it difficult

00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:58.229
for many men to earn enough money to support those children.

00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:02.597
But even if you blame nobody, it still is a national problem,

00:15:02.597 --> 00:15:06.332
and one side has been more concerned about it than the other.

00:15:06.332 --> 00:15:08.565
The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid

00:15:08.565 --> 00:15:10.845
with a front-page story last July

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:15.059
showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality.

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:18.653
We are becoming a nation of just two classes.

00:15:18.653 --> 00:15:21.395
When Americans go to college and marry each other,

00:15:21.395 --> 00:15:24.095
they have very low divorce rates.

00:15:24.095 --> 00:15:27.140
They earn a lot of money, they invest that money in their kids,

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.683
some of them become tiger mothers,

00:15:28.683 --> 00:15:30.359
the kids rise to their full potential,

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:32.782
and the kids go on to become

00:15:32.782 --> 00:15:37.073
the top two lines in this graph.

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:39.703
And then there's everybody else:

00:15:39.703 --> 00:15:42.947
the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage,

00:15:42.947 --> 00:15:44.650
who don't have as much invested in them,

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.434
who don't grow up in a stable environment,

00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:51.392
and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph.

00:15:51.392 --> 00:15:54.957
So once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing.

00:15:54.957 --> 00:15:57.971
As before, we've got a problem, we've got to start working on this,

00:15:57.971 --> 00:16:00.003
we've got to do something,

00:16:00.003 --> 00:16:02.643
and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat?

00:16:02.643 --> 00:16:06.445
But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders,

00:16:06.445 --> 00:16:09.048
we'd see that these two problems actually

00:16:09.048 --> 00:16:11.795
are best addressed together.

00:16:11.795 --> 00:16:13.538
Because if you really care about income inequality,

00:16:13.538 --> 00:16:15.845
you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups

00:16:15.845 --> 00:16:18.976
that are working on ways to promote marriage.

00:16:18.976 --> 00:16:21.182
But then you're going to run smack into the problem

00:16:21.182 --> 00:16:23.710
that women don't generally want to marry someone

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.062
who doesn't have a job.

00:16:26.062 --> 00:16:27.875
So if you really care about strengthening families,

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:29.536
you might want to talk to some liberal groups

00:16:29.536 --> 00:16:32.942
who are working on promoting educational equality,

00:16:32.942 --> 00:16:34.702
who are working on raising the minimum wage,

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:37.542
who are working on finding ways to stop so many men

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:39.581
from being sucked into the criminal justice system and

00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:42.935
taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:48.783
So to conclude, there are at least four asteroids headed our way.

00:16:48.783 --> 00:16:51.575
How many of you can see all four?

00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:54.190
Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.183
that all four of these are national problems.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.040
Please raise your hands.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.687
Okay, almost all of you.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:03.529
Well, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members

00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:06.792
of the Asteroids Club, which is a club

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:10.033
for all Americans who are willing to admit

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:12.936
that the other side actually might have a point.

00:17:12.936 --> 00:17:15.967
In the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.

00:17:15.967 --> 00:17:17.861
Common ground is often very hard to find.

00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:20.045
No, we start by looking for common threats

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:23.714
because common threats make common ground.

00:17:23.714 --> 00:17:27.538
Now, am I being naive? Is it naive to think

00:17:27.538 --> 00:17:28.909
that people could ever lay down their swords,

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:32.515
and left and right could actually work together?

00:17:32.515 --> 00:17:35.002
I don't think so, because it happens,

00:17:35.002 --> 00:17:38.866
not all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way.

00:17:38.866 --> 00:17:40.305
This is something we can do.

00:17:40.305 --> 00:17:44.340
Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.091
and they've formed dozens of organizations,

00:17:46.091 --> 00:17:48.264
at the national level, such as this one,

00:17:48.264 --> 00:17:49.912
down to many local organizations,

00:17:49.912 --> 00:17:52.270
such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee, Florida,

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.745
which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate

00:17:54.745 --> 00:17:58.191
that sort of working together human relationship

00:17:58.191 --> 00:18:01.231
that's necessary to solve Florida's problems.

00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:05.626
Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS,

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:08.522
and on so many humanitarian issues,

00:18:08.522 --> 00:18:11.546
liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies,

00:18:11.546 --> 00:18:13.429
and at times they really have worked together

00:18:13.429 --> 00:18:15.346
to solve these problems.

00:18:15.346 --> 00:18:18.069
And most surprisingly to me, they sometimes can even see

00:18:18.069 --> 00:18:20.065
eye to eye on criminal justice.

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:24.018
For example, the incarceration rate, the prison population

00:18:24.018 --> 00:18:27.971
in this country has quadrupled since 1980.

00:18:27.971 --> 00:18:30.555
Now this is a social disaster,

00:18:30.555 --> 00:18:32.607
and liberals are very concerned about this.

00:18:32.607 --> 00:18:35.394
The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting

00:18:35.394 --> 00:18:38.266
the prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system

00:18:38.266 --> 00:18:41.044
that's just sucking in more and more poor young men.

00:18:41.044 --> 00:18:43.377
But are conservatives happy about this?

00:18:43.377 --> 00:18:46.459
Well, Grover Norquist isn't, because this system

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.531
costs an unbelievable amount of money.

00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:52.110
And so, because the prison-industrial complex

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:56.347
is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls,

00:18:56.347 --> 00:19:00.079
groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:03.911
have come together to form a group called Right on Crime.

00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:06.567
And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center

00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:08.545
to oppose the building of new prisons

00:19:08.545 --> 00:19:11.886
and to work for reforms that will make the justice system

00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:15.007
more efficient and more humane.

00:19:15.007 --> 00:19:18.302
So this is possible. We can do it.

00:19:18.302 --> 00:19:21.383
Let us therefore go to battle stations,

00:19:21.383 --> 00:19:22.642
not to fight each other,

00:19:22.642 --> 00:19:25.968
but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids.

00:19:25.968 --> 00:19:29.039
And let our first mission be to press Congress

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:32.982
to reform itself, before it's too late for our nation.

00:19:32.982 --> 00:19:36.982
Thank you. (Applause)
