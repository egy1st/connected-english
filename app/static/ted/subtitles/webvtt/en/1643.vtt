00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:02.785
It's wonderful to be here

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:04.871
to talk about my journey,

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.605
to talk about the wheelchair

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.245
and the freedom it has bought me.

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:11.882
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.016
when an extended illness

00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:17.602
changed the way I could access the world.

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:19.979
When I started using the wheelchair,

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:22.564
it was a tremendous new freedom.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.650
I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.220
It was like having an enormous new toy.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.250
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.758
Just being out on the street was exhilarating.

00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:40.160
But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.712
people's reaction completely changed towards me.

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:46.192
It was as if they couldn't see me anymore,

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:50.191
as if an invisibility cloak had descended.

00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:53.412
They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions

00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:57.640
of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.552
When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair,

00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:06.106
they used words like "limitation," "fear,"

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:09.131
"pity" and "restriction."

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:13.900
I realized I'd internalized these responses

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.437
and it had changed who I was on a core level.

00:01:17.437 --> 00:01:21.627
A part of me had become alienated from myself.

00:01:21.627 --> 00:01:25.212
I was seeing myself not from my perspective,

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:29.374
but vividly and continuously from the perspective

00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:32.271
of other people's responses to me.

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:37.396
As a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.635
about this experience,

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:42.411
new narratives to reclaim my identity.

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:45.515
["Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' â€” Davis 2009, TEDx Women"]

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:47.593
I started making work

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:50.409
that aimed to communicate something

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.527
of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair --

00:01:55.527 --> 00:02:00.141
a power chair -- to negotiate the world.

00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:06.726
I was working to transform these internalized responses,

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:10.521
to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.702
my identity when I started using a wheelchair,

00:02:13.702 --> 00:02:17.466
by creating unexpected images.

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:23.687
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.

00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:25.728
When I literally started leaving

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:29.294
traces of my joy and freedom,

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:31.242
it was exciting to see

00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:35.744
the interested and surprised responses from people.

00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:38.633
It seemed to open up new perspectives,

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:41.528
and therein lay the paradigm shift.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.602
It showed that an arts practice

00:02:43.602 --> 00:02:45.945
can remake one's identity

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:50.729
and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:54.642
So when I began to dive, in 2005,

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:58.168
I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity

00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:00.827
in just the same way as a wheelchair does,

00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:03.419
but the associations attached to scuba gear

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.019
are ones of excitement and adventure,

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.843
completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair.

00:03:09.843 --> 00:03:12.987
So I thought, "I wonder what'll happen

00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:17.299
if I put the two together?" (Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.491
And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted

00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.198
has taken me on the most amazing journey

00:03:24.198 --> 00:03:26.467
over the last seven years.

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.955
So to give you an idea of what that's like,

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:32.841
I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes

00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:34.937
from creating this spectacle,

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:38.738
and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on.

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:47.578
(Music)

00:07:08.435 --> 00:07:15.236
(Applause)

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:18.215
It is the most amazing experience,

00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:21.856
beyond most other things I've experienced in life.

00:07:21.856 --> 00:07:24.953
I literally have the freedom to move

00:07:24.953 --> 00:07:27.592
in 360 degrees of space

00:07:27.592 --> 00:07:31.352
and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.

00:07:31.352 --> 00:07:33.969
And the incredibly unexpected thing

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:38.159
is that other people seem to see and feel that too.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.537
Their eyes literally light up,

00:07:40.537 --> 00:07:43.791
and they say things like, "I want one of those,"

00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:47.473
or, "If you can do that, I can do anything."

00:07:47.473 --> 00:07:51.095
And I'm thinking, it's because in that moment

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:53.648
of them seeing an object

00:07:53.648 --> 00:07:55.559
they have no frame of reference for,

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:58.359
or so transcends the frames of reference

00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:00.104
they have with the wheelchair,

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:03.136
they have to think in a completely new way.

00:08:03.136 --> 00:08:07.480
And I think that moment of completely new thought

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.978
perhaps creates a freedom

00:08:09.978 --> 00:08:14.004
that spreads to the rest of other people's lives.

00:08:14.004 --> 00:08:17.196
For me, this means that they're seeing

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.546
the value of difference,

00:08:19.546 --> 00:08:21.466
the joy it brings

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:25.286
when instead of focusing on loss or limitation,

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:29.690
we see and discover the power and joy

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.097
of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.796
For me, the wheelchair becomes

00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:38.141
a vehicle for transformation.

00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:41.921
In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal,"

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.125
because it's literally pushed me through

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:46.003
into a new way of being,

00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:49.737
into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.

00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:51.282
And the other thing is,

00:08:51.282 --> 00:08:53.754
that because nobody's seen or heard

00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:56.249
of an underwater wheelchair before,

00:08:56.249 --> 00:08:59.092
and creating this spectacle is about creating

00:08:59.092 --> 00:09:01.929
new ways of seeing, being and knowing,

00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:04.877
now you have this concept in your mind.

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:08.676
You're all part of the artwork too.

00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:16.198
(Applause)
