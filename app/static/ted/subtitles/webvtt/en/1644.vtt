00:00:00.513 --> 00:00:03.266
Hello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka,

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:07.732
and I write and illustrate books for children for a living.

00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:11.892
So I use my imagination as my full-time job.

00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:15.221
But well before my imagination was my vocation,

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.949
my imagination saved my life.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.436
When I was a kid, I loved to draw,

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:23.302
and the most talented artist I knew

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:25.136
was my mother,

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:28.452
but my mother was addicted to heroin.

00:00:28.452 --> 00:00:31.897
And when your parent is a drug addict,

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:35.236
it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football,

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:37.732
because as much as you want to love on that person,

00:00:37.732 --> 00:00:39.970
as much as you want to receive love from that person,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.223
every time you open your heart, you end up on your back.

00:00:43.223 --> 00:00:47.443
So throughout my childhood, my mother was incarcerated

00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:48.869
and I didn't have my father because

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:52.529
I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade.

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:54.849
But I had my grandparents,

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:57.420
my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.702
who adopted me just before my third birthday

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:02.164
and took me in as their own,

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:04.092
after they had already raised five children.

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:07.302
So two people who grew up in the Great Depression,

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:12.340
there in the very, very early '80s took on a new kid.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.398
I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom

00:01:14.398 --> 00:01:16.504
of the Krosoczka family,

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:19.085
the new kid who came out of nowhere.

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:23.228
And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them.

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:26.321
They each smoked two packs a day, each, nonfiltered,

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:28.524
and by the time I was six,

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:30.627
I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan,

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:32.780
dry with a twist, rocks on the side,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.761
the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink.

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.100
But they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.460
And they supported my creative efforts,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.949
because my grandfather was a self-made man.

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:46.669
He ran and worked in a factory.

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:49.132
My grandmother was a homemaker.

00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:51.710
But here was this kid who loved Transformers

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.851
and Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles,

00:01:55.851 --> 00:02:00.652
and the characters that I read about, I fell in love with,

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:03.727
and they became my friends.

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:06.029
So my best friends in life were the characters

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.500
I read about in books.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.587
I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts,

00:02:11.587 --> 00:02:14.283
and I had wonderful teachers there,

00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:17.684
most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch.

00:02:17.684 --> 00:02:21.443
And I just, I can just remember the love that she offered

00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:24.190
us as her students.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.089
When I was in the third grade,

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.832
a monumental event happened.

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:31.176
An author visited our school, Jack Gantos.

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:34.616
A published author of books came to talk to us

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:37.114
about what he did for a living.

00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:40.488
And afterwards, we all went back to our classrooms

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:43.062
and we drew our own renditions of his main character,

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.511
Rotten Ralph.

00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:47.368
And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway,

00:02:47.368 --> 00:02:50.320
and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.940
going from kid to kid looking at the desks, not saying a word.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.137
But he stopped next to my desk,

00:02:57.137 --> 00:02:59.637
and he tapped on my desk, and he said,

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.991
"Nice cat." (Laughter)

00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.730
And he wandered away.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.066
Two words that made a colossal difference in my life.

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:12.905
When I was in the third grade, I wrote a book for the first time,

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:16.587
"The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer." (Laughter)

00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:18.872
We had to write our own Greek myth,

00:03:18.872 --> 00:03:21.715
our own creation story, so I wrote a story about an owl

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:25.658
who challenged Hermes to a flying race,

00:03:25.658 --> 00:03:27.769
and the owl cheated,

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.491
and Hermes, being a Greek god, grew angry and bitter,

00:03:31.491 --> 00:03:33.360
and turned the owl into a moon,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.299
so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.342
while he watched his family and friends play at night.

00:03:38.342 --> 00:03:41.754
Yeah. (Laughter)

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.906
My book had a title page.

00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:48.208
I was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight.

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.339
(Laughter)

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.586
And it was a story that was told with words and pictures,

00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:56.774
exactly what I do now for a living,

00:03:56.774 --> 00:04:00.461
and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own,

00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.531
and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.766
to tell the story.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:09.112
My favorite page is the "About the author" page.

00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:11.351
(Laughter)

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.194
So I learned to write about myself in third person

00:04:14.194 --> 00:04:17.314
at a young age.

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:20.838
So I love that last sentence: "He liked making this book."

00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:24.769
And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination,

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:25.954
and that's what writing is.

00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:28.469
Writing is using your imagination on paper,

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.440
and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.497
and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids,

00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:38.311
that writing would be using your imagination on paper,

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:42.390
if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.578
So I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school,

00:04:44.578 --> 00:04:47.073
and I would take out pieces of paper,

00:04:47.073 --> 00:04:48.994
and I would staple them together,

00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:51.834
and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:55.510
just because I loved using my imagination.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.622
And so these characters would become my friends.

00:04:57.622 --> 00:05:00.682
There was an egg, a tomato, a head of lettuce and a pumpkin,

00:05:00.682 --> 00:05:03.156
and they all lived in this refrigerator city,

00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:05.978
and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:07.381
that was filled with so many dangers

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:12.065
like an evil blender who tried to chop them up,

00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:18.007
an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple,

00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:20.362
and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.759
who was a stick of butter. (Laughter)

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.962
And I'd make my own comics too,

00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:28.099
and this was another way for me to tell stories,

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.330
through words and through pictures.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.114
Now when I was in sixth grade,

00:05:33.114 --> 00:05:35.970
the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.014
in the Worcester public school system.

00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:41.398
I went from having art once a week

00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:42.995
to twice a month

00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:45.841
to once a month to not at all.

00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:47.713
And my grandfather, he was a wise man,

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:49.548
and he saw that as a problem, because he knew

00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:53.128
that was, like, the one thing I had. I didn't play sports.

00:05:53.128 --> 00:05:55.910
I had art.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.368
So he walked into my room one evening,

00:05:58.368 --> 00:05:59.913
and he sat on the edge of my bed,

00:05:59.913 --> 00:06:02.152
and he said, "Jarrett, it's up to you, but if you'd like to,

00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:04.641
we'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum."

00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.238
And I was so thrilled.

00:06:06.238 --> 00:06:07.908
So from sixth through 12th grade,

00:06:07.908 --> 00:06:09.909
once, twice, sometimes three times a week,

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.628
I would take classes at the art museum,

00:06:11.628 --> 00:06:14.660
and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw,

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.064
other kids who shared a similar passion.

00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:21.023
Now my publishing career began when I designed the cover

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:23.634
for my eighth grade yearbook,

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.901
and if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in,

00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:29.509
I was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.370
and Vanilla Ice at the time. (Laughter)

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.263
And to this day, I still can do karaoke to "Ice, Ice Baby"

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:39.806
without looking at the screen.

00:06:39.806 --> 00:06:43.316
Don't tempt me, because I will do it.

00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:45.238
So I get shipped off to private school,

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.461
K through eight, public schools, but for some reason

00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:49.836
my grandfather was upset that somebody

00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:52.197
at the local high school had been stabbed and killed,

00:06:52.197 --> 00:06:54.893
so he didn't want me to go there.

00:06:54.893 --> 00:06:57.704
He wanted me to go to a private school, and he gave me an option.

00:06:57.704 --> 00:06:59.440
You can go to Holy Name, which is coed,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.813
or St. John's, which is all boys.

00:07:01.813 --> 00:07:04.013
Very wise man, because he knew I would,

00:07:04.013 --> 00:07:06.749
I felt like I was making the decision on my own,

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:08.545
and he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's,

00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:10.243
so I went to Holy Name High School,

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:13.011
which was a tough transition because, like I said,

00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:14.571
I didn't play sports,

00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.052
and it was very focused on sports,

00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:21.216
but I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room.

00:07:21.216 --> 00:07:23.714
And I just flourished here.

00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:26.873
I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day.

00:07:26.873 --> 00:07:29.160
So how did I make friends?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.393
I drew funny pictures of my teachers -- (Laughter) --

00:07:33.393 --> 00:07:36.150
and I passed them around.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.948
Well, in English class, in ninth grade,

00:07:39.948 --> 00:07:41.924
my friend John, who was sitting next to me,

00:07:41.924 --> 00:07:44.639
laughed a little bit too hard.

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.920
Mr. Greenwood was not pleased.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.827
(Laughter)

00:07:50.827 --> 00:07:54.212
He instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion,

00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:58.227
and for the first time in my life, I was sent to the hall,

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:00.409
and I thought, "Oh no, I'm doomed.

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:03.614
My grandfather's just going to kill me."

00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:05.175
And he came out to the hallway and he said,

00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:06.293
"Let me see the paper."

00:08:06.293 --> 00:08:11.357
And I thought, "Oh no. He thinks it's a note."

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:14.193
And so I took this picture, and I handed it to him.

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:17.406
And we sat in silence for that brief moment,

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:19.554
and he said to me,

00:08:19.554 --> 00:08:22.917
"You're really talented." (Laughter)

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:25.606
"You're really good. You know, the school newspaper

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.989
needs a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist.

00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:31.615
Just stop drawing in my class."

00:08:31.615 --> 00:08:33.949
So my parents never found out about it.

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:37.175
I didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey,

00:08:37.175 --> 00:08:38.839
who ran the school newspaper,

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:43.411
and I was for three and a half years

00:08:43.411 --> 00:08:45.787
the cartoonist for my school paper,

00:08:45.787 --> 00:08:47.959
handling such heavy issues as,

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:51.067
seniors are mean,

00:08:51.067 --> 00:08:53.663
freshmen are nerds,

00:08:53.663 --> 00:08:59.468
the prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom.

00:08:59.468 --> 00:09:03.052
And I took the headmaster to task

00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:06.915
and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley

00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:10.161
who was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down

00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:12.277
that this wasn't about me,

00:09:12.277 --> 00:09:16.079
but all these years later it was totally me.

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:18.207
But it was so cool because I could write these stories,

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:19.385
I could come up with these ideas,

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:21.688
and they'd be published in the school paper,

00:09:21.688 --> 00:09:24.298
and people who I didn't know could read them.

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:27.353
And I loved that thought, of being able to share my ideas

00:09:27.353 --> 00:09:29.683
through the printed page.

00:09:29.698 --> 00:09:32.879
On my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:35.124
gave me the best birthday present ever:

00:09:35.124 --> 00:09:40.043
a drafting table that I have worked on ever since.

00:09:40.043 --> 00:09:41.299
Here I am, 20 years later,

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:45.843
and I still work on this table every day.

00:09:45.843 --> 00:09:48.253
On the evening of my 14th birthday,

00:09:48.253 --> 00:09:52.418
I was given this table, and we had Chinese food.

00:09:52.418 --> 00:09:56.038
And this was my fortune:

00:09:56.038 --> 00:09:58.315
"You will be successful in your work."

00:09:58.315 --> 00:10:01.143
I taped it to the top left hand of my table,

00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:03.102
and as you can see, it's still there.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:07.003
Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything.

00:10:07.003 --> 00:10:09.347
Well, two things: Rusty, who was a great hamster

00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:13.483
and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade.

00:10:13.483 --> 00:10:16.302
(Laughter)

00:10:16.302 --> 00:10:19.499
And a video camera.

00:10:19.499 --> 00:10:21.739
I just wanted a video camera.

00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:24.220
And after begging and pleading for Christmas,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.651
I got a second-hand video camera,

00:10:26.651 --> 00:10:30.483
and I instantly started making my own animations

00:10:30.483 --> 00:10:32.683
on my own,

00:10:32.683 --> 00:10:35.363
and all throughout high school I made my own animations.

00:10:35.363 --> 00:10:38.460
I convinced my 10th grade English teacher to allow me

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.787
to do my book report on Stephen King's "Misery"

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:45.551
as an animated short. (Laughter)

00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:48.407
And I kept making comics.

00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:52.351
I kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum,

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:56.584
I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given.

00:10:56.584 --> 00:10:59.473
Mark Lynch, he's an amazing teacher

00:10:59.473 --> 00:11:01.688
and he's still a dear friend of mine,

00:11:01.688 --> 00:11:04.095
and I was 14 or 15,

00:11:04.095 --> 00:11:07.116
and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course,

00:11:07.116 --> 00:11:08.930
and I was so excited, I was beaming.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.231
I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way,

00:11:12.231 --> 00:11:14.536
and it taught me how to draw superheroes,

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:16.864
how to draw a woman, how to draw muscles

00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:18.790
just the way they were supposed to be

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.615
if I were to ever draw for X-Men or Spiderman.

00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:24.507
And all the color just drained from his face,

00:11:24.507 --> 00:11:26.246
and he looked at me, and he said,

00:11:26.246 --> 00:11:29.016
"Forget everything you learned."

00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:32.840
And I didn't understand. He said, "You have a great style.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.002
Celebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw.

00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:39.160
Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.609
because you're really good."

00:11:41.609 --> 00:11:45.183
Now when I was a teenager, I was angsty as any teenager was,

00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:48.696
but after 17 years of having a mother

00:11:48.696 --> 00:11:50.858
who was in and out of my life like a yo-yo

00:11:50.858 --> 00:11:54.759
and a father who was faceless, I was angry.

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:57.481
And when I was 17, I met my father for the first time,

00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:01.382
upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about.

00:12:01.382 --> 00:12:03.302
And on the day I met my father for the first time,

00:12:03.302 --> 00:12:06.066
I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design,

00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:09.817
my one and only choice for college.

00:12:09.817 --> 00:12:12.209
But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine

00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:14.709
to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids,

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:17.781
kids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life.

00:12:17.781 --> 00:12:20.346
Eric didn't live to see his sixth birthday,

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:22.911
and Eric lives with me every day.

00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:26.600
So after this experience, my art teacher, Mr. Shilale,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.792
he brought in these picture books,

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.642
and I thought, "Picture books for kids!"

00:12:29.642 --> 00:12:34.710
and I started writing books for young readers

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.439
when I was a senior in high school.

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:39.227
Well, I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design.

00:12:39.227 --> 00:12:41.331
I transferred to RISD as a sophomore,

00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:44.962
and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing,

00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:48.995
and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug

00:12:48.995 --> 00:12:50.647
who wanted to be friends with this kid.

00:12:50.647 --> 00:12:52.156
The kid had no patience for him.

00:12:52.156 --> 00:12:55.395
And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers

00:12:55.395 --> 00:12:57.939
and it was rejected every single time,

00:12:57.939 --> 00:13:00.692
but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp,

00:13:00.692 --> 00:13:03.677
an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses,

00:13:03.677 --> 00:13:06.925
and it's those kids at the camp that read my stories,

00:13:06.925 --> 00:13:10.692
and I read to them, and I saw that they responded to my work.

00:13:10.692 --> 00:13:14.428
I graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud,

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:17.046
and I moved to Boston, and I set up shop.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.221
I set up a studio and I tried to get published.

00:13:19.221 --> 00:13:22.262
I would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards

00:13:22.262 --> 00:13:24.659
to editors and art directors,

00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:26.299
but they would go unanswered.

00:13:26.299 --> 00:13:28.154
And my grandfather would call me every week,

00:13:28.154 --> 00:13:32.485
and he would say, "Jarrett, how's it going? Do you have a job yet?"

00:13:32.485 --> 00:13:34.749
Because he had just invested a significant amount of money

00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:36.670
in my college education.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.525
And I said, "Yes, I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books."

00:13:40.525 --> 00:13:44.043
And he said, "Well, who pays you for that?"

00:13:44.043 --> 00:13:46.009
And I said, "No one, no one, no one just yet.

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:47.169
But I know it's going to happen."

00:13:47.169 --> 00:13:50.662
Now, I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off-season programming

00:13:50.662 --> 00:13:53.845
to make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground,

00:13:53.845 --> 00:13:57.597
and this kid who was just this really hyper kid,

00:13:57.597 --> 00:14:00.469
I started calling him "Monkey Boy,"

00:14:00.469 --> 00:14:04.150
and I went home and wrote a book called "Good Night, Monkey Boy."

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.432
And I sent out one last batch of postcards.

00:14:07.432 --> 00:14:10.806
And I received an email from an editor at Random House

00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:14.557
with a subject line, "Nice work!" Exclamation point.

00:14:14.557 --> 00:14:16.345
"Dear Jarrett, I received your postcard.

00:14:16.345 --> 00:14:19.108
I liked your art, so I went to your website

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:23.069
and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories,

00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:25.735
because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them.

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:29.806
Please let me know if you're ever in New York City."

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:33.108
And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books.

00:14:33.108 --> 00:14:35.444
So the next week I "happened" to be in New York.

00:14:35.444 --> 00:14:38.388
(Laughter)

00:14:38.388 --> 00:14:40.700
And I met with this editor,

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.924
and I left New York for a contract for my first book,

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:44.957
"Good Night, Monkey Boy,"

00:14:44.957 --> 00:14:48.419
which was published on June 12, 2001.

00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:54.114
And my local paper celebrated the news.

00:14:54.114 --> 00:14:58.379
The local bookstore made a big deal of it.

00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:00.268
They sold out of all of their books.

00:15:00.268 --> 00:15:04.045
My friend described it as a wake, but happy,

00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:06.622
because everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me,

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:09.646
but I wasn't dead. I was just signing books.

00:15:09.646 --> 00:15:11.193
My grandparents, they were in the middle of it.

00:15:11.193 --> 00:15:13.782
They were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud.

00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:17.534
Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there.

00:15:17.534 --> 00:15:18.973
Mrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said,

00:15:18.973 --> 00:15:22.230
"I taught him how to read." (Laughter)

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.774
And then something happened that changed my life.

00:15:24.774 --> 00:15:26.990
I got my first piece of significant fan mail,

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.265
where this kid loved Monkey Boy so much

00:15:30.265 --> 00:15:33.861
that he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake.

00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:38.248
For a two-year-old, that is like a tattoo. (Laughter)

00:15:38.248 --> 00:15:41.309
You know? You only get one birthday per year.

00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:44.154
And for him, it's only his second.

00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:45.160
And I got this picture, and I thought,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.202
"This picture is going to live within his consciousness

00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:50.878
for his entire life. He will forever have this photo

00:15:50.878 --> 00:15:53.834
in his family photo albums."

00:15:53.834 --> 00:15:56.502
So that photo, since that moment,

00:15:56.502 --> 00:15:59.549
is framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books.

00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:02.109
I have 10 picture books out.

00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:05.509
"Punk Farm," "Baghead," "Ollie the Purple Elephant."

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:07.793
I just finished the ninth book

00:16:07.793 --> 00:16:10.286
in the "Lunch Lady" series, which is a graphic novel series

00:16:10.286 --> 00:16:12.870
about a lunch lady who fights crime.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.686
I'm expecting the release of a chapter book

00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:19.366
called "Platypus Police Squad: The Frog Who Croaked."

00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:22.936
And I travel the country visiting countless schools,

00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:27.446
letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats.

00:16:27.446 --> 00:16:29.974
And I meet Bagheads.

00:16:29.974 --> 00:16:34.545
Lunch ladies treat me really well.

00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:39.069
And I got to see my name in lights

00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:40.919
because kids put my name in lights.

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:43.009
Twice now, the "Lunch Lady" series has won

00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:45.990
the Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category,

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.960
and those winners were displayed

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.220
on a jumbotron screen in Times Square.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.944
"Punk Farm" and "Lunch Lady" are in development to be movies,

00:16:54.944 --> 00:16:57.518
so I am a movie producer

00:16:57.518 --> 00:17:00.251
and I really do think, thanks to that video camera

00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:02.815
I was given in ninth grade.

00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:05.585
I've seen people have "Punk Farm" birthday parties,

00:17:05.585 --> 00:17:08.472
people have dressed up as "Punk Farm" for Halloween,

00:17:08.472 --> 00:17:10.101
a "Punk Farm" baby room,

00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:14.916
which makes me a little nervous for the child's well-being in the long term.

00:17:14.916 --> 00:17:17.387
And I get the most amazing fan mail,

00:17:17.387 --> 00:17:19.795
and I get the most amazing projects,

00:17:19.795 --> 00:17:23.147
and the biggest moment for me came last Halloween.

00:17:23.147 --> 00:17:25.301
The doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater

00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:29.458
dressed as my character. It was so cool.

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:32.572
Now my grandparents are no longer living,

00:17:32.572 --> 00:17:35.636
so to honor them, I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum

00:17:35.636 --> 00:17:38.911
for kids who are in difficult situations

00:17:38.911 --> 00:17:41.619
but whose caretakers can't afford the classes.

00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:44.210
And it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing,

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.306
and you know who was there to celebrate? Mrs. Alisch.

00:17:47.306 --> 00:17:48.993
I said, "Mrs. Alisch, how are you?"

00:17:48.993 --> 00:17:52.099
And she responded with, "I'm here." (Laughter)

00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:58.713
That's true. You are alive, and that's pretty good right now.

00:17:58.713 --> 00:18:00.389
So the biggest moment for me, though,

00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:02.375
my most important job now is I am a dad myself,

00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:04.723
and I have two beautiful daughters,

00:18:04.723 --> 00:18:07.514
and my goal is to surround them by inspiration,

00:18:07.514 --> 00:18:10.636
by the books that are in every single room of our house

00:18:10.636 --> 00:18:13.226
to the murals I painted in their rooms

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:16.865
to the moments for creativity where you find, in quiet times,

00:18:16.865 --> 00:18:20.350
by making faces on the patio

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.674
to letting her sit in the very desk

00:18:22.674 --> 00:18:25.362
that I've sat in for the past 20 years.

00:18:25.362 --> 00:18:27.638
Thank you. (Applause)
