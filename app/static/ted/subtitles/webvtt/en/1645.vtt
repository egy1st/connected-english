00:00:01.577 --> 00:00:03.573
I'd like to share with you

00:00:03.573 --> 00:00:07.410
the story of one of my patients called Celine.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.563
Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:13.635
of Cameroon in west Central Africa.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:17.322
Six years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis,

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:20.323
she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial

00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:23.394
which was running in her health district at the time.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:27.098
When I first met Celine, a little over a year ago,

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:28.782
she had gone for 18 months

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.069
without any antiretroviral therapy,

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.806
and she was very ill.

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:36.204
She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:37.755
when the trial ended

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.466
because she had no money for the bus fare

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:44.194
and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:45.938
Now during the clinical trial,

00:00:45.938 --> 00:00:50.323
she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge,

00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:52.354
and her transportation costs

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:54.961
had been covered by the research funds.

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.315
All of these ended once the trial was completed,

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:01.307
leaving Celine with no alternatives.

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:03.983
She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs

00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:06.010
she'd received during the trial,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.767
or even what the trial had been about.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:12.316
I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:16.723
because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:18.992
Yet what puzzled me most

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:22.099
was Celine had given her informed consent

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.931
to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:28.401
the implications of being a participant

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:32.810
or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.205
Now, I have shared this story with you as an example

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:39.134
of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:41.593
when it is poorly conducted.

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:45.458
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:49.147
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.

00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:51.954
Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:57.489
on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.275
But it would have done so at a price

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:03.222
to hundreds of patients who, like Celine,

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.466
were left to their own devices

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.537
once the research had been completed.

00:02:08.537 --> 00:02:11.875
I do not stand here today to suggest in any way

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:13.888
that conducting HIV clinical trials

00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:16.103
in developing countries is bad.

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:20.470
On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.768
and are much needed to address the burden

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:25.239
of disease in developing countries.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.098
However, the inequalities that exist between

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:31.800
richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.957
pose a real risk for exploitation,

00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:38.842
especially in the context of externally-funded research.

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:41.448
Sadly enough, the fact remains that

00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:45.432
a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:48.008
could never be authorized in the richer countries

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.256
which fund the research.

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:52.503
I'm sure you must be asking yourselves

00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:54.419
what makes developing countries,

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.963
especially those in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:02:56.963 --> 00:03:00.530
so attractive for these HIV clinical trials?

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.802
Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:06.918
valid and widely applicable results,

00:03:06.918 --> 00:03:10.918
they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants

00:03:10.918 --> 00:03:13.561
and preferably on a population

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:17.342
with a high incidence of new HIV infections.

00:03:17.342 --> 00:03:20.813
Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description,

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:24.015
with 22 million people living with HIV,

00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:27.655
an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:30.136
who are infected worldwide.

00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:32.566
Also, research within the continent

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:36.678
is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty,

00:03:36.678 --> 00:03:40.529
endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.318
A clinical trial that is considered to be

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:46.068
potentially beneficial to the population

00:03:46.068 --> 00:03:48.375
is more likely to be authorized,

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:51.175
and in the absence of good health care systems,

00:03:51.175 --> 00:03:54.129
almost any offer of medical assistance

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.047
is accepted as better than nothing.

00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:59.633
Even more problematic reasons include

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:01.920
lower risk of litigation,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.387
less rigorous ethical reviews,

00:04:04.387 --> 00:04:06.943
and populations that are willing to participate

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:11.607
in almost any study that hints at a cure.

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:15.232
As funding for HIV research

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:17.488
increases in developing countries

00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:21.495
and ethical review in richer countries become more strict,

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.580
you can see why this context becomes

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.141
very, very attractive.

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.821
The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers

00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.305
to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable

00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:37.584
but on many levels ethically questionable.

00:04:37.584 --> 00:04:41.023
How then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure,

00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:43.343
we do not take an unfair advantage

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:46.847
of those who are already most affected by the pandemic?

00:04:46.847 --> 00:04:50.703
I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on

00:04:50.703 --> 00:04:54.278
in order to improve the way in which things are done.

00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:57.105
The first of these is informed consent.

00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:59.473
Now, in order for a clinical trial to be

00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:03.154
considered ethically acceptable,

00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:05.978
participants must be given the relevant information

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:08.413
in a way in which they can understand,

00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:12.630
and must freely consent to participate in the trial.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.308
This is especially important in developing countries,

00:05:15.308 --> 00:05:18.210
where a lot of participants consent to research

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.898
because they believe it is the only way in which

00:05:20.898 --> 00:05:24.468
they can receive medical care or other benefits.

00:05:24.468 --> 00:05:27.435
Consent procedures that are used in richer countries

00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:30.237
are often inappropriate or ineffective

00:05:30.237 --> 00:05:32.590
in a lot of developing countries.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.563
For example, it is counterintuitive to have

00:05:35.563 --> 00:05:38.562
an illiterate study participant, like Celine,

00:05:38.562 --> 00:05:41.889
sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read,

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.996
let alone understand.

00:05:43.996 --> 00:05:47.076
Local communities need to be more involved

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:50.349
in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:55.050
in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.866
The information in these trials

00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:59.817
needs to be given to the potential participants

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:04.245
in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.

00:06:04.245 --> 00:06:07.066
The second point I would like for you to consider

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:09.504
is the standard of care that is provided

00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:12.450
to participants within any clinical trial.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.147
Now, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.

00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:19.128
Should the control group in the clinical trial

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:22.401
be given the best current treatment which is available

00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:24.481
anywhere in the world?

00:06:24.481 --> 00:06:27.449
Or should they be given an alternative standard of care,

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.337
such as the best current treatment available

00:06:30.337 --> 00:06:33.649
in the country in which the research is being conducted?

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:36.989
Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:40.065
which may not be affordable or accessible

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:44.035
to the study participants once the research has been completed?

00:06:44.035 --> 00:06:47.776
Now, in a situation where the best current treatment

00:06:47.776 --> 00:06:50.415
is inexpensive and simple to deliver,

00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:52.443
the answer is straightforward.

00:06:52.443 --> 00:06:55.593
However, the best current treatment available

00:06:55.593 --> 00:06:58.480
anywhere in the world is often very difficult

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.167
to provide in developing countries.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:04.719
It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:07.496
of the standard of care which is to be provided

00:07:07.496 --> 00:07:09.977
to participants in any clinical trial,

00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:15.425
and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study

00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:18.922
and most beneficial for the participants within the study.

00:07:18.922 --> 00:07:22.173
That brings us to the third point I want you think about:

00:07:22.173 --> 00:07:25.024
the ethical review of research.

00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:28.823
An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:32.951
of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:35.064
within any clinical trial.

00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:37.976
Unfortunately, this is often lacking

00:07:37.976 --> 00:07:41.504
or inefficient in a lot of developing countries.

00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:45.867
Local governments need to set up effective systems

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:48.744
for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials

00:07:48.744 --> 00:07:52.661
which are authorized in different developing countries,

00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:54.935
and they need to do this by setting up

00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:57.445
ethical review committees that are independent

00:07:57.445 --> 00:08:00.830
of the government and research sponsors.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.240
Public accountability needs to be promoted

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.473
through transparency and independent review

00:08:06.473 --> 00:08:09.512
by nongovernmental and international organizations

00:08:09.512 --> 00:08:11.083
as appropriate.

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:14.593
The final point I would like for you to consider tonight

00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:17.816
is what happens to participants in the clinical trial

00:08:17.816 --> 00:08:20.591
once the research has been completed.

00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:24.065
I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin

00:08:24.065 --> 00:08:26.577
in the first place without a clear plan

00:08:26.577 --> 00:08:28.656
for what would happen to the participants

00:08:28.656 --> 00:08:31.096
once the trial has ended.

00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:36.224
Now, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:39.208
an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:40.940
during a clinical trial

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.552
is accessible to the participants of the trial

00:08:44.552 --> 00:08:47.100
once the trial has been completed.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.624
In addition, they should be able to consider the possibility

00:08:50.624 --> 00:08:54.225
of introducing and maintaining effective treatments

00:08:54.225 --> 00:08:58.066
in the wider community once the trial ends.

00:08:58.066 --> 00:09:01.489
If, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible,

00:09:01.489 --> 00:09:04.456
then I think they should have to ethically justify

00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:08.483
why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.

00:09:08.483 --> 00:09:10.799
Now, fortunately for Celine,

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:13.474
our meeting did not end in my office.

00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:17.848
I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:19.236
closer to her home,

00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:23.010
and with a support group to help her cope.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.344
Her story has a positive ending,

00:09:25.344 --> 00:09:29.047
but there are thousands of others in similar situations

00:09:29.047 --> 00:09:31.344
who are much less fortunate.

00:09:31.344 --> 00:09:33.768
Although she may not know this,

00:09:33.768 --> 00:09:37.633
my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way

00:09:37.633 --> 00:09:41.904
in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries,

00:09:41.904 --> 00:09:45.624
and made me even more determined to be part of the movement

00:09:45.624 --> 00:09:48.481
to change the way in which things are done.

00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.849
I believe that every single person

00:09:50.849 --> 00:09:55.224
listening to me tonight can be part of that change.

00:09:55.224 --> 00:09:57.821
If you are a researcher, I hold you

00:09:57.821 --> 00:10:00.391
to a higher standard of moral conscience,

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:02.818
to remain ethical in your research,

00:10:02.818 --> 00:10:06.306
and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers.

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:09.984
If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company,

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:13.014
I challenge you to hold your employers

00:10:13.014 --> 00:10:16.189
to fund research that is ethically sound.

00:10:16.189 --> 00:10:19.375
If you come from a developing country like myself,

00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:22.447
I urge you to hold your government

00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:25.063
to a more thorough review of the clinical trials

00:10:25.063 --> 00:10:27.976
which are authorized in your country.

00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:31.644
Yes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV,

00:10:31.644 --> 00:10:34.296
to find an effective vaccine for malaria,

00:10:34.296 --> 00:10:38.138
to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.,

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.713
but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly

00:10:41.713 --> 00:10:45.768
and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials

00:10:45.768 --> 00:10:47.994
to do this in a humane way.

00:10:47.994 --> 00:10:50.321
Thank you.
