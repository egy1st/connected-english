00:00:01.787 --> 00:00:04.780
I was sitting with my girls,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.293
and Joy said,

00:00:06.293 --> 00:00:10.271
"Dang, I wish he'd get off my back.

00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:14.127
My daddy, he calls me all the time."

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:17.393
"Lucky for you he calls at all," said Jasmine.

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:21.053
"I haven't heard from my dad in years."

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:25.285
At this moment, I knew the girls needed a way

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:27.862
to connect with their fathers.

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:31.625
At Camp Diva, my non-profit organization,

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:35.162
we have these types of conversations all the time

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:38.354
as a way to help girls of African descent

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:41.936
prepare for their passage into womanhood.

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:45.477
These girls just needed

00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:49.318
a way to invite their fathers into their lives

00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:52.015
on their own terms.

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:53.468
So I asked the girls,

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:56.604
"How can we help other girls

00:00:56.604 --> 00:01:00.894
develop healthy relationships with their fathers?"

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:05.397
"Let's have a dance," one girl shouted,

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:09.730
and all the girls quickly backed her up.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.636
They started dreaming about the decorations,

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:16.050
invitations, the dresses they were going to wear,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.196
and what their fathers could and could not wear. (Laughter)

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:24.767
It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes,

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:28.837
but even if I could have slowed down those girls,

00:01:28.837 --> 00:01:30.177
I wouldn't have,

00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:32.258
because one thing that I have learned

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:35.336
from over a decade of working with girls

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:38.856
is that they already know what they need.

00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:43.533
The wisdom lives inside of them.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.181
As long as they have infrastructure,

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:48.597
mentorship and resources,

00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:52.015
they can build what they need,

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:57.449
not only to survive, but to thrive.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:01.673
So we had a dance,

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:06.213
and girls and their fathers came in multitudes.

00:02:06.213 --> 00:02:09.188
They were dressed to the nines.

00:02:09.188 --> 00:02:11.431
They acted sweet.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:15.117
(Laughter)

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:16.967
They acted silly.

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:20.188
They really enjoyed each other's company.

00:02:20.188 --> 00:02:23.029
It was a huge success.

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:28.240
And the girls decided to make it an annual event.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.832
So as the seasons changed,

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:33.552
and it was time to plan the dance again,

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:36.659
one girl named Brianna spoke up,

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.849
and she said,

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.595
"My dad can't come to the dance,

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:45.832
and this whole thing is making me sad."

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.840
"Why not?" the girls asked.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.520
"Because he's in jail," she bravely admitted.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.454
"Well, can he just get out for a day?" one of the girls asked. (Laughter)

00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:01.632
"And come in shackles?

00:03:01.632 --> 00:03:05.977
That's worse than not having him here at all."

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:10.395
At this moment, I saw an opportunity

00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:13.321
for the girls to rise to the occasion

00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:16.085
and to become their own heroes.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:20.758
So I asked, "What do you think we should do about this?

00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:26.008
We want every girl to experience the dance, right?"

00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:27.671
So the girls thought for a moment,

00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.980
and one girl suggested,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.286
"Why don't we just take the dance in the jail?"

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:38.102
Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that,

00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:40.896
and said, "Are you crazy?

00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:43.904
Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls,

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:46.368
dressed up — " (Laughter)

00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:51.955
" — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits?"

00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:55.303
Because that's what they called them.

00:03:55.303 --> 00:03:59.461
I said, "Girls, well, well,

00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:03.464
you never know unless you ask."

00:04:03.464 --> 00:04:07.904
So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff,

00:04:07.904 --> 00:04:11.723
signed collectively by each girl,

00:04:11.723 --> 00:04:17.129
and I would have to say, he is a very special sheriff.

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:22.062
He contacted me immediately and said,

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:28.016
whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside,

00:04:28.016 --> 00:04:31.188
his doors are always open.

00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.513
Because one thing he did know,

00:04:33.513 --> 00:04:36.840
that when fathers are connected to their children,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.803
it is less likely that they will return.

00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:43.884
So,

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:49.738
16 inmates and 18 girls were invited.

00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:53.387
The girls were dressed in their Sunday best,

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:58.416
and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits

00:04:58.416 --> 00:05:02.920
for shirts and ties.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.291
They hugged.

00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:10.042
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:13.767
They laughed together.

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:18.175
It was beautiful.

00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:22.416
The fathers and daughters even experienced

00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:26.491
an opportunity to have a physical connection,

00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:29.220
something that a lot of them didn't even have

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.452
for a while.

00:05:30.452 --> 00:05:34.863
Fathers were in a space where they were able to

00:05:34.863 --> 00:05:37.576
make their daughter's plate,

00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:43.825
and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance.

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:47.502
Even the guards cried.

00:05:47.502 --> 00:05:50.222
But after the dance,

00:05:50.222 --> 00:05:55.782
we all realized that Dad still would be in jail.

00:05:55.782 --> 00:05:58.875
So we needed to create something

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:00.633
that they could take with them.

00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:03.248
So we brought in Flip cams,

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:05.989
and we had them look at the Flip cams

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:07.717
and just interview each other --

00:06:07.717 --> 00:06:11.431
their messages, their thoughts.

00:06:11.431 --> 00:06:14.614
This was going to be used as a touchstone

00:06:14.614 --> 00:06:17.030
so when they started to miss each other

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.330
and feel disconnected,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.694
they could reconnect through this image.

00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:28.076
I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:29.396
with that camera and said,

00:06:29.396 --> 00:06:36.106
"Daddy, when you look at me, what do you see?"

00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:40.194
Because our daddies are our mirrors

00:06:40.194 --> 00:06:42.616
that we reflect back on

00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:47.386
when we decide about what type of man we deserve,

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:50.977
and how they see us for the rest of our lives.

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:54.522
I know that very well,

00:06:54.522 --> 00:06:56.923
because I was one of the lucky girls.

00:06:56.923 --> 00:06:59.182
I have had

00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:08.805
my father in my life always.

00:07:08.805 --> 00:07:10.685
He's even here today.

00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:19.722
(Applause)

00:07:19.722 --> 00:07:23.700
And that is why it is extremely special

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.944
for me to make sure that these girls

00:07:26.944 --> 00:07:29.474
are connected to their fathers,

00:07:29.474 --> 00:07:32.383
especially those who are separated

00:07:32.383 --> 00:07:37.269
because of barbed wires and metal doors.

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:40.362
We have just created a form

00:07:40.362 --> 00:07:43.745
for girls who have heavy questions on their heart

00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:48.237
to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions

00:07:48.237 --> 00:07:53.004
and given the fathers the freedom to answer.

00:07:53.004 --> 00:07:56.349
Because we know that the fathers

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:59.597
are even leaving with this one thought:

00:07:59.597 --> 00:08:04.966
What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world?

00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:08.383
Because a father is locked in

00:08:08.383 --> 00:08:11.433
does not mean he should be locked out

00:08:11.433 --> 00:08:13.984
of his daughter's life.

00:08:13.984 --> 00:08:25.737
(Applause)
