WEBVTT

00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:02.926
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.979
and for the last little while,
I've been a model.

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.344
Actually, for 10 years.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.146
And I feel like

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.970
there's an uncomfortable tension
in the room right now

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:20.017
because I should not have worn this dress.

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.799
(Laughter)

00:00:21.823 --> 00:00:24.297
So luckily, I brought an outfit change.

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:27.946
This is the first outfit change
on the TED stage,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.992
so you guys are pretty lucky
to witness it, I think.

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:33.933
If some of the women were
really horrified when I came out,

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:37.100
you don't have to tell me now,
but I'll find out later on Twitter.

00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:40.344
(Laughter)

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.173
I'd also note that I'm quite privileged

00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:47.251
to be able to transform
what you think of me

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:49.914
in a very brief 10 seconds.

00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:51.683
Not everybody gets to do that.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.234
These heels are very uncomfortable,
so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.760
The worst part is putting
this sweater over my head,

00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:03.833
because that's when
you'll all laugh at me,

00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:05.965
so don't do anything
while it's over my head.

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:08.762
All right.

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:13.690
So, why did I do that?

00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:14.920
That was awkward.

00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:16.872
(Laughter)

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:18.007
Well --

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.397
(Laughter)

00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:24.112
Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:28.064
Image is powerful,

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.489
but also, image is superficial.

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:37.455
I just totally transformed
what you thought of me, in six seconds.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.294
And in this picture,

00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:41.865
I had actually never had
a boyfriend in real life.

00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:44.436
I was totally uncomfortable,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.938
and the photographer
was telling me to arch my back

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:48.657
and put my hand in that guy's hair.

00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:52.989
And of course, barring surgery,

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:56.430
or the fake tan that I got
two days ago for work,

00:01:56.454 --> 00:02:00.191
there's very little that we can do
to transform how we look,

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.647
and how we look, though it is
superficial and immutable,

00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:05.981
has a huge impact on our lives.

00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:12.638
So today, for me, being
fearless means being honest.

00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:15.523
And I am on this stage
because I am a model.

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:19.250
I am on this stage because
I am a pretty, white woman,

00:02:19.274 --> 00:02:22.015
and in my industry,
we call that a sexy girl.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.886
I'm going to answer the questions
that people always ask me,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.208
but with an honest twist.

00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:29.110
So the first question is,
how do you become a model?

00:02:29.134 --> 00:02:31.143
I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted,"

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:32.325
but that means nothing.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.430
The real way that I became a model

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:38.917
is I won a genetic lottery,
and I am the recipient of a legacy,

00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.037
and maybe you're wondering
what is a legacy.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:43.783
Well, for the past few centuries

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:49.301
we have defined beauty
not just as health and youth

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:53.087
and symmetry that we're biologically
programmed to admire,

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:56.623
but also as tall, slender figures,

00:02:56.647 --> 00:02:59.870
and femininity and white skin.

00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:01.942
And this is a legacy
that was built for me,

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:04.416
and it's a legacy
that I've been cashing out on.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.470
And I know there are
people in the audience

00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:08.186
who are skeptical at this point,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.687
and maybe there are
some fashionistas who are like,

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.230
"Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:16.397
And first, I commend you on your model
knowledge. Very impressive.

00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:18.053
(Laughter)

00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:21.606
But unfortunately,
I have to inform you that in 2007,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.116
a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.742
counted all the models on the runway,
every single one that was hired,

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:30.870
and of the 677 models that were hired,

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:34.387
only 27, or less than four percent,
were non-white.

00:03:35.637 --> 00:03:37.570
The next question people always ask is,

00:03:37.594 --> 00:03:39.219
"Can I be a model when I grow up?"

00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:42.877
And the first answer is, "I don't know,
they don't put me in charge of that."

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:44.294
But the second answer,

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:47.072
and what I really want to say
to these little girls is,

00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:49.086
"Why? You know? You can be anything.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.356
You could be the President
of the United States,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.157
or the inventor of the next Internet,

00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:55.139
or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,

00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:57.830
which would be awesome,
because you'd be the first one."

00:03:57.854 --> 00:04:00.016
(Laughter)

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.374
If, after this amazing list,
they still are like,

00:04:02.398 --> 00:04:04.303
"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.941
well, then I say, "Be my boss."

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:07.831
Because I'm not in charge of anything,

00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:10.382
and you could be the editor in chief
of American Vogue

00:04:10.406 --> 00:04:12.542
or the CEO of H&amp;M,
or the next Steven Meisel.

00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.412
Saying that you want to be
a model when you grow up

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:18.770
is akin to saying that you want to win
the Powerball when you grow up.

00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:22.214
It's out of your control,
and it's awesome,

00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:23.640
and it's not a career path.

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:28.283
I will demonstrate for you now
10 years of accumulated model knowledge,

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:30.212
because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.938
it can just be distilled right now.

00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:36.022
So, if the photographer is right there,

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:38.103
the light is right there, like a nice HMI,

00:04:38.127 --> 00:04:40.274
and the client says,
"We want a walking shot,"

00:04:40.298 --> 00:04:43.982
this leg goes first, nice and long,
this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.924
the head is at three quarters,
and you just go back and forth,

00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:49.948
just do that, and then you look back
at your imaginary friends,

00:04:49.972 --> 00:04:51.691
300, 400, 500 times.

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:53.395
(Laughter)

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.206
It will look something like this.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.417
(Laughter)

00:04:57.441 --> 00:05:00.369
Hopefully less awkward
than that one in the middle.

00:05:00.393 --> 00:05:02.944
That was -- I don't know
what happened there.

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:05.075
Unfortunately,
after you've gone to school,

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.429
and you have a résumé
and you've done a few jobs,

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:08.945
you can't say anything anymore,

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.016
so if you say you want to be
the President of the United States,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.446
but your résumé reads,
"Underwear Model: 10 years,"

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.876
people give you a funny look.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.488
The next question is,
"Do they retouch all the photos?"

00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:20.893
And yeah, they pretty much
retouch all the photos,

00:05:20.917 --> 00:05:23.526
but that is only a small component
of what's happening.

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:26.724
This picture is the very first
picture that I ever took,

00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:29.557
and it's also the very first time
that I had worn a bikini,

00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:31.361
and I didn't even have my period yet.

00:05:31.385 --> 00:05:34.512
I know we're getting personal,
but I was a young girl.

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:37.786
This is what I looked like with my grandma
just a few months earlier.

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:41.192
Here's me on the same day as this shoot.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.560
My friend got to come.

00:05:42.584 --> 00:05:45.832
Here's me at a slumber party
a few days before I shot French Vogue.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:49.293
Here's me on the soccer team
and in V Magazine.

00:05:50.787 --> 00:05:52.223
And here's me today.

00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:54.283
And I hope what you're seeing

00:05:54.307 --> 00:05:56.481
is that these pictures
are not pictures of me.

00:05:56.505 --> 00:05:57.919
They are constructions,

00:05:57.943 --> 00:06:00.847
and they are constructions
by a group of professionals,

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:03.967
by hairstylists and makeup artists
and photographers and stylists

00:06:03.991 --> 00:06:07.183
and all of their assistants
and pre-production and post-production,

00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:08.215
and they build this.

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:09.309
That's not me.

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:11.730
Okay, so the next question
people always ask me is,

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:13.080
"Do you get free stuff?"

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:14.150
(Laughter)

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:17.421
I do have too many 8-inch heels
which I never get to wear,

00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:19.040
except for earlier,

00:06:19.064 --> 00:06:22.525
but the free stuff that I get
is the free stuff that I get in real life,

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.779
and that's what we don't like
to talk about.

00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:26.070
I grew up in Cambridge,

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.666
and one time I went into a store
and I forgot my money

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.798
and they gave me the dress for free.

00:06:30.822 --> 00:06:33.318
When I was a teenager,
I was driving with my friend

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:36.009
who was an awful driver
and she ran a red and of course,

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:37.222
we got pulled over,

00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:41.053
and all it took was a "Sorry, officer,"
and we were on our way.

00:06:42.363 --> 00:06:45.545
And I got these free things
because of how I look,

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.364
not who I am, and there are
people paying a cost

00:06:48.388 --> 00:06:50.606
for how they look and not who they are.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.250
I live in New York, and last year,

00:06:52.274 --> 00:06:56.053
of the 140,000 teenagers
that were stopped and frisked,

00:06:56.077 --> 00:07:00.092
86% of them were black and Latino,
and most of them were young men.

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:04.578
And there are only 177,000
young black and Latino men in New York,

00:07:04.602 --> 00:07:07.317
so for them, it's not a question
of, "Will I get stopped?"

00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.399
but "How many times will I get stopped?
When will I get stopped?"

00:07:10.423 --> 00:07:11.995
When I was researching this talk,

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:15.174
I found out that of the 13-year-old girls
in the United States,

00:07:15.198 --> 00:07:17.861
53% don't like their bodies,

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:20.854
and that number goes to 78%
by the time that they're 17.

00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:24.879
So, the last question people ask me is,

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.503
"What is it like to be a model?"

00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:28.910
And I think the answer
that they're looking for is,

00:07:28.934 --> 00:07:31.854
"If you are a little bit skinnier
and you have shinier hair,

00:07:31.878 --> 00:07:34.651
you will be so happy and fabulous."

00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:36.210
And when we're backstage,

00:07:36.234 --> 00:07:38.757
we give an answer
that maybe makes it seem like that.

00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:42.261
We say, "It's really amazing to travel,
and it's amazing to get to work

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:44.885
with creative, inspired,
passionate people."

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:48.052
And those things are true,
but they're only one half of the story,

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:50.654
because the thing
that we never say on camera,

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:52.750
that I have never said on camera, is,

00:07:52.774 --> 00:07:54.146
"I am insecure."

00:07:55.158 --> 00:07:59.306
And I'm insecure because I have to think
about what I look like every day.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.572
And if you ever are wondering,

00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:07.526
"If I have thinner thighs
and shinier hair, will I be happier?"

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.455
you just need to meet a group of models,

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:13.405
because they have the thinnest thighs,
the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,

00:08:13.429 --> 00:08:16.872
and they're the most physically
insecure women probably on the planet.

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.278
When I was writing this talk,

00:08:18.302 --> 00:08:21.271
I found it very difficult
to strike an honest balance,

00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:22.729
because on the one hand,

00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:25.165
I felt very uncomfortable
to come out here and say,

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:28.784
"Look I've received all these benefits
from a deck stacked in my favor,"

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:31.999
and it also felt really uncomfortable
to follow that up with,

00:08:32.023 --> 00:08:34.387
"and it doesn't always make me happy."

00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:40.286
But mostly it was difficult to unpack
a legacy of gender and racial oppression

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.418
when I am one
of the biggest beneficiaries.

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:46.279
But I'm also happy
and honored to be up here

00:08:46.303 --> 00:08:49.515
and I think that it's great
that I got to come

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:53.212
before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed
and I'd had more agency in my career,

00:08:53.236 --> 00:08:56.710
because maybe then I wouldn't tell
the story of how I got my first job,

00:08:56.734 --> 00:08:59.607
or maybe I wouldn't tell the story
of how I paid for college,

00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:01.304
which seems so important right now.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.972
If there's a takeaway to this talk,

00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:07.599
I hope it's that we all feel
more comfortable acknowledging

00:09:07.623 --> 00:09:11.566
the power of image
in our perceived successes

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.466
and our perceived failures.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.842
Thank you.

00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:16.970
(Applause)
