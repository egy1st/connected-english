00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.787
So, before I became a dermatologist,

00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:05.339
I started in general medicine,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.555
as most dermatologists do in Britain.

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:09.603
At the end of that time, I went off to Australia,

00:00:09.603 --> 00:00:11.499
about 20 years ago.

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.620
What you learn when you go to Australia

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.346
is the Australians are very competitive.

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:18.403
And they are not magnanimous in victory.

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.467
And that happened a lot:

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:22.899
"You pommies, you can't play cricket, rugby."

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.017
I could accept that.

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:27.347
But moving into work --

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:29.885
and we have each week what's called a journal club,

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:32.343
when you'd sit down with the other doctors

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:34.463
and you'd study a scientific paper

00:00:34.463 --> 00:00:36.304
in relation to medicine.

00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:39.053
And after week one, it was about cardiovascular mortality,

00:00:39.053 --> 00:00:42.733
a dry subject -- how many people die of heart disease,

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.117
what the rates are.

00:00:44.117 --> 00:00:46.093
And they were competitive about this:

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:49.189
"You pommies, your rates of heart disease are shocking."

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:51.085
And of course, they were right.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:55.066
Australians have about a third less heart disease than we do --

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.857
less deaths from heart attacks, heart failure, less strokes --

00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:00.917
they're generally a healthier bunch.

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:02.608
And of course they said this was because of

00:01:02.608 --> 00:01:04.672
their fine moral standing, their exercise,

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:08.740
because they're Australians and we're weedy pommies, and so on.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.771
But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain.

00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:17.299
Within Britain, there is a gradient of health --

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.235
and this is what's called standardized mortality,

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:21.323
basically your chances of dying.

00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:24.667
This is looking at data from the paper about 20 years ago,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.142
but it's true today.

00:01:26.142 --> 00:01:29.232
Comparing your rates of dying 50 degrees north --

00:01:29.232 --> 00:01:31.499
that's the South, that's London and places --

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:34.851
by latitude, and 55 degrees --

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:37.235
the bad news is that's here, Glasgow.

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:40.083
I'm from Edinburgh. Worse news, that's even Edinburgh.

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:44.207
(Laughter)

00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:47.513
So what accounts for this horrible space here

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:49.717
between us up here in southern Scotland

00:01:49.717 --> 00:01:50.727
and the South?

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:52.145
Now, we know about smoking,

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.847
deep-fried Mars bars, chips -- the Glasgow diet.

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.175
All of these things.

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:58.967
But this graph is after taking into account

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:01.031
all of these known risk factors.

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:04.800
This is after accounting for smoking, social class, diet,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.543
all those other known risk factors.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.767
We are left with this missing space

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:12.627
of increased deaths the further north you go.

00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:15.264
Now, sunlight, of course, comes into this.

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:17.584
And vitamin D has had a great deal of press,

00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:19.586
and a lot of people get concerned about it.

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:23.578
And we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount.

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:25.810
My grandmother grew up in Glasgow,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.396
back in the 1920s and '30s when rickets was a real problem

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:31.594
and cod liver oil was brought in.

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:35.538
And that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city.

00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:39.458
And I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:42.482
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil.

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:47.264
But an association: The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are,

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:50.591
the less heart disease they have, the less cancer.

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:54.433
There seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:56.727
And it is, to prevent rickets and so on.

00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:59.447
But if you give people vitamin D supplements,

00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:02.879
you don't change that high rate of heart disease.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.607
And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great.

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:11.464
So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town.

00:03:11.464 --> 00:03:14.775
It's not the only reason preventing heart disease.

00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:19.144
High vitamin D levels, I think, are a marker for sunlight exposure,

00:03:19.144 --> 00:03:22.359
and sunlight exposure, in methods I'm going to show,

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.798
is good for heart disease.

00:03:24.798 --> 00:03:26.759
Anyway, I came back from Australia,

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.255
and despite the obvious risks to my health, I moved to Aberdeen.

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:32.807
(Laughter)

00:03:32.807 --> 00:03:35.958
Now, in Aberdeen, I started my dermatology training.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.903
But I also became interested in research,

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:41.078
and in particular I became interested in this substance, nitric oxide.

00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:42.454
Now these three guys up here,

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:44.024
Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad,

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:47.286
won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:49.429
And they were the first people to describe

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.774
this new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.799
What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels,

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.670
so it lowers your blood pressure.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.837
It also dilates the coronary arteries, so it stops angina.

00:04:01.837 --> 00:04:03.223
And what was remarkable about it

00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:07.294
was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body,

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:10.464
we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin,

00:04:10.464 --> 00:04:11.934
or nerve transmission.

00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:15.229
Very complex processes with very complex chemicals

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.517
that fit into very complex receptors.

00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:19.878
And here's this incredibly simple molecule,

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:23.216
a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together,

00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:27.846
and yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure,

00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:30.452
for neurotransmission, for many, many things,

00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:33.854
but particularly cardiovascular health.

00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:37.156
And I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly,

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:39.766
that the skin produces nitric oxide.

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:42.663
So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.

00:04:42.663 --> 00:04:44.530
It arises in the skin.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.396
Well, having found that and published that,

00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:48.452
I thought, well, what's it doing?

00:04:48.452 --> 00:04:49.932
How do you have low blood pressure in your skin?

00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:52.023
It's not the heart. What do you do?

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:56.094
So I went off to the States, as many people do if they're going to do research,

00:04:56.094 --> 00:04:59.831
and I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh.

00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.444
And I was interested in these really complex systems.

00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:06.485
We thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death,

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:08.965
and how cells survive, and their resistance to other things.

00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:12.332
And I first off started work in cell culture, growing cells,

00:05:12.332 --> 00:05:14.452
and then I was using knockout mouse models --

00:05:14.452 --> 00:05:16.189
mice that couldn't make the gene.

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.599
We worked out a mechanism, which -- NO was helping cells survive.

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.420
And I then moved back to Edinburgh.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.202
And in Edinburgh, the experimental animal we use is the medical student.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.260
It's a species close to human,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.162
with several advantages over mice:

00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:34.618
They're free, you don't shave them, they feed themselves,

00:05:34.618 --> 00:05:36.738
and nobody pickets your office saying,

00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:39.138
"Save the lab medical student."

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:42.401
So they're really an ideal model.

00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.362
But what we found

00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:48.979
was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice.

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.219
It seemed we couldn't turn off the production

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.299
of nitric oxide in the skin of humans.

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:58.091
We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it,

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:02.475
we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide.

00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:05.739
And the reason for this, it turned out, after two or three years' work,

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:09.787
was that in the skin we have huge stores

00:06:09.787 --> 00:06:12.875
not of nitric oxide, because nitric oxide is a gas,

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:16.027
and it's released -- (Poof!) -- and in a few seconds it's away,

00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:19.251
but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide --

00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.883
nitrate, NO3; nitrite, NO2; nitrosothiols.

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.299
And these are more stable,

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:28.459
and your skin has got really large stores of NO.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:31.284
And we then thought to ourselves, with those big stores,

00:06:31.284 --> 00:06:34.595
I wonder if sunlight might activate those stores

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:36.339
and release them from the skin,

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:39.731
where the stores are about 10 times as big as what's in the circulation.

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:42.571
Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation,

00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:47.811
and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system?

00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:50.339
Well, I'm an experimental dermatologist,

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:51.644
so what we did was we thought

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:55.171
we'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight.

00:06:55.171 --> 00:06:59.251
And so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers

00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:01.949
and we exposed them to ultraviolet light.

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.678
So these are kind of sunlamps.

00:07:03.678 --> 00:07:06.374
Now, what we were careful to do was,

00:07:06.374 --> 00:07:09.334
vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays

00:07:09.334 --> 00:07:13.310
and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.157
So we used ultraviolet A, which doesn't make vitamin D.

00:07:17.157 --> 00:07:19.438
When we put people under a lamp

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:24.514
for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh,

00:07:24.514 --> 00:07:27.054
what we produced was, we produced a rise

00:07:27.054 --> 00:07:29.046
in circulating nitric oxide.

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:31.894
So we put patients with these subjects under the UV,

00:07:31.894 --> 00:07:34.310
and their NO levels do go up,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.446
and their blood pressure goes down.

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:38.823
Not by much, as an individual level,

00:07:38.823 --> 00:07:41.190
but enough at a population level

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.910
to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.334
And when we shone UV at them,

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:50.996
or when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps,

00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:54.258
but didn't actually let the rays hit the skin, this didn't happen.

00:07:54.258 --> 00:07:58.122
So this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin.

00:07:58.122 --> 00:07:59.946
Now, we're still collecting data.

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.394
A few good things here:

00:08:01.394 --> 00:08:04.541
This appeared to be more marked in older people.

00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:06.154
I'm not sure exactly how much.

00:08:06.154 --> 00:08:07.927
One of the subjects here was my mother-in-law,

00:08:07.927 --> 00:08:10.879
and clearly I do not know her age.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:14.311
But certainly in people older than my wife,

00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:17.444
this appears to be a more marked effect.

00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:18.695
And the other thing I should mention

00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:20.751
was there was no change in vitamin D.

00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:22.871
This is separate from vitamin D.

00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:24.407
So vitamin D is good for you -- it stops rickets,

00:08:24.407 --> 00:08:26.647
it prevents calcium metabolism, important stuff.

00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:29.679
But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:32.255
Now, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure

00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:33.807
is your body does everything it can

00:08:33.807 --> 00:08:35.390
to keep your blood pressure at the same place.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.039
If your leg is chopped off and you lose blood,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.944
your body will clamp down, increase the heart rate,

00:08:39.944 --> 00:08:42.168
do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up.

00:08:42.168 --> 00:08:45.144
That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle.

00:08:45.144 --> 00:08:46.951
So what we've next done

00:08:46.951 --> 00:08:50.607
is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation.

00:08:50.607 --> 00:08:52.104
So we've measured -- this is again,

00:08:52.104 --> 00:08:57.432
notice no tail and hairless, this is a medical student.

00:08:57.432 --> 00:09:00.050
In the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.282
by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it.

00:09:03.282 --> 00:09:06.757
And what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation --

00:09:06.757 --> 00:09:08.226
this is the thick line here --

00:09:08.226 --> 00:09:10.626
this is shining UV on the arm so it warms up

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:13.450
but keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.362
There is no change in blood flow, in dilatation of the blood vessels.

00:09:17.362 --> 00:09:19.211
But the active irradiation,

00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:22.563
during the UV and for an hour after it,

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:24.660
there is dilation of the blood vessels.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.260
This is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.636
by which you dilate the coronary arteries also,

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:31.347
to let the blood be supplied with the heart.

00:09:31.347 --> 00:09:35.740
So here, further data that ultraviolet -- that's sunlight --

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.619
has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system.

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:42.962
So we thought we'd just kind of model --

00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:49.211
Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year,

00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:53.235
so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide --

00:09:53.235 --> 00:09:55.491
the nitrates, nitrites, nitrosothiols in the skin --

00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:58.363
cleave to release NO.

00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:02.188
Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.

00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:04.267
So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:08.252
And you can look -- So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead,

00:10:08.252 --> 00:10:10.068
it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.507
In winter or summer, it's the same amount of light.

00:10:12.507 --> 00:10:15.020
If you live up here, in summer

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.676
the sun is coming fairly directly down,

00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:20.983
but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere,

00:10:20.983 --> 00:10:24.204
and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out,

00:10:24.204 --> 00:10:26.556
and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth

00:10:26.556 --> 00:10:28.884
are different from summer to winter.

00:10:28.884 --> 00:10:30.826
So what you can do is you can multiply those data

00:10:30.826 --> 00:10:32.819
by the NO that's released

00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:36.003
and you can calculate how much nitric oxide

00:10:36.003 --> 00:10:39.172
would be released from the skin into the circulation.

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:41.172
Now, if you're on the equator here --

00:10:41.172 --> 00:10:44.599
that's these two lines here, the red line and the purple line --

00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:48.996
the amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve,

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:51.027
it's the area in this space here.

00:10:51.027 --> 00:10:53.724
So if you're on the equator, December or June,

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:56.980
you've got masses of NO being released from the skin.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.444
So Ventura is in southern California.

00:10:59.444 --> 00:11:01.660
In summer, you might as well be at the equator.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.716
It's great. Lots of NO is released.

00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:07.659
Ventura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount.

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:11.620
Edinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good,

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.835
but Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released

00:11:15.835 --> 00:11:19.693
is next to nothing, tiny amounts.

00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:21.498
So what do we think?

00:11:21.498 --> 00:11:23.090
We're still working at this story,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.002
we're still developing it, we're still expanding it.

00:11:25.002 --> 00:11:26.650
We think it's very important.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.243
We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain,

00:11:30.243 --> 00:11:31.874
It's of relevance to us.

00:11:31.874 --> 00:11:33.562
We think that the skin --

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:36.450
well, we know that the skin has got very large stores

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.674
of nitric oxide as these various other forms.

00:11:38.674 --> 00:11:40.547
We suspect a lot of these come from diet,

00:11:40.547 --> 00:11:42.818
green leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce

00:11:42.818 --> 00:11:46.138
has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:48.282
We think they're then stored in the skin,

00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:50.682
and we think the sunlight releases this

00:11:50.682 --> 00:11:53.315
where it has generally beneficial effects.

00:11:53.315 --> 00:11:55.794
And this is ongoing work, but dermatologists --

00:11:55.794 --> 00:11:57.514
I mean, I'm a dermatologist.

00:11:57.514 --> 00:12:00.042
My day job is saying to people, "You've got skin cancer,

00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:01.922
it's caused by sunlight, don't go in the sun."

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:04.658
I actually think a far more important message

00:12:04.658 --> 00:12:08.082
is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight.

00:12:08.082 --> 00:12:13.835
Yes, sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer,

00:12:13.835 --> 00:12:16.706
but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher

00:12:16.706 --> 00:12:18.658
than deaths from skin cancer.

00:12:18.658 --> 00:12:21.307
And I think that we need to be more aware of,

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:23.386
and we need to find the risk-benefit ratio.

00:12:23.386 --> 00:12:24.858
How much sunlight is safe,

00:12:24.858 --> 00:12:29.058
and how can we finesse this best for our general health?

00:12:29.058 --> 00:12:31.238
So, thank you very much indeed.

00:12:31.238 --> 00:12:38.135
