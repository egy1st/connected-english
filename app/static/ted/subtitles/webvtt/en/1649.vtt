00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:02.415
What I want to do this afternoon

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:05.280
is something a little different than what's scheduled.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.226
Foreign policy, you can figure that out

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:10.260
by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.094
but — (Laughter) —

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:15.656
I want to talk about young people and structure,

00:00:15.656 --> 00:00:17.623
young people and structure.

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:19.871
This was last Wednesday afternoon

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.375
at a school in Brooklyn, New York,

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:25.309
at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.146
And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:31.613
They were around me in three directions.

00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:34.409
You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.254
You'll notice that the building is rather austere.

00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:40.385
It's an old New York school building, nothing fancy.

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.916
They still have old blackboards and whatnot.

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:45.507
And there are about 300 kids in this school,

00:00:45.507 --> 00:00:48.159
and the school's been going now for four years,

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.113
and they're about to graduate their first class.

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.184
Twenty-two people are graduating,

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:55.427
and all 22 are going to college.

00:00:55.427 --> 00:00:58.167
They all come from homes where there is, for the most part,

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.690
just one person in the home,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.596
usually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.083
and they come here for their education

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:07.496
and for their structure.

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:10.304
Now I had this picture taken, and it was put up

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.797
on my Facebook page last week,

00:01:12.797 --> 00:01:14.431
and somebody wrote in,

00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:19.417
"Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?"

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:23.788
And then they said, "But he looks good." (Laughter)

00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:26.498
He does look good, because kids need structure,

00:01:26.498 --> 00:01:30.004
and the trick I play in all of my school appearances

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.903
is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids,

00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:35.087
I then invite them to ask questions,

00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:36.952
and when they raise their hands, I say, "Come up,"

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:39.291
and I make them come up and stand in front of me.

00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:41.405
I make them stand at attention like a soldier.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.187
Put your arms straight down at your side,

00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:46.639
look up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead,

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.074
and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear.

00:01:50.074 --> 00:01:53.331
No slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff.

00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:54.702
(Laughter)

00:01:54.702 --> 00:01:57.967
And this young man, his name is -- his last name Cruz --

00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:01.804
he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral.

00:02:01.804 --> 00:02:03.991
(Laughter)

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.734
So people think I'm being unkind to this kid.

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:08.378
No, we're having a little fun.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.792
And the thing about it, I've done this for years,

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:13.952
the younger they are, the more fun it is.

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:16.892
When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group,

00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:18.771
I have to figure out how to keep them quiet.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.774
You know that they'll always start yakking.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.379
And so I play a little game with them

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.951
before I make them stand at attention.

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:26.224
I say, "Now listen. In the army,

00:02:26.224 --> 00:02:28.552
when we want you to pay attention,

00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:31.737
we have a command. It's called 'at ease.'

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:35.311
It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up.

00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:36.449
Do you understand?"

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:41.314
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.""Let's practice. Everybody start chatting."

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:44.611
And I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, "At ease!"

00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.116
"Huh!" (Laughter)

00:02:48.116 --> 00:02:50.638
"Yes, General. Yes, General."

00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:53.041
Try it with your kids. See if it works. (Laughter)

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:56.094
I don't think so.

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:59.108
But anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously

00:02:59.108 --> 00:03:00.830
from my military experience.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.259
Because for the majority of my adult life,

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.319
I worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.764
And we would bring them into the army,

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:13.213
and the first thing we would do is to put them

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:17.300
in an environment of structure, put them in ranks,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.723
make them all wear the same clothes,

00:03:18.723 --> 00:03:21.217
cut all their hair off so they look alike,

00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:23.421
make sure that they are standing in ranks.

00:03:23.421 --> 00:03:25.201
We teach them how to go right face, left face,

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:27.118
so they can obey instructions and know

00:03:27.118 --> 00:03:30.046
the consequences of not obeying instructions.

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:31.511
It gives them structure.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:35.691
And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant.

00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:37.565
And they hate him.

00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:39.913
And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them,

00:03:39.913 --> 00:03:43.762
and telling them to do all kinds of awful things.

00:03:43.762 --> 00:03:46.766
But then the most amazing thing happens over time.

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:49.792
Once that structure is developed,

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:53.010
once they understand the reason for something,

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.016
once they understand, "Mama ain't here, son.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:04:00.836
I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy.

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:03.448
And that's just the way it is. You got that, son?

00:04:03.448 --> 00:04:06.286
Yeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers:

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:08.682
yes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.845
Don't start telling me why you didn't do something.

00:04:10.845 --> 00:04:13.497
It's yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir."

00:04:13.497 --> 00:04:14.620
"You didn't shave.""But sir —"

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.875
"No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.615
I'm telling you you didn't shave."

00:04:19.615 --> 00:04:22.821
"No excuse, sir.""Attaboy, you're learning fast."

00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:25.209
But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:27.663
once you put them in that structure.

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:32.521
In 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature.

00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.638
And you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeant

00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:37.536
and they never forget the drill sergeant.

00:04:37.536 --> 00:04:40.171
They come to respect him.

00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:44.086
And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect

00:04:44.086 --> 00:04:46.117
in the lives of our children.

00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:48.090
I spend a lot of time with youth groups,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.381
and I say to people, "When does the education process begin?"

00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:53.060
We're always talking about, "Let's fix the schools.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.807
Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools.

00:04:56.807 --> 00:04:59.748
Let's get it all online."

00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:03.054
That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer.

00:05:03.054 --> 00:05:06.316
But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:10.924
with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with.

00:05:10.924 --> 00:05:13.793
When does the learning process begin? Does it begin in first grade?

00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:15.976
No, no, it begins the first time

00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:18.657
a child in a mother's arms

00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:21.421
looks up at the mother

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.785
and says, "Oh, this must be my mother.

00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:27.158
She's the one who feeds me.

00:05:27.158 --> 00:05:29.364
Oh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there,

00:05:29.364 --> 00:05:31.878
she takes care of me.

00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:34.901
It's her language I will learn."

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.650
And at that moment they shut out all the other languages

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.006
that they could be learning at that age,

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.955
but by three months, that's her.

00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:45.275
And if the person doing it, whether it's the mother

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:47.268
or grandmother, whoever's doing it,

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:49.482
that is when the education process begins.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.210
That's when language begins.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.459
That's when love begins. That's when structure begins.

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.947
That's when you start to imprint on the child

00:05:55.947 --> 00:05:58.165
that "you are special,

00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:01.354
you are different from every other child in the world.

00:06:01.354 --> 00:06:03.438
And we're going to read to you."

00:06:03.438 --> 00:06:05.509
A child who has not been read to

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.653
is in danger when that child gets to school.

00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:09.713
A child who doesn't know his or her colors

00:06:09.713 --> 00:06:12.727
or doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes,

00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:14.126
doesn't know how to do those things,

00:06:14.126 --> 00:06:16.796
and doesn't know how to do something that

00:06:16.796 --> 00:06:19.672
goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind.

00:06:19.672 --> 00:06:23.560
Mind your manners! Mind your adults! Mind what you're saying!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.083
This is the way children are raised properly.

00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:29.878
And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along

00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:33.971
and they're, much to the distress of my children,

00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:38.647
they are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them.

00:06:38.647 --> 00:06:43.872
And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school.

00:06:43.872 --> 00:06:46.131
And I'm working at all the energy I have

00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:48.461
to sort of communicate this message that

00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:52.340
we need preschool, we need Head Start,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.860
we need prenatal care.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.075
The education process begins even before the child is born,

00:06:59.075 --> 00:07:01.783
and if you don't do that, you're going to have difficulty.

00:07:01.783 --> 00:07:04.197
And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities

00:07:04.197 --> 00:07:07.242
and so many of our schools where kids are coming

00:07:07.242 --> 00:07:09.553
to first grade and their eyes are blazing,

00:07:09.553 --> 00:07:13.164
they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go,

00:07:13.164 --> 00:07:16.565
and then they realize they're not like the other first graders

00:07:16.565 --> 00:07:21.029
who know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:23.723
And by the third grade, the kids who didn't have

00:07:23.723 --> 00:07:27.869
that structure and minding in the beginning

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:29.779
start to realize they're behind, and what do they do?

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.100
They act it out. They act it out, and they're on their way

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.186
to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts.

00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:38.050
It's predictable.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.016
If you're not at the right reading level at third grade,

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:45.093
you are a candidate for jail at age 18,

00:07:45.093 --> 00:07:47.330
and we have the highest incarceration rate

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.258
because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life.

00:07:50.258 --> 00:07:52.474
The last chapter in my book is called

00:07:52.474 --> 00:07:55.385
"The Gift of a Good Start."

00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:59.077
The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life.

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:01.780
I was privileged to have that kind of good start.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.671
I was not a great student.

00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:06.339
I was a public school kid in New York City,

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:08.979
and I didn't do well at all.

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:12.791
I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript

00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:15.234
from kindergarten through college.

00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:17.504
I wanted it when I was writing my first book.

00:08:17.504 --> 00:08:19.543
I wanted to see if my memory was correct,

00:08:19.543 --> 00:08:22.818
and, my God, it was. (Laughter)

00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:25.606
Straight C everywhere.

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:28.047
And I finally bounced through high school,

00:08:28.047 --> 00:08:30.126
got into the City College of New York

00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:33.766
with a 78.3 average, which I shouldn't have been allowed in with,

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:36.505
and then I started out in engineering,

00:08:36.505 --> 00:08:39.063
and that only lasted six months. (Laughter)

00:08:39.063 --> 00:08:43.076
And then I went into geology, "rocks for jocks." This is easy.

00:08:43.076 --> 00:08:45.078
And then I found ROTC.

00:08:45.078 --> 00:08:49.012
I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing,

00:08:49.012 --> 00:08:52.906
and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way.

00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:56.892
And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.

00:08:56.892 --> 00:08:59.560
And I say to young kids everywhere, as you're growing up

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.161
and as this structure is being developed inside of you,

00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:05.197
always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing,

00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:08.334
and when you find those two things together, man, you got it.

00:09:08.334 --> 00:09:10.698
That's what's going on. And that's what I found.

00:09:10.698 --> 00:09:13.352
Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:15.153
I'd been there four and a half going on five years,

00:09:15.153 --> 00:09:19.563
and my grades were not doing particularly well,

00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:22.705
and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.

00:09:22.705 --> 00:09:25.619
And so they said, "But he does so well in ROTC.

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:28.969
Look, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else."

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:33.325
And so they said, "Look, let's take his ROTC grades

00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:36.771
and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens."

00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:43.487
And they did, and it brought me up to 2.0. (Laughter)

00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:47.221
Yep. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.270
They said, "It's good enough for government work.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.768
Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again."

00:09:53.768 --> 00:09:55.620
So they shipped me off to the army,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.288
and lo and behold, many years later,

00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:03.594
I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. (Laughter)

00:10:03.594 --> 00:10:06.796
So, I tell young people everywhere,

00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:10.987
it ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life

00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:14.598
that determines where you end up in life,

00:10:14.598 --> 00:10:17.283
and you are blessed to be living in a country that,

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.469
no matter where you start, you have opportunities

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:23.173
so long as you believe in yourself,

00:10:23.173 --> 00:10:26.164
you believe in the society and the country,

00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:29.583
and you believe that you can self-improve

00:10:29.583 --> 00:10:31.994
and educate yourself as you go along.

00:10:31.994 --> 00:10:34.227
And that's the key to success.

00:10:34.227 --> 00:10:37.577
But it begins with the gift of a good start.

00:10:37.577 --> 00:10:40.050
If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids,

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.728
if we don't invest at the earliest age,

00:10:43.728 --> 00:10:46.470
we're going to be running into difficulties.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.736
It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall

00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:53.458
and almost 50 percent of our minority population

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:56.932
living in low-income areas,

00:10:56.932 --> 00:10:59.713
because they're not getting the gift of a good start.

00:10:59.713 --> 00:11:03.691
My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family,

00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:07.246
a good family, but having a family that said to me,

00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:11.193
"Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats

00:11:11.193 --> 00:11:14.555
in 1920 and 1924.

00:11:14.555 --> 00:11:18.730
We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.256
We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose

00:11:22.256 --> 00:11:26.636
or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out."

00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:29.687
If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people

00:11:29.687 --> 00:11:32.156
that, "You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out,"

00:11:32.156 --> 00:11:34.813
they'd said, "We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid."

00:11:34.813 --> 00:11:41.171
(Laughter)

00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:43.697
They had expectations for all of the cousins

00:11:43.697 --> 00:11:47.280
and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.439
but they had more than just expectations for us.

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:54.350
They stuck into our hearts like a dagger

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.212
a sense of shame: "Don't you shame this family."

00:11:59.212 --> 00:12:00.875
Sometimes I would get in trouble,

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.718
and my parents were coming home,

00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:06.199
and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen,

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:08.410
and I would sit there saying to myself, "Okay, look,

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.185
take the belt and hit me, but, God, don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again."

00:12:13.185 --> 00:12:15.942
It devastated me when my mother did that to me.

00:12:15.942 --> 00:12:18.106
And I also had this extended network.

00:12:18.106 --> 00:12:21.094
Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe,

00:12:21.094 --> 00:12:22.975
a family, a community.

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:27.199
In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings.

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:29.055
I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers,

00:12:29.055 --> 00:12:30.976
but there were these tenement buildings,

00:12:30.976 --> 00:12:34.189
and these women were always hanging out one of the windows,

00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:35.811
leaning on a pillow.

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:38.570
They never left. (Laughter)

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.604
I, so help me God, I grew up walking those streets,

00:12:41.604 --> 00:12:43.086
and they were always there.

00:12:43.086 --> 00:12:45.960
They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter)

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.506
They never did anything.

00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:51.219
But what they did was keep us in play.

00:12:51.219 --> 00:12:53.505
They kept us in play.

00:12:53.505 --> 00:12:55.763
And they didn't care

00:12:55.763 --> 00:13:00.510
whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general,

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.603
and they never expected any generals in the family,

00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:07.463
as long as you got an education and then you got a job.

00:13:07.463 --> 00:13:09.454
"Don't give us any of that self-actualization stuff.

00:13:09.454 --> 00:13:12.269
You get a job and get out of the house.

00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:14.747
We don't have time to waste for that.

00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:18.322
And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys."

00:13:18.322 --> 00:13:23.844
And so, it's so essential that we kind of put this culture

00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:28.126
back into our families, all families.

00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:31.461
And it is so important that all of you here today

00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:34.137
who are successful people,

00:13:34.137 --> 00:13:38.692
and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren,

00:13:38.692 --> 00:13:40.430
it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.081
and find kids like Mr. Cruz

00:13:43.081 --> 00:13:46.451
who can make it if you give them the structure,

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.438
if you reach back and help, if you mentor,

00:13:48.438 --> 00:13:50.812
if you invest in boys and girls clubs,

00:13:50.812 --> 00:13:52.703
if you work with your school system,

00:13:52.703 --> 00:13:53.977
make sure it's the best school system,

00:13:53.977 --> 00:13:58.800
and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.622
not just downtown Montessori on the West Side.

00:14:01.622 --> 00:14:05.775
All of us have to have a commitment to do that.

00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:08.425
And we're not just investing in the kids.

00:14:08.425 --> 00:14:10.478
We're investing in our future.

00:14:10.478 --> 00:14:13.299
We're going to be a minority-majority country

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:15.292
in one more generation.

00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:18.661
Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority.

00:14:18.661 --> 00:14:21.241
And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority.

00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:23.472
We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders

00:14:23.472 --> 00:14:26.424
of this great country of ours,

00:14:26.424 --> 00:14:29.900
a country that is like no other,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.585
a country that amazes me every single day,

00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:34.205
a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other.

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:37.177
That's how the system's supposed to work.

00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:40.756
It's a country of such contrasts, but it's a nation of nations.

00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:44.752
We touch every nation. Every nation touches us.

00:14:44.752 --> 00:14:46.437
We are a nation of immigrants.

00:14:46.437 --> 00:14:49.581
That's why we need sound immigration policy.

00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:52.816
It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:55.899
to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation,

00:14:55.899 --> 00:14:58.052
or we can send back home with an education

00:14:58.052 --> 00:15:01.433
to help their people rise up out of poverty.

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:05.276
One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:06.673
of going to my hometown of New York

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:08.467
and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day

00:15:08.467 --> 00:15:10.948
and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by

00:15:10.948 --> 00:15:12.402
from all over the world.

00:15:12.402 --> 00:15:16.040
But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.426
and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler.

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:22.577
Gotta have a dirty water dog. (Laughter)

00:15:22.577 --> 00:15:25.557
And no matter where I am or what I'm doing,

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:26.832
I've got to do that.

00:15:26.832 --> 00:15:29.497
I even did it when I was Secretary of State.

00:15:29.497 --> 00:15:32.398
I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:35.478
— (Laughter) —

00:15:35.478 --> 00:15:38.789
be walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street

00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:41.100
looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.299
In those days, I had five bodyguards around me

00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:46.193
and three New York City police cars would roll alongside

00:15:46.193 --> 00:15:51.013
to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue. (Laughter)

00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:52.681
And I would order the hot dog from the guy,

00:15:52.681 --> 00:15:55.127
and he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around

00:15:55.127 --> 00:15:56.804
at the bodyguards and the police cars --

00:15:56.804 --> 00:15:58.886
"I've got a green card! I've got a green card!" (Laughter)

00:15:58.886 --> 00:16:03.222
"It's okay, it's okay."

00:16:03.222 --> 00:16:05.670
But now I'm alone. I'm alone.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.461
I've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing.

00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:11.123
But I gotta have my hot dog.

00:16:11.123 --> 00:16:14.887
I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening

00:16:14.887 --> 00:16:17.187
down by Columbus Circle.

00:16:17.187 --> 00:16:20.042
And the scene repeats itself so often.

00:16:20.042 --> 00:16:23.396
I'll go up and ask for my hot dog,

00:16:23.396 --> 00:16:25.758
and the guy will fix it, and as he's finishing,

00:16:25.758 --> 00:16:28.460
he'll say, "I know you. I see you on television.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.354
You're, well, you're General Powell."

00:16:30.354 --> 00:16:33.044
"Yes, yes.""Oh ... "

00:16:33.044 --> 00:16:34.195
I hand him the money.

00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:39.120
"No, General. You can't pay me. I've been paid.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.883
America has paid me. I never forget where I came from.

00:16:42.883 --> 00:16:46.073
But now I'm an American. Sir, thank you."

00:16:46.073 --> 00:16:48.341
I accept the generosity, continue up the street,

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.570
and it washes over me, my God,

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.588
it's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago.

00:16:54.588 --> 00:16:56.775
So we are still that magnificent country,

00:16:56.775 --> 00:16:59.550
but we are fueled by young people coming up

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.554
from every land in the world,

00:17:02.554 --> 00:17:06.081
and it is our obligation as contributing citizens

00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:07.867
to this wonderful country of ours

00:17:07.867 --> 00:17:11.014
to make sure that no child gets left behind.

00:17:11.014 --> 00:17:13.092
Thank you very much.

00:17:13.092 --> 00:17:25.199
(Applause)
