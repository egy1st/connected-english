00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, where are the robots?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Very soon they'll be doing everything for us.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
They'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but we don't have any robots.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what can we do about that? What can we say?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And this is an x-ray picture

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of a real beetle, and a Swiss watch, back from '88. You look at that --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
what was true then is certainly true today.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We can make the circuitry of the right computational power,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but we can't actually put them together to make something

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So let's try to look at it from a different perspective.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's summon the best designer, the mother of all designers.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's see what evolution can do for us.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars, with motors, with neurons.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Put them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
under mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
A very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
come out of this. They all move around.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that we actually made a couple of these things,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for:

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but we can also do that on a real machine.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Here's a physical robot that we actually

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
have a population of brains,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
competing, or evolving on the machine.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and they get rewarded for how fast or how far

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
they can make the machine move forward.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And you can see these robots are not ready

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to take over the world yet, but

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
they gradually learn how to move forward,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and they do this autonomously.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So in these two examples, we had basically

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
machines that learned how to walk in simulation,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and also machines that learned how to walk in reality.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But I want to show you a different approach,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and this is this robot over here, which has four legs.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
which way it's tilting.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You look at it and you see it has four legs,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it doesn't have any idea what it looks like,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but it's going to try to find that out.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Initially, it does some random motion,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and then it tries to figure out what it might look like.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a second action that creates the most disagreement

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
among predictions of these alternative models,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
This is the last cycle, and you can see it's pretty much

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
a pattern of locomotion.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But when you look at that, you have to remember

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
nor did it have a model of itself.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and then actually tried that out.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
(Applause)

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, we'll move forward to a different idea.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So that was what happened when we had a couple of --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that's what happened when you had a couple of -- OK, OK, OK --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
(Laughter)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
-- they don't like each other. So

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
there's a different robot.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
That's what happened when the robots actually

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
are rewarded for doing something.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
What happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So we have these cubes, like the diagram showed here.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The cube can swivel, or flip on its side,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
this is in simulation --and don't reward them for anything,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we just let them flip. We pump energy into this

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and see what happens in a couple of mutations.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But after a very short while, you can see these blue things

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
on the right there begin to take over.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
They begin to self-replicate. So in absence of any reward,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the intrinsic reward is self-replication.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And we've actually built a couple of these,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
carrying out some of its replication process.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So you're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case --

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and more energy, and it can make another robot.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So of course, this is a very crude machine,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but we're working on a micro-scale version of these,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
OK, so what can we learn? These robots are of course

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
not very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
about how we can build better robots,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and perhaps how humans, animals, create self-models and learn.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And one of the things that I think is important

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
is that we have to get away from this idea

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
of designing the machines manually,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
but actually let them evolve and learn, like children,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
(Applause)
