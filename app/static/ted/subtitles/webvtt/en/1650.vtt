00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:02.952
You know, my favorite part of being a dad

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:06.211
is the movies I get to watch.

00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:08.092
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:10.688
and when my daughter was four,

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.578
we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.

00:00:13.578 --> 00:00:16.977
It totally dominated her imagination for months.

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:20.195
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:22.255
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.909
and carry a wand.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.318
But you watch that movie enough times,

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:27.751
and you start to realize how unusual it is.

00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.603
Now we live today, and are raising our children,

00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:36.953
in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.698
But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:40.885
It did not start that trend.

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:44.307
Forty years later was when the trend really caught on,

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:46.656
with, interestingly, another movie

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:48.791
that featured a metal guy

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:50.175
and a furry guy

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:55.386
rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.

00:00:55.386 --> 00:00:57.827
Do you know what I'm talking about? (Laughter)

00:00:57.827 --> 00:00:59.302
Yeah.

00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:03.025
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies,

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:05.062
a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"

00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:05.995
and all the movies we watch today.

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:09.300
One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.545
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.

00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:18.152
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:22.578
the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:24.340
that the prophecy foretold.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.414
Use your magic slippers to defeat

00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:30.027
the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:31.679
But that's not how it happens.

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.081
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"

00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:37.384
to me is that all of the most heroic

00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:40.714
and wise and even villainous characters

00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:44.226
are female.

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:46.340
Now I started to notice this

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.485
when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,

00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:52.021
which was years later, and the situation was different.

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:55.160
At that point I also had a son.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.887
He was only three at the time.

00:01:56.887 --> 00:02:01.033
He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:02.354
But he was the second child,

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:06.127
and the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter)

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:09.741
So he wandered in,

00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.770
and it imprinted on him

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.412
like a mommy duck does to its duckling,

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:23.191
and I don't think he understands what's going on,

00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:26.718
but he is sure soaking in it.

00:02:26.718 --> 00:02:28.087
And I wonder what he's soaking in.

00:02:28.087 --> 00:02:30.565
Is he picking up on the themes of courage

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:32.682
and perseverance and loyalty?

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:35.662
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:40.556
joins an army to overthrow the government?

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:42.212
Is he picking up on the fact that

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:45.315
there are only boys in the universe

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.504
except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:52.954
who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie

00:02:52.954 --> 00:02:56.183
so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink

00:02:56.183 --> 00:02:58.736
to thank him for saving the universe, which he does

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:01.962
by the magic that he was born with?

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:04.928
Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."

00:03:04.928 --> 00:03:07.557
How does Dorothy win her movie?

00:03:07.557 --> 00:03:10.507
By making friends with everybody

00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:12.284
and being a leader.

00:03:12.284 --> 00:03:15.590
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in --

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.480
Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.383
which is where we kind of have to be.

00:03:21.383 --> 00:03:25.163
Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force --

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.850
in the movies we have for our kids,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.295
and so little yellow brick road?

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:32.712
There is a lot of great writing about the impact

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.959
that the boy-violent movie has on girls,

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.577
and you should do that reading. It's very good.

00:03:39.577 --> 00:03:44.451
I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.

00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:47.001
I know from my own experience that

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:52.626
Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:56.755
that I could have used in navigating the adult world

00:03:56.755 --> 00:04:01.356
that is co-ed. (Laughter)

00:04:01.356 --> 00:04:04.546
I think there was a first-kiss moment

00:04:04.546 --> 00:04:07.877
when I really expected the credits to start rolling

00:04:07.877 --> 00:04:10.680
because that's the end of the movie, right?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.977
I finished my quest, I got the girl.

00:04:12.977 --> 00:04:16.108
Why are you still standing there?

00:04:16.108 --> 00:04:17.553
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:20.741
The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain

00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:23.329
and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:26.220
for other relationships and other journeys.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.459
It's almost as though if you're a boy,

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:30.540
you are a dopey animal,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.014
and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.

00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:37.202
There are plenty of exceptions,

00:04:37.202 --> 00:04:42.499
and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.551
But they do send a message to boys,

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.057
that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.

00:04:48.057 --> 00:04:50.499
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.871
how to defend against the patriarchy,

00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:55.836
but they are not necessarily showing boys

00:04:55.836 --> 00:04:58.670
how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.810
There's no models for them.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.083
And we also have some terrific women

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:06.220
who are writing new stories for our kids,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.962
and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,

00:05:10.962 --> 00:05:13.088
these are still war movies.

00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:17.196
And, of course, the most successful studio of all time

00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:21.326
continues to crank out classic after classic,

00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:24.070
every single one of them about

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.840
the journey of a boy, or a man,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.484
or two men who are friends, or a man and his son,

00:05:31.484 --> 00:05:35.079
or two men who are raising a little girl.

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:38.819
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year,

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.545
when they finally came out with "Brave."

00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:44.552
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:48.446
Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?

00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:52.854
"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."

00:05:52.854 --> 00:05:54.975
It's very good. Don't let that stop you.

00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:58.867
Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:00.053
I don't know if you've heard of this.

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:02.875
It has not yet caught on and caught fire,

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:04.956
but maybe today we will start a movement.

00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:07.738
Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist,

00:06:07.738 --> 00:06:12.844
and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation

00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:16.418
she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.404
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:

00:06:19.404 --> 00:06:21.914
Is there more than one character in the movie

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:25.515
that is female who has lines?

00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:28.095
So try to meet that bar.

00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:33.755
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?

00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:37.208
And is their conversation about something other than

00:06:37.208 --> 00:06:40.524
the guy that they both like? (Laughter)

00:06:40.524 --> 00:06:44.856
Right? Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:46.681
Thank you very much.

00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:54.284
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.

00:06:54.284 --> 00:06:59.414
It does happen. I've seen it,

00:06:59.414 --> 00:07:02.362
and yet I very rarely see it in the movies

00:07:02.362 --> 00:07:03.529
that we know and love.

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:05.689
In fact, this week I went to see

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:09.303
a very high-quality movie, "Argo."

00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:12.962
Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,

00:07:12.962 --> 00:07:17.246
a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.

00:07:17.246 --> 00:07:19.930
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.737
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,

00:07:23.737 --> 00:07:25.318
I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie

00:07:25.318 --> 00:07:28.776
takes place in this embassy where men and women

00:07:28.776 --> 00:07:31.453
are hiding out during the hostage crisis.

00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:33.342
We've got quite a few scenes of the men

00:07:33.342 --> 00:07:37.503
having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,

00:07:37.503 --> 00:07:41.519
and the great moment for one of the actresses is

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:46.641
to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"

00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:48.642
That's Hollywood for you.

00:07:48.642 --> 00:07:51.087
So let's look at the numbers.

00:07:51.087 --> 00:07:54.649
2011, of the 100 most popular movies,

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:58.894
how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?

00:07:58.894 --> 00:08:02.188
Eleven. It's not bad.

00:08:02.188 --> 00:08:05.883
It's not as many percent as the number of women

00:08:05.883 --> 00:08:09.009
we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.

00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:12.013
But there is a number that is greater than this

00:08:12.013 --> 00:08:14.670
that's going to bring this room down.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.332
Last year, The New York Times published a study

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:19.991
that the government had done.

00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:21.379
Here's what it said.

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:25.595
One out of five women in America

00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:31.848
say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.

00:08:31.848 --> 00:08:35.632
Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.

00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:39.915
I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.

00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:41.693
I don't even think that

00:08:41.693 --> 00:08:45.248
music videos or pornography are really directly related to that,

00:08:45.248 --> 00:08:48.013
but something is going wrong,

00:08:48.013 --> 00:08:51.064
and when I hear that statistic,

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:53.569
one of the things I think of is

00:08:53.569 --> 00:08:57.694
that's a lot of sexual assailants.

00:08:57.694 --> 00:09:01.054
Who are these guys? What are they learning?

00:09:01.054 --> 00:09:02.770
What are they failing to learn?

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.920
Are they absorbing the story that

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.447
a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence

00:09:09.447 --> 00:09:11.980
and then collect the reward, which is a woman

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.028
who has no friends and doesn't speak?

00:09:17.028 --> 00:09:22.233
Are we soaking up that story?

00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:24.579
You know,

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:27.346
as a parent with the privilege

00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:29.990
of raising a daughter

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.859
like all of you who are doing the same thing,

00:09:32.859 --> 00:09:36.639
we find this world and this statistic very alarming

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:37.776
and we want to prepare them.

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:42.062
We have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"

00:09:42.062 --> 00:09:44.796
and we hope that that will help,

00:09:44.796 --> 00:09:48.405
but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them

00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:51.003
if, at the same time, actively or passively,

00:09:51.003 --> 00:09:55.956
we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?

00:09:55.956 --> 00:09:59.354
I mean, I think the Netflix queue

00:09:59.354 --> 00:10:02.610
is one way that we can do something very important,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.665
and I'm talking mainly to the dads here.

00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:08.515
I think we have got to show our sons

00:10:08.515 --> 00:10:10.371
a new definition of manhood.

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:14.891
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.

00:10:14.891 --> 00:10:17.022
You've read about how the new economy

00:10:17.022 --> 00:10:20.423
is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.

00:10:20.423 --> 00:10:22.077
They're throwing it up in the air.

00:10:22.077 --> 00:10:24.695
So our sons are going to have to find some way

00:10:24.695 --> 00:10:27.670
of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.517
and I think we really have to show them, and model for them,

00:10:31.517 --> 00:10:35.218
how a real man

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:38.987
is someone who trusts his sisters

00:10:38.987 --> 00:10:42.160
and respects them, and wants to be on their team,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.783
and stands up against the real bad guys,

00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:49.639
who are the men who want to abuse the women.

00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:52.690
And I think our job in the Netflix queue

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.459
is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,

00:10:56.459 --> 00:11:00.740
if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.326
who are there,

00:11:02.326 --> 00:11:06.115
who show real courage, who bring people together,

00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:09.703
and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines

00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:13.188
and to say, "I want to be on their team,"

00:11:13.188 --> 00:11:17.770
because they're going to be on their team.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.464
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"

00:11:21.464 --> 00:11:23.493
do you know what she said?

00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:25.996
Obi-Wan.

00:11:25.996 --> 00:11:29.893
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.

00:11:29.893 --> 00:11:33.360
What do these two have in common?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.284
Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.

00:11:35.284 --> 00:11:38.911
I think these people are experts.

00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:40.437
I think these are the two people in the movie

00:11:40.437 --> 00:11:42.005
who know more than anybody else,

00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:45.332
and they love sharing their knowledge with other people

00:11:45.332 --> 00:11:48.436
to help them reach their potential.

00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:50.444
Now, they are leaders.

00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:52.662
I like that kind of quest for my daughter,

00:11:52.662 --> 00:11:54.849
and I like that kind of quest for my son.

00:11:54.849 --> 00:11:56.760
I want more quests like that.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.360
I want fewer quests where my son is told,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.571
"Go out and fight it alone,"

00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:06.776
and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,

00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:10.876
maybe a team led by women,

00:12:10.876 --> 00:12:16.496
to help other people become better

00:12:16.496 --> 00:12:18.888
and be better people,

00:12:18.888 --> 00:12:21.170
like the Wizard of Oz.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:34.479
Thank you.
