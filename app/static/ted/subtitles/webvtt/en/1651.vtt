00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:03.515
This is how war starts.

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:06.781
One day you're living your ordinary life,

00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:09.297
you're planning to go to a party,

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:11.681
you're taking your children to school,

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:14.394
you're making a dentist appointment.

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:18.020
The next thing, the telephones go out,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.957
the TVs go out, there's armed men on the street,

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:24.273
there's roadblocks.

00:00:24.273 --> 00:00:28.750
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.955
It stops.

00:00:30.955 --> 00:00:33.513
I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine,

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:36.491
a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her,

00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:40.868
because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like.

00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:44.962
She was walking to work one day in April, 1992,

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:48.110
in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.634
She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.468
Great person.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:56.775
And suddenly she sees a tank

00:00:56.775 --> 00:00:59.981
ambling down the main road of Sarajevo

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:03.533
knocking everything out of its path.

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.564
She thinks she's dreaming, but she's not.

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:10.309
And she runs as any of us would have done

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:14.326
and takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin,

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:16.925
in her high heels and her miniskirt.

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:21.144
And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous,

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:23.840
but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.200
and people all over the place and chaos

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.827
and she thinks, "I feel like Alice in Wonderland

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:33.162
going down the rabbit hole,

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:36.230
down, down, down into chaos,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.631
and my life will never be the same again."

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.418
A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:50.368
pushing with her infant son in her arms

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:52.904
to give him to a stranger on a bus,

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.928
which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:59.093
to take children out so they could be safe.

00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:03.203
And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front,

00:02:03.203 --> 00:02:06.629
crowds and crowds of people, "Take my child! Take my child!"

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:12.682
and passing her son to someone through a window.

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:15.550
And she didn't see him for years.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.269
The siege went on for three and a half years,

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.558
and it was a siege without water,

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:26.847
without power, without electricity, without heat, without food,

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:32.202
in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:36.004
I had the honor of being one of those reporters

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.423
that lived through that siege,

00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:41.461
and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.651
because it's taught me everything,

00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:47.780
not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.135
I learned about compassion.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:53.946
I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes.

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:58.317
I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie.

00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:01.228
Most of all, I learned about love.

00:03:01.228 --> 00:03:06.507
Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos,

00:03:06.507 --> 00:03:09.643
I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors,

00:03:09.643 --> 00:03:12.287
share food, raise their children,

00:03:12.287 --> 00:03:15.539
drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.396
even though you yourself were endangering your life,

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:21.647
helping people get into taxis who were injured

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:24.268
to try to take them to hospitals.

00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:27.487
I learned so much about myself.

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:30.512
Martha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said,

00:03:30.512 --> 00:03:35.710
"You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility."

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.246
I went on to cover many, many, many wars after that,

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:41.875
so many that I lost count,

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:44.958
but there was nothing like Sarajevo.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.913
Last April, I went back to a very strange --

00:03:48.913 --> 00:03:52.687
what I called a deranged high school reunion.

00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:57.030
What it was, was the 20th anniversary of the siege,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.502
the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo,

00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:03.942
and I don't like the word "anniversary," because it sounds like a party,

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:05.345
and this was not a party.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:09.333
It was a very somber gathering of the reporters

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:12.724
that worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers,

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:17.193
and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:19.612
And the thing that struck me the most,

00:04:19.612 --> 00:04:21.353
that broke my heart,

00:04:21.353 --> 00:04:23.523
was walking down the main street of Sarajevo,

00:04:23.523 --> 00:04:27.598
where my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago,

00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:34.295
and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs,

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:35.921
empty,

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.190
and every single one of them symbolized

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.907
a person who had died during the siege,

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:46.194
just in Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia,

00:04:46.194 --> 00:04:48.781
and it stretched from one end of the city

00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:51.055
to a large part of it,

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:54.558
and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs

00:04:54.558 --> 00:04:57.414
for the children.

00:04:57.414 --> 00:05:00.541
I now cover Syria,

00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:03.731
and I started reporting it because I believed that

00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:05.987
it needs to be done.

00:05:05.987 --> 00:05:08.992
I believe a story there has to be told.

00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:12.962
I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.

00:05:12.962 --> 00:05:15.191
And when I first arrived in Damascus,

00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:17.593
I saw this strange moment where people

00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:21.153
didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend,

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:23.088
and it was exactly the same in Bosnia

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:25.902
and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes.

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:28.445
People don't want to believe it's coming,

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:31.912
so they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.

00:05:31.912 --> 00:05:33.582
They don't get their money out.

00:05:33.582 --> 00:05:37.477
They stay because you want to stay in your home.

00:05:37.477 --> 00:05:41.516
And then war and chaos descend.

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:45.319
Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:51.473
In 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda.

00:05:51.473 --> 00:05:56.322
Between April and August, 1994,

00:05:56.322 --> 00:06:00.523
one million people were slaughtered.

00:06:00.523 --> 00:06:05.750
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.822
with the sheer number,

00:06:07.822 --> 00:06:11.453
I want you just for a second to think of a million people.

00:06:11.453 --> 00:06:13.990
And to give you some example, I remember

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.071
standing and looking down a road as far as I could see,

00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:25.160
at least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.884
of the dead.

00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:30.219
And that was just a small percentage of the dead.

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.188
And there were mothers holding their children

00:06:32.188 --> 00:06:35.529
who had been caught in their last death throes.

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.859
So we learn a lot from war,

00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:41.211
and I mention Rwanda

00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:45.329
because it is one place, like South Africa,

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:49.311
where nearly 20 years on, there is healing.

00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:52.779
Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women,

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.231
which is fantastic,

00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:59.257
and there's also within the national constitution now,

00:06:59.257 --> 00:07:02.430
you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.299
You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity,

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:10.845
which is, of course, what started the slaughter in the first place.

00:07:10.845 --> 00:07:13.952
And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story,

00:07:13.952 --> 00:07:15.435
or I find it beautiful.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:20.352
There was a group of children, mixed Hutus and Tutsis,

00:07:20.352 --> 00:07:23.066
and a group of women who were adopting them,

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:27.000
and they lined up and one was just given to the next.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.166
There was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi,

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:33.081
you're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother,

00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:34.927
you might have killed my father.

00:07:34.927 --> 00:07:40.233
They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation,

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:43.817
and I find this remarkable.

00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:46.659
So when people ask me how I continue to cover war,

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:48.871
and why I continue to do it,

00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:50.340
this is why.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.731
When I go back to Syria, next week in fact,

00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:57.692
what I see is incredibly heroic people,

00:07:57.692 --> 00:07:59.965
some of them fighting for democracy,

00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:03.982
for things we take for granted every single day.

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:07.220
And that's pretty much why I do it.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.688
In 2004, I had a little baby boy,

00:08:11.688 --> 00:08:14.883
and I call him my miracle child,

00:08:14.883 --> 00:08:17.929
because after seeing so much death

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:22.106
and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life,

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:25.965
this ray of hope was born.

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:30.162
And I called him Luca, which means "The bringer of light,"

00:08:30.162 --> 00:08:35.085
because he does bring light to my life.

00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:38.536
But I'm talking about him because when he was four months old,

00:08:38.536 --> 00:08:43.208
my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad

00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:46.540
where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.419
and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards,

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:52.513
and I remember getting on the plane in tears,

00:08:52.513 --> 00:08:55.499
crying to be separated from my son,

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:57.732
and while I was there,

00:08:57.732 --> 00:09:00.467
a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:02.941
said to me, "What are you doing here?

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:04.782
Why aren't you home with Luca?"

00:09:04.782 --> 00:09:08.567
And I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004

00:09:08.567 --> 00:09:12.954
which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq,

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:16.194
"I have to see, I have to see what is happening here.

00:09:16.194 --> 00:09:17.059
I have to report it."

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:20.623
And he said, "Go home,

00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:23.909
because if you miss his first tooth,

00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:26.907
if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.

00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:30.770
But there will always be another war."

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.111
And there, sadly, will always be wars.

00:09:35.111 --> 00:09:38.965
And I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist,

00:09:38.965 --> 00:09:40.731
as a reporter, as a writer,

00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:45.569
what I do can stop them. I can't.

00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:48.116
I'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war.

00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:51.093
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.

00:09:51.093 --> 00:09:55.089
I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person.

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:57.372
I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor,

00:09:57.372 --> 00:10:00.198
and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt

00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:03.469
to have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:07.304
All I am is a witness.

00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:12.358
My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.

00:10:12.358 --> 00:10:15.591
A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light

00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:18.353
in the darkest corners of the world.

00:10:18.353 --> 00:10:21.000
And that's what I try to do.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.036
I'm not always successful,

00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:26.577
and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating,

00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:28.783
because you feel like you're writing into a void,

00:10:28.783 --> 00:10:31.112
or you feel like no one cares.

00:10:31.112 --> 00:10:33.361
Who cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia?

00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:35.374
Who cares about the Congo,

00:10:35.374 --> 00:10:37.648
the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone,

00:10:37.648 --> 00:10:39.763
all of these strings of places that

00:10:39.763 --> 00:10:43.736
I will remember for the rest of my life?

00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:46.989
But my métier is to bear witness

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:50.171
and that is the crux, the heart of the matter,

00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:52.712
for us reporters who do this.

00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:56.303
And all I can really do is hope,

00:10:56.303 --> 00:10:58.911
not to policymakers or politicians,

00:10:58.911 --> 00:11:01.308
because as much as I'd like to have faith

00:11:01.308 --> 00:11:03.773
that they read my words and do something,

00:11:03.773 --> 00:11:06.933
I don't delude myself.

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:11.150
But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.703
or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast,

00:11:14.703 --> 00:11:17.385
if you can remember the story of Sarajevo,

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:20.876
or the story of Rwanda,

00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:23.449
then I've done my job.

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.487
Thank you very much.

00:11:25.487 --> 00:11:32.717
