WEBVTT

00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:04.048
So I want to talk to you about two things tonight.

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:06.332
Number one:

00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:09.648
Teaching surgery and doing surgery

00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:11.781
is really hard.

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:13.365
And second,

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.864
that language is one of the most profound things

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:19.182
that separate us all over the world.

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:21.099
And in my little corner of the world,

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.049
these two things are actually related,

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:24.981
and I want to tell you how tonight.

00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:28.987
Now, nobody wants an operation.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:32.926
Who here has had surgery?

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:34.249
Did you want it?

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:35.807
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation.

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:37.899
Nobody wants an operation.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.961
In particular, nobody wants an operation

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:46.449
with tools like these through large incisions

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.424
that cause a lot of pain,

00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:51.956
that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school,

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:54.207
that leave a big scar.

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.109
But if you have to have an operation,

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.640
what you really want is a minimally invasive operation.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.672
That's what I want to talk to you about tonight --

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:04.406
how doing and teaching this type of surgery

00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:05.873
led us on a search

00:01:05.873 --> 00:01:08.407
for a better universal translator.

00:01:08.407 --> 00:01:10.750
Now, this type of surgery is hard,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.274
and it starts by putting people to sleep,

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.391
putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen,

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:18.207
blowing them up like a balloon,

00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:23.396
sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen --

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:26.943
it's dangerous stuff --

00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:31.586
and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen.

00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:33.553
So let's see what it looks like.

00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:35.319
So this is gallbladder surgery.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.351
We perform a million of these a year

00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:39.569
in the United States alone.

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.619
This is the real thing. There's no blood.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.753
And you can see how focused the surgeons are,

00:01:44.753 --> 00:01:47.268
how much concentration it takes.

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:48.952
You can see it in their faces.

00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:55.459
It's hard to teach, and it's not all that easy to learn.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.437
We do about five million of these in the United States

00:01:57.437 --> 00:02:02.724
and maybe 20 million of these worldwide.

00:02:02.724 --> 00:02:05.557
All right, you've all heard the term:

00:02:05.557 --> 00:02:07.355
"He's a born surgeon."

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:10.755
Let me tell you, surgeons are not born.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:14.492
Surgeons are not made either.

00:02:14.492 --> 00:02:17.832
There are no little tanks where we're making surgeons.

00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:22.287
Surgeons are trained one step at a time.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:26.139
It starts with a foundation, basic skills.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.904
We build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room

00:02:30.904 --> 00:02:32.672
where they learn to be an assistant.

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:34.806
Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training.

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:37.738
And when they do all of that for about five years,

00:02:37.738 --> 00:02:41.104
they get the coveted board certification.

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:43.738
If you need surgery, you want to be operated on

00:02:43.738 --> 00:02:46.222
by a board-certified surgeon.

00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:48.206
You get your board certificate,

00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:50.549
and you can go out into practice.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.816
And eventually, if you're lucky, you achieve mastery.

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:58.848
Now that foundation is so important

00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:00.749
that a number of us

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:04.316
from the largest general surgery society in the United States, SAGES,

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:07.182
started in the late 1990s a training program

00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:11.533
that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:16.115
would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.800
necessary to go on and do procedures.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.899
Now the science behind this is so potent

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:26.683
that it became required by the American Board of Surgery

00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:30.233
in order for a young surgeon to become board certified.

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:34.018
It's not a lecture, it's not a course,

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:37.416
it's all of that plus a high-stakes assessment.

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.650
It's hard.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.784
Now just this past year,

00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:45.850
one of our partners, the American College of Surgeons,

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.712
teamed up with us to make an announcement

00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:51.182
that all surgeons should be FLS (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery)-certified

00:03:51.182 --> 00:03:54.266
before they do minimally invasive surgery.

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:57.710
And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada?

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.683
No, we just said all surgeons.

00:03:59.683 --> 00:04:04.382
So to lift this education and training worldwide

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:05.632
is a very large task,

00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:09.574
something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world.

00:04:09.574 --> 00:04:14.266
SAGES does surgery all over the world, teaching and educating surgeons.

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:18.305
So we have a problem, and one of the problems is distance.

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.538
We can't travel everywhere.

00:04:20.538 --> 00:04:23.356
We need to make the world a smaller place.

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:26.039
And I think that we can develop some tools to do so.

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.022
And one of the tools I like personally is using video.

00:04:30.022 --> 00:04:32.472
So I was inspired by a friend.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.721
This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto.

00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.326
And he proved

00:04:37.326 --> 00:04:41.572
that you could actually teach people to do surgery

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:44.272
using video conferencing.

00:04:44.272 --> 00:04:48.505
So here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:51.055
these basic fundamental skills

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:53.772
necessary to do minimally invasive surgery.

00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:55.372
Very inspiring.

00:04:55.372 --> 00:04:59.138
But for this examination, which is really hard,

00:04:59.138 --> 00:05:01.955
we have a problem.

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:04.555
Even people who say they speak English,

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:07.072
only 14 percent pass.

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:09.088
Because for them it's not a surgery test,

00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:12.963
it's an English test.

00:05:12.963 --> 00:05:14.572
Let me bring it to you locally.

00:05:14.572 --> 00:05:16.239
I work at the Cambridge Hospital.

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:19.522
It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility.

00:05:19.522 --> 00:05:24.838
We have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages,

00:05:24.838 --> 00:05:30.022
and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital.

00:05:30.022 --> 00:05:31.797
It's a big labor-intensive effort.

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:35.863
If you think about the worldwide burden

00:05:35.863 --> 00:05:37.722
of trying to talk to your patients --

00:05:37.722 --> 00:05:40.357
not just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients --

00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:43.505
there aren't enough translators in the world.

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:49.471
We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest.

00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:52.638
At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors

00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:55.072
to people who just got here last week.

00:05:55.072 --> 00:05:57.357
And you have no idea how hard it is

00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.289
to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to.

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.189
And there isn't always a translator available.

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:07.552
So we need tools.

00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:11.230
We need a universal translator.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.639
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:21.156
is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:23.705
It's really about setting up a dialogue.

00:06:23.705 --> 00:06:25.556
We have a lot to learn.

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:30.056
Here in the United States we spend more money per person

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.906
for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.

00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:37.289
Maybe we have something to learn as well.

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:41.772
So I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world.

00:06:41.772 --> 00:06:45.156
This past year I've been in Latin America, I've been in China,

00:06:45.156 --> 00:06:48.889
talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery.

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.421
And everywhere I go the barrier is:

00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:57.055
"We want this, but we need it in our language."

00:06:57.055 --> 00:06:59.972
So here's what we think we want to do:

00:06:59.972 --> 00:07:02.389
Imagine giving a lecture

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:07.385
and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:13.073
I want to talk to the people in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe

00:07:13.073 --> 00:07:17.793
seamlessly, accurately

00:07:17.793 --> 00:07:22.074
and in a cost-effective fashion using technology.

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:23.702
And it has to be bi-directional.

00:07:23.702 --> 00:07:26.489
They have to be able to teach us something as well.

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:27.889
It's a big task.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.955
So we looked for a universal translator; I thought there would be one out there.

00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:34.906
Your webpage has translation, your cellphone has translation,

00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:40.106
but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery.

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:42.572
Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon?

00:07:42.572 --> 00:07:46.671
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain.

00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:49.156
I need to have a health care lexicon.

00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:52.757
And in that I need a surgery lexicon.

00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:57.012
That's a tall order. We have to work at it.

00:07:57.012 --> 00:07:58.805
So let me show you what we're doing.

00:07:58.805 --> 00:08:01.106
This is research -- can't buy it.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:05.589
We're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:10.522
to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator.

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:12.656
It starts with a framework system

00:08:12.656 --> 00:08:15.388
where when the surgeon delivers the lecture

00:08:15.388 --> 00:08:18.555
using a framework of captioning technology,

00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:22.971
we then add another technology to do video conferencing.

00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:26.456
But we don't have the words yet, so we add a third technology.

00:08:26.456 --> 00:08:29.106
And now we've got the words,

00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:33.657
and we can apply the special sauce: the translation.

00:08:33.657 --> 00:08:38.037
We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic.

00:08:38.037 --> 00:08:40.321
We work with a fourth technology.

00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:44.305
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs.

00:08:44.305 --> 00:08:48.806
More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place.

00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:51.455
And I'd like to show you our prototype

00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:56.288
of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other

00:08:56.288 --> 00:08:59.955
to become something useful.

00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:03.751
Narrator: Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery.

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:07.364
Module five: manual skills practice.

00:09:07.364 --> 00:09:14.647
Students may display captions in their native language.

00:09:14.647 --> 00:09:16.396
Steven Schwaitzberg: If you're in Latin America,

00:09:16.396 --> 00:09:18.281
you click the "I want it in Spanish" button

00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:21.913
and out it comes in real time in Spanish.

00:09:21.913 --> 00:09:24.747
But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time,

00:09:24.747 --> 00:09:28.080
by using technology in a constructive fashion,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.346
you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian --

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:36.812
on and on and on, simultaneously without the use of human translators.

00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:39.012
But that's the lectures.

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:41.863
If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning,

00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:44.880
it's knowledge and skills.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.163
The difference in an operation

00:09:47.163 --> 00:09:51.763
between doing something successfully and not

00:09:51.763 --> 00:09:55.230
may be moving your hand this much.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.530
So we're going to take it one step further;

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.663
we've brought my friend Allan back.

00:09:59.663 --> 00:10:04.764
Allan Okrainec: Today we're going to practice suturing.

00:10:04.764 --> 00:10:06.762
This is how you hold the needle.

00:10:06.762 --> 00:10:12.259
Grab the needle at the tip.

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:14.717
It's important to be accurate.

00:10:14.717 --> 00:10:18.550
Aim for the black dots.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.999
Orient your loop this way.

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:26.584
Now go ahead and cut.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:30.472
Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week.

00:10:30.472 --> 00:10:33.338
SS: So that's what we're working on

00:10:33.338 --> 00:10:36.321
in our quest for the universal translator.

00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:38.405
We want it to be bi-directional.

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:42.606
We have a need to learn as well as to teach.

00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:46.622
I can think of a million uses for a tool like this.

00:10:46.622 --> 00:10:49.372
As we think about intersecting technologies --

00:10:49.372 --> 00:10:51.772
everybody has a cell phone with a camera --

00:10:51.772 --> 00:10:53.988
we could use this everywhere,

00:10:53.988 --> 00:10:56.071
whether it be health care, patient care,

00:10:56.071 --> 00:11:00.556
engineering, law, conferencing, translating videos.

00:11:00.556 --> 00:11:02.956
This is a ubiquitous tool.

00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:05.155
In order to break down our barriers,

00:11:05.155 --> 00:11:06.922
we have to learn to talk to people,

00:11:06.922 --> 00:11:10.922
to demand that people work on translation.

00:11:10.922 --> 00:11:13.272
We need it for our everyday life,

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:16.106
in order to make the world a smaller place.

00:11:16.106 --> 00:11:17.806
Thank you very much.

00:11:17.806 --> 00:11:20.188
