00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:01.893
The theme of my talk today is,

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:05.101
"Be an artist, right now."

00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:08.158
Most people, when this subject is brought up,

00:00:08.158 --> 00:00:10.784
get tense and resist it:

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:13.778
"Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:16.154
I have to go to school, get a job,

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:18.441
send my kids to lessons ... "

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:23.976
You think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:27.437
There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.

00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:28.992
Don't they just pop into your head?

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:30.815
There are so many reasons why we can't be,

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:33.375
indeed, we're not sure why we should be.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.068
We don't know why we should be artists,

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:38.971
but we have many reasons why we can't be.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.346
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:47.214
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:52.266
or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:56.609
And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.227
Well you might have, but I don't think so.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.696
This is the theme of my talk today.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.498
We are all born artists.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.542
If you have kids, you know what I mean.

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:13.427
Almost everything kids do is art.

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:16.005
They draw with crayons on the wall.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:19.157
They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV,

00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:23.015
but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:28.301
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:32.275
Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear,

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:37.472
and because they practice such art all day long,

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:40.751
people honestly get a little tired around kids.

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.906
Kids will sometimes perform monodramas --

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:47.452
playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:50.131
And some kids, when they get a bit older,

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:52.151
start to lie.

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:57.242
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.587
They're shocked.

00:01:58.587 --> 00:02:02.155
"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:05.361
She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:06.932
But you shouldn't worry.

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:13.152
The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.

00:02:13.152 --> 00:02:15.340
They are talking about things they didn't see.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.131
It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.

00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:19.198
Parents should celebrate.

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:23.355
"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:25.584
All right! It calls for celebration.

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:28.973
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."

00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:33.424
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:37.040
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this:

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.112
"Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?

00:02:40.112 --> 00:02:41.816
Where did you meet it?" "Um, in front of the supermarket."

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:44.138
When you have a conversation like this,

00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:50.513
the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.

00:02:50.513 --> 00:02:52.677
Soon, a story develops.

00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:57.154
Of course this is an infantile story,

00:02:57.154 --> 00:03:00.970
but thinking up one sentence after the next

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.038
is the same thing a professional writer like me does.

00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:07.417
In essence, they are not different.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:10.103
Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels,

00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:12.709
"Flaubert did not write a novel.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.714
He merely connected one sentence after another.

00:03:15.714 --> 00:03:20.441
The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."

00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:23.224
That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:26.683
then, without violating the scope of the first one,

00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:28.388
writing the next sentence.

00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:29.897
And you continue to make connections.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.963
Take a look at this sentence:

00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.430
"One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.876
Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."

00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:40.044
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence

00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:42.492
and continuing in order to justify it,

00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:46.921
Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:49.670
Kafka did not show his work to his father.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.994
He was not on good terms with his father.

00:03:51.994 --> 00:03:55.790
On his own, he wrote these sentences.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.053
Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought.

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:00.965
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts

00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:03.212
and justifying the next sentence,

00:04:03.212 --> 00:04:06.473
which is not much different from what a kid does.

00:04:06.473 --> 00:04:08.004
A kid who has just started to lie

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:11.130
is taking the first step as a storyteller.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.691
Kids do art.

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.116
They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.877
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:21.989
When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.896
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:27.140
making mountains and seas -- well, not seas,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.087
but different things -- people and dogs, etc.

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:32.500
But parents tell them,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.263
"It will all be washed away by the waves."

00:04:34.263 --> 00:04:36.085
In other words, it's useless.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:37.229
There's no need.

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.095
But kids don't mind.

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:40.266
They have fun in the moment

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:42.432
and they keep playing in the sand.

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:44.698
Kids don't do it because someone told them to.

00:04:44.698 --> 00:04:46.294
They aren't told by their boss

00:04:46.294 --> 00:04:49.219
or anyone, they just do it.

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:54.615
When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.

00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:58.977
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,

00:04:58.977 --> 00:05:04.901
many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.

00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.656
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,

00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:12.672
or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.

00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:16.023
Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.

00:05:16.023 --> 00:05:18.346
They talk about these kinds of experiences.

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:20.611
You must have had such a moment.

00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:22.544
In that moment, art makes you happy

00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:24.221
because it's not work.

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:26.754
Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.

00:05:26.754 --> 00:05:29.855
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:31.545
It's a bit mischievous, actually.

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:36.517
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."

00:05:36.517 --> 00:05:38.002
Right? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?

00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:39.663
Playing doesn't tire us.

00:05:39.663 --> 00:05:41.098
We can play all night long.

00:05:41.098 --> 00:05:43.531
If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:46.815
Why? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.

00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:51.497
But kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:54.231
They don't draw to sell the work to a client

00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:57.256
or play the piano to earn money for the family.

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:00.032
Of course, there were kids who had to.

00:06:00.032 --> 00:06:01.334
You know this gentleman, right?

00:06:01.334 --> 00:06:05.420
He had to tour around Europe to support his family --

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.310
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart --

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.273
but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:14.138
Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.

00:06:14.138 --> 00:06:17.528
Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework

00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:21.046
and of course they take piano or ballet lessons,

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:22.815
but they aren't fun anymore.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:26.147
You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?

00:06:26.147 --> 00:06:31.739
If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall,

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:35.654
you'll surely get in trouble with your mom.

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:39.521
Besides,

00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:42.101
if you continue to act like an artist as you get older,

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:45.769
you'll increasingly feel pressure --

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:51.824
people will question your actions and ask you to act properly.

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:58.011
Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.

00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.918
I was trying my best, and my teacher came around

00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:04.506
and asked me, "What are you doing?"

00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:06.320
"I'm drawing diligently," I said.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.223
"Why are you using only black?"

00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:10.603
Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.

00:07:10.603 --> 00:07:13.672
And I explained,

00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:16.919
"It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:17.917
Then my teacher said,

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:23.239
"Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:25.974
Or so I wished.

00:07:25.974 --> 00:07:28.742
"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response. (Laughter)

00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:30.346
"You'll get it!" he said.

00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:33.028
You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,

00:07:33.028 --> 00:07:35.463
but I was coloring everything in black,

00:07:35.463 --> 00:07:37.147
so he dragged me out of the group.

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:39.167
There were a lot of girls there as well,

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.718
so I was utterly mortified.

00:07:40.718 --> 00:07:45.170
None of my explanations or excuses were heard,

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.383
and I really got it big time.

00:07:48.383 --> 00:07:52.901
If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,

00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:55.214
"Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,

00:07:55.214 --> 00:07:58.589
but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:02.041
But such a teacher is seldom found.

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:05.004
Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries --

00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:06.905
I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:12.303
Look what I found. (Laughter)

00:08:12.303 --> 00:08:16.628
Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished

00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:22.021
and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.

00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:25.027
Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?

00:08:25.027 --> 00:08:26.943
Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.

00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:30.888
No crows are brought up.

00:08:30.888 --> 00:08:34.221
Most of the works have no title, Untitled.

00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:37.322
Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century

00:08:37.322 --> 00:08:42.691
is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation --

00:08:42.691 --> 00:08:44.170
essentially the same as I did.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.918
Of course, my work was very amateur,

00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:50.207
but let's turn to more famous examples.

00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:52.808
This is Picasso's.

00:08:52.808 --> 00:08:58.609
He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?

00:08:58.609 --> 00:09:03.253
Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".

00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:04.847
That was Duchamp.

00:09:04.847 --> 00:09:09.297
So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories --

00:09:09.297 --> 00:09:13.424
that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.

00:09:13.424 --> 00:09:14.812
Picasso even made the statement,

00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:18.989
"I draw not what I see but what I think."

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:21.506
Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.

00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:25.577
I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.

00:09:25.577 --> 00:09:29.379
Unfortunately, the little artists within us

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:34.866
are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.471
They get locked in.

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:37.554
That's our tragedy.

00:09:37.554 --> 00:09:42.814
So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:44.197
Our artistic desire doesn't go away.

00:09:44.197 --> 00:09:47.294
We want to express, to reveal ourselves,

00:09:47.294 --> 00:09:52.532
but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.

00:09:52.532 --> 00:09:55.499
In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing

00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:58.041
"She's Gone" or "Hotel California,"

00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.361
miming the guitar riffs.

00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:02.603
Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:05.082
Some people turn into rockers like this.

00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:07.155
Or some people dance in clubs.

00:10:07.155 --> 00:10:10.557
People who would have enjoyed telling stories

00:10:10.557 --> 00:10:13.567
end up trolling on the Internet all night long.

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:16.962
That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.

00:10:16.962 --> 00:10:20.915
Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids

00:10:20.915 --> 00:10:23.900
playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.633
They go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."

00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:27.268
The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,

00:10:27.268 --> 00:10:31.277
but the dad alone builds castles.

00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:35.755
This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.

00:10:35.755 --> 00:10:39.547
But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.

00:10:39.547 --> 00:10:44.841
You know the song "I would love to be on TV"? Why would we love it?

00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:48.669
TV is full of people who do what we wished to do,

00:10:48.669 --> 00:10:50.609
but never got to.

00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:56.738
They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.

00:10:56.738 --> 00:10:59.888
So we start to envy them.

00:10:59.888 --> 00:11:03.982
We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.

00:11:03.982 --> 00:11:09.835
"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes."

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.125
We easily say these sorts of things.

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:15.068
We get jealous, not because we're evil,

00:11:15.068 --> 00:11:19.605
but because we have little artists pent up inside us.

00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:23.191
That's what I think.

00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:25.029
What should we do then?

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:25.806
Yes, that's right.

00:11:25.806 --> 00:11:29.000
Right now, we need to start our own art.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.009
Right this minute, we can turn off TV,

00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:32.458
log off the Internet,

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.158
get up and start to do something.

00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:36.893
Where I teach students in drama school,

00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:39.627
there's a course called Dramatics.

00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:43.817
In this course, all students must put on a play.

00:11:43.817 --> 00:11:47.929
However, acting majors are not supposed to act.

00:11:47.929 --> 00:11:49.949
They can write the play, for example,

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:52.673
and the writers may work on stage art.

00:11:52.673 --> 00:11:54.969
Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.

00:11:54.984 --> 00:11:58.732
Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it,

00:11:58.732 --> 00:12:03.295
but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:07.457
In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.

00:12:07.457 --> 00:12:12.353
I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays.

00:12:12.353 --> 00:12:15.285
I have another experience:

00:12:15.285 --> 00:12:18.919
In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.

00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:24.819
I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:29.396
Some major in art or music and think they can't write.

00:12:29.396 --> 00:12:33.123
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.

00:12:33.123 --> 00:12:34.737
It can be a simple theme:

00:12:34.737 --> 00:12:37.251
Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.

00:12:37.251 --> 00:12:41.164
There's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!

00:12:41.164 --> 00:12:43.897
I walk around and encourage them,

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:47.641
"Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.

00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.849
They only get to think for the first five minutes.

00:12:50.849 --> 00:12:54.071
The reason I make them write like crazy is because

00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:56.829
when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind,

00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:59.276
the artistic devil creeps in.

00:12:59.276 --> 00:13:03.308
This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons

00:13:03.308 --> 00:13:06.238
why you can't write:

00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:09.073
"People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!

00:13:09.073 --> 00:13:10.623
What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!"

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.200
It will say a lot of things.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.704
You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.

00:13:14.704 --> 00:13:18.776
The really good writing I've seen in my class

00:13:18.776 --> 00:13:21.449
was not from the assignments with a long deadline,

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:24.933
but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did

00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:28.335
in front of me with a pencil.

00:13:28.335 --> 00:13:30.174
The students go into a kind of trance.

00:13:30.174 --> 00:13:34.636
After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.

00:13:34.636 --> 00:13:37.601
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.

00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:39.310
So I can say this:

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.325
It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist,

00:13:43.325 --> 00:13:47.575
but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.

00:13:47.575 --> 00:13:49.284
Why we cannot be something is not important.

00:13:49.284 --> 00:13:52.434
Most artists became artists because of the one reason.

00:13:52.434 --> 00:13:56.104
When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art,

00:13:56.104 --> 00:13:58.438
enemies appear on the outside.

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:01.294
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents. (Laughter)

00:14:01.294 --> 00:14:04.395
Sometimes they look like our spouses,

00:14:04.395 --> 00:14:06.163
but they are not your parents or spouses.

00:14:06.163 --> 00:14:09.057
They are devils. Devils.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:11.001
They came to Earth briefly transformed

00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:14.947
to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.

00:14:14.947 --> 00:14:16.869
And they have a magic question.

00:14:16.869 --> 00:14:23.027
When we say, "I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center," or

00:14:23.027 --> 00:14:27.504
"I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah? A play? What for?"

00:14:27.504 --> 00:14:31.166
The magic question is, "What for?"

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:34.878
But art is not for anything.

00:14:34.878 --> 00:14:37.132
Art is the ultimate goal.

00:14:37.132 --> 00:14:41.272
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.

00:14:41.272 --> 00:14:46.778
It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.

00:14:46.778 --> 00:14:51.103
So in response to such a pragmatic question,

00:14:51.118 --> 00:14:53.537
we need to be bold.

00:14:53.537 --> 00:14:57.981
"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you,"

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:02.006
is what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway."

00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:07.106
The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities,

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:10.887
at least one of which is an artist.

00:15:10.887 --> 00:15:14.056
Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat,

00:15:14.056 --> 00:15:18.213
and in front of me I saw something related to a play.

00:15:18.213 --> 00:15:19.350
So I asked the driver, "What is this?"

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.395
He said it was his profile. "Then what are you?" I asked. "An actor," he said.

00:15:23.395 --> 00:15:26.818
He was a cabby and an actor. I asked, "What roles do you usually play?"

00:15:26.818 --> 00:15:28.844
He proudly said he played King Lear.

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:30.289
King Lear.

00:15:30.289 --> 00:15:31.915
"Who is it that can tell me who I am?" -- a great line from King Lear.

00:15:31.915 --> 00:15:35.306
That's the world I dream of.

00:15:35.306 --> 00:15:39.241
Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.

00:15:39.241 --> 00:15:41.760
Or a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter,

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.336
secretly or publicly performing their own arts.

00:15:47.336 --> 00:15:52.207
In 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.

00:15:52.207 --> 00:15:57.963
The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport

00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:01.044
and a reporter asked her a typical question:

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:03.651
"What do you have to do to become a great dancer?

00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:06.231
Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:11.226
Now, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.

00:16:11.226 --> 00:16:13.417
In 1990, she was asked this question.

00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:16.101
And here's what she answered:

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:20.018
"Just do it."

00:16:20.018 --> 00:16:21.536
Wow. I was touched.

00:16:21.536 --> 00:16:25.628
Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it.

00:16:25.628 --> 00:16:28.859
So what should we do now?

00:16:28.859 --> 00:16:32.585
Let's be artists, right now. Right away. How?

00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:33.577
Just do it!

00:16:33.577 --> 00:16:35.191
Thank you.

00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:36.995
(Applause)
