00:00:00.681 --> 00:00:03.969
I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.667
which has an equally disturbing answer.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:11.269
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence,

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.603
and the question I'm going to tackle

00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:17.684
is the one question everyone always asks:

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.296
Why does she stay?

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:23.292
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her?

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:26.269
I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.604
or an expert in domestic violence.

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:31.803
I'm just one woman with a story to tell.

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:36.316
I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:38.788
I had moved to New York City for my first job

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.084
as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.324
I had my first apartment,

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:47.524
my first little green American Express card,

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:50.552
and I had a very big secret.

00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:54.251
My secret was that I had this gun

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:57.689
loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:00.252
by the man who I thought was my soulmate,

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:03.737
many, many times.

00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:07.297
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:11.376
held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:14.561
more times than I can even remember.

00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:17.304
I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,

00:01:17.304 --> 00:01:20.488
a psychological trap disguised as love,

00:01:20.488 --> 00:01:23.340
one that millions of women and even a few men

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.721
fall into every year.

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:28.470
It may even be your story.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.513
I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:33.819
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.181
an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.

00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.473
I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies

00:01:39.473 --> 00:01:43.745
including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:47.541
I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.330
and we have three kids together.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.559
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:57.039
(Laughter)

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.758
So my first message for you is that domestic violence

00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:02.126
happens to everyone --

00:02:02.126 --> 00:02:06.302
all races, all religions, all income and education levels.

00:02:06.302 --> 00:02:08.241
It's everywhere.

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:10.761
And my second message is that everyone thinks

00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:12.879
domestic violence happens to women,

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.147
that it's a women's issue.

00:02:15.147 --> 00:02:17.366
Not exactly.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:21.478
Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse

00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:27.396
happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:29.565
in other words, in families,

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:33.430
the last place we would want or expect to find violence,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.708
which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.

00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:41.259
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.831
who would stay with a man who beats me,

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:47.238
but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.

00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:50.523
I was 22, and in the United States,

00:02:50.523 --> 00:02:54.372
women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely

00:02:54.372 --> 00:02:57.133
to be domestic violence victims

00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.948
as women of other ages,

00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:03.251
and over 500 women and girls this age

00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.822
are killed every year by abusive partners,

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:11.455
boyfriends, and husbands in the United States.

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:14.515
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing

00:03:14.515 --> 00:03:19.100
about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.165
I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:27.128
He sat next to me on the New York City subway,

00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:29.267
and he started chatting me up.

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.135
He told me two things.

00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:34.937
One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:39.292
and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:42.952
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:46.240
was that he was smart and funny

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.640
and he looked like a farm boy.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.987
He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks

00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:51.672
and this wheat-blond hair,

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:54.959
and he seemed so sweet.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.743
One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,

00:03:58.743 --> 00:04:04.317
was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.

00:04:04.317 --> 00:04:06.518
He did this especially at the beginning

00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:09.384
by idolizing me.

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:12.670
We started dating, and he loved everything about me,

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.354
that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.384
that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.

00:04:17.384 --> 00:04:19.915
He wanted to know everything about my family

00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:22.531
and my childhood and my hopes and dreams.

00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:26.165
Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.844
in a way that no one else ever had.

00:04:29.844 --> 00:04:34.169
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.689
by confessing his secret,

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.169
which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.080
he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.766
by his stepfather,

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:49.706
and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.325
even though he was very smart,

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.581
and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life.

00:04:55.581 --> 00:04:58.737
Which is why that Ivy League degree

00:04:58.737 --> 00:05:01.550
and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.121
meant so much to him.

00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.265
If you had told me

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:11.629
that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.012
would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,

00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:18.062
how short my skirts were,

00:05:18.062 --> 00:05:19.992
where I lived, what jobs I took,

00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:23.356
who my friends were and where I spent Christmas,

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.304
I would have laughed at you,

00:05:25.304 --> 00:05:28.352
because there was not a hint of violence or control

00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:31.836
or anger in Conor at the beginning.

00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:34.961
I didn't know that the first stage

00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.336
in any domestic violence relationship

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:40.988
is to seduce and charm the victim.

00:05:40.988 --> 00:05:45.748
I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.

00:05:45.748 --> 00:05:49.902
Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce,

00:05:49.902 --> 00:05:53.036
"You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,

00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:55.041
but I need to move into the next phase

00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:59.220
where I isolate you and I abuse you" — (Laughter) —

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.575
"so I need to get you out of this apartment

00:06:00.575 --> 00:06:02.216
where the neighbors can hear you scream

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:04.689
and out of this city where you have friends and family

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.995
and coworkers who can see the bruises."

00:06:07.995 --> 00:06:12.216
Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening

00:06:12.216 --> 00:06:14.947
and he told me that he had quit his job that day,

00:06:14.947 --> 00:06:17.412
his dream job,

00:06:17.412 --> 00:06:21.553
and he said that he had quit his job because of me,

00:06:21.553 --> 00:06:24.731
because I had made him feel so safe and loved

00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:27.854
that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.369
and he just wanted to get out of the city

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:33.347
and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family,

00:06:33.347 --> 00:06:36.469
and move to a tiny town in New England

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.042
where he could start his life over with me by his side.

00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:43.908
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,

00:06:43.908 --> 00:06:47.515
and my dream job,

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:50.098
but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,

00:06:50.098 --> 00:06:53.562
so I agreed, and I quit my job,

00:06:53.562 --> 00:06:56.193
and Conor and I left Manhattan together.

00:06:56.193 --> 00:07:00.559
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:04.191
that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:09.171
physical, financial and psychological trap.

00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:11.491
The next step in the domestic violence pattern

00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:15.773
is to introduce the threat of violence

00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:17.972
and see how she reacts.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:20.681
And here's where those guns come in.

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:23.599
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.337
that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --

00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:28.753
he bought three guns.

00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:32.193
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car.

00:07:32.193 --> 00:07:34.849
He kept one under the pillows on our bed,

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.011
and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.

00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:40.329
And he said that he needed those guns

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:43.125
because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:45.609
He needed them to feel protected.

00:07:45.609 --> 00:07:48.521
But those guns were really a message for me,

00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:51.215
and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,

00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:57.021
my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.

00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:00.594
Conor first physically attacked me

00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:03.419
five days before our wedding.

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:07.611
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.

00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:11.851
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,

00:08:11.851 --> 00:08:13.665
and I got frustrated,

00:08:13.665 --> 00:08:16.752
and Conor used my anger as an excuse

00:08:16.752 --> 00:08:19.903
to put both of his hands around my neck

00:08:19.903 --> 00:08:23.723
and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,

00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:25.547
and he used the chokehold

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:29.973
to hit my head repeatedly against the wall.

00:08:29.973 --> 00:08:35.291
Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,

00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.766
and I put on my mother's wedding dress,

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:40.083
and I married him.

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:42.364
Despite what had happened,

00:08:42.364 --> 00:08:45.883
I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,

00:08:45.883 --> 00:08:49.964
because I loved him, and he loved me so much.

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:53.336
And he was very, very sorry.

00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:56.509
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding

00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:58.706
and by becoming a family with me.

00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.427
It was an isolated incident,

00:09:00.427 --> 00:09:04.023
and he was never going to hurt me again.

00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:06.603
It happened twice more on the honeymoon.

00:09:06.603 --> 00:09:09.690
The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.392
and I got lost,

00:09:12.392 --> 00:09:15.362
and he punched me in the side of my head so hard

00:09:15.362 --> 00:09:17.506
that the other side of my head repeatedly hit

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:19.913
the driver's side window.

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:23.279
And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.562
he got frustrated by traffic,

00:09:25.562 --> 00:09:28.994
and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.

00:09:28.994 --> 00:09:31.602
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week

00:09:31.602 --> 00:09:35.019
for the next two and a half years of our marriage.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:38.144
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:40.787
and alone in this situation.

00:09:40.787 --> 00:09:42.978
One in three American women

00:09:42.978 --> 00:09:47.130
experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.771
and the CDC reports that 15 million children

00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:54.181
are abused every year, 15 million.

00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:58.554
So actually, I was in very good company.

00:09:58.554 --> 00:10:00.970
Back to my question:

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.465
Why did I stay?

00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:06.203
The answer is easy.

00:10:06.203 --> 00:10:08.891
I didn't know he was abusing me.

00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:12.739
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head,

00:10:12.739 --> 00:10:14.962
pushed me down stairs,

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.343
threatened to kill our dog,

00:10:16.343 --> 00:10:20.266
pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,

00:10:20.266 --> 00:10:22.783
poured coffee grinds on my head

00:10:22.783 --> 00:10:25.099
as I dressed for a job interview,

00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:29.469
I never once thought of myself as a battered wife.

00:10:29.469 --> 00:10:33.046
Instead, I was a very strong woman

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:35.298
in love with a deeply troubled man,

00:10:35.298 --> 00:10:37.355
and I was the only person on Earth

00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:40.795
who could help Conor face his demons.

00:10:40.795 --> 00:10:44.506
The other question everybody asks is,

00:10:44.506 --> 00:10:46.923
why doesn't she just leave?

00:10:46.923 --> 00:10:50.874
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.

00:10:50.874 --> 00:10:55.586
To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,

00:10:55.586 --> 00:10:58.677
because we victims know something you usually don't:

00:10:58.677 --> 00:11:03.070
It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.389
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:09.284
is kill her.

00:11:09.284 --> 00:11:11.825
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders

00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:15.893
happen after the victim has ended the relationship,

00:11:15.893 --> 00:11:17.786
after she's gotten out,

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:21.037
because then the abuser has nothing left to lose.

00:11:21.037 --> 00:11:24.128
Other outcomes include long-term stalking,

00:11:24.128 --> 00:11:27.080
even after the abuser remarries;

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.235
denial of financial resources;

00:11:29.235 --> 00:11:31.624
and manipulation of the family court system

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:34.447
to terrify the victim and her children,

00:11:34.447 --> 00:11:39.373
who are regularly forced by family court judges

00:11:39.373 --> 00:11:41.342
to spend unsupervised time

00:11:41.342 --> 00:11:45.013
with the man who beat their mother.

00:11:45.013 --> 00:11:49.188
And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?

00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:50.942
I was able to leave,

00:11:50.942 --> 00:11:53.844
because of one final, sadistic beating

00:11:53.844 --> 00:11:57.003
that broke through my denial.

00:11:57.003 --> 00:12:00.173
I realized that the man who I loved so much

00:12:00.173 --> 00:12:03.083
was going to kill me if I let him.

00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:05.598
So I broke the silence.

00:12:05.598 --> 00:12:08.428
I told everyone:

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:12.213
the police, my neighbors,

00:12:12.213 --> 00:12:16.053
my friends and family, total strangers,

00:12:16.053 --> 00:12:22.907
and I'm here today because you all helped me.

00:12:22.907 --> 00:12:25.445
We tend to stereotype victims

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:28.507
as grisly headlines,

00:12:28.507 --> 00:12:31.803
self-destructive women, damaged goods.

00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:34.806
The question, "Why does she stay?"

00:12:34.806 --> 00:12:40.442
is code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying,"

00:12:40.442 --> 00:12:43.766
as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:46.398
intent upon destroying us.

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.902
But since publishing "Crazy Love,"

00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:52.425
I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women

00:12:52.425 --> 00:12:54.870
who also got out,

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.250
who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.463
and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives --

00:13:03.463 --> 00:13:05.797
as employees, wives and mothers,

00:13:05.797 --> 00:13:10.478
lives completely free of violence, like me.

00:13:10.478 --> 00:13:14.509
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim

00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:17.953
and a typical domestic violence survivor.

00:13:17.953 --> 00:13:21.978
I remarried a kind and gentle man,

00:13:21.978 --> 00:13:24.314
and we have those three kids.

00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:27.715
I have that black lab, and I have that minivan.

00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:31.181
What I will never have again,

00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:34.139
ever,

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:36.264
is a loaded gun held to my head

00:13:36.264 --> 00:13:39.907
by someone who says that he loves me.

00:13:39.907 --> 00:13:42.538
Right now, maybe you're thinking,

00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:44.445
"Wow, this is fascinating,"

00:13:44.445 --> 00:13:47.573
or, "Wow, how stupid was she,"

00:13:47.573 --> 00:13:53.576
but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.

00:13:53.576 --> 00:13:57.093
I promise you there are several people

00:13:57.093 --> 00:13:58.835
listening to me right now

00:13:58.835 --> 00:14:01.847
who are currently being abused

00:14:01.847 --> 00:14:04.362
or who were abused as children

00:14:04.362 --> 00:14:07.732
or who are abusers themselves.

00:14:07.732 --> 00:14:09.669
Abuse could be affecting your daughter,

00:14:09.669 --> 00:14:14.962
your sister, your best friend right now.

00:14:14.962 --> 00:14:18.406
I was able to end my own crazy love story

00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:20.607
by breaking the silence.

00:14:20.607 --> 00:14:23.122
I'm still breaking the silence today.

00:14:23.122 --> 00:14:26.938
It's my way of helping other victims,

00:14:26.938 --> 00:14:30.306
and it's my final request of you.

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:33.138
Talk about what you heard here.

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:36.466
Abuse thrives only in silence.

00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:40.169
You have the power to end domestic violence

00:14:40.169 --> 00:14:43.678
simply by shining a spotlight on it.

00:14:43.678 --> 00:14:46.752
We victims need everyone.

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:50.825
We need every one of you to understand

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:54.603
the secrets of domestic violence.

00:14:54.603 --> 00:14:57.587
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it

00:14:57.587 --> 00:14:59.714
with your children, your coworkers,

00:14:59.714 --> 00:15:01.651
your friends and family.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:05.097
Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people

00:15:05.097 --> 00:15:07.912
with full futures.

00:15:07.912 --> 00:15:11.393
Recognize the early signs of violence

00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:14.226
and conscientiously intervene,

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:18.388
deescalate it, show victims a safe way out.

00:15:18.388 --> 00:15:22.383
Together we can make our beds,

00:15:22.383 --> 00:15:26.000
our dinner tables and our families

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.257
the safe and peaceful oases they should be.

00:15:29.257 --> 00:15:31.229
Thank you.

00:15:31.229 --> 00:15:38.937
(Applause)
