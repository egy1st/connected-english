00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.396
Let me tell you a story.

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:06.715
It's my first year as a new
high school science teacher,

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.035
and I'm so eager.

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:12.535
I'm so excited, I'm pouring
myself into my lesson plans.

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:18.526
But I'm slowly coming
to this horrifying realization

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.081
that my students just might
not be learning anything.

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:25.312
This happens one day:

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:28.470
I'd just assigned my class
to read this textbook chapter

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:31.544
about my favorite subject
in all of biology:

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.917
viruses and how they attack.

00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:38.055
And so I'm so excited
to discuss this with them,

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.426
and I come in and I say,
"Can somebody please explain

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.545
the main ideas and why this is so cool?"

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.987
There's silence.

00:00:49.352 --> 00:00:52.312
Finally, my favorite student,
she looks me straight in the eye,

00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:54.884
and she says, "The reading sucked."

00:00:55.257 --> 00:00:56.709
(Laughter)

00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:58.820
And then she clarified.

00:00:58.844 --> 00:01:01.343
She said, "You know what,
I don't mean that it sucks.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:03.405
I mean I didn't understand a word of it.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.992
It's boring, who cares, and it sucks."

00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:09.309
(Laughter)

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:14.199
These sympathetic smiles
spread all throughout the room now,

00:01:14.223 --> 00:01:19.032
and I realize that all of my other
students are in the same boat,

00:01:19.056 --> 00:01:22.944
that maybe they took notes or memorized
definitions from the textbook,

00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:28.047
but not one of them
really understood the main ideas.

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.721
Not one of them can tell me
why this stuff is so cool,

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:32.078
why it's so important.

00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:36.157
I'm totally clueless.

00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:38.776
I have no idea what to do next.

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.363
So the only thing I can think of is say,

00:01:42.387 --> 00:01:45.077
"Listen. Let me tell you a story.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:52.331
The main characters in the story
are bacteria and viruses.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.157
These guys are blown up
a couple million times.

00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.973
The real bacteria and viruses are so small

00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:01.251
we can't see them without a microscope,

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:03.385
and you guys might know
bacteria and viruses

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.973
because they both make us sick.

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:07.432
But what a lot of people don't know

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:11.218
is that viruses
can also make bacteria sick."

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.535
Now, the story
that I start telling my kids,

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.646
it starts out like a horror story.

00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:21.880
Once upon a time,
there's this happy little bacterium.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.957
Don't get too attached to him.

00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:25.673
(Laughter)

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:28.363
Maybe he's floating around in your stomach

00:02:28.387 --> 00:02:30.561
or in some spoiled food somewhere,

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:34.189
and all of a sudden,
he starts to not feel so good.

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.791
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch.

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:39.354
And then things get really horrible,

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:40.975
as his skin rips apart,

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.493
and he sees a virus
coming out from his insides.

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:49.051
And then it gets horrible
when he bursts open

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:52.798
and an army of viruses
floods out from his insides.

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:56.573
"Ouch" is right.

00:02:57.643 --> 00:03:00.167
If you see this, and you're a bacterium,

00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.005
this is like your worst nightmare.

00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:05.769
But if you're a virus and you see this,

00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:08.809
you cross those little legs
of yours and you think,

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:10.340
"We rock."

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:15.086
Because it took a lot of crafty work
to infect this bacterium.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.416
Here's what had to happen.

00:03:17.987 --> 00:03:21.169
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium

00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:23.701
and it slipped its DNA into it.

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:28.160
The next thing
is that virus DNA made stuff

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:31.168
that chopped up the bacteria DNA.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.881
And now that we've gotten rid
of the bacteria DNA,

00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:38.710
the virus DNA takes control of the cell

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:42.210
and it tells it to start
making more viruses.

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:46.535
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.908
that tells living things what to make.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.543
So this is kind of like going
into a car factory

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:58.519
and replacing the blueprints
with blueprints for killer robots.

00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:02.209
The workers still come
the next day, they do their job,

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:04.796
but they're following
different instructions.

00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:09.277
So replacing the bacteria
DNA with virus DNA

00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:14.123
turns the bacteria into a factory
for making viruses --

00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:17.901
that is, until it's so filled
with viruses that it bursts.

00:04:18.896 --> 00:04:22.276
But that's not the only way
that viruses infect bacteria.

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:26.283
Some are much more crafty.

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.457
(Laughter)

00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:33.776
When a secret agent virus
infects a bacterium,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.562
they do a little espionage.

00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:40.336
Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.123
is slipping his DNA
into the bacterial cell,

00:04:43.147 --> 00:04:44.742
but here's the kicker:

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:48.639
It doesn't do anything
harmful -- not at first.

00:04:49.043 --> 00:04:54.598
Instead, it silently slips
into the bacteria's own DNA,

00:04:54.622 --> 00:04:59.320
and it just stays there
like a terrorist sleeper cell,

00:04:59.344 --> 00:05:01.468
waiting for instructions.

00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:07.912
And what's interesting about this is now,
whenever this bacteria has babies,

00:05:07.936 --> 00:05:13.055
the babies also have
the virus DNA in them.

00:05:13.753 --> 00:05:17.586
So now we have a whole
extended bacteria family,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.411
filled with virus sleeper cells.

00:05:21.106 --> 00:05:25.851
They're just happily living together
until a signal happens

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:30.319
and bam! -- all of the DNA pops out.

00:05:30.343 --> 00:05:33.985
It takes control of these cells,
turns them into virus-making factories,

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.801
and they all burst,

00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:38.523
a huge, extended bacteria family,

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.668
all dying with viruses
spilling out of their guts,

00:05:41.692 --> 00:05:44.684
the viruses taking over the bacterium.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.231
So now you understand
how viruses can attack cells.

00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:52.359
There are two ways:

00:05:52.383 --> 00:05:55.342
On the left is what we call the lytic way,

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:58.675
where the viruses go right in
and take over the cells.

00:05:59.278 --> 00:06:02.349
On the [right] is the lysogenic way

00:06:02.373 --> 00:06:04.761
that uses secret agent viruses.

00:06:05.944 --> 00:06:08.198
So this stuff is not that hard, right?

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:10.221
And now all of you understand it.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.236
But if you've graduated from high school,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.046
I can almost guarantee
you've seen this information before.

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:20.553
But I bet it was presented in a way
that it didn't exactly stick in your mind.

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.587
So when my students
were first learning this,

00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:27.349
why did they hate it so much?

00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:30.086
Well, there were a couple of reasons.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.261
First of all, I can guarantee you

00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:35.667
you that their textbooks
didn't have secret agent viruses,

00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:38.157
and they didn't have horror stories.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.386
You know, in the communication of science,

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.434
there is this obsession with seriousness.

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:47.560
It kills me. I'm not kidding.

00:06:47.584 --> 00:06:49.813
I used to work
for an educational publisher,

00:06:49.837 --> 00:06:53.496
and as a writer, I was always told
never to use stories

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.408
or fun, engaging language,

00:06:55.432 --> 00:07:00.400
because then my work might not be viewed
as "serious" and "scientific."

00:07:00.848 --> 00:07:03.919
I mean, because God
forbid somebody have fun

00:07:03.943 --> 00:07:05.711
when they're learning science.

00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:10.573
So we have this field of science
that's all about slime

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.940
and color changes.

00:07:12.964 --> 00:07:14.168
Check this out.

00:07:24.496 --> 00:07:28.257
And then we have, of course,
as any good scientist has to have ...

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.472
explosions!

00:07:31.903 --> 00:07:36.569
But if a textbook seems too much fun,

00:07:36.593 --> 00:07:39.189
it's somehow unscientific.

00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:43.314
Now another problem

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:49.170
was that the language in their textbook
was truly incomprehensible.

00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:52.503
If we want to summarize that story
that I told you earlier,

00:07:52.527 --> 00:07:53.813
we could start by saying,

00:07:53.837 --> 00:07:55.979
"These viruses make copies of themselves

00:07:56.003 --> 00:07:58.337
by slipping their DNA into a bacterium."

00:07:59.003 --> 00:08:02.344
The way this showed up in the textbook,
it looked like this:

00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:05.582
"Bacteriophage replication is initiated

00:08:05.606 --> 00:08:10.248
through the introduction of viral
nucleic acid into a bacterium."

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:15.036
That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.

00:08:16.052 --> 00:08:17.233
But here's the thing:

00:08:17.257 --> 00:08:19.807
There are plenty of people
in science education

00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:21.987
who would look
at this and say there's no way

00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:24.428
that we could ever give that to students,

00:08:24.452 --> 00:08:28.904
because it contains some language
that isn't completely accurate.

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:32.499
For example, I told you
that viruses have DNA.

00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:35.126
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.094
They have something called RNA instead.

00:08:37.465 --> 00:08:40.767
So a professional science writer
would say, "That has to go.

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.381
We have to change it to something
much more technical."

00:08:43.405 --> 00:08:46.133
And after a team
of professional science editors

00:08:46.157 --> 00:08:49.966
went over this really simple explanation,

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.394
they'd find fault
with almost every word I've used,

00:08:54.418 --> 00:08:57.323
and they'd have to change anything
that wasn't serious enough,

00:08:57.347 --> 00:08:59.062
and they'd have to change everything

00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:01.568
that wasn't 100 percent perfect.

00:09:02.544 --> 00:09:04.408
Then it would be accurate,

00:09:04.432 --> 00:09:08.805
but it would be completely
impossible to understand.

00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:11.003
This is horrifying.

00:09:11.553 --> 00:09:16.422
You know, I keep talking
about this idea of telling a story,

00:09:16.446 --> 00:09:21.017
and it's like science communication
has taken on this idea

00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:24.096
of what I call the tyranny of precision,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.251
where you can't just tell a story.

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:31.893
It's like science has become
that horrible storyteller that we all know

00:09:31.917 --> 00:09:34.512
who gives us all the details
nobody cares about,

00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:38.361
where you're like, "Oh, I met
my friend for lunch the other day,

00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:40.178
and she was wearing these ugly jeans.

00:09:40.202 --> 00:09:43.202
I mean, they weren't really jeans,
they were more like leggings,

00:09:43.226 --> 00:09:45.860
but I guess they're actually
kind of more like jeggings,

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:50.197
and you're just like,
"Oh my God. What is the point?"

00:09:50.776 --> 00:09:54.736
Or even worse,
science education is becoming

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.760
like that guy who always says, "Actually."

00:09:58.735 --> 00:10:00.591
You want to be like,

00:10:00.615 --> 00:10:03.726
"Oh, dude, we had to get up
in the middle of the night

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.432
and drive a hundred miles
in total darkness."

00:10:06.456 --> 00:10:11.114
And that guy's like,
"Actually, it was 87.3 miles."

00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:15.503
And you're like, "Actually, shut up!
I'm just trying to tell a story."

00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:23.280
Because good storytelling
is all about emotional connection.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.537
We have to convince our audience

00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:28.822
that what we're talking about matters.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:34.776
But just as important is knowing
which details we should leave out

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.430
so that the main point still comes across.

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:41.262
I'm reminded of what the architect
Mies van der Rohe said,

00:10:41.286 --> 00:10:44.651
and I paraphrase,
when he said that sometimes,

00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:47.603
you have to lie
in order to tell the truth.

00:10:48.238 --> 00:10:52.753
I think this sentiment is particularly
relevant to science education.

00:10:54.952 --> 00:11:01.718
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed

00:11:01.742 --> 00:11:06.289
when people think that I'm advocating
a dumbing down of science.

00:11:06.948 --> 00:11:08.098
That's not true at all.

00:11:08.646 --> 00:11:11.423
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT,

00:11:11.447 --> 00:11:16.429
and I absolutely understand
the importance of detailed,

00:11:16.453 --> 00:11:21.322
specific scientific
communication between experts,

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:24.774
but not when we're trying
to teach 13-year-olds.

00:11:25.856 --> 00:11:30.928
If a young learner
thinks that all viruses have DNA,

00:11:30.952 --> 00:11:34.982
that's not going to ruin
their chances of success in science.

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:40.021
But if a young learner
can't understand anything in science

00:11:40.045 --> 00:11:43.980
and learns to hate it because it
all sounds like this,

00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:46.973
that will ruin their chances of success.

00:11:48.765 --> 00:11:50.071
This needs to stop ...

00:11:51.118 --> 00:11:54.912
and I wish that the change could come
from the institutions at the top

00:11:54.936 --> 00:11:56.698
that are perpetuating these problems,

00:11:56.722 --> 00:12:00.142
and I beg them,
I beseech them to just stop it.

00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:03.033
But I think that's unlikely.

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:07.048
So we are so lucky that we have resources

00:12:07.072 --> 00:12:10.206
like the Internet, where we can
circumvent these institutions

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.286
from the bottom up.

00:12:13.593 --> 00:12:16.481
There's a growing number
of online resources

00:12:16.505 --> 00:12:19.807
that are dedicated
to just explaining science

00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:22.497
in simple, understandable ways.

00:12:22.934 --> 00:12:25.290
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website

00:12:25.314 --> 00:12:29.013
that would explain
any scientific concept you can think of

00:12:29.037 --> 00:12:32.648
in simple language
any middle schooler can understand.

00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:36.965
And I myself spend most of my free time

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:40.092
making these science videos
that I put on YouTube.

00:12:40.613 --> 00:12:42.823
I explain chemical equilibrium

00:12:42.847 --> 00:12:46.327
using analogies to awkward
middle school dances,

00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:48.057
and I talk about fuel cells

00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:51.184
with stories about boys and girls
at a summer camp.

00:12:52.246 --> 00:12:55.650
The feedback that I get
is sometimes misspelled

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.817
and it's often written in LOLcats,

00:12:57.841 --> 00:12:59.055
(Laughter)

00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:04.999
but nonetheless,
it's so appreciative, so thankful

00:13:05.023 --> 00:13:11.245
that I know this is the right way
we should be communicating science.

00:13:12.073 --> 00:13:15.120
There's still so much work
left to be done, though,

00:13:15.144 --> 00:13:18.382
and if you're involved
with science in any way,

00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:20.675
I urge you to join me.

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:26.456
Pick up a camera, start
to write a blog, whatever,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.908
but leave out the seriousness,
leave out the jargon.

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:33.700
Make me laugh. Make me care.

00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:37.279
Leave out those annoying details
that nobody cares about

00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:39.652
and just get to the point.

00:13:41.049 --> 00:13:42.232
How should you start?

00:13:42.914 --> 00:13:46.626
Why don't you say,
"Listen, let me tell you a story."

00:13:48.063 --> 00:13:49.214
Thank you.
