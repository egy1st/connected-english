00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.902
This is about a hidden corner of the labor market.

00:00:03.902 --> 00:00:07.535
It's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly,

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:08.852
if they're to work at all.

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:10.019
So think, for instance,

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.637
of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition,

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:16.420
or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.267
or a parent with complex child care needs.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:22.425
Their availability for work can be such that it's,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.118
"A few hours today.

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:27.718
Maybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:30.237
And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people

00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:33.266
to find the work that they so often need very badly.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.085
Which is a tragedy because there are employers

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:39.391
who can use pools of very flexible local people

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:43.290
booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.891
Imagine that you run a cafe.

00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:47.558
It's mid-morning, the place is filling up.

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:49.141
You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:52.458
If you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.112
to start in an hour's time,

00:00:55.112 --> 00:01:00.070
you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.946
They'd have to be available at very competitive rates.

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:05.113
They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.

00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:09.045
In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business,

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.428
so you are going to muddle by, understaffed.

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:14.746
And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers,

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:18.045
it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:22.578
There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people,

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:25.729
possibly already once they've been inducted.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.762
At this level of the labor market,

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:31.612
what you need is a marketplace for spare hours.

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:33.729
They do exist. Here's how they work.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.196
So in this example, a distribution company has said,

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:40.479
we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.879
Show us everyone who's available.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.530
It's found 31 workers.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.062
Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.

00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:49.396
They're all contactable in time for this booking.

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:53.397
They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:56.811
And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.

00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:59.372
And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:01.296
Of course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:03.511
You can select as many of them as you want.

00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:04.963
They're from multiple agencies.

00:02:04.963 --> 00:02:08.895
It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.229
And it's monitoring their reliability.

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.229
The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.978
They're likely to be more expensive.

00:02:15.978 --> 00:02:19.179
In an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people,

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:20.862
here's a market research company,

00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:24.812
and it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.497
And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week.

00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:30.896
And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted

00:02:30.896 --> 00:02:33.178
are available each hour next week.

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:35.912
And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.

00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:38.529
But is there more that could be done

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.279
for this corner of the labor market?

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.965
Because right now there are so many people

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:46.563
who need whatever economic opportunity they can get.

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:48.613
Let's make it personal.

00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:51.396
Imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid,

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:53.596
very little prospect of getting a job --

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:57.312
what economic activity could she theoretically engage in?

00:02:57.312 --> 00:02:59.596
Well, she might be willing to work odd hours

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.896
in a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:06.228
She may be interested in providing local services to her community:

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.779
babysitting, local deliveries, pet care.

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.916
She may have possessions that she would like to trade

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:13.162
at times she doesn't need them.

00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:16.761
So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out.

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:20.929
She might have a bike, a video games console she only uses occasionally.

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.330
And you're probably thinking -- because you're all very web-aware --

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.895
yes, and we're in the era of collaborative consumption,

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:28.655
so she can go online and do all this.

00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:31.313
She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed,

00:03:31.313 --> 00:03:35.197
she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, "I want to do local deliveries," and so on.

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:40.547
These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:47.161
And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all.

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:51.712
Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years,

00:03:51.712 --> 00:03:55.396
but only for organizations at the top of the economy.

00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:58.396
If you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for granted

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:01.312
that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets

00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:04.895
that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time,

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:08.548
executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:11.980
It analyzes supply and demand and pricing

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.073
and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from.

00:04:14.073 --> 00:04:17.623
It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:20.057
It's all extremely low overhead.

00:04:20.057 --> 00:04:23.058
What have we gained at the bottom of the economy

00:04:23.058 --> 00:04:27.152
in terms of markets in the last 20 years?

00:04:27.152 --> 00:04:33.311
Basically classified adverts with a search facility.

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:35.324
So why do we have this disparity

00:04:35.324 --> 00:04:38.874
between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy

00:04:38.874 --> 00:04:42.490
that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.939
out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading,

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.323
and what the rest of us have?

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:51.389
A modern market is more than a website;

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.008
it's a web of interoperable marketplaces,

00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:56.542
back office mechanisms, regulatory regimes,

00:04:56.542 --> 00:05:01.439
settlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.590
And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.789
she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.405
and then post that listing on multiple websites

00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:14.905
and wait for potential buyers to get in touch

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:18.622
and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade.

00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:21.521
In the early days of this modern markets technology,

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.589
the financial institutions worked out

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:27.221
how they could leverage their buying power, their back office processes,

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.521
their relationships, their networks

00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:34.111
to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity.

00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:37.200
They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.834
and in a lot of cases they got it.

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:41.784
But throughout the economy,

00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:44.602
there are facilities that could likewise leverage

00:05:44.602 --> 00:05:46.201
a new generation of markets

00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:48.934
for the benefit of all of us.

00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:50.902
And those facilities --

00:05:50.902 --> 00:05:54.618
I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity,

00:05:54.618 --> 00:05:56.901
the licensing authorities

00:05:56.901 --> 00:06:00.734
that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time,

00:06:00.734 --> 00:06:04.402
the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.

00:06:04.402 --> 00:06:07.251
These mechanisms, these facilities

00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.800
are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.902
they're controlled by the state.

00:06:13.902 --> 00:06:16.633
And the policymakers who sit on top of them

00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:22.851
are, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used

00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:25.634
to underpin a whole new era of markets.

00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:30.351
Like everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for granted

00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:32.619
that modern markets are the preserve

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:40.530
of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.957
Suppose we stopped taking that for granted.

00:06:43.957 --> 00:06:47.123
Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.,

00:06:47.123 --> 00:06:49.305
or the leader of any other developed nation,

00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:53.156
woke up and said, "I'm never going to be able to create

00:06:53.156 --> 00:06:55.322
all the jobs I need in the current climate.

00:06:55.322 --> 00:07:00.656
I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.

00:07:00.656 --> 00:07:04.623
And for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets.

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:06.991
How do I make that happen?"

00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:09.740
And I think I can see a few eyes rolling.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.522
Politicians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?

00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:17.052
Oh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen.

00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:20.057
Not necessarily.

00:07:20.057 --> 00:07:22.905
There is a precedent for technology-enabled service

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:26.607
that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries

00:07:26.607 --> 00:07:29.423
and has been hugely successful:

00:07:29.423 --> 00:07:31.873
national lotteries.

00:07:31.873 --> 00:07:33.623
Let's take Britain as an example.

00:07:33.623 --> 00:07:36.223
Our government didn't design the national lottery,

00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:39.006
it didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.

00:07:39.006 --> 00:07:44.157
It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.

00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:47.422
This act defines what a national lottery will look like.

00:07:47.422 --> 00:07:49.090
It specifies certain benefits

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.773
that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.

00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:54.472
And it puts some obligations on those operators.

00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:57.822
In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses,

00:07:57.822 --> 00:08:00.856
this was an unqualified success.

00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:02.640
But let's suppose that our aim

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.523
is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.

00:08:06.523 --> 00:08:08.673
Could we use the same model?

00:08:08.673 --> 00:08:10.457
I believe we could.

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:14.573
So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.

00:08:14.573 --> 00:08:18.557
Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.

00:08:18.557 --> 00:08:20.406
Think of it as a regulated public utility.

00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:23.290
So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.406
And it's a series of markets for low-level trade

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:30.223
that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.

00:08:30.223 --> 00:08:32.972
And government has certain benefits

00:08:32.972 --> 00:08:35.522
it can uniquely bestow on these markets.

00:08:35.522 --> 00:08:38.306
It's about public spending going through these markets

00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:40.905
to buy public services at the local level.

00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:42.640
It's about interfacing these markets

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.290
direct into the highest official channels in the land.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.690
It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.472
It's about deregulating some sectors

00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:53.905
so that local people can enter them.

00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:56.157
So, taxi journeys might be one example.

00:08:56.157 --> 00:09:00.939
And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:02.540
to be placed on the operators,

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.040
and the key one is, of course,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.906
that the operators pay for everything,

00:09:06.906 --> 00:09:09.907
including all the interfacing into the public sector.

00:09:09.907 --> 00:09:13.473
So imagine that the operators make their return

00:09:13.473 --> 00:09:16.656
by building a percentage markup into each transaction.

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:19.090
Imagine that there's a concession period

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.523
defined of maybe 15 years

00:09:21.523 --> 00:09:25.989
in which they can take all these benefits and run with them.

00:09:25.989 --> 00:09:29.306
And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told,

00:09:29.306 --> 00:09:32.939
whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:34.431
to fund the whole thing

00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:35.806
will get the deal.

00:09:35.806 --> 00:09:37.606
So government then exits the frame.

00:09:37.606 --> 00:09:39.239
This is now in the hands of the consortium.

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:41.790
Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.874
and make a percentage on all of it

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.473
or it's all going to crash and burn,

00:09:45.473 --> 00:09:47.090
which is tough on their shareholders.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.540
It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.190
And there would be no constraints on alternative markets.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.623
So this would just be one more choice

00:09:56.623 --> 00:09:59.439
among millions of Internet forums.

00:09:59.439 --> 00:10:01.989
But it could be very different,

00:10:01.989 --> 00:10:05.607
because having access to those state-backed facilities

00:10:05.607 --> 00:10:07.940
could incentivize this consortium

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.057
to seriously invest in the service.

00:10:10.057 --> 00:10:13.124
Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going

00:10:13.124 --> 00:10:14.855
to start making their return.

00:10:14.855 --> 00:10:19.746
So we're talking about sectors like home hair care,

00:10:19.746 --> 00:10:23.703
the hire of toys, farm work,

00:10:23.703 --> 00:10:27.322
hire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door,

00:10:27.322 --> 00:10:29.129
services for tourists, home care.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:35.912
This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed,

00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:39.779
because national e-markets will deliver data.

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:42.412
So this is a local person

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:45.412
potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.

00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:48.261
And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training

00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:49.661
if they wanted to go into that market.

00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:52.279
They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.779
who wanted a pool of babysitters.

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.180
Is it worth their while?

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.880
Should they be looking at other sectors?

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.764
Should they be moving to another part of the country

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:01.013
where there's a shortage of babysitters?

00:11:01.013 --> 00:11:03.363
This kind of data can become routine.

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:05.397
And this data can be used by investors.

00:11:05.397 --> 00:11:08.563
So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country

00:11:08.563 --> 00:11:11.462
and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training,

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.046
an investor can pay for it

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:16.730
and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.379
for maybe the next two years.

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:21.680
This is a world of atomized capitalism.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.712
So it's small trades by small people,

00:11:23.712 --> 00:11:30.579
but it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.

00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:33.504
Some rough research suggests this could unlock

00:11:33.504 --> 00:11:37.705
around 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity

00:11:37.705 --> 00:11:39.655
in a country the size of the U.K.

00:11:39.655 --> 00:11:42.388
Does that sound improbable to you?

00:11:42.388 --> 00:11:46.521
That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading

00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:49.573
in financial exchanges 20 years ago.

00:11:49.573 --> 00:11:52.673
Do not underestimate the transformative power

00:11:52.673 --> 00:11:55.829
of truly modern markets.

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:57.455
Thank you.

00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:59.040
(Applause)
