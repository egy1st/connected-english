00:00:00.651 --> 00:00:03.830
It was a Saturday afternoon in May,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.344
and I suddenly realized

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:09.798
that the next day was Mother's Day,

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:11.644
and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.045
so I started thinking about

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:15.382
what should I get my mom for Mother's Day?

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.226
I thought, why don't I make her

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:20.275
an interactive Mother's Day card

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:22.983
using the Scratch software that I'd been developing

00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:26.800
with my research group at the MIT Media Lab?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.180
We developed it so that people could easily create

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.424
their own interactive stories and games and animations,

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:38.193
and then share their creations with one another.

00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:42.061
So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.961
to make an interactive card for my mom.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.137
Before making my own Mother's Day card,

00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:49.122
I thought I would take a look

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:50.695
at the Scratch website.

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:54.053
So over the last several years, kids around the world

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:57.247
ages 8 and up, have shared their projects,

00:00:57.247 --> 00:01:00.682
and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects,

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:04.067
whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:07.061
So in the search box I typed in

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:08.606
"Mother's Day,"

00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:11.609
and I was surprised and delighted to see a list

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.313
of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:16.827
that showed up on the Scratch website,

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.145
many of them just in the past 24 hours

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.351
by procrastinators just like myself.

00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.473
So I started taking a look at them. (Music)

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:27.929
I saw one of them that featured a kitten

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:34.800
and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.331
And the creator very considerately

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.835
offered a replay for her mom.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:43.219
Another one was an interactive project where,

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.417
when you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day,"

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:51.337
it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan.

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:55.320
(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.979
about how she had Googled to find out

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.096
when Mother's Day was happening.

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:05.239
(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.717
she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting

00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:11.344
of how much she loved her mom.

00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:13.569
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.221
and interacting with these projects.

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:19.062
In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project,

00:02:19.062 --> 00:02:23.816
I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter)

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:27.396
And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:28.781
She wrote back to me and she said,

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:32.048
"I'm so proud to have a son that created the software

00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:36.160
that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.960
So my mom was happy, and that made me happy,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.584
but actually I was even happier for another reason.

00:02:44.584 --> 00:02:48.543
I was happy because these kids were using Scratch

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.344
just in the way that we had hoped that they would.

00:02:51.344 --> 00:02:54.155
As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards,

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:56.436
you could see that they were really

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:59.748
becoming fluent with new technologies.

00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:01.211
What do I mean by fluent?

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:05.243
I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves

00:03:05.243 --> 00:03:08.020
and to start expressing their ideas.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.674
When you become fluent with language,

00:03:10.674 --> 00:03:14.211
it means you can write an entry in your journal

00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:18.264
or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:21.421
And it's similar with new technologies.

00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:25.603
By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards,

00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:28.133
these kids were showing that they were really fluent

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:29.806
with new technologies.

00:03:29.806 --> 00:03:32.571
Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this,

00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:35.267
because a lot of times people feel that

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:38.667
young people today can do all sorts of things with technology.

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:43.128
I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives."

00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:46.925
But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term.

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:50.426
I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.

00:03:50.426 --> 00:03:52.979
When you really look at it, how is it that young people

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.515
spend most of their time using new technologies?

00:03:56.515 --> 00:04:00.038
You often see them in situations like this,

00:04:00.038 --> 00:04:02.232
or like this,

00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:03.750
and there's no doubt that young people

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.066
are very comfortable and familiar browsing

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:11.588
and chatting and texting and gaming.

00:04:11.588 --> 00:04:14.787
But that doesn't really make you fluent.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:18.746
So young people today have lots of experience

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:22.541
and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies,

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.946
but a lot less so of creating with new technologies

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:28.918
and expressing themselves with new technologies.

00:04:28.918 --> 00:04:31.310
It's almost as if they can read

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.643
but not write with new technologies.

00:04:34.643 --> 00:04:38.541
And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent

00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:41.070
so they can write with new technologies?

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.430
And that really means that they need to be able to

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.942
write their own computer programs, or code.

00:04:48.942 --> 00:04:51.654
So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize

00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:54.958
the importance of learning to code.

00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.560
You know, in recent years, there have been

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.452
hundreds of new organizations and websites

00:05:00.452 --> 00:05:03.746
that are helping young people learn to code.

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:07.337
You look online, you'll see places like Codecademy

00:05:07.337 --> 00:05:09.708
and events like CoderDojo

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:12.139
and sites like Girls Who Code,

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.833
or Black Girls Code.

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:16.941
It seems that everybody is getting into the act.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.524
You know, just at the beginning of this year,

00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:20.889
at the turn of the new year,

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.549
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:25.809
made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.588
to code in 2012.

00:05:28.588 --> 00:05:31.756
A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that

00:05:31.756 --> 00:05:35.412
all of its first graders should learn to code.

00:05:35.412 --> 00:05:38.204
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:42.513
about whether all the children there should learn to code.

00:05:42.513 --> 00:05:45.356
Now, for some of you, when you hear about this,

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:48.964
it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.

00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:52.114
When many people think of coding, they think of it

00:05:52.114 --> 00:05:55.690
as something that only a very narrow sub-community

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.348
of people are going to be doing,

00:05:58.348 --> 00:06:01.270
and they think of coding looking like this.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.436
And in fact, if this is what coding is like,

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:05.931
it will only be a narrow sub-community of people

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.003
with special mathematical skills and technological background

00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:11.269
that can code.

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:13.769
But coding doesn't have to be like this.

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:17.748
Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.

00:06:17.748 --> 00:06:22.027
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.

00:06:22.027 --> 00:06:23.942
In this case, you take a move block,

00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:25.711
snap it into a stack,

00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:28.469
and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.987
of the different characters in your game or your story,

00:06:31.987 --> 00:06:34.288
in this case controlling the big fish.

00:06:34.288 --> 00:06:37.739
After you've created your program, you can click on "share,"

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:40.815
and then share your project with other people,

00:06:40.815 --> 00:06:42.638
so that they can use the project

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:45.612
and start working on the project as well.

00:06:45.612 --> 00:06:48.934
So, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing

00:06:48.934 --> 00:06:50.579
you can do with Scratch.

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:52.559
Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website,

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:55.383
there's everything from animated stories

00:06:55.383 --> 00:06:57.799
to school science projects

00:06:57.799 --> 00:06:59.863
to anime soap operas

00:06:59.863 --> 00:07:02.185
to virtual construction kits

00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:04.898
to recreations of classic video games

00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:07.167
to political opinion polls

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:09.807
to trigonometry tutorials

00:07:09.807 --> 00:07:12.727
to interactive artwork, and, yes,

00:07:12.727 --> 00:07:15.511
interactive Mother's Day cards.

00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:18.547
So I think there's so many different ways

00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:22.007
that people can express themselves using this,

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:25.407
to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.

00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:27.969
And it doesn't just stay on the screen.

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:31.736
You can also code to interact with the physical world around you.

00:07:31.736 --> 00:07:34.215
Here's an example from Hong Kong,

00:07:34.215 --> 00:07:35.622
where some kids made a game

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.903
and then built their own physical interface device

00:07:38.903 --> 00:07:41.795
and had a light sensor, so the light sensor

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.738
detects the hole in the board,

00:07:43.738 --> 00:07:45.938
so as they move the physical saw,

00:07:45.938 --> 00:07:48.178
the light sensor detects the hole

00:07:48.178 --> 00:07:51.134
and controls the virtual saw on the screen

00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:53.914
and saws down the tree.

00:07:53.914 --> 00:07:56.023
We're going to continue to look at new ways

00:07:56.023 --> 00:07:59.079
of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:02.007
and connecting to the world around us.

00:08:02.007 --> 00:08:04.240
This is an example from a new version of Scratch

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.863
that we'll be releasing in the next few months,

00:08:07.863 --> 00:08:09.913
and we're looking again to be able

00:08:09.913 --> 00:08:11.609
to push you in new directions.

00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:13.873
Here's an example.

00:08:13.873 --> 00:08:17.947
It uses the webcam.

00:08:17.947 --> 00:08:22.803
And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:25.688
or I can move the bug.

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:28.253
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect,

00:08:28.253 --> 00:08:30.969
where you interact with gestures in the world.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.213
But instead of just playing someone else's game,

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:35.455
you get to create the games,

00:08:35.455 --> 00:08:36.838
and if you see someone else's game,

00:08:36.838 --> 00:08:39.478
you can just say "see inside,"

00:08:39.478 --> 00:08:42.372
and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.

00:08:42.372 --> 00:08:45.927
So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is,

00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:49.048
and then, if there's so much video motion,

00:08:49.048 --> 00:08:52.427
it will then tell the balloon to pop.

00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:54.811
The same way that this uses the camera

00:08:54.811 --> 00:08:57.316
to get information into Scratch,

00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:00.323
you can also use the microphone.

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:04.307
Here's an example of a project using the microphone.

00:09:04.307 --> 00:09:06.707
So I'm going to let all of you control this game

00:09:06.707 --> 00:09:08.953
using your voices.

00:09:08.953 --> 00:09:25.409
(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping)

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:34.038
(Laughter)

00:09:34.038 --> 00:09:42.822
(Applause)

00:09:42.822 --> 00:09:45.427
As kids are creating projects like this,

00:09:45.427 --> 00:09:47.692
they're learning to code,

00:09:47.692 --> 00:09:51.626
but even more importantly, they're coding to learn.

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:53.915
Because as they learn to code,

00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:57.235
it enables them to learn many other things,

00:09:57.235 --> 00:10:00.107
opens up many new opportunities for learning.

00:10:00.107 --> 00:10:04.491
Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.

00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:07.431
When you learn to read and write, it opens up

00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:10.491
opportunities for you to learn so many other things.

00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:14.251
When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.

00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:16.439
And it's the same thing with coding.

00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:18.986
If you learn to code, you can code to learn.

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:21.540
Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.038
You learn more about how computers work.

00:10:24.038 --> 00:10:26.356
But that's just where it starts.

00:10:26.356 --> 00:10:28.951
When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn

00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:31.196
many other things.

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:33.542
Let me show you an example.

00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:35.812
Here's another project,

00:10:35.812 --> 00:10:38.080
and I saw this when I was visiting

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.222
one of the computer clubhouses.

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:43.242
These are after-school learning centers that we helped start

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:46.004
that help young people from low-income communities

00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:50.083
learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:52.878
And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago,

00:10:52.878 --> 00:10:56.603
I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software

00:10:56.603 --> 00:10:59.499
to create a game somewhat like this one,

00:10:59.499 --> 00:11:02.422
and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game,

00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:05.387
but also he wanted to do more.

00:11:05.387 --> 00:11:07.691
He wanted to keep score.

00:11:07.691 --> 00:11:10.767
So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish,

00:11:10.767 --> 00:11:13.694
but he wanted to keep score, so that each time

00:11:13.694 --> 00:11:17.072
the big fish eats the little fish,

00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:19.611
the score would go up and it would keep track,

00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:22.123
and he didn't know how to do that.

00:11:22.123 --> 00:11:24.388
So I showed him.

00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:27.965
In Scratch, you can create something called a variable.

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:32.092
I'll call it score.

00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:34.923
And that creates some new blocks for you,

00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:39.589
and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score,

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:44.841
so each time I click on "change score," it increments the score.

00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:47.366
So I showed this to the clubhouse member --

00:11:47.366 --> 00:11:50.067
let's call him Victor -- and Victor,

00:11:50.067 --> 00:11:52.869
when he saw that this block would let him increment the score,

00:11:52.869 --> 00:11:54.685
he knew exactly what to do.

00:11:54.685 --> 00:11:56.999
He took the block

00:11:56.999 --> 00:12:00.043
and he put it into the program

00:12:00.043 --> 00:12:04.236
exactly where the big fish eats the little fish.

00:12:04.236 --> 00:12:09.259
So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish,

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:15.254
he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.

00:12:15.254 --> 00:12:16.951
And it's in fact working.

00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:19.205
And he saw this, and he was so excited,

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:20.884
he reached his hand out to me,

00:12:20.884 --> 00:12:23.433
and he said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."

00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:25.502
And what went through my mind was,

00:12:25.502 --> 00:12:28.544
how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students

00:12:28.544 --> 00:12:31.947
for teaching them variables? (Laughter)

00:12:31.947 --> 00:12:34.428
It doesn't happen in most classrooms,

00:12:34.428 --> 00:12:37.387
but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables,

00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:39.895
they don't know why they're learning it.

00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:42.766
It's nothing that, really, they can make use of.

00:12:42.766 --> 00:12:44.928
When you learn ideas like this in Scratch,

00:12:44.928 --> 00:12:49.031
you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you,

00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:52.021
that you can understand the reason for learning variables,

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.063
and we see that kids learn it more deeply

00:12:54.063 --> 00:12:55.478
and learn it better.

00:12:55.478 --> 00:12:58.519
Victor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools,

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:00.707
but he really didn't -- he wasn't paying attention.

00:13:00.707 --> 00:13:02.990
Now he had a reason for learning variables.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.064
So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn,

00:13:06.064 --> 00:13:10.948
you're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things.

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:14.403
So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this,

00:13:14.403 --> 00:13:17.187
they're learning important concepts like variables,

00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:19.315
but that's just the start.

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:23.165
As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts,

00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:26.417
he was also learning about the process of design,

00:13:26.417 --> 00:13:29.036
how to start with the glimmer of an idea

00:13:29.036 --> 00:13:31.942
and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project

00:13:31.942 --> 00:13:34.449
like you see here.

00:13:34.449 --> 00:13:38.489
So he was learning many different core principles of design,

00:13:38.489 --> 00:13:41.731
about how to experiment with new ideas,

00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:46.436
how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts,

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:49.426
how to collaborate with other people on your projects,

00:13:49.426 --> 00:13:52.877
about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong,

00:13:52.877 --> 00:13:55.931
how to keep persistent and to persevere

00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:59.336
in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well.

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:01.109
Now those are important skills

00:14:01.109 --> 00:14:03.977
that aren't just relevant for coding.

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:06.804
They're relevant for all sorts of different activities.

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:09.972
Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become

00:14:09.972 --> 00:14:12.896
a programmer or a professional computer scientist?

00:14:12.896 --> 00:14:14.708
It's probably not so likely,

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:16.496
but regardless of what he does,

00:14:16.496 --> 00:14:20.200
he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.784
Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager

00:14:22.784 --> 00:14:25.904
or a mechanic or a community organizer,

00:14:25.904 --> 00:14:28.360
that these ideas are useful for everybody.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.282
Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language.

00:14:32.282 --> 00:14:36.638
When you become fluent with reading and writing,

00:14:36.638 --> 00:14:39.079
it's not something that you're doing

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:41.039
just to become a professional writer.

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:43.736
Very few people become professional writers.

00:14:43.736 --> 00:14:47.304
But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.

00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:49.399
Again, the same thing with coding.

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:51.621
Most people won't grow up to become professional

00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:54.840
computer scientists or programmers,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.178
but those skills of thinking creatively,

00:14:57.178 --> 00:14:59.692
reasoning systematically, working collaboratively --

00:14:59.692 --> 00:15:02.402
skills you develop when you code in Scratch --

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:07.224
are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives.

00:15:07.224 --> 00:15:09.600
And it's not just about your work life.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.320
Coding can also enable you to

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.496
express your ideas and feelings in your personal life.

00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:18.169
Let me end with just one more example.

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:21.296
So this is an example that came from

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:25.764
after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom,

00:15:25.764 --> 00:15:28.865
she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.

00:15:28.865 --> 00:15:31.896
So she made this project for my birthday

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:35.472
and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.

00:15:35.472 --> 00:15:39.328
Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design,

00:15:39.328 --> 00:15:42.303
and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom

00:15:42.303 --> 00:15:46.540
is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.512
But working on this project enabled her

00:15:49.512 --> 00:15:52.178
to make a connection to someone that she cares about

00:15:52.178 --> 00:15:54.986
and enabled her to keep on learning new things

00:15:54.986 --> 00:15:57.418
and continuing to practice her creativity

00:15:57.418 --> 00:16:00.593
and developing new ways of expressing herself.

00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:04.804
So as we take a look and we see that

00:16:04.804 --> 00:16:07.368
Michael Bloomberg is learning to code,

00:16:07.368 --> 00:16:10.018
all of the children of Estonia learn to code,

00:16:10.018 --> 00:16:12.218
even my mom has learned to code,

00:16:12.218 --> 00:16:13.990
don't you think it's about time that you might be

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.902
thinking about learning to code?

00:16:15.902 --> 00:16:18.095
If you're interested in giving it a try,

00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:20.531
I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website.

00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:22.556
It's scratch.mit.edu,

00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:24.378
and give a try at coding.

00:16:24.378 --> 00:16:28.496
Thanks very much. (Applause)
