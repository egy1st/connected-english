00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:03.166
Human beings start putting each other into boxes

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.983
the second that they see each other --

00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:08.053
Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive?

00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:11.319
Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.853
We do this little interrogation when we meet people

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:16.020
to make a mental resume for them.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.537
What's your name? Where are you from?

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:20.898
How old are you? What do you do?

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:23.699
Then we get more personal with it.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.847
Have you ever had any diseases?

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:28.834
Have you ever been divorced?

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:32.280
Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.997
What are you into? Who are you into?

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:35.863
What gender do you like to sleep with?

00:00:35.863 --> 00:00:38.293
I get it.

00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:40.045
We are neurologically hardwired

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:42.429
to seek out people like ourselves.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.614
We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough

00:00:44.614 --> 00:00:46.547
to know what acceptance feels like.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.897
We bond together based on anything that we can --

00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:54.349
music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.

00:00:54.349 --> 00:01:01.237
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices.

00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:03.698
Sometimes, though, just the question "what do you do?"

00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:05.658
can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:07.187
and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:10.754
Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting.

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:12.638
The boxes are too narrow.

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:14.755
And this can get really dangerous.

00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:16.536
So here's a disclaimer about me, though,

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:18.138
before we get too deep into this.

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:21.123
I grew up in a very sheltered environment.

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:25.069
I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s,

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.964
two blocks from the epicenter of punk music.

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:31.054
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry

00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:35.154
and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing.

00:01:35.154 --> 00:01:38.575
Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker

00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:40.703
or a performance artist of some kind,

00:01:40.703 --> 00:01:42.687
you were the weirdo.

00:01:42.687 --> 00:01:43.970
(Laughter)

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.055
It was an unorthodox upbringing,

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.566
but as a kid on the streets of New York,

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.537
you learn how to trust your own instincts,

00:01:50.537 --> 00:01:53.470
you learn how to go with your own ideas.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.709
So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.176
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them.

00:02:00.176 --> 00:02:01.609
They said they wouldn't let girls play.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.019
So I went home, and I shaved my head,

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:05.641
and I came back the next day and I said, "I'm a boy."

00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:06.655
I mean, who knows, right?

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:10.468
When you're six, maybe you can do that.

00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:14.101
I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't.

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.743
I kept up the charade for eight years.

00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:20.910
So this is me when I was 11.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.421
I was playing a kid named Walter

00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:24.610
in a movie called "Julian Po."

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.044
I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:30.094
See, I was also a child actor,

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:32.776
which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity,

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:38.864
because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy.

00:02:38.864 --> 00:02:41.980
In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl --

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.296
not my teachers at school, not my friends,

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.148
not the directors that I worked with.

00:02:46.148 --> 00:02:48.413
Kids would often come up to me in class

00:02:48.413 --> 00:02:50.647
and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple

00:02:50.647 --> 00:02:53.996
or grab my crotch to check what I was working with.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:56.357
When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:58.912
so that it looked like I was peeing standing up.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.980
At sleepovers I would have panic attacks

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.364
trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me

00:03:03.364 --> 00:03:05.096
without outing myself.

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:07.148
It's worth mentioning though

00:03:07.148 --> 00:03:10.997
that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia.

00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:12.764
I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body.

00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:14.796
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act.

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:18.623
I wouldn't have qualified as transgender.

00:03:18.623 --> 00:03:20.869
If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy,

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:22.592
they probably would have diagnosed me

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:24.378
as something like gender dysmorphic

00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:26.781
and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.

00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:27.665
But in my particular case,

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.380
I just woke up one day when I was 14,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.963
and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.

00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.963
Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant,

00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:38.588
and I was ready to figure out who I actually was.

00:03:38.588 --> 00:03:40.993
When a kid behaves like I did,

00:03:40.993 --> 00:03:42.829
they don't exactly have to come out, right?

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.090
No one is exactly shocked.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.834
(Laughter)

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:53.297
But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents.

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:55.163
When I was 15, and I called my father

00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:56.863
to tell him that I had fallen in love,

00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:59.163
it was the last thing on either of our minds

00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:00.779
to discuss what the consequences were

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:03.197
of the fact that my first love was a girl.

00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:05.479
Three years later, when I fell in love with a man,

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.063
neither of my parents batted an eyelash either.

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:11.446
See, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood

00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:13.480
that I wasn't ever asked to define myself

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.827
as any one thing at any point.

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:19.646
I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment.

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:22.691
So four, almost five years ago,

00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:26.006
Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate,

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:27.981
was raising a lot of dust around this country.

00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:30.592
And at the time, getting married wasn't really something

00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:31.725
I spent a lot of time thinking about.

00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:34.531
But I was struck by the fact that America,

00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:36.596
a country with such a tarnished civil rights record,

00:04:36.596 --> 00:04:39.212
could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:41.180
And I remember watching the discussion on television

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.981
and thinking how interesting it was

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.012
that the separation of church and state

00:04:46.012 --> 00:04:49.631
was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country,

00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:51.213
between places where people believed in it

00:04:51.213 --> 00:04:52.998
and places where people didn't.

00:04:52.998 --> 00:04:59.246
And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me.

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:02.364
If this was a war with two disparate sides,

00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:05.145
I, by default, fell on team gay,

00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:08.331
because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight.

00:05:08.331 --> 00:05:11.580
At the time I was just beginning to emerge

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.497
from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:17.330
that saw me go from being a boy

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.552
to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:23.342
to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy,

00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:26.008
over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl

00:05:26.008 --> 00:05:29.976
to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was,

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:32.383
a tomboyish girl

00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:35.592
who liked both boys and girls depending on the person.

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:40.743
I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself,

00:05:40.743 --> 00:05:42.409
who fell kind of between-the-lines --

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.946
girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear,

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:49.904
girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish,

00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:52.899
girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees,

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:55.997
girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls

00:05:55.997 --> 00:05:57.846
who all hated being boxed in to anything.

00:05:57.846 --> 00:06:01.597
I loved these people, and I admired their freedom,

00:06:01.597 --> 00:06:04.530
but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.380
exploded into these raging debates

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.946
where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television.

00:06:11.946 --> 00:06:14.279
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:19.646
that I was a minority, and in my own home country,

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:22.297
based on one facet of my character.

00:06:22.297 --> 00:06:27.912
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.

00:06:27.912 --> 00:06:29.446
I was not an activist.

00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:31.946
I wave no flags in my own life.

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:34.085
But I was plagued by this question:

00:06:34.085 --> 00:06:37.031
How could anyone vote to strip the rights

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:39.196
of the vast variety of people that I knew

00:06:39.196 --> 00:06:42.630
based on one element of their character?

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.146
How could they say that we as a group

00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:47.079
were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else?

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:49.446
Were we even a group? What group?

00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:53.313
And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:57.356
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was?

00:06:57.356 --> 00:06:59.247
And then it occurred to me,

00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:01.530
perhaps if they could look into the eyes

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.311
of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship

00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:07.213
it might make it harder for them to do.

00:07:07.213 --> 00:07:09.197
It might give them pause.

00:07:09.197 --> 00:07:15.037
Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party,

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:19.368
so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically

00:07:19.368 --> 00:07:22.334
without any artifice, without any lighting,

00:07:22.334 --> 00:07:25.568
or without any manipulation of any kind on my part.

00:07:25.568 --> 00:07:28.318
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers

00:07:28.318 --> 00:07:31.034
without the fear of him ripping your face off.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:34.431
For me, photography is not just about exposing film,

00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:36.384
it's about exposing the viewer

00:07:36.384 --> 00:07:38.485
to something new, a place they haven't gone before,

00:07:38.485 --> 00:07:41.800
but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.644
Life magazine introduced generations of people

00:07:43.644 --> 00:07:47.718
to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures.

00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:53.951
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits,

00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:55.701
mugshots if you will.

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:59.469
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:01.870
that was not 100 percent straight,

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.053
which, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people.

00:08:05.053 --> 00:08:07.103
(Laughter)

00:08:07.103 --> 00:08:09.769
So this was a very large undertaking,

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:11.653
and to do it we needed some help.

00:08:11.653 --> 00:08:14.186
So I ran out in the freezing cold,

00:08:14.186 --> 00:08:17.594
and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to

00:08:17.594 --> 00:08:21.564
in February of about two years ago.

00:08:21.564 --> 00:08:25.687
And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help.

00:08:25.687 --> 00:08:28.053
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York.

00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:31.064
And then we made this.

00:08:31.064 --> 00:08:43.341
(Music)

00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:47.524
Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City.

00:08:47.524 --> 00:09:00.832
(Music)

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:05.494
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today.

00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:07.117
My aim is to take a simple portrait

00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:09.767
of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:14.987
or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way.

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:17.985
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us

00:09:17.985 --> 00:09:20.103
through the simplicity of a face.

00:09:20.103 --> 00:09:22.791
(Music)

00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:25.881
"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:28.298
It's written in the Declaration of Independence.

00:09:28.298 --> 00:09:29.565
We are failing as a nation

00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:31.674
to uphold the morals upon which we were founded.

00:09:31.674 --> 00:09:33.881
There is no equality in the United States.

00:09:33.896 --> 00:09:36.279
["What does equality mean to you?"]

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.917
["Marriage"] ["Freedom"] ["Civil rights"]

00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:40.043
["Treat every person as you'd treat yourself"]

00:09:40.043 --> 00:09:43.663
It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that.

00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:46.453
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.

00:09:46.453 --> 00:09:50.549
Today in 29 states, more than half of this country,

00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:54.920
you can legally be fired just for your sexuality.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.071
["Who is responsible for equality?"]

00:09:58.071 --> 00:10:01.082
I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer:

00:10:01.082 --> 00:10:04.558
"We are all responsible for equality."

00:10:04.558 --> 00:10:07.411
So far we've shot 300 faces in New York City.

00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.827
And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it

00:10:08.827 --> 00:10:11.712
without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign.

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:13.661
I want to take the project across the country.

00:10:13.661 --> 00:10:17.744
I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people.

00:10:17.744 --> 00:10:21.727
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation.

00:10:21.727 --> 00:10:23.904
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people

00:10:23.904 --> 00:10:26.766
and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.

00:10:26.766 --> 00:10:28.806
(Music)

00:10:28.806 --> 00:10:31.073
["Self evident truths"]

00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.752
["4,000 faces across America"]

00:10:32.753 --> 00:10:37.309
(Music)

00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:45.557
(Applause)

00:10:45.557 --> 00:10:49.840
iO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.090
Almost 85,000 people watched that video,

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.590
and then they started emailing us from all over the country,

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.257
asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces.

00:11:00.257 --> 00:11:04.607
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated.

00:11:04.607 --> 00:11:08.108
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces.

00:11:08.108 --> 00:11:12.173
That video was made in the spring of 2011,

00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:15.630
and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.536
and photographed almost 2,000 people.

00:11:18.536 --> 00:11:21.546
I know that this is a talk,

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:24.812
but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet

00:11:24.812 --> 00:11:26.061
and have you just look at these faces

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:29.931
because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them.

00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:32.464
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words,

00:11:32.464 --> 00:11:35.803
then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary.

00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:00.748
So after traveling and talking to people

00:12:00.748 --> 00:12:04.596
in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas,

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:08.131
we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on.

00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:10.017
Visibility really is key.

00:12:10.017 --> 00:12:13.280
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.730
Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family,

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.647
you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it

00:12:19.647 --> 00:12:21.213
or explore a new perspective on it.

00:12:21.213 --> 00:12:23.864
Of course, in my travels I met people

00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:28.063
who legally divorced their children for being other than straight,

00:12:28.063 --> 00:12:30.431
but I also met people who were Southern Baptists

00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:33.447
who switched churches because their child was a lesbian.

00:12:33.447 --> 00:12:37.597
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths.

00:12:37.597 --> 00:12:41.013
But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting:

00:12:41.013 --> 00:12:45.363
Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us.

00:12:45.363 --> 00:12:48.747
In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them.

00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:50.846
It presents, not just the complexities

00:12:50.846 --> 00:12:53.013
found in a procession of different human beings,

00:12:53.013 --> 00:12:56.613
but the complexities found within each individual person.

00:12:56.613 --> 00:13:01.498
It wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few.

00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:14.303
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph "gays" was inherently flawed,

00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:17.491
because there were a million different shades of gay.

00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:20.237
Here I was trying to help,

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:23.430
and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid --

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.936
yet another box.

00:13:25.936 --> 00:13:29.156
At some point I added a question to the release form

00:13:29.156 --> 00:13:31.085
that asked people to quantify themselves

00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:33.885
on a scale of one to 100 percent gay.

00:13:33.885 --> 00:13:37.801
And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me.

00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:40.602
(Laughter)

00:13:40.602 --> 00:13:41.802
People didn't know what to do

00:13:41.802 --> 00:13:44.205
because they had never been presented with the option before.

00:13:44.205 --> 00:13:46.392
Can you quantify your openness?

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:48.302
Once they got over the shock, though,

00:13:48.302 --> 00:13:52.385
by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent

00:13:52.385 --> 00:13:54.902
or the 3 to 20 percent marks.

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:57.603
Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other,

00:13:57.603 --> 00:14:00.071
but I found that a much larger proportion of people

00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:02.920
identified as something that was much more nuanced.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:09.129
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as "Grey."

00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:13.113
Let me be clear though -- and this is very important --

00:14:13.113 --> 00:14:17.829
in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist.

00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:22.629
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative,

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:25.496
because if any of you happen to be of the belief

00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:27.363
that sexual orientation is a choice,

00:14:27.363 --> 00:14:28.896
I invite you to go out and try to be grey.

00:14:28.896 --> 00:14:31.162
I'll take your picture just for trying.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.545
(Laughter)

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:36.962
What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional.

00:14:36.962 --> 00:14:42.730
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this:

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.947
If you have gay people over here

00:14:44.947 --> 00:14:48.595
and you have straight people over here,

00:14:48.595 --> 00:14:51.563
and while we recognize that most people identify

00:14:51.563 --> 00:14:54.266
as somewhere closer to one binary or another,

00:14:54.266 --> 00:14:59.212
there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between.

00:14:59.212 --> 00:15:02.246
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one.

00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:04.530
Because, for example, if you pass a law

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.033
that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior,

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:10.800
where exactly do you draw the line?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.666
Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far?

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:17.967
Or is it over here

00:15:17.967 --> 00:15:22.066
by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far?

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:26.716
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen?

00:15:26.716 --> 00:15:31.532
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:35.834
is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is.

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:38.445
After traveling so much and meeting so many people,

00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:41.950
let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.899
and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:47.849
and every other polarization you can possibly think of

00:15:47.849 --> 00:15:49.983
within the LGBT community

00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:53.499
as there are within the human race.

00:15:53.499 --> 00:15:58.117
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs,

00:15:58.117 --> 00:16:01.782
and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle,

00:16:01.782 --> 00:16:03.183
just being other than straight

00:16:03.183 --> 00:16:08.199
doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common.

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:16.600
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.799
as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms,

00:16:19.799 --> 00:16:25.258
bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers,

00:16:25.258 --> 00:16:28.333
perhaps in watching this procession of humanity,

00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:31.250
something interesting and useful will begin to happen.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.967
Hopefully these categories, these binaries,

00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:36.716
these over-simplified boxes

00:16:36.716 --> 00:16:41.782
will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.

00:16:41.782 --> 00:16:45.200
Because really, they describe nothing that we see

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.549
and no one that we know and nothing that we are.

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:54.150
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.733
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity.

00:16:57.733 --> 00:17:02.074
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights.

00:17:02.074 --> 00:17:05.633
So is it me particularly

00:17:05.633 --> 00:17:09.135
that you would choose to deny the right to housing,

00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:12.116
the right to adopt children, the right to marriage,

00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:15.749
the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here?

00:17:15.749 --> 00:17:17.828
Am I the one that you choose to disown

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:22.250
as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father,

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.598
your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president,

00:17:24.598 --> 00:17:28.048
your police woman or the fireman?

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:31.066
It's too late.

00:17:31.066 --> 00:17:34.367
Because I already am all of those things.

00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:38.732
We already are all of those things, and we always have been.

00:17:38.732 --> 00:17:41.538
So please don't greet us as strangers,

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:45.091
greet us as your fellow human beings, period.

00:17:45.091 --> 00:17:46.407
Thank you.

00:17:46.407 --> 00:17:57.334
(Applause)
