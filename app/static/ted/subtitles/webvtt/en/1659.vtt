00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:06.991
I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother

00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.391
who died in her exile:

00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.256
"Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him.

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:17.463
But don't you ever turn

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:23.586
into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary."

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:25.740
Almost two years have passed

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.556
since the Libyan Revolution broke out,

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:33.306
inspired by the waves of mass mobilization

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:38.106
in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions.

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:43.206
I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:45.406
to call for a day of rage

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:51.890
and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.923
And there it was, a great revolution.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:59.623
Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:02.807
calling for the fall of the regime,

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:08.023
raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:11.063
They have shown an exemplary bravery

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:15.130
in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.645
They have shown a great sense of solidarity

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:22.129
from the far east to the far west to the south.

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:28.045
Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:33.513
and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead,

00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:38.896
we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant.

00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:45.145
(Applause)

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:49.579
However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden,

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.914
a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions.

00:01:56.914 --> 00:02:01.215
For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:09.664
destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:13.364
Aware of the devastation and the challenges,

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:20.147
I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:23.639
calling for an inclusive and just transition

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.706
to democracy and national reconciliation.

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:30.523
Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:33.422
during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi --

00:02:33.422 --> 00:02:36.323
almost 300 in Tripoli.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:42.273
After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya,

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:44.490
and with unique enthusiasm,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.972
I started organizing workshops

00:02:46.972 --> 00:02:51.804
on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.339
With an amazing group of women,

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:58.121
I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace,

00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:02.989
a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.590
to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.740
and to lobby for our right

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.857
for equal participation in building democracy and peace.

00:03:14.857 --> 00:03:20.573
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,

00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:24.557
an environment which was increasingly polarized,

00:03:24.557 --> 00:03:34.025
an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:38.107
I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace

00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:42.241
to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law,

00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:46.706
a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background,

00:03:46.706 --> 00:03:49.790
the right to vote and run,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.941
and most importantly to stipulate on political parties

00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:58.656
the alternation of male and female candidates

00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:02.040
vertically and horizontally in their lists,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.873
creating the zipper list.

00:04:04.873 --> 00:04:11.218
Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:16.990
Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.255
in the first elections ever in 52 years.

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:28.006
(Applause)

00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:34.474
However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:38.206
and of the revolution as a whole,

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:39.790
was fading out --

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.256
for every day we were waking up to the news of violence.

00:04:44.256 --> 00:04:46.490
One day we wake up to the news

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.962
of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.

00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:51.757
On another day we wake up to the news

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:56.258
of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.

00:04:56.258 --> 00:04:58.340
On another day we wake up to the news

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.857
of the assassination of army officers.

00:05:01.857 --> 00:05:07.424
And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias

00:05:07.424 --> 00:05:12.274
and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners

00:05:12.274 --> 00:05:16.206
and their disrespect of the rule of law.

00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:19.742
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,

00:05:19.742 --> 00:05:21.703
became more polarized

00:05:21.703 --> 00:05:25.381
and has driven away from the ideals and the principles --

00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:28.447
freedom, dignity, social justice --

00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:30.147
that we first held.

00:05:30.147 --> 00:05:34.257
Intolerance, exclusion and revenge

00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:39.289
became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.939
I am here today not at all to inspire you

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.123
with our success story of the zipper list and the elections.

00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:50.324
I'm rather here today to confess

00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:57.106
that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:59.929
We did not prioritize right.

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:07.323
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.

00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:12.623
Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates

00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:15.656
bring peace and national reconciliation?

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:18.073
No, it didn't.

00:06:18.073 --> 00:06:20.023
What is it, then?

00:06:20.023 --> 00:06:26.206
Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated

00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:33.507
with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?

00:06:33.507 --> 00:06:38.026
Maybe what was missing was not the women only,

00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:45.230
but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.603
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building

00:06:49.603 --> 00:06:51.403
more than it needed the elections,

00:06:51.403 --> 00:06:55.388
which only reinforced polarization and division.

00:06:55.388 --> 00:07:01.653
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:07.670
more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:14.367
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:19.967
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.

00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:23.601
We need to develop a feminine discourse

00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:27.734
that not only honors but also implements

00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:36.098
mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,

00:07:36.098 --> 00:07:39.317
inclusion instead of exclusion.

00:07:39.317 --> 00:07:42.424
These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:45.899
needs desperately in order to achieve peace.

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:48.083
For peace has an alchemy,

00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:55.166
and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation

00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:58.666
between the feminine and masculine perspectives.

00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:00.717
That's the real zipper.

00:08:00.717 --> 00:08:03.766
And we need to establish that existentially

00:08:03.766 --> 00:08:06.217
before we do so sociopolitically.

00:08:06.217 --> 00:08:09.116
According to a Quranic verse

00:08:09.116 --> 00:08:15.617
"Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem."

00:08:15.617 --> 00:08:21.352
In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,

00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:26.053
has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb --

00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:31.887
symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity

00:08:31.887 --> 00:08:34.003
from which the male and the female,

00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:39.536
from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.

00:08:39.536 --> 00:08:48.547
And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,

00:08:48.547 --> 00:08:56.313
the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.

00:08:56.313 --> 00:09:01.680
Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things."

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.680
Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger."

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.263
May we all be granted a grace of mercy.

00:09:12.263 --> 00:09:16.083
(Applause)

00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:18.187
Thank you.

00:09:18.187 --> 00:09:23.607
(Applause)
