00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:03.544
Salaam alaikum.

00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:05.230
Welcome to Doha.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.632
I am in charge of making this country's food secure.

00:00:08.632 --> 00:00:10.683
That is my job for the next two years,

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:13.099
to design an entire master plan,

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.632
and then for the next 10 years to implement it --

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:18.652
of course, with so many other people.

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:23.299
But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story,

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:27.167
about the story of this country that you're all here in today.

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:30.717
And of course, most of you have had three meals today,

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:35.250
and probably will continue to have after this event.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.683
So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s?

00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:43.883
We were about 11,000 people living here.

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:50.899
There was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.294
Most of the people who lived here

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:54.766
either lived in coastal villages, fishing,

00:00:54.766 --> 00:01:00.716
or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water.

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:04.118
None of the glamour that you see today existed.

00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:09.266
No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh.

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.883
It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities.

00:01:11.883 --> 00:01:13.982
Resources weren't there to develop them.

00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:16.815
And you can see that life expectancy was also short.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:18.717
Most people died around the age of 50.

00:01:18.717 --> 00:01:22.516
So let's move to chapter two: the oil era.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:25.733
1939, that's when they discovered oil.

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:30.533
But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.983
until after the Second World War.

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:35.117
What did it do?

00:01:35.117 --> 00:01:38.417
It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.

00:01:38.417 --> 00:01:42.149
It also made all those people who roamed around the desert --

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.433
looking for water, looking for food,

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:49.536
trying to take care of their livestock -- urbanize.

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:51.500
You might find this strange,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.349
but in my family we have different accents.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.349
My mother has an accent that is so different to my father,

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:04.383
and we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country.

00:02:04.383 --> 00:02:07.917
There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:11.733
Someone says, "How so? How could this happen?"

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.516
Because we lived scattered.

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:18.668
We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources.

00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:22.479
And when the resources came, be it oil,

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.533
we started building these fancy technologies

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.183
and bringing people together because we needed the concentration.

00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:31.567
People started to get to know each other.

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:35.516
And we realized that there are some differences in accents.

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:38.451
So that is the chapter two: the oil era.

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.566
Let's look at today.

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:45.292
This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha.

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:46.683
So what's the population today?

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:48.933
It's 1.7 million people.

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:51.632
That is in less than 60 years.

00:02:51.632 --> 00:02:57.534
The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years.

00:02:57.534 --> 00:03:00.367
Lifespan has increased to 78.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:05.176
Water consumption has increased to 430 liters.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:08.583
And this is amongst the highest worldwide.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.750
From having no water whatsoever

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.234
to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation.

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:20.000
I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.200
But what is interesting about the story that I've just said?

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.383
The interesting part is that we continue to grow

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:35.983
15 percent every year for the past five years without water.

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:40.933
Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history.

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:44.866
Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water.

00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:47.382
This is history being made in this region.

00:03:47.382 --> 00:03:49.299
Not only cities that we're building,

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.452
but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors.

00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:57.601
Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house.

00:03:57.601 --> 00:04:03.800
These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.769
But of course, with the use of technology.

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:12.283
So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.

00:04:12.283 --> 00:04:15.134
Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate.

00:04:15.134 --> 00:04:17.150
The question is how.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.416
How could we survive that?

00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:22.500
We have no water whatsoever.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.799
Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.

00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:32.967
Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything.

00:04:32.967 --> 00:04:37.466
It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of,

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:40.466
probably most of you used it coming to Doha.

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:43.367
So that is our lake, if you can see it.

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:45.216
That is our river.

00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:50.558
That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water.

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:57.184
This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination.

00:04:57.184 --> 00:04:59.452
So what are the risks?

00:04:59.452 --> 00:05:01.002
Do you worry much?

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:04.918
I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts,

00:05:04.918 --> 00:05:07.509
you will realize, of course I have to worry.

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.018
There is growing demand, growing population.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.267
We've turned seven billion only a few months ago.

00:05:13.267 --> 00:05:16.759
And so that number also demands food.

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.967
And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050.

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:22.823
So a country that has no water

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.474
has to worry about what happens beyond its borders.

00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:28.806
There's also changing diets.

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:32.872
By elevating to a higher socio-economic level,

00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:35.055
they also change their diet.

00:05:35.055 --> 00:05:38.055
They start eating more meat and so on and so forth.

00:05:38.055 --> 00:05:40.408
On the other hand, there is declining yields

00:05:40.408 --> 00:05:43.106
because of climate change and because of other factors.

00:05:43.106 --> 00:05:48.274
And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen.

00:05:48.274 --> 00:05:52.089
This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know.

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.439
We only have two days of water reserve.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.723
We import 90 percent of our food,

00:05:57.723 --> 00:06:01.423
and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:03.872
The limited number of farmers that we have

00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:07.406
have been pushed out of their farming practices

00:06:07.406 --> 00:06:12.955
as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc.

00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:16.206
So we also face risks.

00:06:16.206 --> 00:06:23.389
These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.907
The question is, is there a solution?

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:28.089
Is there a sustainable solution?

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:30.073
Indeed there is.

00:06:30.073 --> 00:06:34.106
This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:36.790
that we've been working on over the past two years.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.222
Let's start with the water.

00:06:38.222 --> 00:06:41.991
So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy.

00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.089
So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.388
A depletable energy? Fossil fuel?

00:06:47.388 --> 00:06:49.783
Or should we use something else?

00:06:49.783 --> 00:06:53.122
Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy?

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:57.256
I guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun.

00:06:57.256 --> 00:07:02.588
And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:07.989
And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:10.598
to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.

00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:12.622
And that is a lot of water.

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:14.890
That water will go then to the farmers,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.127
and the farmers will be able to water their plants,

00:07:17.127 --> 00:07:21.257
and they will be able then to supply society with food.

00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:23.374
But in order to sustain the horizontal line --

00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:26.705
because these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver --

00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:29.339
we need to also develop the vertical line:

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:34.657
system sustenance, high-level education, research and development,

00:07:34.657 --> 00:07:39.719
industries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets.

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:45.852
But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations.

00:07:45.852 --> 00:07:48.085
Without it we can't do anything.

00:07:48.085 --> 00:07:49.637
So that's what we are planning to do.

00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:53.168
Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan

00:07:53.168 --> 00:07:55.135
and taking it to implementation.

00:07:55.135 --> 00:08:01.835
Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around:

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:08.970
Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.065
We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever

00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:17.626
as a city, to live in peace.

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:19.571
Thank you very much.

00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:23.650
(Applause)
