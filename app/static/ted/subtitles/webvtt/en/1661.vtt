00:00:00.763 --> 00:00:03.378
Organic chemists make molecules,

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.194
very complicated molecules,

00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:08.878
by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:10.739
and reverse engineering.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:11.778
And as a chemist,

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.245
one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is,

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:19.396
could we make a really cool universal chemistry set?

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:24.429
In essence, could we "app" chemistry?

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.612
Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.583
Well to start to do this,

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.315
we took a 3D printer

00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:35.617
and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:39.682
and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:42.836
and combine them together in what we call reactionware.

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:47.270
And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.437
we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry.

00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:53.985
Now what could this mean?

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:59.253
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine,

00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:02.402
so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.121
or bacteria that you want to kill,

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:06.452
if you have this embedded in your device

00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:08.901
at the same time, and you do the chemistry,

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.502
you may be able to make drugs in a new way.

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:14.902
So how are we doing this in the lab?

00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:18.001
Well it requires software, it requires hardware

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.367
and it requires chemical inks.

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:21.820
And so the really cool bit is,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.867
the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:27.136
that we put out with the printer,

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:31.418
and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule

00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:34.418
and you make it in the device.

00:01:34.418 --> 00:01:39.985
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:42.184
So what could this mean?

00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:47.131
Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.100
And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.002
But to take baby steps to get there,

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.835
first of all we want to look at drug design and production,

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:56.485
or drug discovery and manufacturing.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:59.484
Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it,

00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:01.618
we could deploy it anywhere.

00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:03.734
You don't need to go to the chemist anymore.

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:06.102
We can print drugs at point of need.

00:02:06.102 --> 00:02:08.757
We can download new diagnostics.

00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:10.768
Say a new super bug has emerged.

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:12.385
You put it in your search engine,

00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:15.518
and you create the drug to treat the threat.

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:19.206
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:22.201
But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:25.551
is this idea of taking your own stem cells,

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.318
with your genes and your environment,

00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:30.767
and you print your own personal medicine.

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:33.019
And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.067
where do you think we're going to go?

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:39.651
Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator.

00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:41.551
Beam me up, Scotty.

00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.900
(Applause)
