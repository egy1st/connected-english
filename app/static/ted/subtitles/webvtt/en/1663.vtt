WEBVTT

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.468
So, I'm an artist.

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:04.922
I live in New York, and I've been working in advertising

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.567
for -- ever since I left school,

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.188
so about seven, eight years now,

00:00:09.188 --> 00:00:10.744
and it was draining.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.457
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:16.627
and I found myself never having time for all the projects

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:18.929
that I wanted to work on on my own.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.891
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.122
by Stefan Sagmeister on TED,

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.777
and it was called "The power of time off,"

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:27.413
and he spoke about how every seven years,

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:29.520
he takes a year off from work so he could

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.185
do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:36.574
and I just said, "I have to do that. I have to take a year off.

00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:41.053
I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family

00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:43.339
and start my own creative ideas."

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.978
So the first of those projects ended up being

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:50.544
something I called "One Second Every Day."

00:00:50.544 --> 00:00:52.878
Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life

00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:55.613
for the rest of my life,

00:00:55.613 --> 00:00:58.550
chronologically compiling these one-second

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.852
tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:08.529
until, you know, I can't record them anymore.

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:10.886
The purpose of this project is, one:

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:15.610
I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.320
There's all these things that I've done with my life

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.234
that I have no recollection of

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:21.950
unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.521
"Oh yeah, that's something that I did."

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.162
And something that I realized early on in the project

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:29.886
was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting,

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:32.365
I would probably forget to record the video.

00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:35.838
So the day -- the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,

00:01:35.838 --> 00:01:38.313
because it's something that I really wanted to --

00:01:38.313 --> 00:01:40.509
from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.859
to keep this project going until forever,

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.305
and having missed that one second, I realized,

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:50.058
it just kind of created this thing in my head

00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:52.321
where I never forgot ever again.

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:58.597
So if I live to see 80 years of age,

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:01.230
I'm going to have a five-hour video

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.979
that encapsulates 50 years of my life.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.371
When I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video

00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:11.608
that includes just my 30s.

00:02:11.608 --> 00:02:13.136
This has really

00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:16.411
invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,

00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:19.298
to try and do something interesting with my day.

00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:30.265
Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that,

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:34.463
as the days and weeks and months go by,

00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:36.280
time just seems to start blurring

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.202
and blending into each other

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:41.933
and, you know, I hated that,

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:46.962
and visualization is the way to trigger memory.

00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:57.881
You know, this project for me is a way for me

00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:01.175
to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:03.742
Even just this one second allows me to remember

00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:06.019
everything else I did that one day.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.681
It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.865
On a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds

00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:13.578
that I really want to choose,

00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:15.727
but I'll just have to narrow it down to one,

00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:17.691
but even narrowing it down to that one allows me

00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:20.171
to remember the other three anyway.

00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.712
It's also kind of a protest, a personal protest,

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:26.107
against the culture we have now where people

00:03:26.107 --> 00:03:28.549
just are at concerts with their cell phones out

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.698
recording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.

00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:31.933
They're not even enjoying the show.

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:35.038
They're watching the concert through their cell phone.

00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:39.006
I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:41.824
back in the day, and I've decided that the best way

00:03:41.824 --> 00:03:47.405
for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:50.491
and not be that person, is to just record that one second

00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:52.760
that will allow me to trigger that memory of,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.135
"Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert."

00:03:56.135 --> 00:04:01.553
And it just takes a quick, quick second.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.432
I was on a three-month road trip this summer.

00:04:04.432 --> 00:04:07.286
It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life,

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:09.779
just driving around the U.S. and Canada

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.018
and just figuring out where to go the next day,

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.623
and it was kind of outstanding.

00:04:15.623 --> 00:04:19.335
I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip

00:04:19.335 --> 00:04:22.325
for the savings that I had to take my year off,

00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:25.219
so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.769
with friends working on a really neat project.

00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:39.871
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,

00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.281
and this really tragic thing happened where

00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:44.886
my sister-in-law,

00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:48.322
her intestine suddenly strangled one day,

00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:51.100
and we took her to the emergency room,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.392
and she was, she was in really bad shape.

00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:56.467
We almost lost her a couple of times,

00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:59.879
and I was there with my brother every day.

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:06.684
It helped me realize something else during this project,

00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:13.199
is that recording that one second on a really bad day

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.432
is extremely difficult.

00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:19.629
It's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.053
Or we're, "Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture."

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:25.055
But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day,

00:05:25.055 --> 00:05:26.936
and something horrible is happening.

00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:30.356
And I found that it's actually been very, very important

00:05:30.356 --> 00:05:33.900
to record even just that one second of a really bad moment.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.601
It really helps you appreciate the good times.

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:41.888
It's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,

00:05:41.888 --> 00:05:43.786
I think it's important to remember it,

00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:49.410
just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.346
Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters,

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:04.125
I don't use anything to -- I try to capture the moment

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:09.752
as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:12.487
I started a rule of first person perspective.

00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:14.560
Early on, I think I had a couple of videos where

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.773
you would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go.

00:06:18.773 --> 00:06:20.620
The way to really remember what I saw

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.486
was to record it as I actually saw it.

00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:36.799
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:42.774
wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?

00:06:42.774 --> 00:06:49.029
I turned 31 last week, which is there.

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:50.757
I think it would be interesting to see

00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:52.605
what everyone did with a project like this.

00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:54.597
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.

00:06:54.597 --> 00:06:59.335
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:02.186
Personally, I'm tired of forgetting,

00:07:02.186 --> 00:07:04.757
and this is a really easy thing to do.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.626
I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now --

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:09.456
most people in this room, I bet --

00:07:09.456 --> 00:07:11.046
and it's something that's --

00:07:11.046 --> 00:07:13.304
I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived,

00:07:13.304 --> 00:07:15.585
and this is my way of doing that,

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:18.370
and it'd be really interesting also to see,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.340
if you could just type in on a website,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.546
"June 18, 2018,"

00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:25.897
and you would just see a stream of people's lives

00:07:25.897 --> 00:07:27.591
on that particular day from all over the world.

00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:30.813
And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,

00:07:30.813 --> 00:07:34.460
and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.307
so you can never forget that that day, you lived.

00:07:36.307 --> 00:07:38.011
Thank you.

00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:42.448
(Applause)
