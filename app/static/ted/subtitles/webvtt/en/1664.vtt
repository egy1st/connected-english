00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.494
In my previous life, I was an artist.

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:06.967
I still paint. I love art.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:12.566
I love the joy that color can give to our lives

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.214
and to our communities,

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:20.493
and I try to bring something of the artist in me

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.614
in my politics,

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:26.542
and I see

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:31.726
part of my job today, the reason for being here,

00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:36.653
not just to campaign for my party,

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:41.358
but for politics, and the role it can play

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:45.174
for the better in our lives.

00:00:45.174 --> 00:00:51.046
For 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.

00:00:51.046 --> 00:00:53.738
We faced many challenges.

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:56.222
Art was part of the answer,

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.840
and my name, in the very beginning,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.255
was linked with two things:

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:05.348
demolition of illegal constructions

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:09.428
in order to get public space back,

00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:13.106
and use of colors in order to revive the hope

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.425
that had been lost in my city.

00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:22.286
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act.

00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:26.402
Rather, it was a form of political action

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:31.504
in a context when the city budget I had available

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:38.211
after being elected amounted to zero comma something.

00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:41.202
When we painted the first building,

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:45.754
by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray

00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:48.018
of a facade,

00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:52.242
something unimaginable happened.

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:54.312
There was a traffic jam

00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:57.317
and a crowd of people gathered

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:02.235
as if it were the location of some spectacular accident,

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:06.954
or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star.

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:11.756
The French E.U. official in charge of the funding

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.850
rushed to block the painting.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.596
He screeched that he would block the financing.

00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:23.226
"But why?" I asked him.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.018
"Because the colors you have ordered

00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:30.730
do not meet European standards," he replied.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.659
"Well," I told him,

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.847
"the surroundings do not meet European standards,

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:42.142
even though this is not what we want,

00:02:42.142 --> 00:02:45.313
but we will choose the colors ourselves,

00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:48.983
because this is exactly what we want.

00:02:48.983 --> 00:02:52.866
And if you do not let us continue with our work,

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:55.540
I will hold a press conference here,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.816
right now, right in this road,

00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:02.066
and we will tell people that you look to me

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:07.940
just like the censors of the socialist realism era."

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.595
Then he was kind of troubled,

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:13.187
and asked me for a compromise.

00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:15.507
But I told him no, I'm sorry,

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:20.009
compromise in colors is gray,

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:25.097
and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.

00:03:25.097 --> 00:03:26.314
(Applause)

00:03:26.314 --> 00:03:31.433
So it's time for change.

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:33.603
The rehabilitation of public spaces

00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:36.337
revived the feeling of belonging

00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:41.206
to a city that people lost.

00:03:41.206 --> 00:03:47.646
The pride of people about their own place of living,

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:51.065
and there were feelings that had been buried

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:55.720
deep for years under the fury of the illegal,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.194
barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.

00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:04.238
And when colors came out everywhere,

00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:08.726
a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people.

00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:11.673
Big noise raised up: "What is this? What is happening?

00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:13.634
What are colors doing to us?"

00:04:13.634 --> 00:04:14.689
And we made a poll,

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.091
the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:24.348
We asked people, "Do you want this action,

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:28.838
and to have buildings painted like that?"

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:31.209
And then the second question was,

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:34.213
"Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"

00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:35.897
To the first question,

00:04:35.897 --> 00:04:39.803
63 percent of people said yes, we like it.

00:04:39.803 --> 00:04:42.163
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.

00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:45.835
But to the second question, half of them that didn't like it,

00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:48.914
they wanted it to continue. (Laughter)

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:52.041
So we noticed change.

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:56.436
People started to drop less litter in the streets, for example,

00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:59.066
started to pay taxes,

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:03.515
started to feel something they had forgotten,

00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:08.579
and beauty was acting as a guardsman

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:15.121
where municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.

00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:18.822
One day I remember walking along a street

00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:21.418
that had just been colored,

00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:25.197
and where we were in the process of planting trees,

00:05:25.197 --> 00:05:28.442
when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife

00:05:28.442 --> 00:05:32.409
putting a glass facade to their shop.

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.706
They had thrown the old shutter

00:05:34.706 --> 00:05:37.698
in the garbage collection place.

00:05:37.698 --> 00:05:41.258
"Why did you throw away the shutters?" I asked him.

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:46.490
"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.058
"Safer? Why? They have posted more policemen here?"

00:05:52.058 --> 00:05:54.882
"Come on, man! What policemen?

00:05:54.882 --> 00:05:57.974
You can see it for yourself. There are colors,

00:05:57.974 --> 00:06:03.794
streetlights, new pavement with no potholes,

00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:08.586
trees. So it's beautiful; it's safe."

00:06:08.586 --> 00:06:12.530
And indeed, it was beauty that was giving people

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.957
this feeling of being protected.

00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:20.459
And this was not a misplaced feeling.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:25.216
Crime did fall.

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:28.562
The freedom that was won in 1990

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:32.699
brought about a state of anarchy in the city,

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.610
while the barbarism of the '90s

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.092
brought about a loss of hope for the city.

00:06:39.092 --> 00:06:43.362
The paint on the walls did not feed children,

00:06:43.362 --> 00:06:47.426
nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant,

00:06:47.426 --> 00:06:50.867
but it gave hope and light,

00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:53.307
and helped to make people see

00:06:53.307 --> 00:06:56.410
there could be a different way of doing things,

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.321
a different spirit, a different feel to our lives,

00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:06.540
and that if we brought the same energy and hope

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.828
to our politics, we could build a better life

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:16.023
for each other and for our country.

00:07:16.023 --> 00:07:22.873
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete

00:07:22.873 --> 00:07:25.480
only from the riverbanks.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.630
We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.612
all over the city,

00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:38.081
up to eight stories high, the tallest of them.

00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:44.610
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.693
We established a green tax,

00:07:47.693 --> 00:07:51.723
and then everybody accepted it

00:07:51.723 --> 00:07:56.717
and all businessmen paid it regularly.

00:07:56.717 --> 00:07:59.104
By means of open competitions,

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:02.097
we managed to recruit in our administration

00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:04.092
many young people,

00:08:04.092 --> 00:08:05.954
and we thus managed to build

00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:09.225
a de-politicized public institution

00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:13.745
where men and women were equally represented.

00:08:13.745 --> 00:08:16.287
International organizations

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.665
have invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years,

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:22.897
not all of it well spent.

00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:26.025
When I told the World Bank directors

00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:30.938
that I wanted them to finance a project to build

00:08:30.938 --> 00:08:33.833
a model reception hall for citizens

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:37.993
precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption,

00:08:37.993 --> 00:08:40.243
they did not understand me.

00:08:40.243 --> 00:08:43.521
But people were waiting in long queues

00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:46.444
under sun and under rain

00:08:46.444 --> 00:08:50.669
in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:58.107
from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks.

00:08:58.107 --> 00:09:02.291
They were paying in order to skip the queue,

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.647
the long queue.

00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:08.610
The reply to their requests was met

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.311
by a voice coming from this dark hole,

00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:17.553
and, on the other hand,

00:09:17.553 --> 00:09:22.995
a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:28.803
while searching through old documents for the bribe.

00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:33.110
We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:38.749
every week, but we could not change this corrupt practice.

00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:42.523
"I'm convinced," I told a German official

00:09:42.523 --> 00:09:45.299
with the World Bank,

00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:49.141
"that it would be impossible for them to be bribed

00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:51.595
if they worked in Germany,

00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.546
in a German administration,

00:09:53.546 --> 00:09:57.952
just as I am convinced that if you put German officials

00:09:57.952 --> 00:10:01.175
from the German administration in those holes,

00:10:01.175 --> 00:10:05.323
they would be bribed just the same."

00:10:05.323 --> 00:10:12.027
(Applause)

00:10:12.027 --> 00:10:13.859
It's not about genes.

00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:19.593
It's not about some being with a high conscience

00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:22.035
and some others having not a conscience.

00:10:22.035 --> 00:10:24.807
It's about system, it's about organization.

00:10:24.807 --> 00:10:28.067
It's also about environment and respect.

00:10:28.067 --> 00:10:30.950
We removed the kiosks.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.646
We built the bright new reception hall

00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:38.217
that made people, Tirana citizens,

00:10:38.217 --> 00:10:41.903
think they had traveled abroad when they entered

00:10:41.903 --> 00:10:44.327
to make their requests.

00:10:44.327 --> 00:10:47.771
We created an online system of control

00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:51.687
and so speeded up all the processes.

00:10:51.687 --> 00:10:56.343
We put the citizen first, and not the clerks.

00:10:56.343 --> 00:11:00.547
The corruption in the state administration

00:11:00.547 --> 00:11:03.247
of countries like Albania --

00:11:03.247 --> 00:11:07.423
it's not up to me to say also like Greece --

00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:12.803
can be fought only by modernization.

00:11:12.803 --> 00:11:17.555
Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself

00:11:17.555 --> 00:11:21.074
is the answer, and not reinventing people

00:11:21.074 --> 00:11:23.722
based on a ready-made formula

00:11:23.722 --> 00:11:27.978
that the developed world often tries in vain to impose

00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:30.084
to people like us.

00:11:30.084 --> 00:11:32.791
(Applause)

00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:34.775
Things have come to this point

00:11:34.775 --> 00:11:37.267
because politicians in general,

00:11:37.267 --> 00:11:40.163
but especially in our countries, let's face it,

00:11:40.163 --> 00:11:42.626
think people are stupid.

00:11:42.626 --> 00:11:46.170
They take it for granted that, come what may,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.382
people have to follow them,

00:11:48.382 --> 00:11:52.476
while politics, more and more, fails to offer answers

00:11:52.476 --> 00:11:56.499
for their public concerns

00:11:56.499 --> 00:12:01.170
or the exigencies of the common people.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.972
Politics has come to resemble

00:12:03.972 --> 00:12:07.458
a cynical team game played by politicians,

00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:11.387
while the public has been pushed aside

00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:15.274
as if sitting on the seats of a stadium

00:12:15.274 --> 00:12:17.124
in which passion for politics

00:12:17.124 --> 00:12:22.733
is gradually making room for blindness and desperation.

00:12:22.733 --> 00:12:27.627
Seen from those stairs, all politicians today

00:12:27.627 --> 00:12:29.590
seem the same,

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:34.227
and politics has come to resemble

00:12:34.227 --> 00:12:38.828
a sport that inspires more aggressiveness

00:12:38.828 --> 00:12:42.140
and pessimism than social cohesion

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.413
and the desire for civic protaganism.

00:12:46.413 --> 00:12:48.439
Barack Obama won

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:54.716
— (Applause) —

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:58.279
because he mobilized people as never before

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:00.812
through the use of social networks.

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:03.925
He did not know each and every one of them,

00:13:03.925 --> 00:13:07.795
but with an admirable ingenuity,

00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:11.175
he managed to transform them into activists

00:13:11.175 --> 00:13:15.304
by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands

00:13:15.304 --> 00:13:18.898
the arguments and the instruments that each would need

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:23.691
to campaign in his name by making his own campaign.

00:13:23.691 --> 00:13:25.746
I tweet. I love it.

00:13:25.746 --> 00:13:31.115
I love it because it lets me get the message out,

00:13:31.115 --> 00:13:35.382
but it also lets people get their messages to me.

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:38.374
This is politics, not from top down,

00:13:38.374 --> 00:13:41.598
but from the bottom up, and sideways,

00:13:41.598 --> 00:13:44.590
and allowing everybody's voice to be heard

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.550
is exactly what we need.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.604
Politics is not just about leaders.

00:13:48.604 --> 00:13:51.365
It's not just about politicians and laws.

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:53.333
It is about how people think,

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.668
how they view the world around them,

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.194
how they use their time and their energy.

00:13:58.194 --> 00:14:00.710
When people say all politicians are the same,

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.990
ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush,

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.565
if François Hollande is the same as Sarkozy.

00:14:07.565 --> 00:14:12.269
They are not. They are human beings with different views

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:14.851
and different visions for the world.

00:14:14.851 --> 00:14:17.749
When people say nothing can change,

00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:21.813
just stop and think what the world was like

00:14:21.813 --> 00:14:26.445
10, 20, 50, 100 years ago.

00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:29.561
Our world is defined by the pace of change.

00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:32.365
We can all change the world.

00:14:32.365 --> 00:14:35.241
I gave you a very small example

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:38.742
of how one thing, the use of color,

00:14:38.742 --> 00:14:41.253
can make change happen.

00:14:41.253 --> 00:14:42.616
I want to make more change

00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:45.404
as Prime Minister of my country,

00:14:45.404 --> 00:14:49.726
but every single one of you can make change happen

00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:51.319
if you want to.

00:14:51.319 --> 00:14:54.444
President Roosevelt, he said,

00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:58.117
"Believe you can, and you are halfway there."

00:14:58.117 --> 00:15:01.184
Efharisto and kalinihta.

00:15:01.184 --> 00:15:20.887
(Applause)
