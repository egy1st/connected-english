00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:40.119
(Hammer)

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:47.218
(Laughter)

00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:10.000
(Microwave beeps) (Laughter)

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:17.721
You probably all agree with me

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:20.496
that this is a very nice road.

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:22.655
It's made of asphalt,

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:25.889
and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on,

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:30.023
but not always, especially not on these days as today,

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.874
when it's raining a lot.

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:34.822
Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt.

00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:37.116
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle,

00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:41.061
and pass these cars, then that's not very nice.

00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:44.171
Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise.

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.785
It's a noisy material,

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:48.229
and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands,

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.361
very close to cities, then we would like a silent road.

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.630
The solution for that is to make roads

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.807
out of porous asphalt.

00:01:57.807 --> 00:01:59.798
Porous asphalt, a material that we use now

00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:02.757
in most of the highways in the Netherlands,

00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:06.201
it has pores and water can just rain through it,

00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:09.102
so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,

00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:11.191
and you have a road that's easy to drive on,

00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:13.121
so no splash water anymore.

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:16.283
Also the noise will disappear in these pores.

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:19.306
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:21.894
so it's a very silent road.

00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:25.439
It also has disadvantages, of course,

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.601
and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur.

00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:32.526
What is raveling? You see that in this road

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:35.147
that the stones at the surface come off.

00:02:35.147 --> 00:02:40.425
First you get one stone, then several more,

00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:42.167
and more and more and more and more,

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:45.734
and then they -- well, I will not do that. (Laughter)

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:48.648
But they can damage your windshield,

00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:50.438
so you're not happy with that.

00:02:50.438 --> 00:02:54.428
And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:57.044
Sometimes you can create potholes with that.

00:02:57.044 --> 00:03:01.105
Ha. He's ready.

00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:04.290
Potholes, of course, that can become a problem,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.833
but we have a solution.

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:09.091
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.

00:03:09.091 --> 00:03:11.091
It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:13.863
a small amount of binder between the stones.

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:17.182
Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,

00:03:17.182 --> 00:03:19.910
this binder, this bitumen,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.583
the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:24.528
and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:26.250
and it delaminates from the aggregates.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.810
Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates --

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.806
what we just saw here.

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:35.620
To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.281
If we can make this material self-healing,

00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:41.474
then probably we have a solution.

00:03:41.474 --> 00:03:46.068
So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,

00:03:46.068 --> 00:03:49.553
and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,

00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:53.457
and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.

00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:55.202
So then you have asphalt

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:58.269
with very small pieces of steel wool in it.

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.060
Then you need a machine, like you see here,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.199
that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.248
Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.930
Then what you do is you heat up the steel,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.421
you melt the bitumen,

00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:14.987
and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:18.194
and the stones are again fixed to the surface.

00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:22.156
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take

00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:24.393
the big induction machine here onstage.

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:27.273
So a microwave is a similar system.

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:30.918
So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out

00:04:30.918 --> 00:04:34.170
to see what happened.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.663
So this is the specimen coming out now.

00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:41.056
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:43.328
to heat up the specimens.

00:04:43.328 --> 00:04:45.418
We tested a lot of specimens there,

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.593
and then the government, they actually saw our results,

00:04:48.593 --> 00:04:52.543
and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that."

00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:54.859
So they donated to us a piece of highway,

00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:58.346
400 meters of the A58, where we had to make

00:04:58.346 --> 00:05:00.856
a test track to test this material.

00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:04.388
So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,

00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:08.886
and then of course this road will last several years

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:12.174
without any damage. That's what we know from practice.

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.953
So we took a lot of samples from this road

00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:17.222
and we tested them in the lab.

00:05:17.222 --> 00:05:20.139
So we did aging on the samples,

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.751
did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:26.577
and healed them and tested them again.

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:28.481
Several times we can repeat that.

00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:30.706
So actually, the conclusion from this research is that

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:34.024
if we go on the road every four years

00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:36.904
with our healing machine -- this is the big version

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:38.809
we have made to go on the real road --

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.679
if we go on the road every four years

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:44.429
we can double the surface life of this road,

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:46.606
which of course saves a lot of money.

00:05:46.606 --> 00:05:48.783
Well, to conclude, I can say

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:51.539
that we made a material

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.319
using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.828
using induction energy to really

00:05:57.828 --> 00:06:00.495
increase the surface life of the road,

00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:02.245
double the surface life you can even do,

00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:05.909
so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.382
And now you're of course curious if it also worked.

00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:12.485
So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm.

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:15.064
Actually, it still has to cool down first

00:06:15.064 --> 00:06:17.404
before I can show you that the healing works.

00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:20.272
But I will do a trial.

00:06:20.272 --> 00:06:23.031
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.

00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:24.381
Thank you.

00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:29.797
(Applause)
