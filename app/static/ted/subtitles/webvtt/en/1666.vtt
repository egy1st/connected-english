00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:02.404
When I was 11,

00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:06.966
I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.437
My father was listening to BBC News

00:00:09.437 --> 00:00:13.611
on his small, gray radio.

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:16.487
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:20.458
because the news mostly depressed him.

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:25.343
"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:27.931
I didn't know what it meant,

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:33.117
but I could see that my father was very, very happy.

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:41.628
"You can go to a real school now," he said.

00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:46.797
A morning that I will never forget.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:51.965
A real school.

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:55.073
You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan

00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:58.596
and made it illegal for girls to go to school.

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:01.704
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy

00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:04.215
to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:09.629
to be outside alone, to a secret school.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:14.254
It was the only way we both could be educated.

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:17.488
Each day, we took a different route

00:01:17.488 --> 00:01:21.511
so that no one would suspect where we were going.

00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.705
We would cover our books in grocery bags

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:29.841
so it would seem we were just out shopping.

00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:32.217
The school was in a house,

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:37.880
more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.730
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.251
We all knew we were risking our lives --

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:50.605
the teacher, the students and our parents.

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:52.978
From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:56.894
for a week because Taliban were suspicious.

00:01:56.894 --> 00:01:59.674
We always wondered what they knew about us.

00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:02.706
Were we being followed?

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:06.238
Do they know where we live?

00:02:06.238 --> 00:02:08.896
We were scared,

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:15.822
but still, school was where we wanted to be.

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:19.562
I was very lucky to grow up in a family

00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:25.809
where education was prized and daughters were treasured.

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:30.960
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.439
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.935
he insisted that his daughter, my mom,

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:44.348
go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.

00:02:44.348 --> 00:02:47.858
But my educated mother became a teacher.

00:02:47.858 --> 00:02:50.884
There she is.

00:02:50.884 --> 00:02:53.551
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house

00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:58.929
into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:03.317
And my father -- that's him --

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:10.218
he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:12.327
There was no question that his children

00:03:12.327 --> 00:03:17.416
would receive an education, including his daughters,

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:21.836
despite the Taliban, despite the risks.

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:30.182
To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.

00:03:30.182 --> 00:03:33.310
During Taliban years, I remember

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.403
there were times I would get so frustrated by our life

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:42.355
and always being scared and not seeing a future.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:45.409
I would want to quit,

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.545
but my father,

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:51.054
he would say,

00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:53.159
"Listen, my daughter,

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.475
you can lose everything you own in your life.

00:03:56.475 --> 00:04:00.680
Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.461
But the one thing that will always remain with you

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.769
is what is here,

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.685
and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.906
we will.

00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:19.988
So do you still not want to continue?"

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:23.116
Today I am 22.

00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:25.886
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed

00:04:25.886 --> 00:04:29.056
by decades of war.

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:34.197
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,

00:04:34.197 --> 00:04:36.662
and had my family not been so committed to my education,

00:04:36.662 --> 00:04:39.266
I would be one of them.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:44.581
Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.

00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:54.594
(Applause)

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.542
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:02.121
the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,

00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:05.615
was among the first to congratulate me.

00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:08.245
He not only brags about my college degree,

00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:10.454
but also that I was the first woman,

00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:12.176
and that I am the first woman

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:15.678
to drive him through the streets of Kabul.

00:05:15.678 --> 00:05:21.040
(Applause)

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.689
My family believes in me.

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.639
I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.106
That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:35.870
a global campaign to educate women.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.449
That's why I cofounded SOLA,

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.916
the first and perhaps only boarding school

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:42.645
for girls in Afghanistan,

00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:48.282
a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:52.047
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school

00:05:52.047 --> 00:05:57.675
with ambition grabbing at opportunity.

00:05:57.675 --> 00:06:00.602
And I see their parents and their fathers

00:06:00.602 --> 00:06:05.180
who, like my own, advocate for them,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:14.112
despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.

00:06:14.112 --> 00:06:16.818
Like Ahmed. That's not his real name,

00:06:16.818 --> 00:06:19.446
and I cannot show you his face,

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:23.091
but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:26.927
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter

00:06:26.927 --> 00:06:30.261
were on their way from SOLA to their village,

00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:36.754
and they literally missed being killed

00:06:36.754 --> 00:06:41.536
by a roadside bomb by minutes.

00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:44.939
As he arrived home, the phone rang,

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.634
a voice warning him

00:06:47.634 --> 00:06:51.029
that if he sent his daughter back to school,

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.806
they would try again.

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:57.708
"Kill me now, if you wish," he said,

00:06:57.708 --> 00:07:01.602
"but I will not ruin my daughter's future

00:07:01.602 --> 00:07:06.434
because of your old and backward ideas."

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:08.803
What I've come to realize about Afghanistan,

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:12.323
and this is something that is often dismissed in the West,

00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:15.546
that behind most of us who succeed

00:07:15.546 --> 00:07:22.909
is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:27.536
and who sees that her success is his success.

00:07:27.536 --> 00:07:31.474
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.

00:07:31.474 --> 00:07:36.010
In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.350
of a bright future for their daughters,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.761
but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,

00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:46.181
we must have the support of men.

00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:49.731
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school

00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:51.523
numbered in the hundreds --

00:07:51.523 --> 00:07:53.861
remember, it was illegal.

00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:59.353
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:06.600
(Applause)

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.751
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.

00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:17.723
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.

00:08:17.723 --> 00:08:20.773
I fear that these changes will not last

00:08:20.773 --> 00:08:25.265
much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.

00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:28.918
But when I am back in Afghanistan,

00:08:28.918 --> 00:08:33.703
when I see the students in my school

00:08:33.703 --> 00:08:36.343
and their parents who advocate for them,

00:08:36.343 --> 00:08:40.810
who encourage them, I see a promising future

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.110
and lasting change.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:52.577
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,

00:08:52.577 --> 00:08:55.989
and every single day

00:08:55.989 --> 00:08:59.397
the girls of SOLA remind me of that.

00:08:59.397 --> 00:09:02.604
Like me, they are dreaming big.

00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:04.315
Thank you.

00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:15.192
(Applause)
