WEBVTT

00:00:00.595 --> 00:00:03.715
Radical openness is still a distant future

00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:06.011
in the field of school education.

00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:07.900
We have such a hard time figuring out

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.121
that learning is not a place but an activity.

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.592
But I want to tell you the story of PISA,

00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:17.970
OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.599
of 15-year-olds around the world,

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.121
and it's really a story of how international comparisons

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:27.396
have globalized the field of education that we usually treat

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:30.331
as an affair of domestic policy.

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:32.755
Look at how the world looked in the 1960s,

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:34.586
in terms of the proportion of people

00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:37.326
who had completed high school.

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:41.146
You can see the United States ahead of everyone else,

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:43.859
and much of the economic success of the United States

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.603
draws on its long-standing advantage

00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:49.475
as the first mover in education.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.698
But in the 1970s, some countries caught up.

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:55.387
In the 1980s, the global expansion

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.983
of the talent pool continued.

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:01.683
And the world didn't stop in the 1990s.

00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:03.707
So in the '60s, the U.S. was first.

00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:06.643
In the '90s, it was 13th,

00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:09.044
and not because standards had fallen,

00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:12.799
but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.329
Korea shows you what's possible in education.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.274
Two generations ago, Korea had the standard of living

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:21.705
of Afghanistan today,

00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:25.846
and was one of the lowest education performers.

00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:31.398
Today, every young Korean finishes high school.

00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:34.374
So this tells us that, in a global economy,

00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:38.955
it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success,

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:44.136
but the best performing education systems internationally.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:46.579
The trouble is that

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.449
measuring how much time people spend in school

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:50.473
or what degree they have got is not always

00:01:50.473 --> 00:01:55.497
a good way of seeing what they can actually do.

00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:59.170
Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.364
while employers say they cannot find the people

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:05.163
with the skills they need.

00:02:05.163 --> 00:02:08.827
And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:13.197
into better skills and better jobs and better lives.

00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:15.806
So with PISA, we try to change this

00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:17.677
by measuring the knowledge and skills

00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:21.113
of people directly.

00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:23.011
And we took a very special angle to this.

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:25.493
We were less interested in whether students can simply

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:28.594
reproduce what they have learned in school,

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:31.310
but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.223
from what they know

00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:37.102
and apply their knowledge in novel situations.

00:02:37.102 --> 00:02:39.934
Now, some people have criticized us for this.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:41.881
They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes

00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:44.693
is terribly unfair to people, because we test students

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:47.666
with problems they haven't seen before.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.707
But if you take that logic, you know,

00:02:49.707 --> 00:02:52.635
you should consider life unfair, because

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:55.824
the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember

00:02:55.824 --> 00:02:56.944
what we learned in school,

00:02:56.944 --> 00:03:00.265
but whether we are prepared for change,

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:02.686
whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created,

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:05.032
to use technologies that haven't been invented,

00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:09.949
to solve problems we just can't anticipate today.

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.134
And once hotly contested,

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:15.571
our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.

00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:17.813
In our latest assessment in 2009,

00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:21.225
we measured 74 school systems

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:24.812
that together cover 87 percent of the economy.

00:03:24.812 --> 00:03:28.486
This chart shows you the performance of countries.

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:31.373
In red, sort of below OECD average.

00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:34.749
Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:39.103
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia;

00:03:39.103 --> 00:03:40.793
Finland in Europe;

00:03:40.793 --> 00:03:45.159
Canada in North America doing really well.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.600
You can also see that there is a gap of almost

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.677
three and a half school years between

00:03:49.677 --> 00:03:53.045
15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile,

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:55.750
and the gap grows to seven school years

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.373
when you include the countries with really poor performance.

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.844
There's a world of difference in the way in which

00:04:01.844 --> 00:04:07.046
young people are prepared for today's economy.

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:10.592
But I want to introduce a second important dimension

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:12.813
into this picture.

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:17.188
Educators like to talk about equity.

00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:20.898
With PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity,

00:04:20.898 --> 00:04:23.125
in terms of ensuring that people

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:26.565
from different social backgrounds have equal chances.

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.300
And we see that in some countries, the impact

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.179
of social background on learning outcomes

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:31.317
is very, very strong.

00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:34.235
Opportunities are unequally distributed.

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:37.850
A lot of potential of young children is wasted.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.918
We see in other countries that it matters much less

00:04:40.918 --> 00:04:44.411
into which social context you're born.

00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:46.806
We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant,

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:51.302
where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.

00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:53.973
Nobody, and no country, can afford to be there,

00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:55.354
where performance is poor

00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:58.699
and there are large social disparities.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.854
And then we can debate, you know, is it better

00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:02.653
to be there, where performance is strong

00:05:02.653 --> 00:05:05.613
at the price of large disparities?

00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:11.232
Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?

00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:14.214
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture,

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:16.957
you see there are a lot of countries that actually

00:05:16.957 --> 00:05:21.725
are combining excellence with equity.

00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:24.333
In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:27.439
is that you don't have to compromise equity

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.286
to achieve excellence.

00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:32.725
These countries have moved on from providing excellence

00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:35.994
for just some to providing excellence for all,

00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:37.966
a very important lesson.

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:42.942
And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:47.245
that believe they are mainly there to sort people.

00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:49.757
And ever since those results came out, policymakers,

00:05:49.757 --> 00:05:51.734
educators, researchers from around the world

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:53.095
have tried to figure out

00:05:53.095 --> 00:05:56.525
what's behind the success of those systems.

00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:58.349
But let's step back for a moment

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.363
and focus on the countries that actually started PISA,

00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:03.909
and I'm giving them a colored bubble now.

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.401
And I'm making the size of the bubble

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:08.943
proportional

00:06:08.943 --> 00:06:12.738
to the amount of money that countries spent on students.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:14.290
If money would tell you everything

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.369
about the quality of learning outcomes,

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:19.700
you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.245
But that's not what you see.

00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:24.550
Spending per student only explains about,

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.846
well, less than 20 percent

00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:30.364
of the performance variation among countries,

00:06:30.364 --> 00:06:32.654
and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system,

00:06:32.654 --> 00:06:35.118
doesn't do particularly well.

00:06:35.118 --> 00:06:37.494
What you see is that two countries with similar spending

00:06:37.494 --> 00:06:39.414
achieve very different results.

00:06:39.414 --> 00:06:43.663
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings --

00:06:43.663 --> 00:06:47.252
that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided

00:06:47.252 --> 00:06:49.942
between rich and well-educated countries,

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:52.262
and poor and badly-educated ones,

00:06:52.262 --> 00:06:55.857
a very, very important lesson.

00:06:55.857 --> 00:06:58.439
Let's look at this in greater detail.

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.245
The red dot shows you

00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:04.702
spending per student relative to a country's wealth.

00:07:04.702 --> 00:07:07.509
One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well,

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.014
and you can see Korea investing a lot

00:07:10.014 --> 00:07:13.038
in attracting the best people into the teaching profession.

00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:14.964
And Korea also invests into long school days,

00:07:14.964 --> 00:07:17.720
which drives up costs further.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.860
Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.140
not only to teach but also to develop.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.475
They invest in professional development and collaboration

00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:26.555
and many other things.

00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:28.196
All that costs money.

00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:30.866
How can Korea afford all of this?

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:34.606
The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.

00:07:34.606 --> 00:07:39.074
This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.

00:07:39.074 --> 00:07:41.969
You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg,

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:45.072
and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea,

00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:48.605
so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.

00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:51.499
But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:53.946
in Luxembourg all like small classes.

00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:56.714
You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.

00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:58.618
So they have invested all their money into there,

00:07:58.618 --> 00:08:01.964
and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.

00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:06.125
But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once,

00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.330
and the price for this is that

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.434
teachers are not paid particularly well.

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:13.113
Students don't have long hours of learning.

00:08:13.113 --> 00:08:16.355
And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:20.036
So you can see two countries spent their money very differently,

00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:22.356
and actually how they spent their money

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:28.359
matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:30.913
Let's go back to the year 2000.

00:08:30.913 --> 00:08:34.908
Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.

00:08:34.908 --> 00:08:37.032
This is how the world looked then

00:08:37.032 --> 00:08:41.293
in terms of PISA performance.

00:08:41.293 --> 00:08:44.108
The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?

00:08:44.108 --> 00:08:45.739
We spent a lot less on education,

00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:47.811
about 35 percent less on education.

00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:51.556
So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive,

00:08:51.556 --> 00:08:54.909
has it become so much better?

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.908
And the bitter truth really is that, you know,

00:08:57.908 --> 00:09:00.353
not in many countries.

00:09:00.353 --> 00:09:02.436
But there are some countries which have seen

00:09:02.436 --> 00:09:05.384
impressive improvements.

00:09:05.384 --> 00:09:09.180
Germany, my own country, in the year 2000,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.068
featured in the lower quadrant,

00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:14.233
below average performance, large social disparities.

00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:16.236
And remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries

00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:19.964
that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.

00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:21.725
Very disappointing results.

00:09:21.725 --> 00:09:24.462
People were stunned by the results.

00:09:24.462 --> 00:09:28.253
And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany

00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:31.959
was dominated for months by education,

00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:34.693
not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education

00:09:34.693 --> 00:09:37.244
was the center of the public debate.

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:40.463
And then policymakers began to respond to this.

00:09:40.463 --> 00:09:44.693
The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.

00:09:44.693 --> 00:09:48.322
A lot was done to increase the life chances of students

00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:51.284
with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.

00:09:51.284 --> 00:09:55.792
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about

00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:59.551
optimizing existing policies,

00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:02.964
but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms

00:10:02.964 --> 00:10:04.751
underlying German education.

00:10:04.751 --> 00:10:08.637
For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children

00:10:08.637 --> 00:10:11.255
was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:14.287
where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities

00:10:14.287 --> 00:10:17.375
when they sent their children to kindergarten.

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:20.023
PISA has transformed that debate,

00:10:20.023 --> 00:10:22.796
and pushed early childhood education right at the center

00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:25.188
of public policy in Germany.

00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:28.889
Or traditionally, the German education divides children

00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:31.637
at the age of 10, very young children,

00:10:31.637 --> 00:10:35.826
between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers

00:10:35.826 --> 00:10:39.176
and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers,

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:41.652
and that mainly along socioeconomic lines,

00:10:41.652 --> 00:10:45.820
and that paradigm is being challenged now too.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.304
A lot of change.

00:10:48.304 --> 00:10:51.258
And the good news is, nine years later,

00:10:51.258 --> 00:10:54.357
you can see improvements in quality and equity.

00:10:54.357 --> 00:10:56.633
People have taken up the challenge, done something about it.

00:10:56.633 --> 00:10:58.761
Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.

00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:01.306
In the year 2000, Korea did already very well,

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:04.631
but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:08.990
of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.804
They took up the challenge,

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:14.338
and Korea was able to double the proportion of students

00:11:14.338 --> 00:11:18.740
achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.293
Well, if you only focus on your brightest students,

00:11:21.293 --> 00:11:23.212
you know what happens is disparities grow,

00:11:23.212 --> 00:11:27.012
and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction,

00:11:27.012 --> 00:11:29.723
but still, an impressive improvement.

00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:32.309
A major overhaul of Poland's education

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:35.942
helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools,

00:11:35.942 --> 00:11:38.636
turn around many of the lowest-performing schools,

00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:43.470
and raise performance by over half a school year.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.261
And you can see other countries as well.

00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:48.204
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system,

00:11:48.204 --> 00:11:51.196
raise quality and improve equity,

00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:53.072
and so did Hungary.

00:11:53.072 --> 00:11:56.503
So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.

00:11:56.503 --> 00:11:59.436
And even those people who complain and say that

00:11:59.436 --> 00:12:01.125
the relative standing of countries

00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:04.547
on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture,

00:12:04.547 --> 00:12:07.589
of economic factors, of social issues,

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:10.651
of homogeneity of societies, and so on,

00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:15.493
these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.

00:12:15.493 --> 00:12:18.533
You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.

00:12:18.533 --> 00:12:21.037
It didn't change its economy. It didn't change

00:12:21.037 --> 00:12:23.129
the compositions of its population.

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:25.983
It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies

00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:28.623
and practice. Very impressive.

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.588
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn

00:12:31.588 --> 00:12:33.692
from those countries in the green quadrant

00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:35.967
who have achieved high levels of equity,

00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:39.699
high levels of performance, and raised outcomes?

00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:43.613
And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context

00:12:43.613 --> 00:12:46.329
provide a model elsewhere?

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:49.659
Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale,

00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:53.586
but these comparisons have identified a range of factors

00:12:53.586 --> 00:12:56.907
that high-performing systems share.

00:12:56.907 --> 00:12:59.467
Everybody agrees that education is important.

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:01.454
Everybody says that.

00:13:01.454 --> 00:13:04.709
But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:07.005
against other priorities?

00:13:07.005 --> 00:13:09.018
How do countries pay their teachers

00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:12.123
relative to other highly skilled workers?

00:13:12.123 --> 00:13:14.608
Would you want your child to become a teacher

00:13:14.608 --> 00:13:16.720
rather than a lawyer?

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.722
How do the media talk about schools and teachers?

00:13:18.722 --> 00:13:21.227
Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned

00:13:21.227 --> 00:13:25.321
from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems,

00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:28.871
the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices

00:13:28.871 --> 00:13:31.249
that value education, their future,

00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:33.921
more than consumption today.

00:13:33.921 --> 00:13:35.967
And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it,

00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:38.953
but there are countries in which the most attractive place

00:13:38.953 --> 00:13:41.873
to be is not the shopping center but the school.

00:13:41.873 --> 00:13:44.140
Those things really exist.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.113
But placing a high value on education

00:13:46.113 --> 00:13:48.964
is just part of the picture.

00:13:48.964 --> 00:13:51.993
The other part is the belief that all children

00:13:51.993 --> 00:13:55.428
are capable of success.

00:13:55.428 --> 00:13:57.189
You have some countries where students

00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:59.428
are segregated early in their ages.

00:13:59.428 --> 00:14:01.474
You know, students are divided up,

00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:03.809
reflecting the belief that only some children

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:07.361
can achieve world-class standards.

00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:11.416
But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.

00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:14.800
If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.906
parents and teachers in those countries

00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:20.817
expect every student to succeed,

00:14:20.817 --> 00:14:24.309
and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.

00:14:24.309 --> 00:14:27.025
When we asked students what counts

00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:29.761
for success in mathematics,

00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:32.153
students in North America would typically tell us,

00:14:32.153 --> 00:14:33.699
you know, it's all about talent.

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:38.325
If I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.

00:14:38.325 --> 00:14:41.051
Nine out of 10 Japanese students say

00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:45.297
that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort,

00:14:45.297 --> 00:14:50.032
and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.

00:14:50.032 --> 00:14:54.841
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways.

00:14:54.841 --> 00:14:58.173
High performers on PISA embrace diversity

00:14:58.173 --> 00:15:01.921
with differentiated pedagogical practices.

00:15:01.921 --> 00:15:03.897
They realize that

00:15:03.897 --> 00:15:07.041
ordinary students have extraordinary talents,

00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:10.401
and they personalize learning opportunities.

00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:12.437
High-performing systems also share

00:15:12.437 --> 00:15:16.043
clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.

00:15:16.043 --> 00:15:18.245
Every student knows what matters.

00:15:18.245 --> 00:15:22.332
Every student knows what's required to be successful.

00:15:22.332 --> 00:15:25.197
And nowhere does the quality of an education system

00:15:25.197 --> 00:15:27.640
exceed the quality of its teachers.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.708
High-performing systems are very careful

00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:32.842
in how they recruit and select their teachers

00:15:32.842 --> 00:15:34.563
and how they train them.

00:15:34.563 --> 00:15:37.393
They watch how they improve the performances of teachers

00:15:37.393 --> 00:15:39.713
in difficulties who are struggling,

00:15:39.713 --> 00:15:42.622
and how they structure teacher pay.

00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:46.318
They provide an environment also in which teachers work together

00:15:46.318 --> 00:15:49.875
to frame good practice.

00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:54.036
And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:56.151
in their careers.

00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:57.775
In bureaucratic school systems,

00:15:57.775 --> 00:15:59.768
teachers are often left alone in classrooms

00:15:59.768 --> 00:16:02.935
with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.

00:16:02.935 --> 00:16:06.145
High-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.

00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:08.919
They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:10.696
their teachers to figure out,

00:16:10.696 --> 00:16:14.811
what do I need to teach to my students today?

00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:19.357
The past was about delivered wisdom in education.

00:16:19.357 --> 00:16:24.599
Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.

00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:28.239
High performers have moved on from professional

00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:31.903
or from administrative forms of accountability and control --

00:16:31.903 --> 00:16:35.140
sort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education --

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.806
to professional forms of work organization.

00:16:38.806 --> 00:16:42.678
They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.

00:16:42.678 --> 00:16:45.168
They provide them with the kind of development they need

00:16:45.168 --> 00:16:49.230
to develop stronger pedagogical practices.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:54.888
The goal of the past was standardization and compliance.

00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:57.622
High-performing systems have made teachers

00:16:57.622 --> 00:17:00.908
and school principals inventive.

00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:03.607
In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes,

00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:05.789
on provision.

00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:08.592
The high-performing systems have helped teachers

00:17:08.592 --> 00:17:11.033
and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher,

00:17:11.033 --> 00:17:13.726
the next school around their lives.

00:17:13.726 --> 00:17:15.892
And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems

00:17:15.892 --> 00:17:19.039
is that they achieve high performance across the entire system.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.236
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA,

00:17:21.236 --> 00:17:22.926
but what makes Finland so impressive

00:17:22.926 --> 00:17:26.903
is that only five percent of the performance variation

00:17:26.903 --> 00:17:29.359
amongst students lies between schools.

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:31.675
Every school succeeds.

00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:34.406
This is where success is systemic.

00:17:34.406 --> 00:17:36.110
And how do they do that?

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.802
They invest resources where they can make the most difference.

00:17:38.802 --> 00:17:43.910
They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools,

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.118
and the most talented teachers

00:17:46.118 --> 00:17:48.061
into the most challenging classroom.

00:17:48.061 --> 00:17:51.190
Last but not least, those countries align policies

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.410
across all areas of public policy.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.543
They make them coherent over sustained periods of time,

00:17:56.543 --> 00:18:01.246
and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.550
Now, knowing what successful systems are doing

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.341
doesn't yet tell us how to improve.

00:18:06.341 --> 00:18:08.799
That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:12.274
of international comparisons of PISA are.

00:18:12.274 --> 00:18:14.977
That's where other forms of research need to kick in,

00:18:14.977 --> 00:18:17.435
and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into

00:18:17.435 --> 00:18:19.195
telling countries what they should be doing.

00:18:19.195 --> 00:18:21.018
But its strength lies in telling them

00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:23.773
what everybody else has been doing.

00:18:23.773 --> 00:18:25.969
And the example of PISA shows that data

00:18:25.969 --> 00:18:29.287
can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy

00:18:29.287 --> 00:18:33.228
through which we usually run education systems.

00:18:33.228 --> 00:18:36.266
You know, some people argue that

00:18:36.266 --> 00:18:38.454
changing educational administration

00:18:38.454 --> 00:18:40.895
is like moving graveyards.

00:18:40.895 --> 00:18:45.782
You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this. (Laughter)

00:18:45.782 --> 00:18:50.649
But PISA has shown what's possible in education.

00:18:50.649 --> 00:18:54.454
It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.

00:18:54.454 --> 00:18:58.662
It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent.

00:18:58.662 --> 00:19:02.095
And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets

00:19:02.095 --> 00:19:05.193
in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.

00:19:05.193 --> 00:19:09.743
If we can help every child, every teacher, every school,

00:19:09.743 --> 00:19:13.398
every principal, every parent see what improvement is possible,

00:19:13.398 --> 00:19:16.134
that only the sky is the limit to education improvement,

00:19:16.134 --> 00:19:18.030
we have laid the foundations

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.213
for better policies and better lives.

00:19:20.213 --> 00:19:22.746
Thank you.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:26.746
(Applause)
