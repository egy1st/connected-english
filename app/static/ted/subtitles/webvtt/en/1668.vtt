00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.237
"When the crisis came,

00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:07.947
the serious limitations
of existing economic and financial models

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:09.867
immediately became apparent."

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.349
"There is also a strong belief,
which I share,

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:21.337
that bad or oversimplistic
and overconfident economics

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.266
helped create the crisis."

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.847
Now, you've probably all heard
of similar criticism

00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:28.874
coming from people
who are skeptical of capitalism.

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:30.717
But this is different.

00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:34.420
This is coming from the heart of finance.

00:00:34.444 --> 00:00:37.344
The first quote
is from Jean-Claude Trichet

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:40.230
when he was governor
of the European Central Bank.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.920
The second quote is from the head
of the UK Financial Services Authority.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:48.562
Are these people implying

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:51.326
that we don't understand
the economic systems

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.689
that drive our modern societies?

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.669
It gets worse.

00:00:56.444 --> 00:00:58.633
"We spend billions of dollars

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:02.534
trying to understand
the origins of the universe,

00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:08.513
while we still don't understand
the conditions for a stable society,

00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:12.186
a functioning economy, or peace."

00:01:14.177 --> 00:01:16.949
What's happening here?
How can this be possible?

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:20.220
Do we really understand more
about the fabric of reality

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:24.205
than we do about the fabric
which emerges from our human interactions?

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.532
Unfortunately, the answer is yes.

00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:29.974
But there's an intriguing solution

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:34.236
which is coming from what is known
as the science of complexity.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.472
To explain what this means
and what this thing is,

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:41.109
please let me quickly take
a couple of steps back.

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.189
I ended up in physics by accident.

00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:47.327
It was a random encounter
when I was young,

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:51.945
and since then, I've often wondered
about the amazing success of physics

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.868
in describing the reality
we wake up in every day.

00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:58.880
In a nutshell, you can think
of physics as follows.

00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:01.913
So you take a chunk of reality
you want to understand

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.682
and you translate it into mathematics.

00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.124
You encode it into equations.

00:02:09.142 --> 00:02:11.544
Then, predictions can be made and tested.

00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:15.612
We're actually
really lucky that this works,

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.524
because no one really knows
why the thoughts in our heads

00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:22.355
should actually relate to the fundamental
workings of the universe.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.148
Despite the success,
physics has its limits.

00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:30.738
As Dirk Helbing pointed out
in the last quote,

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:35.620
we don't really understand the complexity
that relates to us, that surrounds us.

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.705
This paradox is what got me interested
in complex systems.

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.605
So these are systems which are made up

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.089
of many interconnected
or interacting parts:

00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:48.922
swarms of birds or fish,

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:53.497
ant colonies, ecosystems,
brains, financial markets.

00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:55.270
These are just a few examples.

00:02:57.687 --> 00:03:02.906
Interestingly, complex systems
are very hard to map

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.929
into mathematical equations,

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:08.588
so the usual physics approach
doesn't really work here.

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:11.452
So what do we know about complex systems?

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:17.508
Well, it turns out that what looks
like complex behavior from the outside

00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:21.243
is actually the result
of a few simple rules of interaction.

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:26.835
This means you can forget
about the equations

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.585
and just start to understand the system

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.328
by looking at the interactions,

00:03:31.352 --> 00:03:33.722
so you can actually forget
about the equations

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.298
and you just start to look
at the interactions.

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:39.656
And it gets even better,
because most complex systems

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.160
have this amazing property
called emergence.

00:03:42.698 --> 00:03:46.889
So this means that the system as a whole
suddenly starts to show a behavior

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:49.785
which cannot be understood or predicted

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.362
by looking at the components
of the system.

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.687
So the whole is literally
more than the sum of its parts.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:57.933
And all of this also means

00:03:57.957 --> 00:04:02.821
that you can forget about
the individual parts of the system,

00:04:02.845 --> 00:04:04.166
how complex they are.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.178
So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,

00:04:09.202 --> 00:04:11.443
you just focus on the rules
of interaction.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.617
As a result, networks are ideal
representations of complex systems.

00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:25.620
The nodes in the network
are the system's components,

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.263
and the links are given
by the interactions.

00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:32.893
So what equations are for physics,

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:36.397
complex networks are for the study
of complex systems.

00:04:37.664 --> 00:04:40.874
This approach has been
very successfully applied

00:04:40.898 --> 00:04:44.492
to many complex systems
in physics, biology,

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:47.236
computer science, the social sciences,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.518
but what about economics?

00:04:49.557 --> 00:04:51.359
Where are economic networks?

00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:55.724
This is a surprising
and prominent gap in the literature.

00:04:56.983 --> 00:05:02.813
The study we published last year, called
"The Network of Global Corporate Control,"

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:07.474
was the first extensive analysis
of economic networks.

00:05:08.654 --> 00:05:11.216
The study went viral on the Internet

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.631
and it attracted a lot of attention
from the international media.

00:05:16.246 --> 00:05:20.465
This is quite remarkable, because, again,
why did no one look at this before?

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:23.548
Similar data has been
around for quite some time.

00:05:23.572 --> 00:05:26.751
What we looked at in detail
was ownership networks.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.719
So here the nodes are companies,
people, governments, foundations, etc.

00:05:36.124 --> 00:05:39.008
And the links represent
the shareholding relations,

00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:44.196
so shareholder A has x percent
of the shares in company B.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.395
And we also assign a value to the company
given by the operating revenue.

00:05:49.778 --> 00:05:54.322
So ownership networks reveal the patterns
of shareholding relations.

00:05:56.045 --> 00:06:00.170
In this little example,
you can see a few financial institutions

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.524
with some of the many links highlighted.

00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:06.690
Now, you may think that no one
looked at this before

00:06:06.714 --> 00:06:11.201
because ownership networks
are really, really boring to study.

00:06:11.941 --> 00:06:16.007
Well, as ownership is related to control,

00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:17.564
as I shall explain later,

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:19.005
looking at ownership networks

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.707
actually can give you
answers to questions like,

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:23.180
who are the key players?

00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:25.530
How are they organized?
Are they isolated?

00:06:25.554 --> 00:06:27.199
Are they interconnected?

00:06:27.223 --> 00:06:29.949
And what is the overall
distribution of control?

00:06:31.153 --> 00:06:34.391
In other words, who controls the world?

00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:36.757
I think this is an interesting question.

00:06:36.781 --> 00:06:39.760
And it has implications for systemic risk.

00:06:41.348 --> 00:06:45.568
This is a measure of how vulnerable
a system is overall.

00:06:46.862 --> 00:06:50.534
A high degree of interconnectivity
can be bad for stability,

00:06:51.524 --> 00:06:56.253
because then the stress can spread
through the system like an epidemic.

00:06:58.332 --> 00:07:00.865
Scientists have sometimes
criticized economists

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.745
who believe ideas and concepts
are more important than empirical data,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.108
because a foundational
guideline in science is:

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.591
Let the data speak. OK. Let's do that.

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:18.850
So we started with a database containing
13 million ownership relations from 2007.

00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:22.868
This is a lot of data,
and because we wanted to find out

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:25.000
"who rules the world,"

00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:28.428
we decided to focus
on transnational corporations,

00:07:28.452 --> 00:07:29.776
or "TNCs," for short.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.372
These are companies that operate
in more than one country,

00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:35.237
and we found 43,000.

00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:40.109
In the next step, we built
the network around these companies,

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.489
so we took all the TNCs' shareholders,

00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:44.472
and the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:47.348
all the way upstream,
and we did the same downstream,

00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:51.500
and ended up with a network
containing 600,000 nodes

00:07:51.524 --> 00:07:52.818
and one million links.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.801
This is the TNC network which we analyzed.

00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.360
And it turns out to be
structured as follows.

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.911
So you have a periphery and a center

00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:06.388
which contains about 75 percent
of all the players,

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:10.990
and in the center,
there's this tiny but dominant core

00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:14.153
which is made up of highly
interconnected companies.

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:17.382
To give you a better picture,

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:19.047
think about a metropolitan area.

00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:21.077
So you have the suburbs and the periphery,

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:23.934
you have a center,
like a financial district,

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.684
then the core will be something like

00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:28.277
the tallest high-rise building
in the center.

00:08:29.732 --> 00:08:33.189
And we already see signs
of organization going on here.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:39.564
36 percent of the TNCs
are in the core only,

00:08:39.588 --> 00:08:45.672
but they make up 95 percent of the total
operating revenue of all TNCs.

00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:49.356
OK, so now we analyzed the structure,

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.159
so how does this relate to the control?

00:08:53.517 --> 00:08:57.163
Well, ownership gives
voting rights to shareholders.

00:08:57.187 --> 00:08:59.564
This is the normal notion of control.

00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:01.429
And there are different models

00:09:01.453 --> 00:09:04.918
which allow you to compute
the control you get from ownership.

00:09:05.918 --> 00:09:08.742
If you have more than 50 percent
of the shares in a company,

00:09:08.766 --> 00:09:10.091
you get control,

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:13.785
but usually, it depends
on the relative distribution of shares.

00:09:15.092 --> 00:09:16.913
And the network really matters.

00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:21.240
About 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera

00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:24.675
had ownership and control
in a small company,

00:09:24.699 --> 00:09:27.508
which had ownership and control
in a bigger company.

00:09:27.886 --> 00:09:29.036
You get the idea.

00:09:29.454 --> 00:09:34.676
This ended up giving him control
in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.763
So this means that,
with each euro he invested,

00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:43.731
he was able to move 26 euros
of market value

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:45.923
through the chain of ownership relations.

00:09:47.175 --> 00:09:53.090
Now what we actually computed in our study
was the control over the TNCs' value.

00:09:54.035 --> 00:09:58.179
This allowed us to assign
a degree of influence to each shareholder.

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:03.930
This is very much in the sense
of Max Weber's idea of potential power,

00:10:04.864 --> 00:10:08.331
which is the probability
of imposing one's own will

00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:10.338
despite the opposition of others.

00:10:12.406 --> 00:10:17.163
If you want to compute the flow
in an ownership network,

00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:18.544
this is what you have to do.

00:10:18.568 --> 00:10:20.762
It's actually not that hard to understand.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:23.793
Let me explain by giving you this analogy.

00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:28.742
So think about water flowing in pipes,
where the pipes have different thickness.

00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:34.945
So similarly, the control is flowing
in the ownership networks

00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:37.056
and is accumulating at the nodes.

00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:42.866
So what did we find after computing
all this network control?

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:48.486
Well, it turns out
that the 737 top shareholders

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:54.080
have the potential to collectively control
80 percent of the TNCs' value.

00:10:55.728 --> 00:10:58.433
Now remember, we started out
with 600,000 nodes,

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:05.140
so these 737 top players
make up a bit more than 0.1 percent.

00:11:06.174 --> 00:11:10.494
They're mostly financial institutions
in the US and the UK.

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:12.841
And it gets even more extreme.

00:11:14.052 --> 00:11:17.342
There are 146 top players in the core,

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:22.181
and they together have the potential
to collectively control

00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:25.986
40 percent of the TNCs' value.

00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.355
What should you take home
from all of this?

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:37.363
Well, the high degree of control you saw
is very extreme by any standard.

00:11:39.285 --> 00:11:44.160
The high degree of interconnectivity
of the top players in the core

00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:48.722
could pose a significant systemic risk
to the global economy.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.442
And we could easily
reproduce the TNC network

00:11:52.466 --> 00:11:54.053
with a few simple rules.

00:11:54.766 --> 00:11:58.420
This means that its structure is probably
the result of self-organization.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:04.673
It's an emergent property which depends
on the rules of interaction in the system,

00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:08.512
so it's probably not the result
of a top-down approach

00:12:08.536 --> 00:12:10.239
like a global conspiracy.

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:14.698
Our study "is an impression
of the moon's surface.

00:12:14.722 --> 00:12:16.031
It's not a street map."

00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:19.865
So you should take the exact numbers
in our study with a grain of salt,

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:25.972
yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse
of a brave new world of finance."

00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:32.217
We hope to have opened the door
for more such research in this direction,

00:12:32.241 --> 00:12:36.538
so the remaining unknown terrain
will be charted in the future.

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.617
And this is slowly starting.

00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:43.732
We're seeing the emergence of long-term
and highly-funded programs

00:12:43.756 --> 00:12:47.383
which aim at understanding
our networked world

00:12:47.407 --> 00:12:49.137
from a complexity point of view.

00:12:49.861 --> 00:12:51.659
But this journey has only just begun,

00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:55.384
so we will have to wait
before we see the first results.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.589
Now there is still
a big problem, in my opinion.

00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:07.466
Ideas relating to finance,
economics, politics, society,

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.435
are very often tainted
by people's personal ideologies.

00:13:13.448 --> 00:13:16.976
I really hope that this
complexity perspective

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:21.184
allows for some common ground to be found.

00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:25.214
It would be really great
if it has the power

00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:30.367
to help end the gridlock
created by conflicting ideas,

00:13:30.391 --> 00:13:33.698
which appears to be paralyzing
our globalized world.

00:13:35.572 --> 00:13:39.319
Reality is so complex,
we need to move away from dogma.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.917
But this is just my own personal ideology.

00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:44.092
Thank you.

00:13:44.116 --> 00:13:50.388
(Applause)
