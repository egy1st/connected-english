00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:04.848
So, why does good sex so often fade,

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:08.492
even for couples who continue
to love each other as much as ever?

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:12.506
And why does good intimacy
not guarantee good sex,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.393
contrary to popular belief?

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:17.331
Or, the next question would be,

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:19.395
can we want what we already have?

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:22.084
That's the million-dollar question, right?

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:24.330
And why is the forbidden so erotic?

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:28.070
What is it about transgression
that makes desire so potent?

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.078
And why does sex make babies,

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:32.712
and babies spell erotic
disaster in couples?

00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:34.343
(Laughter)

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.545
It's kind of the fatal
erotic blow, isn't it?

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:39.327
And when you love, how does it feel?

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.831
And when you desire, how is it different?

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.148
These are some of the questions

00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:49.638
that are at the center of my exploration
on the nature of erotic desire

00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:53.086
and its concomitant
dilemmas in modern love.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.060
So I travel the globe,

00:00:55.084 --> 00:01:00.443
and what I'm noticing is that everywhere
where romanticism has entered,

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:02.892
there seems to be a crisis of desire.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.136
A crisis of desire,
as in owning the wanting --

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.146
desire as an expression
of our individuality,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.135
of our free choice,
of our preferences, of our identity --

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.461
desire that has become a central concept

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:21.685
as part of modern love
and individualistic societies.

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.926
You know, this is the first time
in the history of humankind

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.356
where we are trying to experience
sexuality in the long term

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.742
not because we want 14 children,

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:38.938
for which we need to have even more
because many of them won't make it,

00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:43.107
and not because it is exclusively
a woman's marital duty.

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:47.906
This is the first time
that we want sex over time

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.476
about pleasure and connection
that is rooted in desire.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.520
So what sustains desire,
and why is it so difficult?

00:01:56.255 --> 00:02:01.063
And at the heart of sustaining
desire in a committed relationship,

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:06.670
I think, is the reconciliation
of two fundamental human needs.

00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:11.832
On the one hand, our need
for security, for predictability,

00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:15.751
for safety, for dependability,

00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:19.224
for reliability, for permanence.

00:02:19.248 --> 00:02:22.342
All these anchoring,
grounding experiences of our lives

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:23.518
that we call home.

00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:28.444
But we also have an equally
strong need -- men and women --

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:30.893
for adventure, for novelty,

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:34.028
for mystery, for risk, for danger,

00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:37.318
for the unknown,
for the unexpected, surprise --

00:02:37.342 --> 00:02:39.249
you get the gist.

00:02:39.273 --> 00:02:40.873
For journey, for travel.

00:02:41.248 --> 00:02:44.773
So reconciling our need for security
and our need for adventure

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.347
into one relationship,

00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:49.230
or what we today like to call
a passionate marriage,

00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:51.512
used to be a contradiction in terms.

00:02:51.948 --> 00:02:55.226
Marriage was an economic institution

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.288
in which you were
given a partnership for life

00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:01.032
in terms of children and social status

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.839
and succession and companionship.

00:03:03.863 --> 00:03:07.868
But now we want our partner
to still give us all these things,

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:10.320
but in addition I want you
to be my best friend

00:03:10.344 --> 00:03:13.554
and my trusted confidant
and my passionate lover to boot,

00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:14.958
and we live twice as long.

00:03:14.982 --> 00:03:17.878
(Laughter)

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:21.882
So we come to one person,
and we basically are asking them

00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:24.798
to give us what once
an entire village used to provide.

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.110
Give me belonging, give me identity,

00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:29.449
give me continuity,

00:03:29.473 --> 00:03:33.109
but give me transcendence
and mystery and awe all in one.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.139
Give me comfort, give me edge.

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.061
Give me novelty, give me familiarity.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:39.351
Give me predictability, give me surprise.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:40.724
And we think it's a given,

00:03:40.748 --> 00:03:43.349
and toys and lingerie
are going to save us with that.

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:45.274
(Laughter)

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:49.243
(Applause)

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:52.728
So now we get to the existential
reality of the story, right?

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.158
Because I think, in some way --

00:03:57.182 --> 00:03:58.839
and I'll come back to that --

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:02.290
but the crisis of desire
is often a crisis of the imagination.

00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:05.913
So why does good sex so often fade?

00:04:05.937 --> 00:04:08.461
What is the relationship
between love and desire?

00:04:08.485 --> 00:04:11.362
How do they relate,
and how do they conflict?

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:14.235
Because therein lies
the mystery of eroticism.

00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:18.629
So if there is a verb, for me,
that comes with love, it's "to have."

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:22.339
And if there is a verb that comes
with desire, it is "to want."

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:27.243
In love, we want to have,
we want to know the beloved.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.549
We want to minimize the distance.

00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:31.529
We want to contract that gap.

00:04:31.553 --> 00:04:33.825
We want to neutralize the tensions.

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.299
We want closeness.

00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:37.167
But in desire,

00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:40.982
we tend to not really want to go back
to the places we've already gone.

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:44.327
Forgone conclusion
does not keep our interest.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.865
In desire, we want an Other,

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.914
somebody on the other side
that we can go visit,

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:52.096
that we can go spend some time with,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.265
that we can go see what goes on
in their red-light district.

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:56.876
You know?

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.269
In desire, we want a bridge to cross.

00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:02.274
Or in other words,
I sometimes say, fire needs air.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:04.512
Desire needs space.

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:08.443
And when it's said like that,
it's often quite abstract.

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.134
But then I took a question with me.

00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:13.063
And I've gone to more than 20 countries
in the last few years

00:05:13.087 --> 00:05:15.451
with "Mating in Captivity,"
and I asked people,

00:05:15.475 --> 00:05:18.607
when do you find yourself
most drawn to your partner?

00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.498
Not attracted sexually,
per Se, but most drawn.

00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:26.504
And across culture, across religion,
and across gender -- except for one --

00:05:26.528 --> 00:05:30.406
there are a few answers
that just keep coming back.

00:05:30.843 --> 00:05:32.676
So the first group is:

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.891
I am most drawn to my partner
when she is away,

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:41.476
when we are apart, when we reunite.

00:05:42.057 --> 00:05:45.493
Basically, when I get back in touch

00:05:45.517 --> 00:05:49.204
with my ability to imagine myself
with my partner,

00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:52.286
when my imagination comes
back in the picture,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.950
and when I can root it
in absence and in longing,

00:05:56.974 --> 00:05:59.195
which is a major component of desire.

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:02.898
But then the second group
is even more interesting.

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:04.583
I am most drawn to my partner

00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:07.129
when I see him in the studio,

00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:08.700
when she is onstage,

00:06:08.724 --> 00:06:10.400
when he is in his element,

00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:12.938
when she's doing something
she's passionate about,

00:06:12.962 --> 00:06:16.343
when I see him at a party
and other people are really drawn to him,

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:18.288
when I see her hold court.

00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.995
Basically, when I look at my partner
radiant and confident.

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.903
Probably the biggest
turn-on across the board.

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:28.929
Radiant, as in self-sustaining.

00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:31.946
I look at this person --
by the way, in desire

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.723
people rarely talk about it,
when we are blended into one,

00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:36.367
five centimeters from each other.

00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:38.302
I don't know in inches how much that is.

00:06:38.326 --> 00:06:41.217
But it's also not when the other person
is that far apart

00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.977
that you no longer see them.

00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:47.001
It's when I'm looking at my partner
from a comfortable distance,

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:51.350
where this person that is already
so familiar, so known,

00:06:51.374 --> 00:06:55.814
is momentarily once again
somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.

00:06:56.322 --> 00:07:01.044
And in this space between me
and the other lies the erotic élan,

00:07:01.068 --> 00:07:03.204
lies that movement toward the other.

00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:05.800
Because sometimes, as Proust says,

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:08.475
mystery is not
about traveling to new places,

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.654
but it's about looking with new eyes.

00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:14.507
And so, when I see my partner
on his own or her own,

00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:17.340
doing something
in which they are enveloped,

00:07:17.364 --> 00:07:21.755
I look at this person and I momentarily
get a shift in perception,

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:25.716
and I stay open to the mysteries
that are living right next to me.

00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:31.771
And then, more importantly,
in this description about the other

00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:33.621
or myself -- it's the same --

00:07:33.645 --> 00:07:37.702
what is most interesting
is that there is no neediness in desire.

00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:40.030
Nobody needs anybody.

00:07:40.054 --> 00:07:42.512
There is no caretaking in desire.

00:07:42.536 --> 00:07:44.680
Caretaking is mightily loving.

00:07:44.704 --> 00:07:46.408
It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.433
(Laughter)

00:07:47.457 --> 00:07:49.786
I have yet to see somebody
who is so turned on

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.488
by somebody who needs them.

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:53.228
Wanting them is one thing.

00:07:53.252 --> 00:07:54.981
Needing them is a shot down

00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:56.882
and women have known that forever,

00:07:56.906 --> 00:07:59.489
because anything
that will bring up parenthood

00:07:59.513 --> 00:08:01.852
will usually decrease the erotic charge.

00:08:01.876 --> 00:08:03.089
(Laughter)

00:08:03.113 --> 00:08:04.829
For good reasons, right?

00:08:04.853 --> 00:08:08.082
And then the third group
of answers usually would be:

00:08:08.106 --> 00:08:12.502
when I'm surprised,
when we laugh together,

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:14.787
as somebody said to me
in the office today,

00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:16.811
when he's in his tux, so I said, you know,

00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:19.943
it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:23.349
But basically it's when there is novelty.

00:08:23.373 --> 00:08:26.185
But novelty isn't about new positions.

00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:28.140
It isn't a repertoire of techniques.

00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:31.385
Novelty is, what parts
of you do you bring out?

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:34.191
What parts of you are just being seen?

00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:38.133
Because in some way one could say
sex isn't something you do, eh?

00:08:38.157 --> 00:08:39.498
Sex is a place you go.

00:08:39.882 --> 00:08:41.367
It's a space you enter

00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:44.913
inside yourself
and with another, or others.

00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:46.802
So where do you go in sex?

00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:49.587
What parts of you do you connect to?

00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:51.786
What do you seek to express there?

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.976
Is it a place for transcendence
and spiritual union?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.303
Is it a place for naughtiness
and is it a place to be safely aggressive?

00:08:59.327 --> 00:09:01.647
Is it a place where you
can finally surrender

00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:04.815
and not have to take
responsibility for everything?

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:07.791
Is it a place where you can
express your infantile wishes?

00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:10.071
What comes out there? It's a language.

00:09:10.095 --> 00:09:12.213
It isn't just a behavior.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:15.383
And it's the poetic of that language
that I'm interested in,

00:09:15.407 --> 00:09:18.971
which is why I began to explore
this concept of erotic intelligence.

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:21.161
You know, animals have sex.

00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:25.076
It's the pivot, it's biology,
it's the natural instinct.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.330
We are the only ones
who have an erotic life,

00:09:28.354 --> 00:09:33.512
which means that it's sexuality
transformed by the human imagination.

00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:37.742
We are the only ones
who can make love for hours,

00:09:37.766 --> 00:09:40.614
have a blissful time, multiple orgasms,

00:09:40.638 --> 00:09:43.803
and touch nobody,
just because we can imagine it.

00:09:44.573 --> 00:09:47.367
We can hint at it.
We don't even have to do it.

00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:50.861
We can experience that powerful
thing called anticipation,

00:09:50.885 --> 00:09:53.309
which is a mortar to desire.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:56.952
The ability to imagine it,
as if it's happening,

00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:59.350
to experience it as if it's happening,

00:09:59.374 --> 00:10:00.860
while nothing is happening

00:10:00.884 --> 00:10:03.151
and everything is happening,
at the same time.

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.075
So when I began to think about eroticism,

00:10:06.099 --> 00:10:08.670
I began to think about the poetics of sex.

00:10:09.448 --> 00:10:11.756
And if I look at it as an intelligence,

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.953
then it's something that you cultivate.

00:10:13.977 --> 00:10:15.525
What are the ingredients?

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:18.196
Imagination, playfulness,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.332
novelty, curiosity, mystery.

00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:26.543
But the central agent is really
that piece called the imagination.

00:10:26.567 --> 00:10:29.702
But more importantly,
for me to begin to understand

00:10:29.726 --> 00:10:32.298
who are the couples
who have an erotic spark,

00:10:32.322 --> 00:10:34.124
what sustains desire,

00:10:34.148 --> 00:10:37.538
I had to go back
to the original definition of eroticism,

00:10:37.562 --> 00:10:39.395
the mystical definition,

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:41.506
and I went through it
through a bifurcation

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.628
by looking, actually, at trauma,

00:10:43.652 --> 00:10:45.419
which is the other side.

00:10:45.443 --> 00:10:46.644
And I looked at it,

00:10:46.668 --> 00:10:48.998
looking at the community
that I had grown up in,

00:10:49.022 --> 00:10:52.836
which was a community in Belgium,
all Holocaust survivors,

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.466
and in my community,
there were two groups:

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.622
those who didn't die,
and those who came back to life.

00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:02.677
And those who didn't die lived
often very tethered to the ground,

00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:06.192
could not experience
pleasure, could not trust,

00:11:06.216 --> 00:11:10.217
because when you're vigilant,
worried, anxious, and insecure,

00:11:10.241 --> 00:11:13.780
you can't lift your head
to go and take off in space

00:11:13.804 --> 00:11:16.492
and be playful and safe and imaginative.

00:11:17.238 --> 00:11:19.031
Those who came back to life

00:11:19.055 --> 00:11:22.341
were those who understood
the erotic as an antidote to death.

00:11:22.365 --> 00:11:25.124
They knew how to keep themselves alive.

00:11:25.941 --> 00:11:27.491
And when I began to listen

00:11:27.515 --> 00:11:30.021
to the sexlessness
of the couples that I work with,

00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:32.989
I sometimes would hear people
say, "I want more sex,"

00:11:33.013 --> 00:11:35.542
but generally, people want better sex,

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:38.796
and better is to reconnect
with that quality of aliveness,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.599
of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,

00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:43.224
of Eros, of energy

00:11:43.248 --> 00:11:44.919
that sex used to afford them,

00:11:44.943 --> 00:11:47.188
or that they've hoped
it would afford them.

00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:50.157
And so I began to ask
a different question.

00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:55.267
"I shut myself off when ..."
began to be the question.

00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:57.281
"I turn off my desires when ..."

00:11:57.305 --> 00:11:58.974
Which is not the same question as,

00:11:58.998 --> 00:12:02.072
"What turns me off is ..."
and "You turn me off when ..."

00:12:02.851 --> 00:12:06.008
And people began to say,
"I turn myself off when

00:12:06.032 --> 00:12:08.913
I feel dead inside,
when I don't like my body,

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.182
when I feel old,

00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:11.929
when I haven't had time for myself,

00:12:11.953 --> 00:12:14.553
when I haven't had a chance
to even check in with you,

00:12:14.577 --> 00:12:16.297
when I don't perform well at work,

00:12:16.321 --> 00:12:17.746
when I feel low self esteem,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.737
when I don't have a sense of self-worth,

00:12:19.761 --> 00:12:22.616
when I don't feel like I have
a right to want, to take,

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.272
to receive pleasure."

00:12:25.164 --> 00:12:27.306
And then I began to ask
the reverse question.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.140
"I turn myself on when ..."

00:12:29.164 --> 00:12:31.965
Because most of the time,
people like to ask the question,

00:12:31.989 --> 00:12:34.175
"You turn me on, what turns me on,"

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:36.448
and I'm out of the question, you know?

00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:38.079
Now, if you are dead inside,

00:12:38.103 --> 00:12:40.824
the other person can do
a lot of things for Valentine's.

00:12:40.848 --> 00:12:43.753
It won't make a dent.
There is nobody at the reception desk.

00:12:43.777 --> 00:12:45.051
(Laughter)

00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:47.453
So I turn myself on when,

00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:50.937
I turn on my desires, I wake up when ...

00:12:51.488 --> 00:12:56.082
Now, in this paradox
between love and desire,

00:12:56.106 --> 00:12:58.208
what seems to be so puzzling

00:12:58.232 --> 00:13:02.101
is that the very ingredients
that nurture love --

00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:04.550
mutuality, reciprocity,

00:13:04.574 --> 00:13:08.311
protection, worry,
responsibility for the other --

00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:11.755
are sometimes the very ingredients
that stifle desire.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.498
Because desire comes
with a host of feelings

00:13:16.522 --> 00:13:20.376
that are not always
such favorites of love:

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.169
jealousy, possessiveness,

00:13:22.193 --> 00:13:24.741
aggression, power, dominance,

00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:26.519
naughtiness, mischief.

00:13:26.543 --> 00:13:30.831
Basically most of us will get turned on
at night by the very same things

00:13:30.855 --> 00:13:33.218
that we will demonstrate
against during the day.

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:36.880
You know, the erotic mind
is not very politically correct.

00:13:36.904 --> 00:13:39.536
If everybody was fantasizing
on a bed of roses,

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.184
we wouldn't be having such
interesting talks about this.

00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:43.209
(Laughter)

00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:48.566
But no, in our mind up there
are a host of things going on

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.733
that we don't always know
how to bring to the person that we love,

00:13:51.757 --> 00:13:54.688
because we think love
comes with selflessness

00:13:54.712 --> 00:13:58.258
and in fact desire comes
with a certain amount of selfishness

00:13:58.282 --> 00:14:00.235
in the best sense of the word:

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:04.639
the ability to stay connected
to one's self in the presence of another.

00:14:05.075 --> 00:14:07.613
So I want to draw
that little image for you,

00:14:07.637 --> 00:14:11.322
because this need to reconcile
these two sets of needs,

00:14:11.346 --> 00:14:12.866
we are born with that.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.762
Our need for connection,
our need for separateness,

00:14:15.786 --> 00:14:17.971
or our need for security and adventure,

00:14:17.995 --> 00:14:20.825
or our need for togetherness
and for autonomy,

00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:24.000
and if you think about the little kid
who sits on your lap

00:14:24.024 --> 00:14:27.903
and who is cozily nested here
and very secure and comfortable,

00:14:27.927 --> 00:14:32.169
and at some point all of us
need to go out into the world

00:14:32.193 --> 00:14:34.312
to discover and to explore.

00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:36.170
That's the beginning of desire,

00:14:36.194 --> 00:14:40.010
that exploratory need,
curiosity, discovery.

00:14:41.194 --> 00:14:44.916
And then at some point they turn
around and they look at you.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.689
And if you tell them,

00:14:46.713 --> 00:14:48.710
"Hey kiddo, the world's a great place.

00:14:48.734 --> 00:14:50.859
Go for it. There's so much fun out there,"

00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:53.409
then they can turn away
and they can experience

00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:55.614
connection and separateness
at the same time.

00:14:55.638 --> 00:14:59.428
They can go off in their imagination,
off in their body,

00:14:59.452 --> 00:15:01.080
off in their playfulness,

00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:04.238
all the while knowing that there's
somebody when they come back.

00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:07.032
But if on this side
there is somebody who says,

00:15:07.056 --> 00:15:10.612
"I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.

00:15:10.636 --> 00:15:12.891
My partner hasn't taken care
of me in so long.

00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:14.263
What's so good out there?

00:15:14.287 --> 00:15:17.409
Don't we have everything
you need together, you and I?"

00:15:17.433 --> 00:15:19.522
then there are a few little reactions

00:15:19.546 --> 00:15:22.602
that all of us can pretty much recognize.

00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:25.865
Some of us will come back,

00:15:25.889 --> 00:15:27.642
came back a long time ago,

00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:30.051
and that little child who comes back

00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:33.004
is the child who will forgo
a part of himself

00:15:33.028 --> 00:15:34.742
in order not to lose the other.

00:15:35.171 --> 00:15:38.732
I will lose my freedom
in order not to lose connection.

00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:42.066
And I will learn to love in a certain way

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.906
that will become burdened with extra worry

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.450
and extra responsibility
and extra protection,

00:15:49.474 --> 00:15:51.914
and I won't know how to leave you

00:15:51.938 --> 00:15:55.458
in order to go play,
in order to go experience pleasure,

00:15:55.482 --> 00:15:58.698
in order to discover,
to enter inside myself.

00:15:58.722 --> 00:16:01.221
Translate this into adult language.

00:16:01.606 --> 00:16:03.095
It starts very young.

00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:06.398
It continues into our sex lives
up to the end.

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:09.237
Child number two comes back

00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:12.303
but looks like that
over their shoulder all the time.

00:16:12.327 --> 00:16:14.082
"Are you going to be there?

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:16.178
Are you going to curse me, scold me?

00:16:16.202 --> 00:16:17.959
Are you going to be angry with me?"

00:16:17.983 --> 00:16:21.578
And they may be gone,
but they're never really away.

00:16:21.602 --> 00:16:23.983
And those are often the people
that will tell you,

00:16:24.007 --> 00:16:26.109
"In the beginning, it was super hot."

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:28.286
Because in the beginning,

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.638
the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong

00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:34.531
that it actually led
to the decrease of desire.

00:16:34.555 --> 00:16:38.559
The more connected I became,
the more responsible I felt,

00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:41.682
the less I was able to let go
in your presence.

00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:43.750
The third child doesn't really come back.

00:16:44.346 --> 00:16:47.754
So what happens,
if you want to sustain desire,

00:16:47.778 --> 00:16:49.994
it's that real dialectic piece.

00:16:50.018 --> 00:16:53.675
On the one hand you want the security
in order to be able to go.

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:57.427
On the other hand if you can't go,
you can't have pleasure,

00:16:57.451 --> 00:17:00.471
you can't culminate,
you don't have an orgasm,

00:17:00.495 --> 00:17:02.890
you don't get excited
because you spend your time

00:17:02.914 --> 00:17:05.749
in the body and the head
of the other and not in your own.

00:17:06.352 --> 00:17:12.392
So in this dilemma about reconciling
these two sets of fundamental needs,

00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:16.565
there are a few things that I've come
to understand erotic couples do.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.542
One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.

00:17:19.566 --> 00:17:22.048
They understand
that there is an erotic space

00:17:22.072 --> 00:17:23.672
that belongs to each of them.

00:17:24.123 --> 00:17:27.258
They also understand
that foreplay is not something you do

00:17:27.282 --> 00:17:29.093
five minutes before the real thing.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.562
Foreplay pretty much starts
at the end of the previous orgasm.

00:17:33.033 --> 00:17:36.565
They also understand
that an erotic space isn't about,

00:17:36.589 --> 00:17:38.120
you begin to stroke the other.

00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:41.526
It's about you create a space
where you leave Management Inc.,

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.185
maybe where you leave the Agile program --

00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:46.893
(Laughter)

00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:51.169
And you actually just enter that place
where you stop being the good citizen

00:17:51.193 --> 00:17:53.833
who is taking care of things
and being responsible.

00:17:53.857 --> 00:17:57.377
Responsibility and desire just butt heads.

00:17:57.401 --> 00:17:59.532
They don't really do well together.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.208
Erotic couples also understand
that passion waxes and wanes.

00:18:04.232 --> 00:18:06.032
It's pretty much like the moon.

00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:07.777
It has intermittent eclipses.

00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:10.400
But what they know
is they know how to resurrect it.

00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:12.092
They know how to bring it back.

00:18:12.116 --> 00:18:13.736
And they know how to bring it back

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.122
because they have
demystified one big myth,

00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:18.495
which is the myth of spontaneity,

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:20.926
which is that it's just going
to fall from heaven

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.908
while you're folding the laundry
like a deus ex machina,

00:18:23.932 --> 00:18:25.877
and in fact they understood

00:18:25.901 --> 00:18:31.043
that whatever is going to just happen
in a long-term relationship, already has.

00:18:31.067 --> 00:18:33.829
Committed sex is premeditated sex.

00:18:33.853 --> 00:18:36.145
It's willful. It's intentional.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.217
It's focus and presence.

00:18:40.114 --> 00:18:41.234
Merry Valentine's.

00:18:41.258 --> 00:18:44.404
(Applause)
