00:00:00.473 --> 00:00:05.081
There's a group of people in Kenya.

00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:09.085
People cross oceans to go see them.

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:11.119
These people are tall.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.626
They jump high. They wear red.

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:17.738
And they kill lions.

00:00:17.738 --> 00:00:20.795
You might be wondering, who are these people?

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.389
These are the Maasais.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:29.291
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:33.651
The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.

00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:36.898
The girls are brought up to be mothers.

00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:39.426
When I was five years old,

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:41.994
I found out that I was engaged

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:45.080
to be married as soon as I reached puberty.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.066
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties,

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.244
they constantly reminded me that

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.964
your husband just passed by.

00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:57.910
(Laughter) Cool, yeah?

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.075
And everything I had to do from that moment

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:05.706
was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.

00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:09.283
My day started at 5 in the morning,

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:11.440
milking the cows, sweeping the house,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.979
cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.221
I did everything that I needed to do

00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:22.848
to become a perfect wife.

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:25.912
I went to school not because the Maasais'

00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:28.553
women or girls were going to school.

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:31.710
It's because my mother was denied an education,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.179
and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.127
she never wanted us to live the life she was living.

00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:41.656
Why did she say that?

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:44.984
My father worked as a policeman in the city.

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:46.614
He came home once a year.

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:49.971
We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.

00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:53.859
And whenever he came home, it was a different case.

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.864
My mother worked hard in the farm

00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:57.730
to grow crops so that we can eat.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.833
She reared the cows and the goats

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.848
so that she can care for us.

00:02:01.848 --> 00:02:04.678
But when my father came, he would sell the cows,

00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:07.061
he would sell the products we had,

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:11.256
and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.649
Because my mother was a woman,

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.650
she was not allowed to own any property,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.144
and by default, everything in my family anyway

00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:20.816
belongs to my father, so he had the right.

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:23.105
And if my mother ever questioned him,

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:29.893
he beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.

00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:32.899
When I went to school, I had a dream.

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.304
I wanted to become a teacher.

00:02:35.304 --> 00:02:37.110
Teachers looked nice.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.363
They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.

00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:42.466
I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.

00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:45.721
(Laughter)

00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.222
But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board --

00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:52.296
not hard work, that's what I thought,

00:02:52.296 --> 00:02:55.176
compared to what I was doing in the farm.

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:57.123
So I wanted to become a teacher.

00:02:57.123 --> 00:03:01.026
I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade,

00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:03.430
it was a determining factor.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.003
In our tradition, there is a ceremony

00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.836
that girls have to undergo to become women,

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:11.417
and it's a rite of passage to womanhood.

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:14.985
And then I was just finishing my eighth grade,

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:17.536
and that was a transition for me to go to high school.

00:03:17.536 --> 00:03:19.117
This was the crossroad.

00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:24.639
Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.881
Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.

00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:31.396
So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:33.960
to figure these things out.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.096
I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done.

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:41.296
I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony

00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:43.876
if you let me go back to school."

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:46.464
The reason why, if I ran away,

00:03:46.464 --> 00:03:49.910
my father will have a stigma, people will be calling him

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.951
the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.

00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:56.970
It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.822
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay,

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:03.155
you'll go to school after the ceremony."

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:05.775
I did. The ceremony happened.

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:09.356
It's a whole week long of excitement.

00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:11.521
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.

00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:14.489
And the day before the actual ceremony happens,

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.977
we were dancing, having excitement,

00:04:16.977 --> 00:04:20.900
and through all the night we did not sleep.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.230
The actual day came, and we walked out of the house

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.384
that we were dancing in. Yes, we danced and danced.

00:04:26.384 --> 00:04:30.253
We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.

00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:32.864
They were all in a circle.

00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:34.523
And as we danced and danced,

00:04:34.523 --> 00:04:37.368
and we approached this circle of women,

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:40.519
men, women, children, everybody was there.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.087
There was a woman sitting in the middle of it,

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:47.625
and this woman was waiting to hold us.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:51.300
I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.294
and as I approached her,

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.013
she looked at me, and I sat down.

00:04:57.013 --> 00:05:00.591
And I sat down, and I opened my legs.

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:04.059
As I opened my leg, another woman came,

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.415
and this woman was carrying a knife.

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:10.999
And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:15.388
and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.

00:05:15.388 --> 00:05:20.651
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled.

00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:25.749
After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:27.872
It's something that so many girls --

00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:31.770
I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:38.181
It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife,

00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:40.982
and it was difficult.

00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:43.719
I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.716
that most women don't do.

00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:49.543
Three days later, after everybody has left the home,

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:51.265
my mom went and brought a nurse.

00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:53.119
We were taken care of.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:57.712
Three weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.

00:05:57.712 --> 00:06:01.183
I was so determined to be a teacher now

00:06:01.183 --> 00:06:05.183
so that I could make a difference in my family.

00:06:05.183 --> 00:06:08.950
Well, while I was in high school, something happened.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.564
I met a young gentleman from our village

00:06:11.564 --> 00:06:13.797
who had been to the University of Oregon.

00:06:13.797 --> 00:06:19.673
This man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera,

00:06:19.673 --> 00:06:22.969
white sneakers -- and I'm talking about white sneakers.

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.896
There is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.

00:06:26.896 --> 00:06:30.359
They were sneakers, and this is in a village

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:34.429
that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive.

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:39.416
I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are,"

00:06:39.416 --> 00:06:43.664
because this man looked very happy, and I admired that.

00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:45.929
And he told me, "Well,

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:47.063
what do you mean, you want to go?

00:06:47.063 --> 00:06:49.383
Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"

00:06:49.383 --> 00:06:52.188
And I told him, "Don't worry about that part.

00:06:52.188 --> 00:06:55.346
Just tell me how to get there."

00:06:55.346 --> 00:06:57.948
This gentleman, he helped me.

00:06:57.948 --> 00:07:00.795
While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:04.063
He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick,

00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:07.383
so he really couldn't tell me what to do next.

00:07:07.383 --> 00:07:11.074
But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.

00:07:11.074 --> 00:07:14.519
Everybody who is my dad's age, male in the community,

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.163
is my father by default --

00:07:16.163 --> 00:07:20.346
my uncles, all of them -- and they dictate what my future is.

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:23.479
So the news came, I applied to school

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.711
and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia,

00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:32.151
and I couldn't come without the support of the village,

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.143
because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.

00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:37.423
I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:40.111
But I needed the support of the village,

00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:43.693
and here again, when the men heard,

00:07:43.693 --> 00:07:47.770
and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.195
they said, "What a lost opportunity.

00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:53.840
This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.167
So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.

00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:00.485
There's a belief among our people

00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:03.855
that morning brings good news.

00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:06.717
So I had to come up with something to do with the morning,

00:08:06.717 --> 00:08:09.119
because there's good news in the morning.

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:13.323
And in the village also, there is one chief, an elder,

00:08:13.323 --> 00:08:16.975
who if he says yes, everybody will follow him.

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:20.630
So I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.391
The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.

00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:26.940
"My child, what are you doing here?"

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.215
"Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?"

00:08:31.215 --> 00:08:33.447
I promised him that I would be the best girl,

00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:36.681
I will come back, anything they wanted after that,

00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:38.840
I will do it for them.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.934
He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."

00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:44.481
He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went --

00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:47.018
16 more men -- every single morning

00:08:47.018 --> 00:08:48.602
I went and visited them.

00:08:48.602 --> 00:08:50.343
They all came together.

00:08:50.343 --> 00:08:53.333
The village, the women, the men, everybody came together

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:56.652
to support me to come to get an education.

00:08:56.652 --> 00:09:01.415
I arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find?

00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:04.624
I found snow!

00:09:04.624 --> 00:09:07.782
I found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners,

00:09:07.782 --> 00:09:10.858
and lots of food in the cafeteria.

00:09:10.858 --> 00:09:13.511
I was in a land of plenty.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:19.276
I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here,

00:09:19.276 --> 00:09:21.908
I discovered a lot of things.

00:09:21.908 --> 00:09:24.949
I learned that that ceremony that I went through

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:30.144
when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.

00:09:30.144 --> 00:09:33.818
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.

00:09:33.818 --> 00:09:37.770
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.848
to get an education. I had a right.

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:45.287
And as we speak right now, three million girls

00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:50.628
in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.

00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:53.803
I learned that my mom had a right to own property.

00:09:53.803 --> 00:09:56.692
I learned that she did not have to be abused

00:09:56.692 --> 00:09:59.135
because she is a woman.

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:02.222
Those things made me angry.

00:10:02.222 --> 00:10:04.123
I wanted to do something.

00:10:04.123 --> 00:10:06.692
As I went back, every time I went,

00:10:06.692 --> 00:10:09.660
I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.734
They were getting mutilated, and here,

00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:15.270
after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N.,

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.793
I went back to school to get my graduate work,

00:10:17.793 --> 00:10:21.903
the constant cry of these girls was in my face.

00:10:21.903 --> 00:10:24.729
I had to do something.

00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:27.649
As I went back, I started talking to the men,

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:29.236
to the village, and mothers, and I said,

00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:31.256
"I want to give back the way I had promised you

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.968
that I would come back and help you. What do you need?"

00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:36.086
As I spoke to the women, they told me,

00:10:36.086 --> 00:10:38.062
"You know what we need? We really need a school for girls."

00:10:38.062 --> 00:10:40.818
Because there had not been any school for girls.

00:10:40.818 --> 00:10:42.631
And the reason they wanted the school for girls

00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:46.257
is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school,

00:10:46.257 --> 00:10:48.465
the mother is blamed for that.

00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:51.877
If she got pregnant before she got married,

00:10:51.877 --> 00:10:54.246
the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.

00:10:54.246 --> 00:10:55.887
She's beaten.

00:10:55.887 --> 00:10:59.622
They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."

00:10:59.622 --> 00:11:02.265
As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers,

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:04.638
the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said:

00:11:04.638 --> 00:11:07.041
"We want a school for boys."

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:10.345
And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village

00:11:10.345 --> 00:11:13.017
who have been out and they have gotten an education.

00:11:13.017 --> 00:11:15.089
Why can't they build a school for boys,

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:17.386
and I'll build a school for girls?"

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:20.661
That made sense. And they agreed.

00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:25.320
And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.112
And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.

00:11:30.112 --> 00:11:31.571
We have.

00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:34.703
I want you to meet one of the girls in that school.

00:11:34.703 --> 00:11:37.343
Angeline came to apply for the school,

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:40.943
and she did not meet any criteria that we had.

00:11:40.943 --> 00:11:43.686
She's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:46.430
But she was older. She was 12 years old,

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.542
and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.337
Angeline had been moving from one place --

00:11:51.337 --> 00:11:53.678
because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father --

00:11:53.678 --> 00:11:56.032
moving from one grandmother's house to another one,

00:11:56.032 --> 00:11:59.666
from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life.

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:02.254
And I looked at her, I remember that day,

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:06.786
and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.

00:12:06.786 --> 00:12:09.682
And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.

00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:12.652
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.

00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:15.879
Five months later, that is Angeline.

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:18.645
A transformation had begun in her life.

00:12:18.645 --> 00:12:21.387
Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world

00:12:21.387 --> 00:12:23.120
and make a difference.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.920
She was not the top student when we took her.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.416
Now she's the best student, not just in our school,

00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:30.565
but in the entire division that we are in.

00:12:30.565 --> 00:12:34.886
That's Sharon. That's five years later.

00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:42.055
That's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.

00:12:42.055 --> 00:12:45.330
As a new dawn is happening in my school,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.589
a new beginning is happening.

00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:52.933
As we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.

00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:57.629
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.

00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:03.597
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.

00:13:03.597 --> 00:13:05.870
This is the thing that we are doing,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.197
giving them opportunities where they can rise.

00:13:09.197 --> 00:13:12.852
As we speak right now, women are not being beaten

00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:16.398
because of the revolutions we've started in our community.

00:13:16.398 --> 00:13:24.078
(Applause)

00:13:24.078 --> 00:13:26.913
I want to challenge you today.

00:13:26.913 --> 00:13:29.817
You are listening to me because you are here,

00:13:29.817 --> 00:13:32.261
very optimistic.

00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:35.775
You are somebody who is so passionate.

00:13:35.775 --> 00:13:39.622
You are somebody who wants to see a better world.

00:13:39.622 --> 00:13:44.128
You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.

00:13:44.128 --> 00:13:46.877
You are somebody who wants to make a difference.

00:13:46.877 --> 00:13:50.443
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.

00:13:50.443 --> 00:13:54.221
I want to challenge you today that to be the first,

00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:56.718
because people will follow you.

00:13:56.718 --> 00:13:58.942
Be the first. People will follow you.

00:13:58.942 --> 00:14:04.225
Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.

00:14:04.225 --> 00:14:07.505
Move out, because as you change your world,

00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:09.944
as you change your community,

00:14:09.944 --> 00:14:14.744
as we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family,

00:14:14.744 --> 00:14:18.064
one village, one country at a time.

00:14:18.064 --> 00:14:20.929
We are making a difference, so if you change your world,

00:14:20.929 --> 00:14:22.978
you are going to change your community,

00:14:22.978 --> 00:14:24.770
you are going to change your country,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.737
and think about that. If you do that, and I do that,

00:14:27.737 --> 00:14:31.337
aren't we going to create a better future for our children,

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.572
for your children, for our grandchildren?

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:37.777
And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much.

00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:54.929
(Applause)
