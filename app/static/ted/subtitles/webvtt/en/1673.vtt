WEBVTT

00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:02.581
Okay, this morning I'm speaking

00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:05.770
on the question of corruption.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.930
And corruption is defined

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.666
as the abuse of a position of trust

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.306
for the benefit of yourself -- or, in the case of our context,

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:19.929
your friends, your family or your financiers.

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.452
Okay? Friends, family and financiers.

00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:28.467
But we need to understand what we understand about corruption,

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:31.265
and we need to understand that

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:34.614
we have been miseducated about it, and we have to admit that.

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:36.171
We have to have the courage to admit that

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:38.616
to start changing how we deal with it.

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:41.539
The first thing is that the big myth, number one,

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.910
is that in fact it's not really a crime.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.700
When we get together with friends and family

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.579
and we discuss crime in our country,

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.172
crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella,

00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:52.702
nobody's speaking about corruption.

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:54.252
That's the honest truth.

00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:57.289
When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime,

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.299
he isn't speaking about corruption.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.615
And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:05.490
is speaking about crime, he's not talking about corruption either.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.105
The point I'm making is that it is a crime.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:12.955
It is an economic crime, because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money.

00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:15.723
Public and private corruption is a reality.

00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:17.454
As somebody who comes from the private sector,

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:19.850
I can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.629
in the private sector that has nothing to do with government.

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:25.471
The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table,

00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:27.939
it all takes place in the private sector.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.540
Today, I'm focusing on public sector corruption,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.675
which the private sector also participates in.

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:36.971
The second important myth to understand --

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.705
because we have to destroy these myths,

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:41.165
dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them --

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.111
the second important myth to understand

00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.603
is the one that says

00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:48.872
that in fact corruption is only a small problem --

00:01:48.872 --> 00:01:51.202
if it is a problem, it's only a small problem,

00:01:51.202 --> 00:01:54.896
that in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent,

00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:58.787
it's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever,

00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:02.571
and there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.

00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:04.931
And I want to demonstrate that that, too,

00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:06.868
is a dangerous myth, very dangerous.

00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:09.289
It's a piece of public mischief.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.883
And I want to speak a little bit,

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:14.131
take us back about 30 years.

00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:16.125
We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago,

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.323
a resource-rich, small Caribbean country,

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:24.369
and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth,

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.862
and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices.

00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:30.897
We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.

00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:34.585
And it's ironic, because

00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:36.623
we're standing today in the Central Bank.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.819
You see, history's rich in irony.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.641
We're standing today in the Central Bank,

00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:44.019
and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.344
Okay? We're talking about irresponsibility in public office.

00:02:47.344 --> 00:02:50.092
We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace,

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:52.131
the next tower is the Ministry of Finance,

00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:53.819
and there's a lot of connection with us today,

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.669
so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay?

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:01.569
(Applause)

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.811
The first thing I want to talk about is that

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:07.507
when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago,

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:09.594
we embarked, the government of the day embarked

00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:11.704
on a series of government-to-government arrangements

00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:13.738
to have rapidly develop the country.

00:03:13.738 --> 00:03:16.004
And some of the largest projects in the country

00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:19.202
were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements

00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:21.018
with some of the leading countries in the world,

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:23.726
the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on.

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:26.794
As I said, even this building we're standing in -- that's one of the ironies --

00:03:26.794 --> 00:03:28.478
this building was part of that series of complexes,

00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:32.586
what they called the Twin Towers.

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:35.546
It became so outrageous, the whole situation,

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:38.426
that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed,

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:42.429
and it reported in 1982, 30 years ago it reported --

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.178
the Ballah Report -- 30 years ago,

00:03:45.178 --> 00:03:49.114
and immediately the government-to-government arrangements were stopped.

00:03:49.114 --> 00:03:51.022
The then-Prime Minister went to Parliament

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.219
to give a budget speech, and he said some things that I'll never forget.

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.516
They went right in here. I was a young man at the time.

00:03:56.516 --> 00:03:57.896
It went right into my heart.

00:03:57.896 --> 00:04:02.653
And he said that, in fact — Let me see if this thing works.

00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:05.130
Are we getting a, yeah?—

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.129
That's what he told us.

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.269
He told us that, in fact,

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.191
two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:16.575
that we spent, the taxpayers' money,

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:18.659
was wasted or stolen.

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:22.702
So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief.

00:04:22.702 --> 00:04:24.811
As we say, it's a nancy-story. Forget it.

00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:26.506
That's for little children. We are big people,

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:29.293
and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society.

00:04:29.293 --> 00:04:31.438
Okay? This is the size of the problem.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.450
Okay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.892
That was 30 years ago. 1982 was Ballah.

00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:39.951
So what has changed?

00:04:39.951 --> 00:04:41.638
I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets

00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:44.197
to an international audience, but I have to.

00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:47.710
Four months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.608
We call it the Section 34 fiasco, the Section 34 fiasco,

00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:55.254
a suspicious piece of law, and I'm going to say it like it is,

00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:56.609
a suspicious piece of law

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:58.752
was passed at a suspicious time

00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:00.650
to free some suspects. (Laughter)

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.383
And it was called, those people are called

00:05:07.383 --> 00:05:08.957
the Piarco Airport accused.

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:11.834
I'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today.

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:13.661
They are the Piarco Airport accused.

00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.554
It was a constitutional outrage of the first order,

00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:20.610
and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.709
Our highest institution in our country was perverted.

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:25.682
We are dealing with perverts here

00:05:25.682 --> 00:05:27.404
of an economic and financial nature.

00:05:27.404 --> 00:05:29.253
Do you get how serious this problem is?

00:05:29.253 --> 00:05:31.363
There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:34.073
took part in the protest in different forms.

00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:36.892
Most importantly, the American embassy complained,

00:05:36.892 --> 00:05:39.379
so Parliament was swiftly reconvened,

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.284
and the law was reversed, it was repealed.

00:05:41.284 --> 00:05:43.231
That's the word lawyers use. It was repealed.

00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:46.348
But the point is

00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:50.043
that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events,

00:05:50.043 --> 00:05:52.529
because what really happened is that,

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.603
because of the suspicious passage of that law,

00:05:55.603 --> 00:05:57.924
the law was actually passed into effect

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:01.182
on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence,

00:06:01.182 --> 00:06:02.742
our jubilee of independence.

00:06:02.742 --> 00:06:04.764
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:08.175
It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it,

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:09.862
because we all understood it,

00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:11.620
and for the first time that I could remember,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.170
there were mass protests against this corruption.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.361
And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay?

00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:19.224
Those of us who are, sometimes you feel like

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:22.593
you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work.

00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:26.041
That passage of the law and the repeal of the law

00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:30.017
fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused.

00:06:30.017 --> 00:06:34.628
So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place.

00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:36.524
But what were they accused of?

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:37.627
What was it that they were accused of?

00:06:37.627 --> 00:06:40.906
I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of?

00:06:40.906 --> 00:06:43.488
We were trying to build, or reconstruct largely,

00:06:43.488 --> 00:06:46.090
an airport that had grown outdated.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.880
The entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.447
Trinidad and Tobago dollars,

00:06:52.447 --> 00:06:55.610
and in fact, we had a lot of bid-rigging

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.797
and suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place.

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:02.887
And to get an idea of what it consisted of,

00:07:02.887 --> 00:07:05.767
and to put it in context in relationship to this whole

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:08.200
second myth about it being no big thing,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.971
we can look at this second slide here.

00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.664
And what we have here -- I am not saying so,

00:07:14.664 --> 00:07:19.471
this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so.

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:23.945
And he's telling us that for the $1.6 billion cost of the project,

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:26.137
one billion dollars has been traced

00:07:26.137 --> 00:07:27.900
to offshore bank accounts.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.063
One billion dollars of our taxpayers' money

00:07:30.063 --> 00:07:33.461
has been located in offshore bank accounts.

00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:35.574
Being the kind of suspicious person I am,

00:07:35.574 --> 00:07:38.291
I am outraged at that, and I'm going to pause here,

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.787
I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things.

00:07:40.787 --> 00:07:42.601
I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw

00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:46.345
in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park.

00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:50.537
It was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark.

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:52.470
And I was walking around with the protesters

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.763
looking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around.

00:07:56.763 --> 00:07:59.083
And there was a lady with a sign, a very simple sign,

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:01.507
a kind of battered-looking blonde lady,

00:08:01.507 --> 00:08:04.330
and the sign was made out of Bristol board, as we say in these parts,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.322
and it was made with a marker.

00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:08.843
And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center.

00:08:08.843 --> 00:08:13.250
It said, "If you're not outraged, you haven't been paying attention."

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.232
If you're not outraged by all of this, you haven't been paying attention.

00:08:16.232 --> 00:08:20.363
So listen up, because we're getting into even deeper waters.

00:08:20.363 --> 00:08:22.520
My brain started thinking.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.411
Well, what if --

00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:28.617
because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff.

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:30.295
What if -- (Laughter)

00:08:30.295 --> 00:08:32.819
But to make it in these wrongs,

00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:34.444
you have to read a lot of spy novels

00:08:34.444 --> 00:08:37.011
and follow some of that stuff, right? (Laughter)

00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:41.578
But what if this wasn't the first time?

00:08:41.578 --> 00:08:44.165
What if this is just the first time

00:08:44.165 --> 00:08:46.500
that the so-and-sos had been caught?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.626
What if it had happened before? How would I find out?

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:54.116
Now, the previous two examples I gave

00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:58.172
were to do with construction sector corruption, okay?

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:00.203
And I have the privilege at this time

00:09:00.203 --> 00:09:03.581
to lead the Joint Consultative Council, which is a not-for-profit.

00:09:03.581 --> 00:09:07.178
We're at jcc.org.tt, and we have the -- we are the leaders

00:09:07.178 --> 00:09:10.404
in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system

00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:12.564
about how public money is transacted.

00:09:12.564 --> 00:09:14.769
So those of you interested in finding out more about it,

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:19.049
or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions, please get involved.

00:09:19.049 --> 00:09:21.308
But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates,

00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:24.084
because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting

00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:26.420
for over three and a half years

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.909
is for transparency and accountability

00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:32.008
around the bailout of CL Financial.

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:37.009
CL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate, okay?

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:39.932
And without getting into all of the details,

00:09:39.932 --> 00:09:42.948
it is said to have collapsed — I'm using my words very carefully —

00:09:42.948 --> 00:09:45.775
it's said to have collapsed in January of '09,

00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:49.453
which is just coming up to nearly four years.

00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:52.265
In an unprecedented fit of generosity --

00:09:52.265 --> 00:09:54.748
and you have to be very suspicious about these people --

00:09:54.748 --> 00:09:57.379
in an unprecedented — and I'm using that word carefully —

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:01.263
unprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day

00:10:01.263 --> 00:10:04.918
signed, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors.

00:10:04.918 --> 00:10:07.240
And I can tell you without fear of contradiction

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.422
that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet.

00:10:10.422 --> 00:10:12.333
Let's understand, because we lack context.

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:15.338
People are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street.

00:10:15.338 --> 00:10:19.827
Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something.

00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:24.571
It's not just like anywhere. (Applause)

00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:29.725
It's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere.

00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:32.556
Here is here, and out there is out there. Okay?

00:10:32.556 --> 00:10:33.886
I'm serious now.

00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:36.869
Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.820
They've had bailouts in London.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.957
They've had bailouts in Europe.

00:10:40.957 --> 00:10:43.627
In Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major

00:10:43.627 --> 00:10:46.192
commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh?

00:10:46.192 --> 00:10:48.433
It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has --

00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:50.823
how they've treated it, and they've treated it

00:10:50.823 --> 00:10:52.694
very well compared to us.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.626
Nowhere on the planet

00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:57.332
have all the creditors been bailed out

00:10:57.332 --> 00:10:59.624
in excess of what their statutory entitlements were.

00:10:59.624 --> 00:11:03.206
Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity?

00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:06.011
Is our government that generous? And maybe they are.

00:11:06.011 --> 00:11:08.027
Let's look at it. Let's look into it.

00:11:08.027 --> 00:11:10.795
So I started digging and writing and so and so on,

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.607
and that work can be found, my personal work

00:11:12.607 --> 00:11:15.987
can be found at AfraRaymond.com, which is my name.

00:11:15.987 --> 00:11:18.859
It's a not-for-profit blog that I run.

00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:21.383
Not as popular as some of the other people, but there you go.

00:11:21.383 --> 00:11:23.641
(Laughter)

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:28.130
But the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.587
that plot to pervert Parliament, that bitter experience

00:11:30.587 --> 00:11:33.673
that took place in August,

00:11:33.673 --> 00:11:36.571
when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence,

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.235
going into September, forced me to check myself

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:43.294
and recalculate my bearings,

00:11:43.294 --> 00:11:45.516
and to go back into some of the work, some of the stuff I'd written

00:11:45.516 --> 00:11:47.785
and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials

00:11:47.785 --> 00:11:49.789
to see what was really what.

00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:53.899
As we say in Trinidad and Tobago, who is who and what is what?

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:55.723
Okay? We want to try to recalculate.

00:11:55.723 --> 00:11:58.147
And I made a Freedom of Information application

00:11:58.147 --> 00:12:02.061
in May this year to the Ministry of Finance.

00:12:02.061 --> 00:12:04.119
The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over.

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:05.794
This is the other context.

00:12:05.794 --> 00:12:07.870
The Ministry of Finance, we are told,

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.699
is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:15.003
I'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so.

00:12:15.003 --> 00:12:17.891
The Central Bank in which we stand this morning

00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:22.088
is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

00:12:22.088 --> 00:12:23.767
So in fact, you can't ask them anything,

00:12:23.767 --> 00:12:25.460
and they don't have to answer anything.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.282
That is the law since 1999.

00:12:28.282 --> 00:12:31.858
So I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions.

00:12:31.858 --> 00:12:35.547
And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply,

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:38.162
so you could understand, as I said, where we are.

00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:39.683
Here is not like anywhere else.

00:12:39.683 --> 00:12:42.661
Question number one:

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:45.251
I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial,

00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:47.723
and if you can't show me the accounts --

00:12:47.723 --> 00:12:49.688
the Minister of Finance is making statements,

00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:52.303
passing new laws and giving speeches and so on.

00:12:52.303 --> 00:12:54.594
What are the figures he's relying on?

00:12:54.594 --> 00:12:57.214
It's like that joke: I want whatever he's drinking.

00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:58.813
And they wrote back and said to me,

00:12:58.813 --> 00:13:00.524
well what do you really mean?

00:13:00.524 --> 00:13:02.915
So they hit my question with a question.

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:06.036
Second point: I want to see

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:09.735
who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid?

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:11.739
Let me pause here to point out to you all

00:13:11.739 --> 00:13:15.420
that 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.819
That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars

00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:21.315
coming out of a small -- we used to be resource-rich --

00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:23.687
Caribbean country. Okay?

00:13:23.687 --> 00:13:25.235
And I asked the question,

00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:29.381
who was getting that three and a half billion dollars?

00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:31.638
And I want to pause again to bring up context,

00:13:31.638 --> 00:13:35.041
because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing.

00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:37.611
There's a particular individual who is in the government now.

00:13:37.611 --> 00:13:39.331
The name of the person doesn't matter.

00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:41.883
And that person made a career

00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:44.244
out of using the Freedom of Information Act

00:13:44.244 --> 00:13:46.363
to advance his political cause.

00:13:46.363 --> 00:13:49.606
Okay? His name isn't important.

00:13:49.606 --> 00:13:51.939
I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point.

00:13:51.939 --> 00:13:54.359
The point is, that person made a career out of using

00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:57.323
the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause.

00:13:57.323 --> 00:13:59.637
And the most famous case

00:13:59.637 --> 00:14:02.530
was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal,

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.419
where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:08.291
that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships,

00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:11.015
and the scholarships hadn't been advertised, and so and so on and so on.

00:14:11.015 --> 00:14:14.006
And he was able to get the court, using that act of Parliament,

00:14:14.006 --> 00:14:15.639
Freedom of Information Act,

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:17.616
to release the information,

00:14:17.616 --> 00:14:20.981
and I thought that was excellent.

00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:24.147
Fantastic.

00:14:24.147 --> 00:14:26.097
But you see, the question is this:

00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:30.310
If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.040
and to use the court

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.782
to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money,

00:14:38.782 --> 00:14:40.473
it must be right and proper

00:14:40.473 --> 00:14:44.614
for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars.

00:14:44.614 --> 00:14:47.202
You see? But the Ministry of Finance,

00:14:47.202 --> 00:14:48.804
the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance,

00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:51.861
wrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too.

00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:54.850
You see? This is what we're dealing with, okay?

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.984
The third thing I will tell you

00:14:56.984 --> 00:14:59.989
is that I also asked

00:14:59.989 --> 00:15:02.985
for the directors of CL Financial,

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:07.330
whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.948
We have an Integrity in Public Life Act

00:15:08.948 --> 00:15:13.697
as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest.

00:15:13.697 --> 00:15:15.985
And public officials are supposed to file

00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:22.450
to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.865
And of course I've since discovered that they're not filing,

00:15:24.865 --> 00:15:27.744
and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file.

00:15:27.744 --> 00:15:32.661
So here we have it. We have a situation where

00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:37.555
the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability

00:15:37.555 --> 00:15:39.548
and transparency have all been discarded.

00:15:39.548 --> 00:15:41.792
I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion.

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:44.280
It's been ignored.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.455
The sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34,

00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:50.057
we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it.

00:15:50.057 --> 00:15:53.655
I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history.

00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:56.236
It's also the single largest example

00:15:56.236 --> 00:16:01.248
of public corruption according to this equation.

00:16:01.248 --> 00:16:04.217
And this is my reality check.

00:16:04.217 --> 00:16:06.563
Where you have an expenditure of public money

00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:09.518
and it is without accountability

00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:11.158
and it's without transparency,

00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:13.414
it will always be equal to corruption,

00:16:13.414 --> 00:16:16.619
whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska,

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:20.819
it will always be equal to corruption, and that is what we are dealing with here.

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:23.130
I'm going to continue the work

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.476
to press on, to get some resolution

00:16:27.476 --> 00:16:29.186
of those matters at the Ministry of Finance.

00:16:29.186 --> 00:16:31.738
If it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.

00:16:31.738 --> 00:16:32.926
We will continue to press on.

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:34.877
We will continue to work within JCC.

00:16:34.877 --> 00:16:37.578
But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context

00:16:37.578 --> 00:16:39.497
and bring something new to the table

00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:41.323
in terms of an international example.

00:16:41.323 --> 00:16:44.224
We had the journalist [Heather] Brooke speaking

00:16:44.224 --> 00:16:46.541
about her battle against government corruption,

00:16:46.541 --> 00:16:51.978
and she introduced me to this website, Alaveteli.com.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:56.648
And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:59.427
for Freedom of Information applications,

00:16:59.427 --> 00:17:01.543
and speak with each other.

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:03.780
I could see what you're applying for.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.312
You could see what I applied for and what replies I got.

00:17:07.312 --> 00:17:10.248
We can work on it together. We need to build a collective database

00:17:10.248 --> 00:17:13.552
and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point.

00:17:13.552 --> 00:17:15.192
We need to increase the consciousness.

00:17:15.192 --> 00:17:19.246
The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one,

00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:21.024
which is a lovely website from India

00:17:21.024 --> 00:17:23.466
called IPaidABribe.com.

00:17:23.466 --> 00:17:25.252
They have international branches,

00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:27.696
and it's important for us to tune into this one.

00:17:27.696 --> 00:17:30.152
IPaidABribe.com is really important,

00:17:30.152 --> 00:17:32.568
a good one to log on to and see.

00:17:32.568 --> 00:17:35.195
I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage.

00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:37.416
Discard the first myth; it is a crime.

00:17:37.416 --> 00:17:39.734
Discard the second myth; it is a big thing.

00:17:39.734 --> 00:17:42.232
It's a huge problem. It's an economic crime.

00:17:42.232 --> 00:17:44.280
And let us continue working together

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.747
to betterment in this situation,

00:17:45.747 --> 00:17:49.557
stability and sustainability in our society. Thank you.
