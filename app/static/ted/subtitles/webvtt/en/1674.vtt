00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:04.077
I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.

00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:08.539
Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures,

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.842
creatures from a far-distant world.

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:13.629
But basically, I figured out that I could find

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.606
those alien creatures right on Earth.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:19.259
And what I do is I study insects.

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.515
I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.656
I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:28.398
one of the most important events in the history of life.

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:30.635
Without insects, there'd be no flowering plants.

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:32.551
Without flowering plants, there would be no

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.688
clever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks.

00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:37.988
(Laughter)

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:39.975
Now,

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:43.014
David and Hidehiko and Ketaki

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:46.459
gave a very compelling story about

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.264
the similarities between fruit flies and humans,

00:00:49.264 --> 00:00:50.753
and there are many similarities,

00:00:50.753 --> 00:00:53.755
and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies,

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:57.552
the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example --

00:00:57.552 --> 00:00:59.834
(Laughter)

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:03.025
but in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:06.092
between humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences,

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:11.379
and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing.

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:14.235
And so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence

00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:18.170
of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.380
and to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.815
that is going to go at the fly.

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:25.653
The fly is going to sense this predator.

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:28.108
It is going to extend its legs out.

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:29.721
It's going to sashay away

00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:32.286
to live to fly another day.

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:34.648
Now I have carefully cropped this sequence

00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:37.808
to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink,

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:40.642
so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye,

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.907
the fly has seen this looming predator,

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:50.075
estimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away,

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:54.539
beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.512
I think this is a fascinating behavior

00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:00.433
that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information.

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:03.275
Now, flight -- what does it take to fly?

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:06.139
Well, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft,

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.874
you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces,

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:12.420
you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.129
and you need a controller,

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.755
and in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically

00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:21.067
the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit.

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:23.820
Now, how does this compare to a fly?

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.071
Well, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out

00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:31.407
how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.

00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:33.017
And you might have heard how engineers proved

00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:35.651
that bumblebees couldn't fly.

00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:38.271
Well, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:41.390
function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.244
And we tackle this problem by building giant,

00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:47.676
dynamically scaled model robot insects

00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:51.012
that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:53.286
where we could study the aerodynamic forces.

00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:55.444
And it turns out that the insects flap their wings

00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:58.036
in a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack

00:02:58.036 --> 00:03:01.157
that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing,

00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:04.356
a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex,

00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:07.310
and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.669
to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.097
But the thing that's actually most -- so, what's fascinating

00:03:13.097 --> 00:03:16.072
is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology.

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:19.717
What's clever is the way the fly flaps it,

00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:22.853
which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system,

00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:25.500
and this is what enables flies to perform

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.307
these remarkable aerial maneuvers.

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.404
Now, what about the engine?

00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:32.896
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.

00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:34.794
They have two types of flight muscle:

00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:37.779
so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated,

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:41.505
which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled

00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:44.844
on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.

00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:49.453
It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight,

00:03:49.453 --> 00:03:51.532
and it fills the middle portion of the fly,

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.079
so when a fly hits your windshield,

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.485
it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.631
But attached to the base of the wing

00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:00.269
is a set of little, tiny control muscles

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.570
that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast,

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.776
and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:08.538
on a stroke-by-stroke basis,

00:04:08.538 --> 00:04:11.680
and this is what enables the fly to change its wing

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.651
and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces

00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:17.224
which change its flight trajectory.

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:20.787
And of course, the role of the nervous system is to control all this.

00:04:20.787 --> 00:04:22.299
So let's look at the controller.

00:04:22.299 --> 00:04:24.946
Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:27.230
that they carry to this problem.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.357
They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection.

00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:33.032
They have a sophisticated eye which is

00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:35.488
the fastest visual system on the planet.

00:04:35.488 --> 00:04:37.524
They have another set of eyes on the top of their head.

00:04:37.524 --> 00:04:39.576
We have no idea what they do.

00:04:39.576 --> 00:04:42.530
They have sensors on their wing.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.290
Their wing is covered with sensors, including sensors

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.336
that sense deformation of the wing.

00:04:48.336 --> 00:04:50.445
They can even taste with their wings.

00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:53.000
One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.807
is a structure called the halteres.

00:04:54.807 --> 00:04:56.686
The halteres are actually gyroscopes.

00:04:56.686 --> 00:05:01.135
These devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight,

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.808
and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation

00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:07.776
and initiate very, very fast corrective maneuvers.

00:05:07.776 --> 00:05:10.105
But all of this sensory information has to be processed

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:13.825
by a brain, and yes, indeed, flies have a brain,

00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:16.984
a brain of about 100,000 neurons.

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.177
Now several people at this conference

00:05:19.177 --> 00:05:23.985
have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience

00:05:23.985 --> 00:05:27.232
because they're a simple model of brain function.

00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:29.309
And the basic punchline of my talk is,

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.967
I'd like to turn that over on its head.

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:34.595
I don't think they're a simple model of anything.

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:37.072
And I think that flies are a great model.

00:05:37.072 --> 00:05:39.588
They're a great model for flies.

00:05:39.588 --> 00:05:42.069
(Laughter)

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:45.072
And let's explore this notion of simplicity.

00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:47.503
So I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists,

00:05:47.503 --> 00:05:49.335
we're all somewhat narcissistic.

00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:52.768
When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain.

00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:54.728
But remember that this kind of brain,

00:05:54.728 --> 00:05:56.496
which is much, much smaller

00:05:56.496 --> 00:05:59.174
— instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons —

00:05:59.174 --> 00:06:02.056
but this is the most common form of brain on the planet

00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:04.960
and has been for 400 million years.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.248
And is it fair to say that it's simple?

00:06:07.248 --> 00:06:09.343
Well, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons,

00:06:09.343 --> 00:06:11.097
but is that a fair metric?

00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:13.373
And I would propose it's not a fair metric.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.473
So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare --

00:06:16.473 --> 00:06:18.032
(Laughter) —

00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:23.153
we have to compare the size of the brain

00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:25.183
with what the brain can do.

00:06:25.183 --> 00:06:28.064
So I propose we have a Trump number,

00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:30.929
and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:34.608
behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain.

00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:37.276
We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:39.960
Now, how many people here think the Trump number

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.449
is higher for the fruit fly?

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.880
(Applause)

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.308
It's a very smart, smart audience.

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:51.635
Yes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it.

00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:54.017
Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd

00:06:54.017 --> 00:06:57.575
to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.

00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:01.718
But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse.

00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:06.023
A mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly.

00:07:06.023 --> 00:07:08.050
I used to study mice. When I studied mice,

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.887
I used to talk really slowly.

00:07:10.887 --> 00:07:13.463
And then something happened when I started to work on flies.

00:07:13.463 --> 00:07:15.875
(Laughter)

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:19.335
And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice,

00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:22.648
it's really comparable. They have to forage for food.

00:07:22.648 --> 00:07:25.095
They have to engage in courtship.

00:07:25.095 --> 00:07:28.566
They have sex. They hide from predators.

00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:30.546
They do a lot of the similar things.

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:32.264
But I would argue that flies do more.

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:35.642
So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence,

00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:39.847
and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military,

00:07:39.847 --> 00:07:41.919
so I'm showing this classified sequence

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:46.012
and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?

00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:47.920
So I want you to look at the payload

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.946
at the tail of the fruit fly.

00:07:50.946 --> 00:07:53.047
Watch it very closely,

00:07:53.047 --> 00:07:57.344
and you'll see why my six-year-old son

00:07:57.344 --> 00:08:02.073
now wants to be a neuroscientist.

00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:03.252
Wait for it.

00:08:03.252 --> 00:08:04.821
Pshhew.

00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:07.905
So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice,

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:12.821
they're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter)

00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:16.788
Now, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:19.386
but also the challenge for a fly to compute

00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:22.235
everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:25.223
So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse

00:08:25.223 --> 00:08:27.991
that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab,

00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:31.238
and you can see the wonderful images of brains

00:08:31.238 --> 00:08:34.431
that he showed in his talk.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.799
But up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.911
at the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly.

00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:42.752
And I'll expand this up.

00:08:42.752 --> 00:08:44.922
And it's a beautifully complex neuron.

00:08:44.922 --> 00:08:48.407
It's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges

00:08:48.407 --> 00:08:52.030
with trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.567
How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:57.779
It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes,

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:00.578
it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history,

00:09:00.578 --> 00:09:03.674
it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars

00:09:03.674 --> 00:09:05.056
to parasatize,

00:09:05.056 --> 00:09:09.171
but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain,

00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:11.140
which is comparable for a fruit fly,

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.066
it is the size of a salt grain.

00:09:14.066 --> 00:09:17.701
So here's some other organisms at the similar scale.

00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:21.831
This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba,

00:09:21.831 --> 00:09:25.711
and it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small --

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:28.167
you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about,

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:29.818
where the nucleus of the neuron is?

00:09:29.818 --> 00:09:33.278
This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.

00:09:33.278 --> 00:09:35.751
So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:41.111
I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works.

00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:46.744
But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot?

00:09:46.744 --> 00:09:49.266
And I think, from an engineering perspective,

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:50.995
you think of multiplexing.

00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:53.698
You can take a hardware and have that hardware

00:09:53.698 --> 00:09:55.311
do different things at different times,

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:58.306
or have different parts of the hardware doing different things.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:01.577
And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.

00:10:01.577 --> 00:10:03.235
And they're not concepts that I've come up with,

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:07.780
but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.855
And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs.

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:12.722
And I don't mean chewing the crabs.

00:10:12.722 --> 00:10:16.321
I grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well.

00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:19.178
But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.

00:10:19.178 --> 00:10:21.208
Crab chewing is actually really fascinating.

00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:24.467
Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace

00:10:24.467 --> 00:10:25.777
called the gastric mill

00:10:25.777 --> 00:10:28.207
that grinds their food in a variety of different ways.

00:10:28.207 --> 00:10:33.466
And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.026
The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled

00:10:36.026 --> 00:10:39.458
by a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons

00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:44.421
that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns,

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:48.768
and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion

00:10:48.768 --> 00:10:52.952
in the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:55.093
You heard about neuromodulators earlier.

00:10:55.093 --> 00:10:57.318
There are more neuromodulators

00:10:57.318 --> 00:11:02.803
that alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure,

00:11:02.803 --> 00:11:07.045
and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns.

00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:10.486
And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues

00:11:10.486 --> 00:11:12.781
who've been studying this fascinating system

00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:14.933
that show how a smaller cluster of neurons

00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:16.758
can do many, many, many things

00:11:16.758 --> 00:11:21.614
because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:24.053
So this is basically multiplexing in time.

00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:26.838
Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator.

00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:30.316
You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior,

00:11:30.316 --> 00:11:32.934
another neuromodulator, another set of cells,

00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:34.647
a different pattern, and you can imagine

00:11:34.647 --> 00:11:38.525
you could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system.

00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:40.619
Is there any evidence that flies do this?

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:43.994
Well, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world,

00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:46.642
we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.

00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:48.348
You can tether a fly to a little stick.

00:11:48.348 --> 00:11:50.849
You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.

00:11:50.849 --> 00:11:53.395
You can let the fly play a little video game

00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:57.273
by letting it fly around in a visual display.

00:11:57.273 --> 00:11:59.610
So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.837
Here's a fly

00:12:00.837 --> 00:12:04.274
and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator,

00:12:04.274 --> 00:12:06.229
and this is a game the flies love to play.

00:12:06.229 --> 00:12:08.666
You allow them to steer towards the little stripe,

00:12:08.666 --> 00:12:11.491
and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever.

00:12:11.491 --> 00:12:15.049
It's part of their visual guidance system.

00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:17.394
But very, very recently, it's been possible

00:12:17.394 --> 00:12:22.334
to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.

00:12:22.334 --> 00:12:24.822
So this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs,

00:12:24.822 --> 00:12:27.265
Gaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed,

00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:28.951
and it's basically a flight simulator

00:12:28.951 --> 00:12:32.026
but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode

00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:34.290
in the brain of the fly and record

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.946
from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain.

00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:40.244
And this is what one of these experiments looks like.

00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:43.215
It was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab,

00:12:43.215 --> 00:12:44.414
Bettina Schnell.

00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:47.806
The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential

00:12:47.806 --> 00:12:49.836
of a neuron in the fly's brain,

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:52.778
and you'll see the fly start to fly, and the fly is actually

00:12:52.778 --> 00:12:56.057
controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself

00:12:56.057 --> 00:12:57.536
by its own wing motion,

00:12:57.536 --> 00:12:59.646
and you can see this visual interneuron

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:03.554
respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies.

00:13:03.554 --> 00:13:05.930
So for the first time we've actually been able to record

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.838
from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly

00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:13.306
is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight.

00:13:13.306 --> 00:13:15.161
And one of the lessons we've been learning

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.581
is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying

00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:20.002
for many years in quiescent flies

00:13:20.002 --> 00:13:22.650
is not the same as the physiology of those cells

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.386
when the flies actually engage in active behaviors

00:13:25.386 --> 00:13:27.925
like flying and walking and so forth.

00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:30.850
And why is the physiology different?

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.907
Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators,

00:13:32.907 --> 00:13:36.858
just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.408
So here's a picture of the octopamine system.

00:13:39.408 --> 00:13:41.162
Octopamine is a neuromodulator

00:13:41.162 --> 00:13:45.498
that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.

00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:47.970
But this is just one of many neuromodulators

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.041
that's in the fly's brain.

00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:51.707
So I really think that, as we learn more,

00:13:51.707 --> 00:13:54.234
it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:57.323
is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion,

00:13:57.323 --> 00:14:01.683
and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons.

00:14:01.683 --> 00:14:04.470
Now, another idea, another way of multiplexing

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.126
is multiplexing in space,

00:14:06.126 --> 00:14:07.820
having different parts of a neuron

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.942
do different things at the same time.

00:14:09.942 --> 00:14:11.775
So here's two sort of canonical neurons

00:14:11.775 --> 00:14:14.060
from a vertebrate and an invertebrate,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.310
a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal,

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.313
and another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron,

00:14:21.313 --> 00:14:25.460
and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago,

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.535
and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:31.417
based on the fact that this neuron from a locust

00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:33.376
does not fire action potentials.

00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:35.124
It's a non-spiking cell.

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:37.904
So a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain,

00:14:37.904 --> 00:14:40.656
has a region called the dendrites that receives input,

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:43.245
and that input sums together

00:14:43.245 --> 00:14:45.541
and will produce action potentials

00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:47.872
that run down the axon and then activate

00:14:47.872 --> 00:14:50.168
all the output regions of the neuron.

00:14:50.168 --> 00:14:53.044
But non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated

00:14:53.044 --> 00:14:56.156
because they can have input synapses and output synapses

00:14:56.156 --> 00:14:59.819
all interdigitated, and there's no single action potential

00:14:59.819 --> 00:15:02.945
that drives all the outputs at the same time.

00:15:02.945 --> 00:15:06.852
So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments

00:15:06.852 --> 00:15:10.830
that allow the different parts of the neuron

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.390
to do different things at the same time.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:18.061
So these basic concepts of multitasking in time

00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:20.422
and multitasking in space,

00:15:20.422 --> 00:15:23.254
I think these are things that are true in our brains as well,

00:15:23.254 --> 00:15:25.831
but I think the insects are the true masters of this.

00:15:25.831 --> 00:15:28.947
So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time,

00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:31.882
and as I say up here, please think before you swat.

00:15:31.882 --> 00:15:34.835
(Applause)
