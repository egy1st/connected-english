00:00:00.732 --> 00:00:03.619
So here's the good news about families.

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:05.868
The last 50 years have seen a revolution

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:07.924
in what it means to be a family.

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.219
We have blended families, adopted families,

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.524
we have nuclear families living in separate houses

00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:15.403
and divorced families living in the same house.

00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:18.462
But through it all, the family has grown stronger.

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:21.011
Eight in 10 say the family they have today

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.548
is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:27.532
Now, here's the bad news.

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:29.930
Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.241
by the chaos of family life.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.299
Every parent I know, myself included,

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:36.895
feels like we're constantly playing defense.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:39.948
Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.

00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:41.988
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath,

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:45.188
they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:47.878
And here's the worst news of all.

00:00:47.878 --> 00:00:50.804
Our children sense we're out of control.

00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:53.869
Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.148
asked 1,000 children, "If you were granted

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:59.581
one wish about your parents, what would it be?"

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:01.899
The parents predicted the kids would say,

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.765
spending more time with them.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.610
They were wrong. The kids' number one wish?

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.956
That their parents be less tired and less stressed.

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:14.057
So how can we change this dynamic?

00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:17.275
Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress,

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:19.141
draw our family closer,

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:23.997
and generally prepare our children to enter the world?

00:01:23.997 --> 00:01:27.193
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question,

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:30.218
traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars,

00:01:30.218 --> 00:01:33.276
experts ranging from elite peace negotiators

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:37.323
to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:40.689
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.675
and what can I learn from them to make my family happier?

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:47.540
I want to tell you about one family that I met,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.164
and why I think they offer clues.

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:53.151
At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho,

00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:55.459
where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.697
to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.

00:01:58.697 --> 00:02:00.922
The Starrs are a regular American family

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:03.673
with their share of regular American family problems.

00:02:03.673 --> 00:02:06.465
David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:09.257
of their four children, ages 10 to 15.

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:12.281
One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.

00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.786
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:18.297
One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:21.625
"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:24.969
What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.737
Instead of turning to friends or relatives,

00:02:27.737 --> 00:02:30.449
they looked to David's workplace.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.227
They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development

00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:36.297
that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan

00:02:36.297 --> 00:02:39.273
to startups in Silicon Valley.

00:02:39.273 --> 00:02:42.141
In agile, workers are organized into small groups

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:44.827
and do things in very short spans of time.

00:02:44.827 --> 00:02:47.769
So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations,

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.969
the team in effect manages itself.

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.600
You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.217
You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.

00:02:57.217 --> 00:03:00.417
David said when they brought this system into their home,

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:03.833
the family meetings in particular increased communication,

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:06.209
decreased stress, and made everybody

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.313
happier to be part of the family team.

00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:12.296
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:15.809
into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters,

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.873
it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.

00:03:19.873 --> 00:03:22.062
And these meetings had this effect

00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:24.561
while taking under 20 minutes.

00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:26.713
So what is Agile, and why can it help

00:03:26.713 --> 00:03:29.441
with something that seems so different, like families?

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.790
In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.107
at a financial firm in New England.

00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:37.125
He was very frustrated with how software got designed.

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.877
Companies followed the waterfall method, right,

00:03:39.877 --> 00:03:42.935
in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down

00:03:42.935 --> 00:03:44.554
to programmers below,

00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:47.202
and no one had ever consulted the programmers.

00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:49.781
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.

00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.178
They were too bloated or too out of date

00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:54.860
by the time they were done.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.304
Sutherland wanted to create a system where

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:01.482
ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom

00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:04.027
and be adjusted in real time.

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:07.090
He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.882
before stumbling upon an article in 1986

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.961
called "The New New Product Development Game."

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.212
It said that the pace of business was quickening --

00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:17.341
and by the way, this was in 1986 --

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:21.306
and the most successful companies were flexible.

00:04:21.306 --> 00:04:23.090
It highlighted Toyota and Canon

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.394
and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.

00:04:27.394 --> 00:04:29.759
As Sutherland told me, we got to that article,

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.924
and said, "That's it."

00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:34.641
In Sutherland's system, companies don't use

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.642
large, massive projects that take two years.

00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:38.870
They do things in small chunks.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.319
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.385
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:46.386
and come back with a cell phone or a social network,"

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:48.818
you say, "You go off and come up with one element,

00:04:48.818 --> 00:04:51.338
then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."

00:04:51.338 --> 00:04:54.946
You succeed or fail quickly.

00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:58.114
Today, agile is used in a hundred countries,

00:04:58.114 --> 00:05:01.052
and it's sweeping into management suites.

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:03.562
Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques

00:05:03.562 --> 00:05:05.837
and applying it to their families.

00:05:05.837 --> 00:05:08.410
You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.306
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had

00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:11.816
an Agile Thanksgiving,

00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:14.327
where you had one group of people working on the food,

00:05:14.327 --> 00:05:17.658
one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.

00:05:17.658 --> 00:05:21.178
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.

00:05:21.178 --> 00:05:23.858
So let's take one problem that families face,

00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:26.875
crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.041
A key plank is accountability,

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:30.840
so teams use information radiators,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.603
these large boards in which everybody is accountable.

00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:36.539
So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home,

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.200
created a morning checklist

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.788
in which each child is expected to tick off chores.

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:44.168
So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs,

00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:46.878
poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair,

00:05:46.878 --> 00:05:48.386
and she sat there,

00:05:48.386 --> 00:05:51.384
kind of amiably talking to each of her children

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.375
as one after the other they came downstairs,

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.744
checked the list, made themselves breakfast,

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:58.527
checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher,

00:05:58.527 --> 00:06:01.647
rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had,

00:06:01.647 --> 00:06:04.071
checked the list once more, gathered their belongings,

00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.708
and made their way to the bus.

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:10.785
It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:13.927
And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house,

00:06:13.927 --> 00:06:16.110
our kids needed way too much monitoring,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.410
Eleanor looked at me.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.578
"That's what I thought," she said.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:20.898
"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'

00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:22.519
But I was wrong."

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:24.623
So I turned to David: "So why does it work?"

00:06:24.623 --> 00:06:27.559
He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:29.093
And he made a checkmark.

00:06:29.093 --> 00:06:31.229
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.705
With kids, it's heaven."

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:36.542
The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house,

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:40.689
it cut parental screaming in half. (Laughter)

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.774
But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.

00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:47.095
So following the agile model, we ask three questions:

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:49.017
What worked well in our family this week,

00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:53.177
what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:54.764
Everyone throws out suggestions

00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:57.496
and then we pick two to focus on.

00:06:57.496 --> 00:07:01.398
And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.

00:07:01.398 --> 00:07:03.518
What worked well this week?

00:07:03.518 --> 00:07:06.438
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.

00:07:06.438 --> 00:07:09.350
What didn't work well? Our math sheets,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.537
or greeting visitors at the door.

00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:15.965
Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:18.510
Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out,

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.044
I mean at least not that are revealing.

00:07:20.044 --> 00:07:23.807
This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.

00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:25.594
But the most surprising part was when we turned to,

00:07:25.594 --> 00:07:28.248
what are we going to work on in the week ahead?

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:30.265
You know, the key idea of agile is that

00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:32.070
teams essentially manage themselves,

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.414
and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.

00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:37.105
Our kids love this process.

00:07:37.105 --> 00:07:39.294
So they would come up with all these ideas.

00:07:39.294 --> 00:07:41.340
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.903
get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.

00:07:43.903 --> 00:07:46.715
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:48.882
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.

00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:51.827
We constantly have to kind of dial them back.

00:07:51.827 --> 00:07:53.819
Now look, naturally there's a gap between

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.187
their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week,

00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.301
but the truth is it didn't really bother us.

00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.651
It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables

00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:04.981
that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.

00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:07.411
Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now --

00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:09.848
We're still holding these meetings.

00:08:09.848 --> 00:08:14.580
My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.963
So what did we learn?

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:19.464
The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001

00:08:19.464 --> 00:08:21.664
when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers

00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:25.796
met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.

00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:29.327
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.

00:08:29.327 --> 00:08:32.702
I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.

00:08:32.702 --> 00:08:35.461
I'm proposing three planks.

00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:39.029
Plank number one: Adapt all the time.

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:40.815
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?

00:08:40.815 --> 00:08:43.914
We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.

00:08:43.914 --> 00:08:47.563
That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.

00:08:47.563 --> 00:08:50.997
We can't. What's great about the agile system

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.863
is you build in a system of change

00:08:52.863 --> 00:08:55.894
so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.

00:08:55.894 --> 00:08:57.338
It's like they say in the Internet world:

00:08:57.338 --> 00:09:00.082
if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago,

00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:01.740
you're doing the wrong thing.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.648
Parents can learn a lot from that.

00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:07.960
But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.336
We have to break parents out of this straitjacket

00:09:10.336 --> 00:09:12.673
that the only ideas we can try at home

00:09:12.673 --> 00:09:16.040
are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.360
or other family experts.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.632
The truth is, their ideas are stale,

00:09:20.632 --> 00:09:22.928
whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:26.253
to make groups and teams work effectively.

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:27.388
Let's just take a few examples.

00:09:27.388 --> 00:09:30.608
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.

00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:32.665
Everybody knows that having family dinner

00:09:32.665 --> 00:09:34.993
with your children is good for the kids.

00:09:34.993 --> 00:09:37.952
But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.224
I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said,

00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:42.603
"No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.

00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:44.739
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?

00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:47.731
We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.

00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:50.597
We'll make Sunday meals more important."

00:09:50.597 --> 00:09:54.147
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.

00:09:54.147 --> 00:09:57.059
It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time

00:09:57.059 --> 00:09:58.896
in any family meal.

00:09:58.896 --> 00:10:02.814
The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."

00:10:02.814 --> 00:10:04.851
You can take that 10 minutes and move it

00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:08.131
to any part of the day and have the same benefit.

00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:10.956
So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.

00:10:10.956 --> 00:10:13.246
An environmental psychologist told me,

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:16.581
"If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface,

00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:18.031
you'll be more rigid.

00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:21.934
If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."

00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:23.541
She told me, "When you're discipling your children,

00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:25.939
sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:28.493
The conversation will go better."

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:32.110
My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.930
because I was sitting above in the power position.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.970
So move where you sit. That's adaptability.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.324
The point is there are all these new ideas out there.

00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:43.711
We've got to hook them up with parents.

00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:46.138
So plank number one: Adapt all the time.

00:10:46.138 --> 00:10:50.578
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.

00:10:50.578 --> 00:10:54.674
Plank number two: Empower your children.

00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:57.688
Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.

00:10:57.688 --> 00:11:00.282
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.

00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:02.345
There's a reason that few systems have been more

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:05.397
waterfall over time than the family.

00:11:05.397 --> 00:11:07.214
But the single biggest lesson we learned

00:11:07.214 --> 00:11:10.101
is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.

00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:13.966
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.

00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:15.854
Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting,

00:11:15.854 --> 00:11:18.733
and we had voted to work on overreacting.

00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:22.029
So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?"

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:26.605
So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.

00:11:26.605 --> 00:11:28.363
So we kind of liked that.

00:11:28.363 --> 00:11:30.002
But then her sister started working the system.

00:11:30.002 --> 00:11:33.139
She said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:36.609
or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"

00:11:36.609 --> 00:11:38.837
I loved that. Spend the time however you want.

00:11:38.837 --> 00:11:41.109
Now give us a punishment. Okay.

00:11:41.109 --> 00:11:46.013
If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.

00:11:46.013 --> 00:11:49.437
Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.

00:11:49.437 --> 00:11:52.821
So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.

00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:55.549
There's plenty of parental authority going on.

00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:58.264
But we're giving them practice becoming independent,

00:11:58.264 --> 00:12:00.831
which of course is our ultimate goal.

00:12:00.831 --> 00:12:03.149
Just as I was leaving to come here tonight,

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:04.973
one of my daughters started screaming.

00:12:04.973 --> 00:12:07.488
The other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!"

00:12:07.488 --> 00:12:10.417
and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:13.926
To me that is a certified agile miracle.

00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:16.133
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:16.133 --> 00:12:20.869
And by the way, research backs this up too.

00:12:20.869 --> 00:12:24.445
Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules,

00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:28.370
evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:32.597
and take more control over their lives.

00:12:32.597 --> 00:12:35.749
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms,

00:12:35.749 --> 00:12:38.853
and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.

00:12:38.853 --> 00:12:40.601
I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker,

00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:42.843
and he was chiding me for not letting my children

00:12:42.843 --> 00:12:45.512
make mistakes with their allowance.

00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:47.488
And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"

00:12:47.488 --> 00:12:49.629
He said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:53.061
with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary

00:12:53.061 --> 00:12:55.733
or a $6 million inheritance."

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:58.213
So the bottom line is, empower your children.

00:12:58.213 --> 00:13:02.999
Plank number three: Tell your story.

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:06.962
Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.

00:13:06.962 --> 00:13:08.902
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great,"

00:13:08.902 --> 00:13:11.605
told me that successful human organizations of any kind

00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:13.119
have two things in common:

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:16.414
they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.

00:13:16.414 --> 00:13:18.619
So agile is great for stimulating progress,

00:13:18.619 --> 00:13:21.901
but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:23.955
So how do you do that?

00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:26.162
Collins coached us on doing something

00:13:26.162 --> 00:13:28.949
that businesses do, which is define your mission

00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:31.343
and identify your core values.

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:34.901
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.

00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:37.165
We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.

00:13:37.165 --> 00:13:39.469
We had a pajama party.

00:13:39.469 --> 00:13:43.029
I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:43.901
My wife bought a flip chart.

00:13:43.901 --> 00:13:46.518
And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?

00:13:46.518 --> 00:13:48.643
What values do we most uphold?

00:13:48.643 --> 00:13:50.399
And we ended up with 10 statements.

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:52.370
We are travelers, not tourists.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.045
We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.

00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:59.276
Again, research shows that parents should spend less time

00:13:59.276 --> 00:14:01.615
worrying about what they do wrong

00:14:01.615 --> 00:14:04.772
and more time focusing on what they do right,

00:14:04.772 --> 00:14:08.883
worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.

00:14:08.883 --> 00:14:11.619
This family mission statement is a great way to identify

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:14.139
what it is that you do right.

00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:16.429
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:18.417
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.

00:14:18.417 --> 00:14:20.773
And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?

00:14:20.773 --> 00:14:22.027
And we didn't really know what to do,

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:23.455
so we called her into my office.

00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:25.112
The family mission statement was on the wall,

00:14:25.112 --> 00:14:28.223
and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"

00:14:28.223 --> 00:14:31.099
And she kind of looked down the list, and she said,

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:32.827
"Bring people together?"

00:14:32.827 --> 00:14:36.283
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.

00:14:36.283 --> 00:14:37.615
Another great way to tell your story

00:14:37.615 --> 00:14:40.910
is to tell your children where they came from.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.611
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple

00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:45.693
"what do you know" test.

00:14:45.693 --> 00:14:47.771
Do you know where your grandparents were born?

00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:50.235
Do you know where your parents went to high school?

00:14:50.235 --> 00:14:52.020
Do you know anybody in your family

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.019
who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?

00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:59.589
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale

00:14:59.589 --> 00:15:04.155
had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.

00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:07.411
The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor

00:15:07.411 --> 00:15:10.115
of emotional health and happiness.

00:15:10.115 --> 00:15:12.291
As the author of the study told me,

00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:16.145
children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative

00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:19.099
have greater self-confidence.

00:15:19.099 --> 00:15:22.075
So my final plank is, tell your story.

00:15:22.075 --> 00:15:26.066
Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments

00:15:26.066 --> 00:15:28.907
and how you overcame the negative ones.

00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:31.363
If you give children this happy narrative,

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:37.074
you give them the tools to make themselves happier.

00:15:37.074 --> 00:15:39.497
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina"

00:15:39.497 --> 00:15:41.249
and its famous opening sentence,

00:15:41.249 --> 00:15:43.208
"All happy families are alike.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:47.299
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:50.523
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.

00:15:50.523 --> 00:15:53.646
Of course all happy families aren't alike."

00:15:53.646 --> 00:15:55.987
But as I began working on this project,

00:15:55.987 --> 00:15:58.699
I began changing my mind.

00:15:58.699 --> 00:16:01.251
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time,

00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:03.987
to identify the building blocks

00:16:03.987 --> 00:16:06.963
that successful families have.

00:16:06.963 --> 00:16:09.107
I've mentioned just three here today:

00:16:09.107 --> 00:16:14.274
Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.

00:16:14.289 --> 00:16:18.660
Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.036
The answer, I believe, is yes.

00:16:22.036 --> 00:16:24.748
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old,

00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:26.490
his brother Nikolay came to him

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.464
and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness

00:16:29.464 --> 00:16:32.244
on a little green stick, which he had hidden

00:16:32.244 --> 00:16:35.360
in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.793
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.

00:16:39.793 --> 00:16:45.289
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.

00:16:45.289 --> 00:16:49.640
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.185
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.

00:16:54.185 --> 00:16:56.736
That story perfectly captures for me

00:16:56.736 --> 00:16:58.944
the final lesson that I learned:

00:16:58.944 --> 00:17:01.608
Happiness is not something we find,

00:17:01.608 --> 00:17:04.504
it's something we make.

00:17:04.504 --> 00:17:07.774
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations

00:17:07.774 --> 00:17:10.755
has come to pretty much the same conclusion.

00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:13.144
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.

00:17:13.144 --> 00:17:16.008
It's a matter of choice.

00:17:16.008 --> 00:17:19.472
You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.

00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:21.656
You just need to take small steps,

00:17:21.656 --> 00:17:23.848
accumulate small wins,

00:17:23.848 --> 00:17:26.672
keep reaching for that green stick.

00:17:26.672 --> 00:17:30.321
In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.

00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:34.488
What's the secret to a happy family? Try.

00:17:34.488 --> 00:17:38.488
(Applause)
