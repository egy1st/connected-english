00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:03.105
This is not a story of Tibet

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:05.180
and it's not a story of the Amazon.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.618
I won't be taking you to the high Arctic,

00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:11.721
the life of the Inuit, or to the searing sands of the Sahara.

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.729
This is actually a story of my own backyard.

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:20.005
It's a land known to the Tahltan people

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:22.814
and all the First Nations of British Columbia

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:25.161
as the Sacred Headwaters,

00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:29.113
the source of the three great salmon rivers of home,

00:00:29.113 --> 00:00:33.611
the Skeena, the Stikine and the Nass.

00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:36.361
It's a valley where, in a long day, perhaps, too,

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.899
you can follow the tracks of grizzly and wolf

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.136
and drink from the very sources of water

00:00:41.136 --> 00:00:43.758
that gave rise and cradled the great civilizations

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:45.721
of the Northwest Coast.

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:49.971
It's such a beautiful place. It's the most stunningly wild place I've ever been.

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:52.192
It's the sort of place that we, as Canadians,

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:55.258
could throw England, and they'd never find it.

00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:59.071
John Muir, in 1879, went up just the lower third of the Stikine,

00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.921
and he was so enraptured he called it

00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:03.221
a Yosemite 150 miles long.

00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:05.259
He came back to California

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.471
and named his dog after that river of enchantment.

00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:10.822
In the Lower 48, the farthest you can get away

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:13.035
from a maintained road is 20 miles.

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:15.759
In the Northwest Quadrant of British Columbia,

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.684
an area of land the size of Oregon, there's one road,

00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:21.397
a narrow ribbon of asphalt that slips up the side

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:24.432
of the Coast Mountains to the Yukon.

00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:27.557
I followed that road in the early 1970s,

00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:30.329
soon after it was built, to take a job as the first park ranger

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.603
in Spatsizi wilderness.

00:01:32.603 --> 00:01:35.837
My job description was deliciously vague:

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:39.981
wilderness assessment and public relations.

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.278
In two four-month seasons I saw not a dozen people.

00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:46.144
There was no one to relate publicly to.

00:01:46.144 --> 00:01:47.871
But in the course of these wanderings,

00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:50.254
I came upon an old shaman's grave

00:01:50.254 --> 00:01:52.917
that led to an encounter with a remarkable man:

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:57.401
Alex Jack, an Gitxsan elder and chief who had lived

00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:01.067
as a trapper and a hunter in that country for all of his life.

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:04.604
And over the course of 30 years, I recorded traditional tales

00:02:04.604 --> 00:02:08.493
from Alex, mostly mythological accounts of Wy-ghet,

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:11.773
the trickster transformer of Gitxsan lore

00:02:11.773 --> 00:02:15.569
who, in his folly, taught the people how to live on the land.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.357
And just before Alex died at the age of 96,

00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:21.200
he gave me a gift.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.960
It was a tool carved from caribou bone

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.736
by his grandfather in 1910,

00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:31.020
and it turned out to be a specialized implement

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.247
used by a trapper to skin out the eyelids of wolves.

00:02:35.247 --> 00:02:39.298
It was only when Alex passed away that I realized that

00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:42.272
the eyelids, in some sense, were my own,

00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:45.433
and having done so much to allow me to learn to see,

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:49.271
Alex in his own way was saying goodbye.

00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:51.977
Well, isolation has been the great saving grace

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:56.221
of this remarkable place, but today isolation could be its doom.

00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:59.321
You've heard so much about the developments of the tar sands,

00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.989
the controversy about the Keystone and the Enbridge pipelines,

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.699
but these are just elements of a tsunami

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.086
of industrial development that is sweeping across

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:11.884
all of the wild country of northern Canada.

00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:17.311
In Tahltan territory alone, there are 41 major industrial proposals,

00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:21.022
some with great promise, some of great concern.

00:03:21.022 --> 00:03:23.235
On Todagin Mountain,

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:27.999
revered by the Tahltan people as a wildlife sanctuary in the sky,

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.260
home to the largest population of stone sheep on the planet,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.323
Imperial Metals --

00:03:34.323 --> 00:03:37.421
but the 75th-biggest mining company in all of Canada --

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:39.911
has secured permits to establish an open-pit

00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.880
copper and gold mine which will process

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.873
30,000 tons of rock a day for 30 years,

00:03:45.873 --> 00:03:49.399
generating hundreds of millions of tons of toxic waste

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.449
that, by the project's design, will simply be dumped

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.148
into the lakes of the Sacred Headwaters.

00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:58.824
At the Headwaters itself,

00:03:58.824 --> 00:04:02.350
Shell Canada has plans to extract methane gas

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.237
from coal seams that underly a million acres,

00:04:06.237 --> 00:04:09.483
fracking the coal with hundreds of millions of gallons

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:11.562
of toxic chemicals,

00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:14.337
establishing perhaps as many as 6,000 wellheads,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.813
and eventually a network of roads and pipelines

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:21.733
and flaring wellheads, all to generate methane gas

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:24.175
that most likely will go east

00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:28.410
to fuel the expansion of the tar sands.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.025
For over a decade, the Tahltan people,

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:33.426
both clans, Wolf and Crow,

00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:36.339
have resisted this assault on their homeland.

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:39.588
Men, women and children of all ages,

00:04:39.588 --> 00:04:42.316
elders in wheelchairs, have blockaded

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:45.628
the only road access to the interior.

00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:48.269
For them, the Headwaters is a kitchen.

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:52.041
It's a sanctuary. It's a burial ground of their ancestors.

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:53.876
And those who really own it

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:57.903
are the generations as yet unborn.

00:04:57.903 --> 00:05:00.341
The Tahltan have been able,

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.367
with the support of all Canadians who live downstream,

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:08.754
all local politicians, to resist this assault on their homeland,

00:05:08.754 --> 00:05:12.111
but now everything hangs in the balance.

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:14.923
Decisions that will be made this year will literally determine

00:05:14.923 --> 00:05:17.779
the fate of this country.

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:19.681
The Tahltan have called for the creation

00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:22.880
of a tribal heritage reserve which will set aside

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.632
the largest protected area in British Columbia.

00:05:27.632 --> 00:05:31.480
Our goal is not only to help them do that

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.180
but to encourage our friends, the good people at Shell,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.744
not only to withdraw from the Sacred Headwaters,

00:05:38.744 --> 00:05:41.953
but to move forward with us and join us

00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:45.893
as we do the remarkable, the extraordinary:

00:05:45.893 --> 00:05:50.244
set aside a protected area that will be for all time

00:05:50.244 --> 00:05:53.906
not simply the Sacred Headwaters of the Tahltan people

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:58.644
but the sacred headwaters of all people in the world.

00:05:58.644 --> 00:06:02.619
The Tahltan need your help. We need your help.

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:05.796
And if any of you would like to join us on this great adventure,

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:08.732
please come and see me later today.

00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:10.982
Thank you very much.

00:06:10.982 --> 00:06:15.025
(Applause)
