00:00:01.274 --> 00:00:06.690
What is going to be the future of learning?

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.970
I do have a plan,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.050
but in order for me to tell you what that plan is,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.020
I need to tell you a little story,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.866
which kind of sets the stage.

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.653
I tried to look at

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:23.060
where did the kind of learning we do in schools,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.330
where did it come from?

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.762
And you can look far back into the past,

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:31.575
but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:35.277
it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:39.225
It came from about 300 years ago,

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:41.442
and it came from the last

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:44.410
and the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"]

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.755
Imagine trying to run the show,

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.163
trying to run the entire planet,

00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:52.987
without computers, without telephones,

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:57.119
with data handwritten on pieces of paper,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.669
and traveling by ships.

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:02.823
But the Victorians actually did it.

00:01:02.823 --> 00:01:05.991
What they did was amazing.

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:09.303
They created a global computer

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:12.359
made up of people.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.152
It's still with us today.

00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:20.131
It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.

00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.458
In order to have that machine running,

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.659
you need lots and lots of people.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.018
They made another machine to produce those people:

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:33.914
the school.

00:01:33.914 --> 00:01:36.691
The schools would produce the people

00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:40.540
who would then become parts of the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.925
bureaucratic administrative machine.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:48.315
They must be identical to each other.

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.472
They must know three things:

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:53.512
They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.667
they must be able to read;

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:57.946
and they must be able to do multiplication,

00:01:57.946 --> 00:02:01.609
division, addition and subtraction in their head.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.136
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:07.471
and ship them to Canada

00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:11.552
and he would be instantly functional.

00:02:11.552 --> 00:02:14.421
The Victorians were great engineers.

00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.910
They engineered a system that was so robust

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.365
that it's still with us today,

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:24.341
continuously producing identical people

00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:29.157
for a machine that no longer exists.

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:32.085
The empire is gone,

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.989
so what are we doing with that design

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.358
that produces these identical people,

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:40.261
and what are we going to do next

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:44.181
if we ever are going to do anything else with it?

00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:45.871
["Schools as we know them are obsolete"]

00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:47.763
So that's a pretty strong comment there.

00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:51.557
I said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:53.291
I'm not saying they're broken.

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:56.288
It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:59.939
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.165
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.572
What are the kind of jobs that we have today?

00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:10.706
Well, the clerks are the computers.

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:13.237
They're there in thousands in every office.

00:03:13.237 --> 00:03:16.442
And you have people who guide those computers

00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:18.919
to do their clerical jobs.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.183
Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.

00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:25.215
They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:27.487
They do need to be able to read.

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:31.637
In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.

00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:34.744
Well, that's today, but we don't even know

00:03:34.744 --> 00:03:37.303
what the jobs of the future are going to look like.

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:39.947
We know that people will work from wherever they want,

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:43.145
whenever they want, in whatever way they want.

00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:47.333
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.876
for that world?

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:54.924
Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.

00:03:54.924 --> 00:03:57.556
I used to teach people how to write computer programs

00:03:57.556 --> 00:04:00.020
in New Delhi, 14 years ago.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.777
And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:06.364
And I used to think, how on Earth are those kids

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:08.884
ever going to learn to write computer programs?

00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:11.964
Or should they not?

00:04:11.964 --> 00:04:14.581
At the same time, we also had lots of parents,

00:04:14.581 --> 00:04:17.012
rich people, who had computers,

00:04:17.012 --> 00:04:20.143
and who used to tell me, "You know, my son,

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:22.332
I think he's gifted,

00:04:22.332 --> 00:04:25.206
because he does wonderful things with computers.

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:29.182
And my daughter -- oh, surely she is extra-intelligent."

00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:31.290
And so on. So I suddenly figured that,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.086
how come all the rich people are having

00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:35.227
these extraordinarily gifted children?

00:04:35.227 --> 00:04:37.142
(Laughter)

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:39.966
What did the poor do wrong?

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.969
I made a hole in the boundary wall

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.001
of the slum next to my office,

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.745
and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:50.729
if I gave a computer to children who never would have one,

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.065
didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:55.017
The children came running in.

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:57.187
It was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?"

00:04:57.187 --> 00:05:00.171
And I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know."

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:02.387
(Laughter)

00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:04.943
They said, "Why have you put it there?"

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:06.158
I said, "Just like that."

00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:09.167
And they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to."

00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:11.544
And I went away.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.288
About eight hours later,

00:05:13.288 --> 00:05:16.243
we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.

00:05:16.243 --> 00:05:18.740
So I said, "Well that's impossible, because --

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.281
How is it possible? They don't know anything."

00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:25.145
My colleagues said, "No, it's a simple solution.

00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:27.968
One of your students must have been passing by,

00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:30.063
showed them how to use the mouse."

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.586
So I said, "Yeah, that's possible."

00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:34.645
So I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi

00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:36.636
into a really remote village

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:40.428
where the chances of a passing software development engineer

00:05:40.428 --> 00:05:44.844
was very little. (Laughter)

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.507
I repeated the experiment there.

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:49.794
There was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,

00:05:49.794 --> 00:05:51.994
I went away, came back after a couple of months,

00:05:51.994 --> 00:05:53.689
found kids playing games on it.

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:54.640
When they saw me, they said,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.122
"We want a faster processor and a better mouse."

00:05:57.122 --> 00:06:01.416
(Laughter)

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:04.825
So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?"

00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:07.280
And they said something very interesting to me.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.945
In an irritated voice, they said,

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:11.498
"You've given us a machine that works only in English,

00:06:11.498 --> 00:06:17.583
so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter)

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:19.560
That's the first time, as a teacher,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.651
that I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually.

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:28.253
Here's a short glimpse from those years.

00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:30.900
That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.138
On your right is an eight-year-old.

00:06:33.138 --> 00:06:38.858
To his left is his student. She's six.

00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:42.455
And he's teaching her how to browse.

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:45.741
Then onto other parts of the country,

00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.024
I repeated this over and over again,

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:51.469
getting exactly the same results that we were.

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:55.396
["Hole in the wall film - 1999"]

00:06:55.396 --> 00:06:59.661
An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:10.017
And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,

00:07:10.017 --> 00:07:14.266
and said, "There's a processor inside."

00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:16.759
So I started publishing.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:19.314
I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.516
and I said, in nine months, a group of children

00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:24.214
left alone with a computer in any language

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:28.729
will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:33.489
I'd seen it happen over and over and over again.

00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:36.221
But I was curious to know, what else would they do

00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:38.461
if they could do this much?

00:07:38.461 --> 00:07:40.989
I started experimenting with other subjects,

00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:43.957
among them, for example, pronunciation.

00:07:43.957 --> 00:07:46.405
There's one community of children in southern India

00:07:46.405 --> 00:07:49.173
whose English pronunciation is really bad,

00:07:49.173 --> 00:07:52.693
and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.

00:07:52.693 --> 00:07:56.771
I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,

00:07:56.771 --> 00:08:00.045
and I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say."

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:04.677
(Laughter)

00:08:04.677 --> 00:08:09.861
They did that, and watch a little bit of this.

00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:15.373
Computer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you.

00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:17.644
Sugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face

00:08:17.644 --> 00:08:21.461
of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.

00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:24.957
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad

00:08:24.957 --> 00:08:29.679
and may have tortured you about your credit card bills

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:34.452
in a very clear English accent.

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:38.829
So then people said, well, how far will it go?

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:40.399
Where does it stop?

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:43.762
I decided I would destroy my own argument

00:08:43.762 --> 00:08:46.266
by creating an absurd proposition.

00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:50.154
I made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:51.958
Tamil is a south Indian language, and I said,

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.603
can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village

00:08:54.603 --> 00:08:58.108
learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English

00:08:58.108 --> 00:09:00.355
from a streetside computer?

00:09:00.355 --> 00:09:02.540
And I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.594
I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,

00:09:05.594 --> 00:09:07.898
I'll go back, they'll get another zero.

00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:12.254
I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.

00:09:12.254 --> 00:09:16.317
I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.

00:09:16.317 --> 00:09:18.994
I put in Hole in the Wall computers there,

00:09:18.994 --> 00:09:22.681
downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,

00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:25.986
most of which I didn't understand.

00:09:25.986 --> 00:09:28.963
The children came rushing, said, "What's all this?"

00:09:28.963 --> 00:09:33.971
So I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English."

00:09:33.971 --> 00:09:37.325
So they said, "How can we understand such big English words

00:09:37.325 --> 00:09:39.403
and diagrams and chemistry?"

00:09:39.403 --> 00:09:42.227
So by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,

00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:45.111
so I applied that. I said, "I haven't the foggiest idea."

00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.306
(Laughter)

00:09:48.306 --> 00:09:51.256
"And anyway, I am going away."

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:55.624
(Laughter)

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:59.213
So I left them for a couple of months.

00:09:59.213 --> 00:10:01.848
They'd got a zero. I gave them a test.

00:10:01.848 --> 00:10:02.772
I came back after two months

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:06.432
and the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing."

00:10:06.432 --> 00:10:08.507
So I said, "Well, what did I expect?"

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:12.592
So I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you

00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:15.353
before you decided that you can't understand anything?"

00:10:15.353 --> 00:10:17.301
So they said, "We haven't given up.

00:10:17.301 --> 00:10:19.277
We look at it every single day."

00:10:19.277 --> 00:10:21.742
So I said, "What? You don't understand these screens

00:10:21.742 --> 00:10:24.446
and you keep staring at it for two months? What for?"

00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.959
So a little girl who you see just now,

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.691
she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,

00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:31.888
she said, "Well, apart from the fact that

00:10:31.888 --> 00:10:35.039
improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,

00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:37.560
we haven't understood anything else."

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.272
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:43.272 --> 00:10:47.392
So I tested them.

00:10:47.392 --> 00:10:50.664
I got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent

00:10:50.664 --> 00:10:52.968
in two months in the tropical heat

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:56.408
with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know

00:10:56.408 --> 00:10:59.480
doing something that's a decade ahead of their time.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.857
Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.

00:11:04.857 --> 00:11:08.257
Thirty percent is a fail.

00:11:08.257 --> 00:11:11.193
How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.

00:11:11.193 --> 00:11:16.030
I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.416
a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant

00:11:18.416 --> 00:11:20.864
and she played with them all the time.

00:11:20.864 --> 00:11:22.985
So I asked this girl, "Can you help them?"

00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:25.256
So she says, "Absolutely not.

00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:28.333
I didn't have science in school. I have no idea

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:32.862
what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you."

00:11:32.862 --> 00:11:37.393
I said, "I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother."

00:11:37.393 --> 00:11:38.723
So she says, "What's that?"

00:11:38.723 --> 00:11:40.110
I said, "Stand behind them.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.716
Whenever they do anything, you just say,

00:11:41.732 --> 00:11:44.513
'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?

00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:47.625
What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.'

00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:50.547
You know what grannies do."

00:11:50.547 --> 00:11:52.721
So she did that for two more months.

00:11:52.721 --> 00:11:55.635
The scores jumped to 50 percent.

00:11:55.635 --> 00:11:57.289
Kallikuppam had caught up

00:11:57.289 --> 00:11:59.167
with my control school in New Delhi,

00:11:59.167 --> 00:12:03.303
a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.

00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:08.140
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.236
Here's Kallikuppam.

00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:18.431
(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication.

00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:22.122
I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,

00:12:22.122 --> 00:12:24.618
but what she was saying, as you could make out,

00:12:24.618 --> 00:12:27.025
was about neurons, with her hands were like that,

00:12:27.025 --> 00:12:30.581
and she was saying neurons communicate.

00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:33.925
At 12.

00:12:33.925 --> 00:12:37.135
So what are jobs going to be like?

00:12:37.135 --> 00:12:39.426
Well, we know what they're like today.

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.764
What's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,

00:12:41.764 --> 00:12:44.817
children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand

00:12:44.817 --> 00:12:48.590
and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.549
What will it be tomorrow?

00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:57.449
Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all?

00:12:57.449 --> 00:13:00.989
Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:04.309
you can find out in two minutes?

00:13:04.309 --> 00:13:08.414
Could it be -- a devastating question,

00:13:08.414 --> 00:13:11.206
a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte --

00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:14.245
could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in

00:13:14.245 --> 00:13:17.605
a future where knowing is obsolete?

00:13:17.605 --> 00:13:20.138
But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.

00:13:20.138 --> 00:13:24.055
Knowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.

00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:25.832
But look at it this way.

00:13:25.832 --> 00:13:28.378
It took nature 100 million years

00:13:28.378 --> 00:13:30.514
to make the ape stand up

00:13:30.514 --> 00:13:32.698
and become Homo sapiens.

00:13:32.698 --> 00:13:36.394
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.

00:13:36.394 --> 00:13:38.576
What an achievement that is.

00:13:38.576 --> 00:13:42.603
But we have to integrate that into our own future.

00:13:42.603 --> 00:13:45.562
Encouragement seems to be the key.

00:13:45.562 --> 00:13:46.772
If you look at Kuppam,

00:13:46.772 --> 00:13:49.586
if you look at all of the experiments that I did,

00:13:49.586 --> 00:13:56.721
it was simply saying, "Wow," saluting learning.

00:13:56.721 --> 00:13:59.115
There is evidence from neuroscience.

00:13:59.115 --> 00:14:02.317
The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,

00:14:02.317 --> 00:14:06.053
when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:09.731
it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,

00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:12.475
it shuts all of that down.

00:14:12.475 --> 00:14:16.623
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats.

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:20.248
We take our children, we make them shut their brains down,

00:14:20.248 --> 00:14:22.944
and then we say, "Perform."

00:14:22.944 --> 00:14:26.425
Why did they create a system like that?

00:14:26.425 --> 00:14:28.071
Because it was needed.

00:14:28.071 --> 00:14:30.656
There was an age in the Age of Empires

00:14:30.656 --> 00:14:34.926
when you needed those people who can survive under threat.

00:14:34.926 --> 00:14:37.193
When you're standing in a trench all alone,

00:14:37.193 --> 00:14:41.224
if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.

00:14:41.224 --> 00:14:44.197
If you didn't, you failed.

00:14:44.197 --> 00:14:46.853
But the Age of Empires is gone.

00:14:46.853 --> 00:14:50.491
What happens to creativity in our age?

00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:53.506
We need to shift that balance back

00:14:53.506 --> 00:14:56.915
from threat to pleasure.

00:14:56.915 --> 00:15:00.867
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers.

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:03.884
I put out notices in papers saying,

00:15:03.884 --> 00:15:07.304
if you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,

00:15:07.304 --> 00:15:10.531
can you give me one hour of your time per week for free?

00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:12.643
I got 200 in the first two weeks.

00:15:12.643 --> 00:15:17.551
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter)

00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:21.366
They're called the Granny Cloud.

00:15:21.366 --> 00:15:23.096
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.

00:15:23.096 --> 00:15:27.470
If there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.039
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:34.658
I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles

00:15:34.658 --> 00:15:36.703
in northwestern England,

00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:40.007
deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:42.247
6,000 miles away.

00:15:42.247 --> 00:15:45.823
She does it with only one age-old gesture.

00:15:45.823 --> 00:15:47.538
"Shhh."

00:15:47.538 --> 00:15:50.263
Okay?

00:15:50.263 --> 00:15:51.799
Watch this.

00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:56.055
Grandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:59.823
You can't catch me.

00:15:59.823 --> 00:16:02.791
Children: You can't catch me.

00:16:02.791 --> 00:16:08.373
Grandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man.

00:16:08.373 --> 00:16:12.963
Grandmother: Well done! Very good.

00:16:12.963 --> 00:16:15.421
SM: So what's happening here?

00:16:15.421 --> 00:16:17.265
I think what we need to look at is

00:16:17.265 --> 00:16:19.646
we need to look at learning

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:24.234
as the product of educational self-organization.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:27.079
If you allow the educational process to self-organize,

00:16:27.079 --> 00:16:29.570
then learning emerges.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.963
It's not about making learning happen.

00:16:31.963 --> 00:16:34.179
It's about letting it happen.

00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:37.452
The teacher sets the process in motion

00:16:37.452 --> 00:16:40.171
and then she stands back in awe

00:16:40.171 --> 00:16:42.539
and watches as learning happens.

00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:45.492
I think that's what all this is pointing at.

00:16:45.492 --> 00:16:48.244
But how will we know? How will we come to know?

00:16:48.244 --> 00:16:49.919
Well, I intend to build

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:53.220
these Self-Organized Learning Environments.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.905
They are basically broadband, collaboration

00:16:56.905 --> 00:16:59.298
and encouragement put together.

00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:01.004
I've tried this in many, many schools.

00:17:01.004 --> 00:17:03.539
It's been tried all over the world, and teachers

00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:07.165
sort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?"

00:17:07.165 --> 00:17:10.282
And I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?"

00:17:10.282 --> 00:17:13.775
I said, "You won't believe the children who told me

00:17:13.775 --> 00:17:16.703
and where they're from."

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.447
Here's a SOLE in action.

00:17:19.447 --> 00:17:25.556
(Children talking)

00:17:25.556 --> 00:17:31.845
This one is in England.

00:17:31.845 --> 00:17:35.611
He maintains law and order,

00:17:35.611 --> 00:17:44.126
because remember, there's no teacher around.

00:17:46.096 --> 00:17:49.999
Girl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM: Australia

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:56.734
Girl: -- giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.

00:17:56.734 --> 00:18:00.318
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons

00:18:00.318 --> 00:18:03.611
in the ion minus the number of electrons.

00:18:03.611 --> 00:18:06.660
SM: A decade ahead of her time.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.263
So SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.

00:18:10.263 --> 00:18:12.469
You already heard about that. You know what that means.

00:18:12.469 --> 00:18:15.870
There was a time when Stone Age men and women

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.974
used to sit and look up at the sky and say,

00:18:17.974 --> 00:18:20.453
"What are those twinkling lights?"

00:18:20.453 --> 00:18:25.247
They built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.

00:18:25.247 --> 00:18:29.377
We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.

00:18:29.377 --> 00:18:33.085
But that's not sexy enough.

00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:36.046
The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,

00:18:36.046 --> 00:18:39.199
"If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,

00:18:39.199 --> 00:18:42.597
how would you figure out if it was going to or not?"

00:18:42.597 --> 00:18:45.157
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:48.142
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,"

00:18:48.142 --> 00:18:51.013
and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.

00:18:51.013 --> 00:18:55.471
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.

00:18:55.471 --> 00:19:01.060
I've tried incredible, incredible questions --

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.348
"When did the world begin? How will it end?" —

00:19:05.348 --> 00:19:07.293
to nine-year-olds.

00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:10.269
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe.

00:19:10.269 --> 00:19:15.227
This is done by children without the help of any teacher.

00:19:15.227 --> 00:19:17.611
The teacher only raises the question,

00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:21.275
and then stands back and admires the answer.

00:19:21.275 --> 00:19:25.011
So what's my wish?

00:19:25.011 --> 00:19:27.227
My wish is

00:19:27.227 --> 00:19:31.541
that we design the future of learning.

00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:33.507
We don't want to be spare parts

00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:35.899
for a great human computer, do we?

00:19:35.899 --> 00:19:39.555
So we need to design a future for learning.

00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:41.191
And I've got to -- hang on,

00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:43.891
I've got to get this wording exactly right,

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.535
because, you know, it's very important.

00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:48.851
My wish is to help design a future of learning

00:19:48.851 --> 00:19:51.085
by supporting children all over the world

00:19:51.085 --> 00:19:54.131
to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.

00:19:54.131 --> 00:19:56.363
Help me build this school.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:59.699
It will be called the School in the Cloud.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:04.772
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures

00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:08.629
driven by the big questions which their mediators put in.

00:20:08.629 --> 00:20:10.900
The way I want to do this

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.260
is to build a facility where I can study this.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.060
It's a facility which is practically unmanned.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.827
There's only one granny

00:20:19.827 --> 00:20:22.268
who manages health and safety.

00:20:22.268 --> 00:20:23.701
The rest of it's from the cloud.

00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:25.616
The lights are turned on and off by the cloud,

00:20:25.616 --> 00:20:27.644
etc., etc., everything's done from the cloud.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.869
But I want you for another purpose.

00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:33.628
You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments

00:20:33.628 --> 00:20:38.644
at home, in the school, outside of school, in clubs.

00:20:38.644 --> 00:20:40.772
It's very easy to do. There's a great document

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.660
produced by TED which tells you how to do it.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.036
If you would please, please do it

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:48.401
across all five continents

00:20:48.401 --> 00:20:50.612
and send me the data,

00:20:50.612 --> 00:20:54.116
then I'll put it all together, move it into the School of Clouds,

00:20:54.116 --> 00:20:57.380
and create the future of learning.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.172
That's my wish.

00:20:59.172 --> 00:21:00.595
And just one last thing.

00:21:00.595 --> 00:21:03.188
I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas.

00:21:03.188 --> 00:21:06.491
At 12,000 feet, where the air is thin,

00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:09.476
I once built two Hole in the Wall computers,

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:10.931
and the children flocked there.

00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:13.828
And there was this little girl who was following me around.

00:21:13.828 --> 00:21:18.544
And I said to her, "You know, I want to give a computer to everybody, every child.

00:21:18.544 --> 00:21:20.945
I don't know, what should I do?"

00:21:20.945 --> 00:21:24.976
And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly.

00:21:24.976 --> 00:21:29.032
She suddenly raised her hand like this, and said to me,

00:21:29.032 --> 00:21:30.921
"Get on with it."

00:21:30.921 --> 00:21:42.785
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:21:42.785 --> 00:21:44.646
I think it was good advice.

00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:46.714
I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking.

00:21:46.714 --> 00:21:50.704
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:21:50.704 --> 00:21:54.455
(Applause)

00:21:54.455 --> 00:22:02.779
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:09.194
Thank you very much. Wow. (Applause)
