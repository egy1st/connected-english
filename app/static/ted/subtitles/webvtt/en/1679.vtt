WEBVTT

00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:03.496
Well, I was introduced as

00:00:03.496 --> 00:00:05.528
the former Governor of Michigan,

00:00:05.528 --> 00:00:08.544
but actually I'm a scientist.

00:00:08.544 --> 00:00:11.536
All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count,

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:15.332
but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy

00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:18.488
that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist,

00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:21.330
I was experimenting with policy

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.024
about what would achieve the greatest good

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.133
for the greatest number.

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.411
But there were three problems, three enigmas

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:32.945
that I could not solve,

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:36.423
and I want to share with you those problems,

00:00:36.423 --> 00:00:38.429
but most importantly,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.185
I think I figured out a proposal for a solution.

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.054
The first problem

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:46.045
that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is,

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.364
how do you create good jobs in America

00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:51.112
in a global economy?

00:00:51.112 --> 00:00:54.604
So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab.

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:59.114
I was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003,

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:01.646
I got a call from one of my staff members, who said,

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:04.014
"Gov, we have a big problem.

00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:07.634
We have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan,

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.896
population 8,000,

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:12.691
and they are about to lose their major employer,

00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:17.510
which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux."

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.189
And I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?"

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.119
And he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.900
So it is a one-company town.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.828
And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico.

00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:35.716
So I said, "Forget that. I'm the new Governor.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:38.004
We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.972
with my whole cabinet and we will just

00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:42.877
make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse."

00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:45.308
So I brought my whole cabinet,

00:01:45.308 --> 00:01:49.020
and we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville --

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.250
the mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college --

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.845
and we basically emptied our pockets

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:59.138
and put all of our chips on the table,

00:01:59.138 --> 00:02:03.266
incentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay,

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.917
and as we made our pile of chips,

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:10.024
we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux.

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:14.132
And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years,

00:02:14.132 --> 00:02:18.348
or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company,

00:02:18.348 --> 00:02:21.141
we'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers,

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.980
said they would offer unprecedented concessions,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.033
sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville.

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:31.911
So the management of Electrolux took our pile,

00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:34.724
our list of incentives, and they went outside the room

00:02:34.724 --> 00:02:37.244
for 17 minutes,

00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:39.475
and they came back in and they said,

00:02:39.475 --> 00:02:42.416
"Wow, this is the most generous

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:46.905
any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here.

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:50.300
But there's nothing you can do

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.589
to compensate for the fact that we can pay $1.57 an hour

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.847
in Juarez, Mexico. So we're leaving."

00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:00.852
And they did. And when they did, it was like

00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:04.108
a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville.

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:06.423
In fact, they did implode the factory.

00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:10.401
That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work.

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:14.425
And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line,

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:17.065
the employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan,

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:22.730
had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.713
It was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion,

00:03:25.713 --> 00:03:30.202
and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:34.099
that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs,

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.622
and I wanted to grieve with them,

00:03:36.622 --> 00:03:39.942
and as I went into the room-- there's thousands of people there.

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:43.685
It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:47.845
on roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music,

00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:51.582
or a band playing sad music, probably both. (Laughter)

00:03:51.582 --> 00:03:54.809
And this guy comes up to me,

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:58.549
and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on,

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.167
and he had his two daughters with him,

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:04.774
and he said, "Gov, these are my two daughters."

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:07.822
He said, "I'm 48 years old,

00:04:07.822 --> 00:04:12.380
and I have worked at this factory for 30 years.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.036
I went from high school to factory.

00:04:15.036 --> 00:04:17.644
My father worked at this factory," he said.

00:04:17.644 --> 00:04:20.493
"My grandfather worked at this factory.

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:25.516
All I know is how to make refrigerators."

00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:26.869
And he looked at his daughters,

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.357
and he puts his hand on his chest,

00:04:29.357 --> 00:04:31.907
and he says, "So, Gov, tell me,

00:04:31.907 --> 00:04:37.235
who is ever going to hire me?

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:40.668
Who is ever going to hire me?"

00:04:40.668 --> 00:04:44.190
And that was asked not just by that guy

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.868
but by everyone in the pavilion,

00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:52.708
and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:57.020
that closed in the first decade of this century.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.914
Enigma number one: How do you create jobs

00:04:59.914 --> 00:05:02.347
in America in a global economy?

00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:04.647
Number two, very quickly:

00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:07.379
How do you solve global climate change

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.716
when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country

00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:16.644
and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?

00:05:16.644 --> 00:05:19.806
In fact, there was a poll that was done recently

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:24.083
and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:26.513
to a number of other unpleasant things,

00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:30.033
and it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:32.915
is worse than cockroaches,

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:39.907
lice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump. (Laughter)

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:44.186
But wait, the good news is it's at least better

00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:49.042
than meth labs and gonorrhea. (Laughter)

00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:52.867
We got a problem, folks.

00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:54.505
So it got me thinking, what is it?

00:05:54.505 --> 00:05:58.267
What in the laboratory that I see out there,

00:05:58.267 --> 00:06:00.417
the laboratories of democracy, what has happened?

00:06:00.417 --> 00:06:03.116
What policy prescriptions have happened

00:06:03.116 --> 00:06:04.908
that actually cause changes to occur

00:06:04.908 --> 00:06:08.475
and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way?

00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:09.753
So if I asked you, for example,

00:06:09.753 --> 00:06:12.233
what was the Obama Administration policy

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:15.347
that caused massive changes across the country,

00:06:15.347 --> 00:06:16.635
what would you say?

00:06:16.635 --> 00:06:20.430
You might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.971
As we know, only half the states have opted in.

00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:26.480
We might say the Recovery Act, but those didn't require policy changes.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.831
The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur

00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.251
was Race to the Top for education.

00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:36.493
Why? The government put a $4.5 billion pot

00:06:36.493 --> 00:06:39.939
and said to the governors across the country, compete for it.

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:43.115
Forty-eight governors competed,

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:46.414
convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially

00:06:46.414 --> 00:06:48.700
raise standards for high schoolers

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.011
so that they all take a college prep curriculum.

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:56.397
Forty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up.

00:06:56.397 --> 00:06:59.000
So I thought, well, why can't we do something like that

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.046
and create a clean energy jobs race to the top?

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:05.397
Because after all, if you look at the context,

00:07:05.397 --> 00:07:09.375
1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:11.317
from the private sector globally,

00:07:11.317 --> 00:07:13.689
and every dollar represents a job,

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:15.284
and where are those jobs going?

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:17.708
Well, they're going to places that have policy, like China.

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:19.730
In fact, I was in China to see what they were doing,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.438
and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with,

00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:25.441
and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations

00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:27.804
and standing next to one of the Chinese officials,

00:07:27.804 --> 00:07:29.466
and we were watching, and he says,

00:07:29.466 --> 00:07:34.100
"So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?"

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.668
And I said, "Oh my God -- Congress, gridlock, who knows?"

00:07:37.668 --> 00:07:41.682
And this is what he did, he goes, he says,

00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:44.419
"Take your time."

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:49.057
Because they see our passivity as their opportunity.

00:07:49.057 --> 00:07:51.990
So what if we decided to create

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.689
a challenge to the governors of the country,

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:57.495
and the price to entry into this competition

00:07:57.495 --> 00:08:01.143
used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress

00:08:01.143 --> 00:08:03.833
for the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion,

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.216
which sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than

00:08:06.216 --> 00:08:08.705
one tenth of one percent of federal spending.

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:10.729
It's a rounding error on the federal side.

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:14.647
But price to entry into that competition would be,

00:08:14.647 --> 00:08:17.952
you could just, say, use the President's goal.

00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:21.025
He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard

00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:23.300
of 80 percent by 2030,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.279
in other words, that you'd have to get 80 percent

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:28.929
of your energy from clean sources by the year 2030.

00:08:28.929 --> 00:08:31.630
Why not ask all of the states to do that instead?

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.621
And imagine what might happen,

00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:35.609
because every region has something to offer.

00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:38.591
You might take states like Iowa and Ohio --

00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:40.608
two very important political states, by the way --

00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:42.496
those two governors, and they would say,

00:08:42.496 --> 00:08:45.211
we're going to lead the nation in producing

00:08:45.211 --> 00:08:47.813
the wind turbines and the wind energy.

00:08:47.813 --> 00:08:50.984
You might say the solar states, the sun belt,

00:08:50.984 --> 00:08:54.684
we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country,

00:08:54.684 --> 00:08:56.854
and maybe Jerry Brown says, "Well, I'm going to create

00:08:56.854 --> 00:08:59.031
an industry cluster in California

00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:00.870
to be able to produce the solar panels

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.519
so that we're not buying them from China

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:04.382
but we're buying them from the U.S."

00:09:04.382 --> 00:09:07.812
In fact, every region of the country could do this.

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:11.918
You see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:15.922
In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:18.097
in the West, they could do geothermal,

00:09:18.097 --> 00:09:20.409
or you could look at Texas and say,

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:23.777
we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.

00:09:23.777 --> 00:09:27.869
In the middle eastern states which have access to forests

00:09:27.884 --> 00:09:30.208
and to agricultural waste, they might say,

00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:32.809
we're going to lead the nation in biofuels.

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:35.325
In the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.189
in energy efficiency solutions.

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:41.158
Along the eastern seaboard, we're going to lead the nation

00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:42.977
in offshore wind.

00:09:42.977 --> 00:09:45.560
You might look at Michigan and say, we're going to lead the nation

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.454
in producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery.

00:09:49.454 --> 00:09:52.861
Every region has something to offer,

00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:55.183
and if you created a competition,

00:09:55.183 --> 00:09:59.301
it respects the states and it respects federalism.

00:09:59.301 --> 00:10:02.855
It's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina,

00:10:02.855 --> 00:10:05.525
who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top,

00:10:05.525 --> 00:10:07.926
you might even get them to opt in. Why?

00:10:07.926 --> 00:10:10.477
Because Republican and Democratic governors

00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:12.131
love to cut ribbons.

00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:16.445
We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.

00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:19.065
And it fosters innovation at the state level

00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:21.526
in these laboratories of democracy.

00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:25.832
Now, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately

00:10:25.832 --> 00:10:28.589
might say, "Okay, great idea, but really?

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:31.221
Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table?

00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:33.494
They can't agree to anything."

00:10:33.494 --> 00:10:36.789
So you could wait and go through Congress,

00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:39.365
although you should be very impatient.

00:10:39.365 --> 00:10:47.269
Or, you renegades, we could go around Congress.

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:48.827
Go around Congress.

00:10:48.827 --> 00:10:55.455
What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?

00:10:55.455 --> 00:11:00.415
What if several of the high-net worth companies

00:11:00.415 --> 00:11:04.805
and individuals who are here at TED decided

00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:08.333
that they would create, band together, just a couple of them,

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:11.893
and create a national competition to the governors

00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:14.149
to have a race to the top

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:16.818
and see how the governors respond?

00:11:16.818 --> 00:11:21.706
What if it all started here at TED?

00:11:21.706 --> 00:11:24.365
What if you were here

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:29.713
when we figured out how to crack the code

00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:35.159
to create good paying jobs in America -- (Applause) --

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:38.880
and get national energy policy

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.858
and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up?

00:11:44.858 --> 00:11:48.309
Because, dear TEDsters,

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:51.071
if you are impatient like I am,

00:11:51.071 --> 00:11:54.629
you know that our economic competitors,

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:58.069
our other nations, are in the game

00:11:58.069 --> 00:12:00.421
and are eating us for lunch.

00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:04.967
And we can get in the game or not.

00:12:04.967 --> 00:12:09.286
We can be at the table or we can be on the table.

00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:11.707
And I don't know about you,

00:12:11.707 --> 00:12:14.414
but I prefer to dine.

00:12:14.414 --> 00:12:18.414
Thank you all so much. (Applause)
