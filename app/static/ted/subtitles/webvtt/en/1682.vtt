00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:11.623
(Breathes in)

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:13.384
(Breathes out)

00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:20.959
So, I didn't always make
my living from music.

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:23.863
For about the five years after graduating

00:00:23.887 --> 00:00:26.992
from an upstanding
liberal arts university,

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:29.354
this was my day job.

00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:31.079
(Laughter)

00:00:31.103 --> 00:00:35.647
I was a self-employed living
statue called the Eight-Foot Bride,

00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:39.387
and I love telling people
I did this for a job,

00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.372
because everybody always wants to know,

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:43.351
who are these freaks in real life.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:44.376
(Laughter)

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.415
Hello.

00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:49.047
I painted myself white
one day, stood on a box,

00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:51.455
put a hat or a can at my feet,

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.806
and when someone came by
and dropped in money,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.491
I handed them a flower --

00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:00.545
and some intense eye contact.

00:01:01.987 --> 00:01:03.687
And if they didn't take the flower,

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.781
I threw in a gesture
of sadness and longing --

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:09.242
as they walked away.

00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:13.372
(Laughter)

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:19.611
So I had the most profound
encounters with people,

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:20.946
especially lonely people

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.295
who looked like they hadn't talked
to anyone in weeks,

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:30.288
and we would get this beautiful moment
of prolonged eye contact

00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:32.605
being allowed in a city street,

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:35.250
and we would sort of fall
in love a little bit.

00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:37.560
And my eyes would say --

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.433
"Thank you.

00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:41.028
I see you."

00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.280
And their eyes would say --

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.828
"Nobody ever sees me.

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:48.901
Thank you."

00:01:50.908 --> 00:01:52.393
I would get harassed sometimes.

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:54.481
People would yell at me from their cars.

00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:55.567
"Get a job!"

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:58.187
(Laughing) And I'd be, like,

00:01:58.211 --> 00:01:59.344
"This is my job."

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:03.750
But it hurt, because it made me fear

00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:08.008
that I was somehow doing
something un-joblike

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:09.940
and unfair, shameful.

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:15.995
I had no idea how perfect
a real education I was getting

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.131
for the music business on this box.

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:20.327
And for the economists out there,

00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:23.932
you may be interested to know I actually
made a pretty predictable income,

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:28.147
which was shocking to me,
given I had no regular customers,

00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:31.435
but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday,
90 bucks on a Friday.

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.720
It was consistent.

00:02:32.744 --> 00:02:36.204
And meanwhile, I was touring locally
and playing in nightclubs

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:38.066
with my band, the Dresden Dolls.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.164
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:42.077
I wrote the songs, and eventually

00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:46.463
we started making enough money
that I could quit being a statue,

00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:48.724
and as we started touring,

00:02:48.748 --> 00:02:51.098
I really didn't want to lose this sense

00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:53.798
of direct connection with people,
because I loved it.

00:02:53.822 --> 00:02:57.753
So after all of our shows,
we would sign autographs

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.665
and hug fans and hang out
and talk to people,

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:06.357
and we made an art out
of asking people to help us and join us,

00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:09.503
and I would track down
local musicians and artists

00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:12.695
and they would set up
outside of our shows,

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.183
and they would pass the hat,

00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:16.683
and then they would come in
and join us onstage,

00:03:16.707 --> 00:03:20.092
so we had this rotating smorgasbord
of weird, random circus guests.

00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:23.196
And then Twitter came along,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.252
and made things even more magic,

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:28.011
because I could ask instantly
for anything anywhere.

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.076
So I would need a piano to practice on,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.369
and an hour later I would be
at a fan's house.

00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:33.430
This is in London.

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:35.914
People would bring home-cooked food to us

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:38.653
all over the world backstage
and feed us and eat with us.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.059
This is in Seattle.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:43.686
Fans who worked in museums and stores

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.893
and any kind of public space
would wave their hands

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:50.157
if I would decide to do
a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:52.793
This is a library in Auckland.

00:03:53.604 --> 00:03:58.057
On Saturday I tweeted
for this crate and hat,

00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.840
because I did not want to schlep them
from the East Coast,

00:04:00.864 --> 00:04:03.887
and they showed up care of this dude,
Chris, from Newport Beach,

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.042
who says hello.

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:09.326
I once tweeted, "Where in Melbourne
can I buy a neti pot?"

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.856
And a nurse from a hospital drove one

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.127
right at that moment to the cafe I was in,

00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:15.595
and I bought her a smoothie

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.159
and we sat there talking
about nursing and death.

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:21.214
And I love this kind of random closeness,

00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:24.595
which is lucky, because I do
a lot of couchsurfing.

00:04:25.928 --> 00:04:29.018
In mansions where everyone
in my crew gets their own room

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:30.295
but there's no wireless,

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.851
and in punk squats,

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:34.813
everyone on the floor
in one room with no toilets

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:37.832
but with wireless,
clearly making it the better option.

00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:40.412
(Laughter)

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:47.065
My crew once pulled our van
up to a really poor Miami neighborhood

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:49.771
and we found out that our couchsurfing
host for the night

00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:52.358
was an 18-year-old girl,
still living at home,

00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:56.485
and her family were all undocumented
immigrants from Honduras.

00:04:57.006 --> 00:05:00.382
And that night, her whole family

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:03.459
took the couches and she slept
together with her mom

00:05:03.483 --> 00:05:05.213
so that we could take their beds.

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:08.855
And I lay there thinking,

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.578
these people have so little.

00:05:11.673 --> 00:05:12.879
Is this fair?

00:05:13.773 --> 00:05:15.086
And in the morning,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.433
her mom taught us
how to try to make tortillas

00:05:17.457 --> 00:05:19.434
and wanted to give me a Bible,

00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:25.027
and she took me aside and she said
to me in her broken English,

00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:29.505
"Your music has helped
my daughter so much.

00:05:30.584 --> 00:05:33.220
Thank you for staying here.
We're all so grateful."

00:05:33.894 --> 00:05:37.448
And I thought, this is fair.

00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:40.307
This is this.

00:05:41.305 --> 00:05:44.225
A couple of months later,
I was in Manhattan,

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:46.513
and I tweeted for a crash pad,
and at midnight,

00:05:46.537 --> 00:05:48.315
I'm on the Lower East Side,

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:51.108
and it occurs to me I've never
actually done this alone.

00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:53.085
I've always been with my band or my crew.

00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:54.947
Is this what stupid people do?

00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:56.414
(Laughter)

00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:58.881
Is this how stupid people die?

00:05:59.344 --> 00:06:01.869
And before I can change my mind,
the door busts open.

00:06:01.893 --> 00:06:02.924
She's an artist.

00:06:02.948 --> 00:06:05.268
He's a financial blogger for Reuters,

00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:07.306
and they're pouring me a glass of red wine

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.477
and offering me a bath,

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:12.834
and I have had thousands of nights
like that and like that.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.457
So I couchsurf a lot.
I also crowdsurf a lot.

00:06:17.848 --> 00:06:20.785
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:22.719
are basically the same thing.

00:06:23.057 --> 00:06:25.538
You're falling into the audience

00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:27.078
and you're trusting each other.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.693
I once asked an opening band of mine

00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:32.384
if they wanted to go out
into the crowd and pass the hat

00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:35.098
to get some extra money,
something that I did a lot.

00:06:35.122 --> 00:06:36.910
And as usual, the band was psyched,

00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:39.108
but there was this one guy in the band

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.990
who told me he just couldn't
bring himself to go out there.

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:46.704
It felt too much like begging
to stand there with the hat.

00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:50.828
And I recognized his fear

00:06:50.852 --> 00:06:52.941
of "Is this fair?"

00:06:52.965 --> 00:06:54.303
and "Get a job."

00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:58.832
And meanwhile, my band
is becoming bigger and bigger.

00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:00.385
We sign with a major label.

00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:03.925
And our music is a cross
between punk and cabaret.

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.331
It's not for everybody.

00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:07.782
Well, maybe it's for you.

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:09.890
(Laughter)

00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:13.710
We sign, and there's all this hype
leading up to our next record.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:17.403
And it comes out and it sells
about 25,000 copies

00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:18.716
in the first few weeks,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.620
and the label considers this a failure.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.597
I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"

00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:26.589
They said, "No, the sales are going down.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.629
It's a failure."

00:07:27.653 --> 00:07:28.668
And they walk off.

00:07:29.578 --> 00:07:32.938
Right at this same time,
I'm signing and hugging after a gig,

00:07:32.962 --> 00:07:34.729
and a guy comes up to me

00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:36.931
and hands me a $10 bill,

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:38.612
and he says,

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:41.016
"I'm sorry, I burned
your CD from a friend."

00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:45.361
(Laughter)

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.827
"But I read your blog,
I know you hate your label.

00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:50.634
I just want you to have this money."

00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:54.670
And this starts happening all the time.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.666
I become the hat after my own gigs,

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.952
but I have to physically stand there
and take the help from people,

00:08:01.976 --> 00:08:04.161
and unlike the guy in the opening band,

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:06.979
I've actually had a lot
of practice standing there.

00:08:08.773 --> 00:08:09.852
Thank you.

00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:12.458
And this is the moment I decide

00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:15.350
I'm just going to give away
my music for free

00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:17.082
online whenever possible,

00:08:17.106 --> 00:08:20.568
so it's like Metallica
over here, Napster, bad;

00:08:20.592 --> 00:08:22.258
Amanda Palmer over here,

00:08:22.282 --> 00:08:25.557
and I'm going to encourage
torrenting, downloading, sharing,

00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:27.679
but I'm going to ask for help,

00:08:27.703 --> 00:08:30.406
because I saw it work on the street.

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:33.903
So I fought my way off my label,
and for my next project

00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:36.607
with my new band,
the Grand Theft Orchestra,

00:08:36.631 --> 00:08:38.341
I turned to crowdfunding.

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:43.503
And I fell into those thousands
of connections that I'd made,

00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:45.634
and I asked my crowd to catch me.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:49.634
And the goal was 100,000 dollars.

00:08:49.658 --> 00:08:53.173
My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,

00:08:53.197 --> 00:08:56.079
which was the biggest music
crowdfunding project to date.

00:08:56.103 --> 00:09:00.167
(Applause)

00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:03.517
And you can see how many people it is.

00:09:04.858 --> 00:09:06.350
It's about 25,000 people.

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:09.709
And the media asked,

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:13.187
"Amanda, the music business is tanking
and you encourage piracy.

00:09:13.211 --> 00:09:15.545
How did you make
all these people pay for music?"

00:09:15.569 --> 00:09:17.930
And the real answer is,
I didn't make them.

00:09:18.398 --> 00:09:19.398
I asked them.

00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:24.096
And through the very act of asking people,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.812
I'd connected with them,

00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:29.686
and when you connect with them,
people want to help you.

00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:34.741
It's kind of counterintuitive
for a lot of artists.

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:36.431
They don't want to ask for things.

00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:40.108
But it's not easy.

00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:41.599
It's not easy to ask.

00:09:42.116 --> 00:09:44.298
And a lot of artists have
a problem with this.

00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:46.021
Asking makes you vulnerable.

00:09:46.613 --> 00:09:51.137
And I got a lot of criticism online,

00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:52.758
after my Kickstarter went big,

00:09:52.782 --> 00:09:55.717
for continuing my crazy
crowdsourcing practices,

00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:58.598
specifically for asking musicians

00:09:58.622 --> 00:10:00.971
who are fans if they wanted
to join us on stage

00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:05.286
for a few songs in exchange
for love and tickets and beer,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.810
and this was a doctored image
that went up of me on a website.

00:10:10.342 --> 00:10:13.225
And this hurt in a really familiar way.

00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:15.658
And people saying,

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:18.711
"You're not allowed anymore
to ask for that kind of help,"

00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:22.931
really reminded me of the people
in their cars yelling, "Get a job."

00:10:23.849 --> 00:10:27.952
Because they weren't
with us on the sidewalk,

00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:31.209
and they couldn't see the exchange

00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:33.281
that was happening
between me and my crowd,

00:10:33.305 --> 00:10:37.638
an exchange that was very fair
to us but alien to them.

00:10:38.948 --> 00:10:40.971
So this is slightly not safe for work.

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:43.558
This is my Kickstarter
backer party in Berlin.

00:10:43.582 --> 00:10:46.615
At the end of the night, I stripped
and let everyone draw on me.

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:49.632
Now let me tell you,
if you want to experience

00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:52.127
the visceral feeling
of trusting strangers --

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.598
(Laughter)

00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:54.813
I recommend this,

00:10:54.837 --> 00:10:58.180
especially if those strangers
are drunk German people.

00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:00.115
(Laughter)

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:03.959
This was a ninja
master-level fan connection,

00:11:03.983 --> 00:11:06.479
because what I was really saying here was,

00:11:06.503 --> 00:11:08.047
I trust you this much.

00:11:09.095 --> 00:11:10.216
Should I?

00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:11.984
Show me.

00:11:13.223 --> 00:11:15.235
For most of human history,

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:19.314
musicians, artists, they've been
part of the community.

00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:24.260
Connectors and openers,
not untouchable stars.

00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:29.152
Celebrity is about a lot of people
loving you from a distance,

00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:30.321
but the Internet

00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:33.946
and the content that we're freely
able to share on it

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.247
are taking us back.

00:11:36.744 --> 00:11:40.428
It's about a few people
loving you up close

00:11:40.452 --> 00:11:43.702
and about those people being enough.

00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:47.130
So a lot of people
are confused by the idea

00:11:47.154 --> 00:11:48.445
of no hard sticker price.

00:11:48.469 --> 00:11:51.667
They see it as an unpredictable risk,
but the things I've done,

00:11:51.691 --> 00:11:54.079
the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,

00:11:54.103 --> 00:11:55.933
I don't see these things as risk.

00:11:55.957 --> 00:11:57.257
I see them as trust.

00:11:58.075 --> 00:12:00.069
Now, the online tools

00:12:00.093 --> 00:12:04.841
to make the exchange as easy
and as instinctive as the street,

00:12:04.865 --> 00:12:06.063
they're getting there.

00:12:06.603 --> 00:12:10.178
But the perfect tools
aren't going to help us

00:12:10.202 --> 00:12:12.646
if we can't face each other

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.705
and give and receive fearlessly,

00:12:15.729 --> 00:12:16.928
but, more important --

00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:21.113
to ask without shame.

00:12:21.965 --> 00:12:24.576
My music career has been spent

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.149
trying to encounter people on the Internet
the way I could on the box.

00:12:30.003 --> 00:12:33.491
So blogging and tweeting
not just about my tour dates

00:12:33.515 --> 00:12:37.082
and my new video
but about our work and our art

00:12:37.106 --> 00:12:40.223
and our fears and our hangovers,

00:12:40.247 --> 00:12:41.665
our mistakes,

00:12:41.689 --> 00:12:43.150
and we see each other.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.534
And I think when we really see each other,

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.414
we want to help each other.

00:12:51.763 --> 00:12:54.902
I think people have been obsessed
with the wrong question,

00:12:54.926 --> 00:12:57.814
which is, "How do we make
people pay for music?"

00:12:58.822 --> 00:13:01.626
What if we started asking,

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.664
"How do we let people pay for music?"

00:13:06.532 --> 00:13:07.676
Thank you.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.700
(Applause)
