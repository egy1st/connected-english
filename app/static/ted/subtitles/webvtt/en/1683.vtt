WEBVTT

00:00:01.488 --> 00:00:05.057
The most massive

00:00:05.057 --> 00:00:09.992
tsunami perfect storm

00:00:09.992 --> 00:00:13.871
is bearing down upon us.

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:17.117
This perfect storm

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:22.285
is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:27.235
and we are facing that reality

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.616
with the full belief

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:31.172
that we can solve our problems with technology,

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:33.468
and that's very understandable.

00:00:33.468 --> 00:00:37.675
Now, this perfect storm that we are facing

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:41.185
is the result of our rising population,

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:43.989
rising towards 10 billion people,

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.633
land that is turning to desert,

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.741
and, of course, climate change.

00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.402
Now there's no question about it at all:

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.213
we will only solve the problem

00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:57.725
of replacing fossil fuels with technology.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:00.853
But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas --

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.974
are by no means the only thing

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:07.092
that is causing climate change.

00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:08.975
Desertification

00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:14.301
is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:16.602
and this happens only when

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:18.611
we create too much bare ground.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.617
There's no other cause.

00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:22.635
And I intend to focus

00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:27.541
on most of the world's land that is turning to desert.

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:32.834
But I have for you a very simple message

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:37.030
that offers more hope than you can imagine.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.098
We have environments

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:42.342
where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:44.846
On those, it is almost impossible

00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:47.635
to create vast areas of bare ground.

00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:51.257
No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:53.004
And we have environments

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:55.697
where we have months of humidity

00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:57.475
followed by months of dryness,

00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:00.953
and that is where desertification is occurring.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:03.009
Fortunately, with space technology now,

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.686
we can look at it from space,

00:02:04.686 --> 00:02:08.950
and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.573
Generally, what you see in green

00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:12.428
is not desertifying,

00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:14.734
and what you see in brown is,

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:19.106
and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:23.891
About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.

00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:26.815
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:30.519
while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.231
Think of it in terms of drums of water,

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:35.903
each containing 200 liters.

00:02:35.903 --> 00:02:40.503
Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare

00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:43.377
of that land that day.

00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:45.761
The next day, the land looked like this.

00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.584
Where had that water gone?

00:02:48.584 --> 00:02:50.981
Some of it ran off as flooding,

00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:53.928
but most of the water that soaked into the soil

00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:56.209
simply evaporated out again,

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.578
exactly as it does in your garden

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:01.593
if you leave the soil uncovered.

00:03:01.593 --> 00:03:05.059
Now, because the fate of water and carbon

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.617
are tied to soil organic matter,

00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:12.544
when we damage soils, you give off carbon.

00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:15.370
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.475
Now you're told over and over, repeatedly,

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:22.475
that desertification is only occurring

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:26.124
in arid and semi-arid areas of the world,

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:30.099
and that tall grasslands like this one

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.731
in high rainfall are of no consequence.

00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:38.308
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,

00:03:38.308 --> 00:03:41.019
you find that most of the soil in that grassland

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.310
that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.428
leading to increased runoff and evaporation.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:52.414
That is the cancer of desertification

00:03:52.414 --> 00:03:56.950
that we do not recognize till its terminal form.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.262
Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock,

00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:05.046
mostly cattle, sheep and goats,

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:07.863
overgrazing the plants,

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:11.982
leaving the soil bare and giving off methane.

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.222
Almost everybody knows this,

00:04:14.222 --> 00:04:17.057
from nobel laureates to golf caddies,

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:19.688
or was taught it, as I was.

00:04:19.688 --> 00:04:23.158
Now, the environments like you see here,

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:26.022
dusty environments in Africa where I grew up,

00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:28.942
and I loved wildlife,

00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:32.334
and so I grew up hating livestock

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:34.362
because of the damage they were doing.

00:04:34.362 --> 00:04:37.646
And then my university education as an ecologist

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:40.734
reinforced my beliefs.

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:46.010
Well, I have news for you.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.294
We were once just as certain

00:04:49.294 --> 00:04:51.574
that the world was flat.

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:55.519
We were wrong then, and we are wrong again.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.694
And I want to invite you now

00:04:57.694 --> 00:05:03.948
to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.

00:05:03.948 --> 00:05:06.519
When I was a young man,

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.414
a young biologist in Africa,

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:13.831
I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas

00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:16.350
as future national parks.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.777
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s —

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:22.945
and no sooner did we remove the hunting,

00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:26.426
drum-beating people to protect the animals,

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.319
than the land began to deteriorate,

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.565
as you see in this park that we formed.

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.888
Now, no livestock were involved,

00:05:34.888 --> 00:05:38.520
but suspecting that we had too many elephants now,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.785
I did the research and I proved we had too many,

00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:46.369
and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:50.421
and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.

00:05:50.421 --> 00:05:54.205
Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,

00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:57.064
and it was political dynamite, frankly.

00:05:57.064 --> 00:06:00.189
So our government formed a team of experts

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:02.830
to evaluate my research.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.237
They did. They agreed with me,

00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:07.148
and over the following years,

00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:13.039
we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.779
And it got worse, not better.

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.278
Loving elephants as I do,

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:22.884
that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,

00:06:22.884 --> 00:06:25.612
and I will carry that to my grave.

00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:28.084
One good thing did come out of it.

00:06:28.084 --> 00:06:31.460
It made me absolutely determined

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.940
to devote my life to finding solutions.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.025
When I came to the United States, I got a shock,

00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:43.493
to find national parks like this one

00:06:43.493 --> 00:06:47.724
desertifying as badly as anything in Africa.

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:49.728
And there'd been no livestock on this land

00:06:49.728 --> 00:06:52.452
for over 70 years.

00:06:52.452 --> 00:06:54.378
And I found that American scientists

00:06:54.378 --> 00:06:57.292
had no explanation for this

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.252
except that it is arid and natural.

00:07:00.252 --> 00:07:03.612
So I then began looking

00:07:03.612 --> 00:07:06.863
at all the research plots I could

00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:09.566
over the whole of the Western United States

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:11.767
where cattle had been removed

00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:14.639
to prove that it would stop desertification,

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.472
but I found the opposite,

00:07:16.472 --> 00:07:19.294
as we see on this research station,

00:07:19.294 --> 00:07:23.018
where this grassland that was green in 1961,

00:07:23.018 --> 00:07:28.031
by 2002 had changed to that situation.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:32.750
And the authors of the position paper on climate change

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.303
from which I obtained these pictures

00:07:35.303 --> 00:07:41.122
attribute this change to "unknown processes."

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:45.116
Clearly, we have never understood

00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:47.800
what is causing desertification,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.848
which has destroyed many civilizations

00:07:50.848 --> 00:07:53.540
and now threatens us globally.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.993
We have never understood it.

00:07:55.993 --> 00:07:58.112
Take one square meter of soil

00:07:58.112 --> 00:08:00.815
and make it bare like this is down here,

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:03.994
and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn

00:08:03.994 --> 00:08:06.798
and much hotter at midday

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:10.468
than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,

00:08:10.468 --> 00:08:12.082
plant litter.

00:08:12.082 --> 00:08:15.119
You have changed the microclimate.

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:17.218
Now, by the time you are doing that

00:08:17.218 --> 00:08:22.806
and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:26.831
on more than half the world's land,

00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:30.061
you are changing macroclimate.

00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:32.650
But we have just simply not understood

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.636
why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?

00:08:36.636 --> 00:08:39.286
Why has it accelerated lately?

00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.253
We had no understanding of that.

00:08:41.253 --> 00:08:44.678
What we had failed to understand

00:08:44.678 --> 00:08:48.501
was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.397
the soil and the vegetation

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:57.189
developed with very large numbers of grazing animals,

00:08:57.189 --> 00:08:59.813
and that these grazing animals

00:08:59.813 --> 00:09:05.205
developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators.

00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:09.097
Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators

00:09:09.097 --> 00:09:11.438
is to get into herds,

00:09:11.438 --> 00:09:15.430
and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:20.261
Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,

00:09:20.261 --> 00:09:23.261
and they have to keep moving,

00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:25.178
and it was that movement

00:09:25.178 --> 00:09:27.982
that prevented the overgrazing of plants,

00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:30.381
while the periodic trampling

00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:32.901
ensured good cover of the soil,

00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:36.013
as we see where a herd has passed.

00:09:36.013 --> 00:09:42.241
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.

00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:45.033
It has just come through four months of rain,

00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:48.715
and it's now going into eight months of dry season.

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:52.183
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.

00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:55.259
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground

00:09:55.259 --> 00:09:59.007
has to decay biologically

00:09:59.007 --> 00:10:02.531
before the next growing season, and if it doesn't,

00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:06.724
the grassland and the soil begin to die.

00:10:06.724 --> 00:10:09.919
Now, if it does not decay biologically,

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:15.058
it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:18.013
and this smothers and kills grasses,

00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:21.122
leading to a shift to woody vegetation

00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:24.542
and bare soil, releasing carbon.

00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:29.646
To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:35.495
But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,

00:10:35.495 --> 00:10:37.886
and worse than that,

00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:40.566
burning one hectare of grassland

00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:43.726
gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.640
than 6,000 cars.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.033
And we are burning in Africa, every single year,

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:55.672
more than one billion hectares of grasslands,

00:10:55.672 --> 00:10:59.298
and almost nobody is talking about it.

00:10:59.298 --> 00:11:03.637
We justify the burning, as scientists,

00:11:03.637 --> 00:11:06.550
because it does remove the dead material

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.853
and it allows the plants to grow.

00:11:09.853 --> 00:11:12.949
Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:15.645
what could we do to keep that healthy?

00:11:15.645 --> 00:11:18.669
And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.

00:11:18.669 --> 00:11:23.357
Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more

00:11:23.357 --> 00:11:26.973
without causing desertification and climate change.

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:30.110
We cannot burn it without causing

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.375
desertification and climate change.

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:36.360
What are we going to do?

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.810
There is only one option,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.671
I'll repeat to you, only one option

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:46.390
left to climatologists and scientists,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.318
and that is to do the unthinkable,

00:11:49.318 --> 00:11:52.054
and to use livestock,

00:11:52.054 --> 00:11:55.009
bunched and moving,

00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:58.398
as a proxy for former herds and predators,

00:11:58.398 --> 00:12:00.142
and mimic nature.

00:12:00.142 --> 00:12:04.646
There is no other alternative left to mankind.

00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:07.094
So let's do that.

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:10.464
So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.

00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:13.702
We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:16.526
and we've done so, and look at that.

00:12:16.526 --> 00:12:19.886
All of that grass is now covering the soil

00:12:19.886 --> 00:12:23.856
as dung, urine and litter or mulch,

00:12:23.856 --> 00:12:27.136
as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,

00:12:27.136 --> 00:12:31.497
and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,

00:12:31.497 --> 00:12:36.504
to store carbon, and to break down methane.

00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:38.734
And we did that,

00:12:38.734 --> 00:12:41.504
without using fire to damage the soil,

00:12:41.504 --> 00:12:44.640
and the plants are free to grow.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.904
When I first realized

00:12:46.904 --> 00:12:49.386
that we had no option as scientists

00:12:49.386 --> 00:12:52.146
but to use much-vilified livestock

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:57.393
to address climate change and desertification,

00:12:57.393 --> 00:12:59.628
I was faced with a real dilemma.

00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:01.353
How were we to do it?

00:13:01.353 --> 00:13:05.917
We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists

00:13:05.917 --> 00:13:07.865
bunching and moving their animals,

00:13:07.865 --> 00:13:11.532
but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.

00:13:11.532 --> 00:13:15.411
Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,

00:13:15.411 --> 00:13:18.670
and that had accelerated desertification,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.843
as we first discovered in Africa

00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:23.507
and then confirmed in the United States,

00:13:23.507 --> 00:13:25.626
and as you see in this picture

00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:28.987
of land managed by the federal government.

00:13:28.987 --> 00:13:30.888
Clearly more was needed

00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:32.977
than bunching and moving the animals,

00:13:32.977 --> 00:13:36.547
and humans, over thousands of years,

00:13:36.547 --> 00:13:40.933
had never been able to deal with nature's complexity.

00:13:40.933 --> 00:13:43.317
But we biologists and ecologists

00:13:43.317 --> 00:13:46.286
had never tackled anything as complex as this.

00:13:46.286 --> 00:13:48.925
So rather than reinvent the wheel,

00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:53.061
I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.

00:13:53.061 --> 00:13:55.533
And I found there were planning techniques

00:13:55.533 --> 00:13:59.305
that I could take and adapt to our biological need,

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:02.002
and from those I developed what we call

00:14:02.002 --> 00:14:05.312
holistic management and planned grazing,

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:07.111
a planning process,

00:14:07.111 --> 00:14:10.806
and that does address all of nature's complexity

00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:16.055
and our social, environmental, economic complexity.

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.719
Today, we have young women like this one

00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:21.087
teaching villages in Africa

00:14:21.087 --> 00:14:24.023
how to put their animals together into larger herds,

00:14:24.023 --> 00:14:26.727
plan their grazing to mimic nature,

00:14:26.727 --> 00:14:30.768
and where we have them hold their animals overnight --

00:14:30.768 --> 00:14:33.027
we run them in a predator-friendly manner,

00:14:33.027 --> 00:14:35.349
because we have a lot of lands, and so on --

00:14:35.349 --> 00:14:37.543
and where they do this and hold them overnight

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.348
to prepare the crop fields,

00:14:39.348 --> 00:14:43.332
we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.

00:14:43.332 --> 00:14:44.949
Let's look at some results.

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:49.173
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.

00:14:49.173 --> 00:14:52.717
It has just come through four months of very good rains

00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:56.227
it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.

00:14:56.227 --> 00:14:59.262
But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,

00:14:59.262 --> 00:15:02.369
has evaporated from the soil surface.

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:06.171
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended,

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:09.691
and we have 150,000 people

00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:13.441
on almost permanent food aid.

00:15:13.441 --> 00:15:17.937
Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day,

00:15:17.937 --> 00:15:20.777
with the same rainfall, and look at that.

00:15:20.777 --> 00:15:23.482
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean.

00:15:23.482 --> 00:15:25.969
It's fine.

00:15:25.969 --> 00:15:31.287
The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,

00:15:31.287 --> 00:15:34.143
everything is now more productive,

00:15:34.143 --> 00:15:38.248
and we have virtually no fear of dry years.

00:15:38.248 --> 00:15:43.743
And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats

00:15:43.743 --> 00:15:45.668
400 percent,

00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:48.798
planning the grazing to mimic nature

00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:51.219
and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,

00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:54.806
giraffe and other animals that we have.

00:15:54.806 --> 00:16:00.528
But before we began, our land looked like that.

00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:05.945
This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years

00:16:05.945 --> 00:16:08.714
regardless of what rain we got.

00:16:08.714 --> 00:16:12.332
Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change

00:16:12.332 --> 00:16:15.985
as we use livestock to mimic nature.

00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:17.447
This was another site

00:16:17.447 --> 00:16:19.825
where it had been bare and eroding,

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:22.529
and at the base of the marked small tree,

00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:26.817
we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?

00:16:26.817 --> 00:16:28.426
And again, watch the change

00:16:28.426 --> 00:16:31.276
just using livestock to mimic nature.

00:16:31.276 --> 00:16:33.407
And there are fallen trees in there now,

00:16:33.407 --> 00:16:38.364
because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:42.020
This land in Mexico was in terrible condition,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.974
and I've had to mark the hill

00:16:43.974 --> 00:16:48.161
because the change is so profound.

00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:53.886
(Applause)

00:16:55.721 --> 00:17:00.658
I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s

00:17:00.658 --> 00:17:03.626
turn the desert that you see on the right there

00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:05.560
back to grassland,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.082
and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land

00:17:09.082 --> 00:17:10.925
with hope for the future.

00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:13.722
And look at the amazing change in this one,

00:17:13.722 --> 00:17:16.434
where that gully has completely healed

00:17:16.434 --> 00:17:21.013
using nothing but livestock mimicking nature,

00:17:21.013 --> 00:17:25.238
and once more, we have the third generation of that family

00:17:25.238 --> 00:17:28.518
on that land with their flag still flying.

00:17:28.518 --> 00:17:31.086
The vast grasslands of Patagonia

00:17:31.086 --> 00:17:33.162
are turning to desert as you see here.

00:17:33.162 --> 00:17:36.222
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.866
and he has documented the steady decline of that land

00:17:39.866 --> 00:17:43.342
over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.

00:17:43.342 --> 00:17:48.190
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:52.139
really mimicking nature now with planned grazing,

00:17:52.139 --> 00:17:56.482
and they have documented a 50-percent increase

00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:59.950
in the production of the land in the first year.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.990
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.446
pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature

00:18:06.446 --> 00:18:09.942
and openly saying it is the only hope they have

00:18:09.942 --> 00:18:13.110
of saving their families and saving their culture.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.186
Ninety-five percent of that land

00:18:15.186 --> 00:18:18.846
can only feed people from animals.

00:18:18.846 --> 00:18:20.957
I remind you that I am talking about

00:18:20.957 --> 00:18:25.398
most of the world's land here that controls our fate,

00:18:25.398 --> 00:18:28.454
including the most violent region of the world,

00:18:28.454 --> 00:18:31.406
where only animals can feed people

00:18:31.406 --> 00:18:34.710
from about 95 percent of the land.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.844
What we are doing globally is causing climate change

00:18:39.844 --> 00:18:43.140
as much as, I believe, fossil fuels,

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.676
and maybe more than fossil fuels.

00:18:46.676 --> 00:18:50.351
But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,

00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:53.348
violence, social breakdown and war,

00:18:53.348 --> 00:18:55.756
and as I am talking to you,

00:18:55.756 --> 00:18:58.906
millions of men, women and children

00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:01.308
are suffering and dying.

00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:04.020
And if this continues,

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.814
we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:12.861
even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:17.097
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature

00:19:17.097 --> 00:19:19.553
at very low cost

00:19:19.553 --> 00:19:22.049
to reverse all this.

00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:24.481
We are already doing so

00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:28.477
on about 15 million hectares

00:19:28.477 --> 00:19:31.109
on five continents,

00:19:31.109 --> 00:19:32.736
and people who understand

00:19:32.736 --> 00:19:35.026
far more about carbon than I do

00:19:35.026 --> 00:19:38.084
calculate that, for illustrative purposes,

00:19:38.084 --> 00:19:40.878
if we do what I am showing you here,

00:19:40.878 --> 00:19:44.903
we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere

00:19:44.903 --> 00:19:48.237
and safely store it in the grassland soils

00:19:48.237 --> 00:19:49.863
for thousands of years,

00:19:49.863 --> 00:19:54.859
and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands

00:19:54.859 --> 00:19:56.213
that I've shown you,

00:19:56.213 --> 00:19:59.913
we can take us back to pre-industrial levels,

00:19:59.913 --> 00:20:01.554
while feeding people.

00:20:01.554 --> 00:20:04.326
I can think of almost nothing

00:20:04.326 --> 00:20:07.851
that offers more hope for our planet,

00:20:07.851 --> 00:20:10.099
for your children,

00:20:10.099 --> 00:20:12.755
and their children, and all of humanity.

00:20:12.755 --> 00:20:16.060
Thank you.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:24.172
(Applause)

00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:29.160
Thank you. (Applause)

00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:39.241
Thank you, Chris.

00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:42.587
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have,

00:20:42.587 --> 00:20:44.684
and I'm sure everyone here has,

00:20:44.684 --> 00:20:48.412
A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.

00:20:48.412 --> 00:20:50.171
I'm just going to ask you one quick question.

00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:53.855
When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,

00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:57.231
it's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?

00:20:57.231 --> 00:20:58.222
How do you start?

00:20:58.222 --> 00:20:59.861
Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,

00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:03.479
and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed

00:21:03.479 --> 00:21:05.248
is during mine reclamation,

00:21:05.248 --> 00:21:07.562
where it's 100 percent bare.

00:21:07.562 --> 00:21:11.918
But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,

00:21:11.918 --> 00:21:15.012
where I offered a £5 note

00:21:15.012 --> 00:21:17.031
in a hundred-mile drive

00:21:17.031 --> 00:21:19.151
if somebody could find one grass

00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:21.141
in a hundred-mile drive,

00:21:21.141 --> 00:21:23.927
and on that, we trebled the stocking rate,

00:21:23.927 --> 00:21:27.703
the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:30.359
just by the movement, mimicking nature,

00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:35.134
and using a sigmoid curve, that principle.

00:21:35.134 --> 00:21:37.605
It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.

00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:41.317
CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.

00:21:41.317 --> 00:21:43.309
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you

00:21:43.309 --> 00:21:45.941
and try and -- I want to get more on this

00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:48.893
that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful.

00:21:48.893 --> 00:21:52.429
CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk,

00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:55.205
and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way.

00:21:55.205 --> 00:21:58.197
Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.

00:21:58.197 --> 00:21:59.427
(Applause)
