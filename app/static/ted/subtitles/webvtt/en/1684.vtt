00:00:00.975 --> 00:00:04.011
The Kraken, a beast so terrifying

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:07.108
it was said to devour men and ships and whales,

00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:11.035
and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:13.291
In assessing the merits of such tales,

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.176
it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:19.799
that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.436
is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time,"

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:27.669
and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit." (Laughter)

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.447
Every fish that gets away

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:31.595
grows with every telling of the tale.

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:34.082
Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.111
and we now have video proof,

00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:40.733
as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.370
I was one of the three scientists on this expedition

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.566
that took place last summer off Japan.

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.062
I'm the short one.

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:52.120
The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.650
I owe my participation in this now-historic event

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.456
to TED.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.531
In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:03.265
held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos

00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:07.107
as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.

00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:09.896
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean,

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:14.673
one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:16.969
Mike deGruy was also invited,

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.524
and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,

00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:22.937
and he also talked to me about applying my approach

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.593
to something he's been involved with for a very long time,

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:29.027
which is the hunt for the giant squid.

00:01:29.027 --> 00:01:32.907
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit,

00:01:32.907 --> 00:01:37.032
a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:41.821
that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter)

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.237
I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.780
and optical luring of deep sea squid

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.557
in which I emphasized the importance

00:01:48.557 --> 00:01:53.807
of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.

00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:56.532
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made,

00:01:56.532 --> 00:01:58.858
farting around in the dark

00:01:58.858 --> 00:02:01.636
using these platforms,

00:02:01.636 --> 00:02:05.219
and my impression that I saw more animals

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.100
working from the submersible

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.020
than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.390
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.079
But I also felt like I saw more animals

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.930
working with the Tiburon than the Ventana,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.115
two vehicles with the same field of view

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:21.153
but different propulsion systems.

00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:25.184
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.

00:02:25.184 --> 00:02:27.440
So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.600
and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.032
and recorded the sound they made.

00:02:33.032 --> 00:02:34.669
The Johnson Sea-Link -- (whirring noise) --

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.264
which you can probably just barely hear here,

00:02:37.264 --> 00:02:40.864
uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.

00:02:40.864 --> 00:02:44.219
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:49.298
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)

00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:52.501
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics

00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:55.939
and they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise)

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.365
I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.

00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:01.858
So for the deep sea squid hunt,

00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:04.015
I proposed using an optical lure

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:06.175
attached to a camera platform

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:10.943
with no thrusters, no motors,

00:03:10.943 --> 00:03:13.552
just a battery-powered camera,

00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:16.572
and the only illumination coming from red light

00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:19.064
that's invisible to most deep-sea animals

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:21.756
that are adapted to see primarily blue.

00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:23.018
That's visible to our eye,

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:26.359
but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.200
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.329
could just be thrown off the back of the ship,

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.915
attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:40.994
it would just float around passively carried by the currents,

00:03:40.994 --> 00:03:45.391
and the only light visible to the animals in the deep

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:49.378
would be the blue light of the optical lure,

00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:53.158
which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:56.018
because it was designed to imitate

00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:58.274
the bioluminescent display

00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:01.619
of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:05.180
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.163
is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm

00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:10.441
and is a form of defense.

00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:13.622
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure

00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:16.525
is not because giant squid eat jellyfish,

00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:20.954
but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light

00:04:20.954 --> 00:04:23.331
when it's being chewed on by a predator

00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:26.010
and its only hope for escape

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.985
may be to attract the attention of a larger predator

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:31.047
that will attack its attacker

00:04:31.047 --> 00:04:33.590
and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.482
It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,

00:04:37.482 --> 00:04:40.890
and a common form of defense in the deep sea.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.003
The approach worked.

00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:46.514
Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner

00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:48.962
a single video glimpse of the giant,

00:04:48.962 --> 00:04:53.627
we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.

00:04:53.627 --> 00:05:06.845
Edith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:09.981
EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance --

00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:12.026
now you see me, now you don't --

00:05:12.026 --> 00:05:15.029
and we had four such teasing appearances,

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:20.438
and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.

00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:24.711
(Music) Narrator: (Speaking in Japanese)

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:34.553
Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:39.253
(Applause)

00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:44.107
EW: The full monty.

00:05:44.107 --> 00:05:45.452
What really wowed me about that

00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:47.626
was the way it came in up over the e-jelly

00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:49.946
and then attacked the enormous thing next to it,

00:05:49.946 --> 00:05:53.252
which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:55.671
But even more incredible was the footage shot

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:58.316
from the Triton submersible.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:01.100
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.546
was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,

00:06:04.546 --> 00:06:08.148
a one-meter long diamondback squid

00:06:08.148 --> 00:06:10.860
had a light attached to it, a squid jig

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.444
of the type that longline fishermen use,

00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:15.482
and I think it was this light

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:18.031
that brought the giant in.

00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:19.496
Now, what you're seeing

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:24.594
is the intensified camera's view under red light,

00:06:24.594 --> 00:06:28.716
and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:31.171
And then he got so excited,

00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:34.666
he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:36.850
and the giant didn't run away,

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.091
so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,

00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:42.627
bringing a creature of legend

00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:47.598
from the misty history into high-resolution video.

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:50.866
It was absolutely breathtaking,

00:06:50.866 --> 00:06:53.795
and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact

00:06:53.795 --> 00:06:55.260
and fully extended,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.512
it would have been as tall as a two-story house.

00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:01.171
How could something that big

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:05.771
live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?

00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:09.395
We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:12.531
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there,

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:17.153
fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution

00:07:17.153 --> 00:07:19.250
and possibly bioactive compounds

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.065
that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.

00:07:23.065 --> 00:07:26.113
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:29.482
of the money on ocean exploration

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.889
that we've spent on space exploration.

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.534
We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration,

00:07:35.534 --> 00:07:38.369
because we need to be exploring and protecting

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:40.961
our life support systems here on Earth.

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:47.193
We need — thank you. (Applause)

00:07:47.193 --> 00:07:50.047
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.

00:07:50.047 --> 00:07:53.018
Innovation drives economic growth.

00:07:53.018 --> 00:07:54.541
So let's all go exploring,

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:57.642
but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away,

00:07:57.642 --> 00:07:59.975
or, as Mike deGruy once said,

00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:01.761
"If you want to get away from it all

00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:03.375
and see something you've never seen,

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:06.960
or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.490
get in a sub."

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.696
He should have been with us for this adventure.

00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:12.503
We miss him.

00:08:12.503 --> 00:08:17.719
(Applause)
