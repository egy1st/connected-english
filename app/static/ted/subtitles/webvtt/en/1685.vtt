00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:03.664
I live in South Central.

00:00:03.664 --> 00:00:05.807
This is South Central:

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:08.677
liquor stores,

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:11.052
fast food,

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.396
vacant lots.

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.078
So the city planners, they get together and they figure

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:18.324
they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:21.492
so they change it to South Los Angeles,

00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:25.374
like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:29.084
This is South Los Angeles. (Laughter)

00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:31.252
Liquor stores,

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:33.564
fast food,

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:36.205
vacant lots.

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:39.676
Just like 26.5 million other Americans,

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:42.236
I live in a food desert,

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:44.300
South Central Los Angeles,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.501
home of the drive-thru and the drive-by.

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:53.940
Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.441
People are dying from curable diseases

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:59.276
in South Central Los Angeles.

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.877
For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood

00:01:01.877 --> 00:01:05.144
is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:08.744
which is probably eight, 10 miles away.

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:12.204
I got tired of seeing this happening.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.312
And I was wondering, how would you feel

00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:17.600
if you had no access to healthy food,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.480
if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.140
that the present food system has on your neighborhood?

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.808
I see wheelchairs bought and sold

00:01:26.808 --> 00:01:28.877
like used cars.

00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:32.901
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks.

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:36.296
And I figured, this has to stop.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:42.122
So I figured that the problem is the solution.

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:45.846
Food is the problem and food is the solution.

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:48.776
Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:52.984
to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides.

00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:57.536
So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.

00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:59.928
It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway.

00:01:59.928 --> 00:02:03.312
It's 150 feet by 10 feet.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:05.760
Thing is, it's owned by the city.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.336
But you have to maintain it.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:12.848
So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,

00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:16.691
since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."

00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:19.592
And this is how I decided to maintain it.

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:22.578
So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together

00:02:22.578 --> 00:02:24.930
and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.040
you know, the whole nine, vegetables.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.011
What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:34.850
where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.179
from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.011
and everything we do is free.

00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:42.113
And the garden, it was beautiful.

00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:44.563
And then somebody complained.

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:46.939
The city came down on me,

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.251
and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,

00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:53.879
which this citation was turning into a warrant.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.411
And I'm like, "Come on, really?

00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:59.155
A warrant for planting food on a piece of land

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:02.567
that you could care less about?" (Laughter)

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:04.907
And I was like, "Cool. Bring it."

00:03:04.907 --> 00:03:08.102
Because this time it wasn't coming up.

00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:13.114
So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it

00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:16.231
and talked to the councilman,

00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:17.827
and one of the Green Grounds members,

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:20.645
they put up a petition on Change.org,

00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:23.498
and with 900 signatures, we were a success.

00:03:23.498 --> 00:03:25.574
We had a victory on our hands.

00:03:25.574 --> 00:03:29.071
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse

00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:31.717
and love what we're doing.

00:03:31.717 --> 00:03:34.241
I mean, come on, why wouldn't they?

00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:39.086
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:44.444
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots.

00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:47.466
That's 20 Central Parks.

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:54.785
That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.

00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:59.738
Why in the hell would they not okay this?

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:03.853
Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds.

00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:06.562
When one dollar's worth of green beans

00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:10.120
will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.797
It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food.

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:16.938
Growing your own food is like printing your own money.

00:04:16.938 --> 00:04:23.938
(Applause)

00:04:23.938 --> 00:04:26.810
See, I have a legacy in South Central.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.539
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.802
And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality

00:04:35.802 --> 00:04:38.666
that was manufactured for me by some other people,

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:41.274
and I'm manufacturing my own reality.

00:04:41.274 --> 00:04:43.786
See, I'm an artist.

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:47.890
Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.466
Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:55.898
me, I beautify lawns, parkways.

00:04:55.898 --> 00:04:59.808
I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,

00:04:59.808 --> 00:05:02.003
and the plants and the trees,

00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:05.685
that's my embellishment for that cloth.

00:05:05.685 --> 00:05:11.726
You'd be surprised what the soil could do

00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:13.261
if you let it be your canvas.

00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.781
You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is

00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:19.789
and how it affects people.

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.461
So what happened?

00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:27.532
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,

00:05:27.532 --> 00:05:30.558
a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.

00:05:30.558 --> 00:05:35.439
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.979
We are the soil.

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.522
You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.

00:05:45.522 --> 00:05:49.756
Gardening is the most therapeutic

00:05:49.756 --> 00:05:52.700
and defiant act you can do,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.192
especially in the inner city.

00:05:55.192 --> 00:05:57.936
Plus you get strawberries.

00:05:57.936 --> 00:06:01.394
(Laughter)

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:03.772
I remember this time,

00:06:03.772 --> 00:06:06.081
there was this mother and a daughter came,

00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:09.548
it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,

00:06:09.548 --> 00:06:13.012
and I came out and they looked so ashamed.

00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:16.700
So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.436
and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.

00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:21.447
This is on the street for a reason.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:24.938
It made me feel ashamed to see people

00:06:24.938 --> 00:06:27.521
that were this close to me that were hungry,

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:30.660
and this only reinforced why I do this,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.629
and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:35.116
people are going to steal your food?"

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:37.317
And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.

00:06:37.317 --> 00:06:39.910
That's why it's on the street.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.620
That's the whole idea.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.415
I want them to take it, but at the same time,

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:48.418
I want them to take back their health."

00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:50.961
There's another time when I put

00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:56.404
a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.

00:06:56.404 --> 00:06:59.355
These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck.

00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:01.980
It was cool, and they just shared the stories

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.836
about how this affected them and how

00:07:04.836 --> 00:07:07.628
they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,

00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:11.054
and it was just cool to see how this changed them,

00:07:11.054 --> 00:07:16.759
if it was only for that one moment.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:19.622
So Green Grounds has gone on to plant

00:07:19.622 --> 00:07:21.373
maybe 20 gardens.

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:25.638
We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins

00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:28.403
and participate, and it's all volunteers.

00:07:28.403 --> 00:07:32.030
If kids grow kale, kids eat kale.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.294
(Laughter)

00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:38.270
If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. (Applause)

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.604
But when none of this is presented to them,

00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:45.230
if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.774
they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them.

00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:51.679
I see young people

00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:54.790
and they want to work,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.911
but they're in this thing where they're caught up --

00:07:56.911 --> 00:08:00.518
I see kids of color and they're just on this track

00:08:00.518 --> 00:08:03.453
that's designed for them,

00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:05.486
that leads them to nowhere.

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:08.161
So with gardening, I see an opportunity

00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:10.307
where we can train these kids

00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:13.304
to take over their communities,

00:08:13.304 --> 00:08:17.148
to have a sustainable life.

00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:19.267
And when we do this, who knows?

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:22.491
We might produce the next George Washington Carver.

00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:24.776
but if we don't change the composition of the soil,

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:26.385
we will never do this.

00:08:26.385 --> 00:08:29.327
Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do.

00:08:29.327 --> 00:08:33.327
I want to plant a whole block of gardens

00:08:33.327 --> 00:08:36.715
where people can share in the food in the same block.

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:38.976
I want to take shipping containers

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:41.672
and turn them into healthy cafes.

00:08:41.672 --> 00:08:44.064
Now don't get me wrong.

00:08:44.064 --> 00:08:46.342
I'm not talking about no free shit,

00:08:46.342 --> 00:08:49.695
because free is not sustainable.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.600
The funny thing about sustainability,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.357
you have to sustain it.

00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:57.514
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:57.514 --> 00:08:59.752
What I'm talking about is putting people to work,

00:08:59.752 --> 00:09:02.855
and getting kids off the street, and letting them know

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:07.807
the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,

00:09:07.807 --> 00:09:10.145
opening farmer's markets.

00:09:10.145 --> 00:09:12.238
So what I want to do here,

00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:14.944
we gotta make this sexy.

00:09:14.944 --> 00:09:19.184
So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.903
gangstas, gangsta gardeners.

00:09:20.903 --> 00:09:25.239
We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is.

00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:27.092
If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta.

00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:31.512
Get gangsta with your shovel, okay?

00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:34.696
And let that be your weapon of choice.

00:09:34.696 --> 00:09:41.640
(Applause)

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.263
So basically, if you want to meet with me,

00:09:47.263 --> 00:09:50.396
you know, if you want to meet,

00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:54.193
don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs

00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:57.999
and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit --

00:09:57.999 --> 00:10:01.227
where you talk about doing some shit.

00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:04.381
If you want to meet with me, come to the garden

00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:07.661
with your shovel so we can plant some shit.

00:10:07.661 --> 00:10:10.845
Peace. Thank you.

00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:14.989
(Applause)

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:18.989
Thank you. (Applause)
