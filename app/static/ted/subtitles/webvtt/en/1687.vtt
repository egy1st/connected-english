WEBVTT

00:00:06.146 --> 00:00:07.821
There's so many of you.

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:09.433
(Laughter)

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.272
When I was a kid,

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:17.780
I hid my heart under the bed,
because my mother said,

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.669
"If you're not careful,
someday someone's going to break it."

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.478
Take it from me: Under the bed
is not a good hiding spot.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.433
I know because I've been
shot down so many times,

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:30.364
I get altitude sickness
just from standing up for myself.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.956
But that's what we were told.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.882
"Stand up for yourself."

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:38.612
And that's hard to do
if you don't know who you are.

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:42.376
We were expected to define ourselves
at such an early age,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.138
and if we didn't do it,
others did it for us.

00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:47.203
Geek. Fatty.

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:48.972
Slut. Fag.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.627
And at the same time we were
being told what we were,

00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:54.976
we were being asked,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.508
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:00.055
I always thought
that was an unfair question.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.024
It presupposes that we can't be
what we already are.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.595
We were kids.

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:07.339
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:10.534
I wanted a registered
retirement savings plan

00:01:10.558 --> 00:01:13.677
that would keep me in candy
long enough to make old age sweet.

00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:14.882
(Laughter)

00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:16.922
When I was a kid, I wanted to shave.

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.184
Now, not so much.

00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:20.635
(Laughter)

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:24.487
When I was eight,
I wanted to be a marine biologist.

00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:26.416
When I was nine, I saw the movie "Jaws,"

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.353
and thought to myself, "No, thank you."

00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:29.590
(Laughter)

00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:31.044
And when I was 10,

00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:33.901
I was told that my parents left
because they didn't want me.

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:35.886
When I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.259
When I was 12, I wanted to die.
When I was 13, I wanted to kill a kid.

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:42.696
When I was 14, I was asked
to seriously consider a career path.

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:45.021
I said, "I'd like to be a writer."

00:01:45.783 --> 00:01:48.044
And they said,
"Choose something realistic."

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.873
So I said, "Professional wrestler."

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.793
And they said, "Don't be stupid."

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.175
See, they asked me what I wanted to be,

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:58.937
then told me what not to be.

00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:01.135
And I wasn't the only one.

00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:04.037
We were being told
that we somehow must become

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.024
what we are not, sacrificing what we are

00:02:06.048 --> 00:02:08.436
to inherit the masquerade
of what we will be.

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:12.747
I was being told to accept the identity
that others will give me.

00:02:13.588 --> 00:02:16.692
And I wondered, what made
my dreams so easy to dismiss?

00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:21.004
Granted, my dreams are shy,

00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:22.305
because they're Canadian.

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:25.218
(Laughter)

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.885
My dreams are self-conscious
and overly apologetic.

00:02:29.258 --> 00:02:31.544
They're standing alone
at the high school dance,

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.020
and they've never been kissed.

00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:36.370
See, my dreams got called names too.

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:39.054
Silly. Foolish.

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:40.770
Impossible.

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:42.057
But I kept dreaming.

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:45.140
I was going to be a wrestler.
I had it all figured out.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.784
I was going to be The Garbage Man.

00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:47.809
(Laughter)

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:51.262
My finishing move was going
to be The Trash Compactor.

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:54.404
My saying was going to be,
"I'm taking out the trash!"

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:57.264
(Laughter)

00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:01.040
(Applause)

00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:05.812
And then this guy,
Duke "The Dumpster" Droese,

00:03:05.836 --> 00:03:07.556
stole my entire shtick.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.147
(Laughter)

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:11.273
I was crushed,

00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:13.122
as if by a trash compactor.

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:15.361
(Laughter)

00:03:15.668 --> 00:03:18.192
I thought to myself,
"What now? Where do I turn?"

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.652
Poetry.

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:22.054
(Laughter)

00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:25.056
Like a boomerang,
the thing I loved came back to me.

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:28.239
One of the first lines of poetry
I can remember writing

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:30.883
was in response to a world
that demanded I hate myself.

00:03:30.907 --> 00:03:33.303
From age 15 to 18, I hated myself

00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:36.127
for becoming the thing that I loathed:

00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:37.324
a bully.

00:03:37.728 --> 00:03:40.492
When I was 19, I wrote,

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:43.041
"I will love myself
despite the ease with which

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:44.889
I lean toward the opposite."

00:03:46.183 --> 00:03:49.389
Standing up for yourself
doesn't have to mean

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:51.016
embracing violence.

00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:53.715
When I was a kid,

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.446
I traded in homework
assignments for friendship,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.469
then gave each friend a late slip
for never showing up on time,

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:01.119
and in most cases, not at all.

00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:04.253
I gave myself a hall pass
to get through each broken promise.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.604
And I remember this plan,
born out of frustration

00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:08.823
from a kid who kept calling me "Yogi,"

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.849
then pointed at my tummy and said,
"Too many picnic baskets."

00:04:12.588 --> 00:04:15.010
Turns out it's not that hard
to trick someone,

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:16.606
and one day before class, I said,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.675
"Yeah, you can copy my homework,"

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.650
and I gave him all the wrong answers
that I'd written down the night before.

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:25.180
He got his paper back
expecting a near-perfect score,

00:04:25.204 --> 00:04:29.015
and couldn't believe it when he looked
across the room at me and held up a zero.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.085
I knew I didn't have to hold up
my paper of 28 out of 30,

00:04:32.109 --> 00:04:35.117
but my satisfaction was complete
when he looked at me, puzzled,

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.599
and I thought to myself, "Smarter
than the average bear, motherfucker."

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:40.405
(Laughter)

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:46.659
(Applause)

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:48.472
This is who I am.

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:51.943
This is how I stand up for myself.

00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:55.533
When I was a kid,

00:04:55.557 --> 00:04:59.469
I used to think that pork chops
and karate chops were the same thing.

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:02.208
I thought they were both pork chops.

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:04.369
My grandmother thought it was cute,

00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:07.203
and because they were my favorite,
she let me keep doing it.

00:05:07.227 --> 00:05:08.680
Not really a big deal.

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:12.463
One day, before I realized fat kids
are not designed to climb trees,

00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:15.641
I fell out of a tree
and bruised the right side of my body.

00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:17.717
I didn't want to tell my grandmother

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:19.611
because I was scared I'd get in trouble

00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:21.742
for playing somewhere
I shouldn't have been.

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:25.396
The gym teacher noticed the bruise,
and I got sent to the principal's office.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.699
From there, I was sent to another
small room with a really nice lady

00:05:28.723 --> 00:05:31.572
who asked me all kinds of questions
about my life at home.

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:34.191
I saw no reason to lie.

00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:36.992
As far as I was concerned,
life was pretty good.

00:05:37.492 --> 00:05:40.934
I told her, whenever I'm sad,
my grandmother gives me karate chops.

00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:47.921
(Laughter)

00:05:48.902 --> 00:05:52.713
This led to a full-scale investigation,

00:05:52.737 --> 00:05:55.639
and I was removed
from the house for three days,

00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:58.524
until they finally decided
to ask how I got the bruises.

00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:02.345
News of this silly little story
quickly spread through the school,

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:04.008
and I earned my first nickname:

00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:05.995
Porkchop.

00:06:06.896 --> 00:06:09.255
To this day,

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.181
I hate pork chops.

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:16.180
I'm not the only kid who grew up this way,

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:18.902
surrounded by people
who used to say that rhyme

00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:21.338
about sticks and stones,

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:24.106
as if broken bones hurt more
than the names we got called,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.617
and we got called them all.

00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:29.626
So we grew up believing
no one would ever fall in love with us,

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.955
that we'd be lonely forever,

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.691
that we'd never meet someone
to make us feel like the sun

00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:37.073
was something they built
for us in their toolshed.

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:38.922
So broken heartstrings bled the blues,

00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:41.456
and we tried to empty ourselves
so we'd feel nothing.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.835
Don't tell me that hurts
less than a broken bone,

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:46.492
that an ingrown life
is something surgeons can cut away,

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:49.139
that there's no way
for it to metastasize; it does.

00:06:49.163 --> 00:06:50.865
She was eight years old,

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.707
our first day of grade three
when she got called ugly.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.089
We both got moved to the back of class

00:06:56.113 --> 00:06:59.071
so we would stop
getting bombarded by spitballs.

00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:01.066
But the school halls were a battleground.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.619
We found ourselves outnumbered
day after wretched day.

00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:06.666
We used to stay inside for recess,
because outside was worse.

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:09.088
Outside, we'd have
to rehearse running away,

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:12.505
or learn to stay still like statues,
giving no clues that we were there.

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:15.316
In grade five, they taped
a sign to the front of her desk

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.010
that read, "Beware of dog."

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.589
To this day,

00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:23.186
despite a loving husband,
she doesn't think she's beautiful,

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.594
because of a birthmark that takes up
a little less than half her face.

00:07:26.618 --> 00:07:28.857
Kids used to say,
"She looks like a wrong answer

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:32.041
that someone tried to erase,
but couldn't quite get the job done."

00:07:32.065 --> 00:07:35.002
And they'll never understand
that she's raising two kids

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:39.137
whose definition of beauty
begins with the word "Mom,"

00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:41.615
because they see her heart
before they see her skin,

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.735
because she's only ever
always been amazing.

00:07:44.678 --> 00:07:48.678
He was a broken branch grafted
onto a different family tree,

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:50.591
adopted,

00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:53.545
not because his parents opted
for a different destiny.

00:07:54.465 --> 00:07:56.418
He was three when he became a mixed drink

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:59.735
of one part left alone
and two parts tragedy,

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:01.917
started therapy in eighth grade,

00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:04.745
had a personality
made up of tests and pills,

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:08.537
lived like the uphills were mountains
and the downhills were cliffs,

00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:11.945
four-fifths suicidal,
a tidal wave of antidepressants,

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:14.855
and an adolescent being called "Popper,"

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:16.951
one part because of the pills,

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:19.055
99 parts because of the cruelty.

00:08:19.713 --> 00:08:22.253
He tried to kill himself in grade 10

00:08:22.277 --> 00:08:24.896
when a kid who could still
go home to Mom and Dad

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.720
had the audacity to tell him,
"Get over it."

00:08:28.323 --> 00:08:30.768
As if depression is something
that could be remedied

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:33.434
by any of the contents
found in a first-aid kit.

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:37.034
To this day, he is a stick of TNT
lit from both ends,

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.561
could describe to you in detail
the way the sky bends

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.514
in the moment before it's about to fall,

00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:44.506
and despite an army of friends
who all call him an inspiration,

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.827
he remains a conversation piece
between people who can't understand

00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:50.856
sometimes being drug-free
has less to do with addiction

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.082
and more to do with sanity.

00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:56.424
We weren't the only kids
who grew up this way.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.801
To this day, kids are still
being called names.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.343
The classics were
"Hey, stupid," "Hey, spaz."

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:08.565
Seems like every school
has an arsenal of names

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:10.203
getting updated every year.

00:09:10.787 --> 00:09:13.930
And if a kid breaks in a school
and no one around chooses to hear,

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:15.304
do they make a sound?

00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:18.469
Are they just background noise
from a soundtrack stuck on repeat,

00:09:18.493 --> 00:09:21.709
when people say things like,
"Kids can be cruel."

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:25.753
Every school was a big top circus tent,

00:09:25.777 --> 00:09:28.592
and the pecking order
went from acrobats to lion tamers,

00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:31.965
from clowns to carnies,
all of these miles ahead of who we were.

00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:33.411
We were freaks --

00:09:33.435 --> 00:09:36.032
lobster-claw boys and bearded ladies,

00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:38.142
oddities juggling
depression and loneliness,

00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:39.895
playing solitaire, spin the bottle,

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:42.539
trying to kiss the wounded
parts of ourselves and heal,

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:45.160
but at night, while the others slept,

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:46.866
we kept walking the tightrope.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.064
It was practice, and yes, some of us fell.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.641
But I want to tell them that all of this

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:56.680
is just debris

00:09:56.704 --> 00:10:01.408
left over when we finally decide to smash
all the things we thought we used to be,

00:10:01.432 --> 00:10:05.352
and if you can't see anything
beautiful about yourself,

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:10.059
get a better mirror, look
a little closer, stare a little longer,

00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:13.000
because there's something inside you
that made you keep trying

00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:14.924
despite everyone who told you to quit.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.991
You built a cast around your broken heart

00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:19.056
and signed it yourself, "They were wrong."

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.683
Because maybe you didn't belong
to a group or a clique.

00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:24.764
Maybe they decided to pick you last
for basketball or everything.

00:10:24.788 --> 00:10:28.648
Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken
teeth to show-and-tell, but never told,

00:10:28.672 --> 00:10:30.395
because how can you hold your ground

00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:32.850
if everyone around you
wants to bury you beneath it?

00:10:32.874 --> 00:10:34.833
You have to believe that they were wrong.

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:37.879
They have to be wrong.

00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:41.364
Why else would we still be here?

00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:45.089
We grew up learning
to cheer on the underdog

00:10:45.113 --> 00:10:46.931
because we see ourselves in them.

00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:49.975
We stem from a root planted in the belief

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:51.946
that we are not what we were called.

00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:57.013
We are not abandoned cars stalled out
and sitting empty on some highway,

00:10:57.037 --> 00:10:58.932
and if in some way we are, don't worry.

00:10:58.956 --> 00:11:00.949
We only got out to walk and get gas.

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:04.252
We are graduating members
from the class of We Made It,

00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:06.276
not the faded echoes of voices crying out,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.056
"Names will never hurt me."

00:11:11.014 --> 00:11:13.879
Of course they did.

00:11:15.586 --> 00:11:19.204
But our lives will only ever always
continue to be a balancing act

00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:22.283
that has less to do with pain

00:11:23.593 --> 00:11:24.968
and more to do with beauty.

00:11:27.403 --> 00:11:34.403
(Applause)
