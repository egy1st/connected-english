WEBVTT

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.858
So raise your hand if you know someone

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:06.505
in your immediate family or circle of friends

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:09.993
who suffers from some form of mental illness.

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:12.777
Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised.

00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:15.072
And raise your hand if you think that

00:00:15.072 --> 00:00:17.897
basic research on fruit flies has anything to do

00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:22.359
with understanding mental illness in humans.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.152
Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised.

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:28.472
I can see I've got my work cut out for me here.

00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:31.060
As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.273
psychiatric disorders like autism, depression and schizophrenia

00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:38.148
take a terrible toll on human suffering.

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:41.361
We know much less about their treatment

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.967
and the understanding of their basic mechanisms

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:46.586
than we do about diseases of the body.

00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:49.229
Think about it: In 2013,

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.184
the second decade of the millennium,

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.549
if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.068
and you go to your doctor, you get bone scans,

00:00:56.068 --> 00:00:58.996
biopsies and blood tests.

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:02.861
In 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis,

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:04.824
you go to your doctor, and what do you get?

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:06.811
A questionnaire.

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:09.240
Now, part of the reason for this is that we have

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.063
an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view

00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:16.950
of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.193
We tend to view them --

00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:21.038
and the popular press aids and abets this view --

00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:24.054
as chemical imbalances in the brain,

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:27.738
as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup

00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:31.938
full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:34.265
This view is conditioned by the fact

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.671
that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders,

00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:42.342
like Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry,

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:46.318
as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.

00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:48.219
But that can't be the answer,

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.456
because these drugs actually don't work all that well.

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:54.632
A lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them,

00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:57.289
because of their unpleasant side effects.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.349
These drugs have so many side effects

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.305
because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:05.994
is a bit like trying to change your engine oil

00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:10.107
by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:12.257
Some of it will dribble into the right place,

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.358
but a lot of it will do more harm than good.

00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:17.596
Now, an emerging view

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:20.546
that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:23.116
is that psychiatric disorders are actually

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:26.590
disturbances of neural circuits that mediate

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.109
emotion, mood and affect.

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.871
When we think about cognition,

00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:35.447
we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem.

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:38.028
Well it turns out that the computer analogy

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:40.411
is just as valid for emotion.

00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.197
It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.

00:02:43.197 --> 00:02:46.480
But we know much less about the circuit basis

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.379
of psychiatric disorders

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.449
because of the overwhelming dominance

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.801
of this chemical imbalance hypothesis.

00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:57.628
Now, it's not that chemicals are not important

00:02:57.628 --> 00:02:59.165
in psychiatric disorders.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:03.137
It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.

00:03:03.137 --> 00:03:06.786
Rather, they're released in very specific locations

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.511
and they act on specific synapses

00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:13.199
to change the flow of information in the brain.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.636
So if we ever really want to understand

00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:18.341
the biological basis of psychiatric disorders,

00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.373
we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:23.107
where these chemicals act.

00:03:23.107 --> 00:03:26.586
Otherwise, we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:29.543
and suffering the consequences.

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.602
Now to begin to overcome our ignorance

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:36.136
of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:38.816
it's helpful to work on what we biologists call

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.395
"model organisms,"

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:43.729
animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.154
in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:50.779
to molecularly identify and pinpoint

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:52.342
specific classes of neurons,

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:55.245
as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:57.706
Moreover, once we can do that,

00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:00.455
we can actually activate specific neurons

00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:04.666
or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:07.380
So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.845
and we find that a behavior is blocked,

00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:12.059
we can conclude that those neurons

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.023
are necessary for that behavior.

00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:17.405
On the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:20.219
and we find that that produces the behavior,

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:24.293
we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:27.302
So in this way, by doing this kind of test,

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:30.825
we can draw cause and effect relationships

00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:33.181
between the activity of specific neurons

00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:36.094
in particular circuits and particular behaviors,

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:38.531
something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,

00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:43.582
to do right now in humans.

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:46.419
But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is --

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.619
it's a great model organism

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.157
because it's got a small brain,

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:54.944
it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors,

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:58.094
it breeds quickly, and it's cheap.

00:04:58.094 --> 00:04:59.889
But can an organism like this

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.732
teach us anything about emotion-like states?

00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:07.032
Do these organisms even have emotion-like states,

00:05:07.032 --> 00:05:10.395
or are they just little digital robots?

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:13.595
Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion

00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:16.145
and express them in their behaviors, as he wrote

00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:21.338
in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals.

00:05:21.338 --> 00:05:24.857
And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.271
Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila

00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:31.794
here at CalTech in the '60s as a model organism

00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:35.391
to study the connection between genes and behavior.

00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:38.998
Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.

00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:43.432
He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,

00:05:43.432 --> 00:05:45.820
and Seymour taught me both to love flies

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.869
and also to play with science.

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:51.985
So how do we ask this question?

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:56.045
It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,

00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:59.208
but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:03.158
Now, in humans we often infer emotional states,

00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:07.063
as you'll hear later today, from facial expressions.

00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:10.783
However, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.

00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:14.096
(Laughter)

00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:17.233
It's kind of like landing on Mars

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:19.938
and looking out the window of your spaceship

00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:22.408
at all the little green men who are surrounding it

00:06:22.408 --> 00:06:24.814
and trying to figure out, "How do I find out

00:06:24.814 --> 00:06:27.169
if they have emotions or not?"

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.712
What can we do? It's not so easy.

00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:32.897
Well, one of the ways that we can start

00:06:32.897 --> 00:06:37.022
is to try to come up with some general characteristics

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:40.770
or properties of emotion-like states

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.234
such as arousal, and see if we can identify

00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:49.610
any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.430
So three important ones that I can think of

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.102
are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.

00:06:57.102 --> 00:06:59.436
Persistence means long-lasting.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:03.397
We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion

00:07:03.397 --> 00:07:08.413
causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone.

00:07:08.413 --> 00:07:11.503
Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like.

00:07:11.503 --> 00:07:16.086
You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.

00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:18.686
If you're a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth

00:07:18.686 --> 00:07:20.373
turn down and you sniffle,

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:23.511
and if you're very unhappy, tears pour down your face

00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:25.343
and you might sob.

00:07:25.343 --> 00:07:29.722
Valence means good or bad, positive or negative.

00:07:29.722 --> 00:07:34.174
So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:36.625
the kind of behavior that you see

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:39.435
by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table,

00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:42.120
you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.649
the more vigorously you try to swat it away,

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:46.933
and it seems to keep getting irritated.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:50.580
So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.925
in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies

00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:57.701
in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench

00:07:57.701 --> 00:07:59.426
and blow them away.

00:07:59.426 --> 00:08:02.665
And what we found is that if we gave these flies

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:05.513
in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,

00:08:05.513 --> 00:08:08.202
they became somewhat hyperactive

00:08:08.202 --> 00:08:12.637
and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped

00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:15.501
and took a while to calm down.

00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:17.690
So we quantified this behavior

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.702
using custom locomotor tracking software

00:08:20.702 --> 00:08:23.502
developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona,

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:27.114
who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.

00:08:27.114 --> 00:08:29.928
And what this quantification showed us is that,

00:08:29.928 --> 00:08:33.152
upon experiencing a train of these air puffs,

00:08:33.152 --> 00:08:37.466
the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:40.064
which is persistent, long-lasting,

00:08:40.064 --> 00:08:42.568
and also appears to be graded.

00:08:42.568 --> 00:08:45.427
More puffs, or more intense puffs,

00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:49.340
make the state last for a longer period of time.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.376
So now we wanted to try to understand something

00:08:51.376 --> 00:08:55.090
about what controls the duration of this state.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.941
So we decided to use our puff-o-mat

00:08:57.941 --> 00:08:59.996
and our automated tracking software

00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:03.778
to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies

00:09:03.778 --> 00:09:08.857
to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.

00:09:08.857 --> 00:09:11.204
And this is one of the great things about fruit flies.

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:13.997
There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone

00:09:13.997 --> 00:09:17.638
and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants

00:09:17.638 --> 00:09:19.810
and screen them in your assay and then find out

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.129
what gene is affected in the mutation.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:26.641
So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant

00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:30.115
that took much longer than normal to calm down

00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:32.392
after the air puffs,

00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:36.342
and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:39.947
it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:42.958
That's right -- flies, like people, have dopamine,

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.730
and it acts on their brains and on their synapses

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.280
through the same dopamine receptor molecules

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.669
that you and I have.

00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:54.155
Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,

00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:57.268
including in attention, arousal, reward,

00:09:57.268 --> 00:10:00.681
and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked

00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:03.781
to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,

00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:08.015
Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.

00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:10.805
Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.

00:10:10.805 --> 00:10:14.065
We tend to infer the normal function of something

00:10:14.065 --> 00:10:17.775
by what doesn't happen when we take it away,

00:10:17.775 --> 00:10:20.778
by the opposite of what we see when we take it away.

00:10:20.778 --> 00:10:23.791
So when we take away the dopamine receptor

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.348
and the flies take longer to calm down,

00:10:26.348 --> 00:10:30.194
from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine

00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:34.679
is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:37.629
And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:41.604
which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.

00:10:41.604 --> 00:10:46.210
Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.920
by feeding them cocaine

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.892
after getting the appropriate DEA license

00:10:50.892 --> 00:10:54.892
— oh my God -- (Laughter) —

00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:58.064
we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies

00:10:58.064 --> 00:11:01.106
calm down faster than normal flies do,

00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:04.305
and that's also reminiscent of ADHD,

00:11:04.305 --> 00:11:06.350
which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.369
that act similarly to cocaine.

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:12.518
So slowly I began to realize that what started out

00:11:12.518 --> 00:11:16.167
as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies

00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:20.143
might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder.

00:11:20.143 --> 00:11:22.369
Now, how far does this analogy go?

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:25.491
As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD

00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:27.828
also have learning disabilities.

00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:31.394
Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?

00:11:31.394 --> 00:11:34.114
Remarkably, the answer is yes.

00:11:34.114 --> 00:11:36.742
As Seymour showed back in the 1970s,

00:11:36.742 --> 00:11:39.193
flies, like songbirds, as you just heard,

00:11:39.193 --> 00:11:40.926
are capable of learning.

00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:45.369
You can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue,

00:11:45.369 --> 00:11:47.757
if you pair that odor with a shock.

00:11:47.757 --> 00:11:51.141
Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose

00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:54.295
between a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor,

00:11:54.295 --> 00:11:58.495
it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock.

00:11:58.495 --> 00:12:01.997
Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,

00:12:01.997 --> 00:12:04.462
they don't learn. Their learning score is zero.

00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:08.273
They flunk out of CalTech.

00:12:08.273 --> 00:12:13.021
So that means that these flies have two abnormalities,

00:12:13.021 --> 00:12:16.071
or phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:21.583
that one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:25.946
Now what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:29.859
In ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity

00:12:29.859 --> 00:12:31.765
causes the learning disability.

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:35.484
The kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn.

00:12:35.484 --> 00:12:38.780
But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.652
that cause the hyperactivity.

00:12:40.652 --> 00:12:45.122
Because the kids can't learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.

00:12:45.122 --> 00:12:48.179
And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:50.583
between learning disabilities and hyperactivity,

00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:55.498
but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD.

00:12:55.498 --> 00:12:57.840
Now people have been wondering about this for a long time

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.328
in humans, but in flies we can actually test this.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:04.412
And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind

00:13:04.412 --> 00:13:08.678
of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.

00:13:08.678 --> 00:13:11.140
We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.704
and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor

00:13:15.704 --> 00:13:18.939
by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:20.990
back into the fly brain.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.825
But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons

00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:28.539
and not in others, and then we test each of these flies

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:32.207
for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.

00:13:32.207 --> 00:13:37.025
Remarkably, we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.688
If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back

00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:42.649
in this elliptical structure called the central complex,

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:46.726
the flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can't learn.

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:49.452
On the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure

00:13:49.452 --> 00:13:50.970
called the mushroom body,

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.055
the learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well,

00:13:54.055 --> 00:13:55.885
but they're still hyperactive.

00:13:55.885 --> 00:13:58.135
What that tells us is that dopamine

00:13:58.135 --> 00:14:01.527
is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup.

00:14:01.527 --> 00:14:04.689
Rather, it's acting to control two different functions

00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:06.323
on two different circuits,

00:14:06.323 --> 00:14:10.227
so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies

00:14:10.227 --> 00:14:14.402
is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions

00:14:14.402 --> 00:14:17.265
in two different regions of the brain.

00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:20.327
Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:22.703
we don't know, but these kinds of results

00:14:22.703 --> 00:14:26.180
should at least cause us to consider that possibility.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.153
So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever

00:14:30.153 --> 00:14:33.565
that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,

00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:37.092
and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders

00:14:37.092 --> 00:14:39.803
just by changing the flavor of the soup.

00:14:39.803 --> 00:14:44.020
What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.728
to try to design a new generation of treatments

00:14:46.728 --> 00:14:51.016
that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:54.354
that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders.

00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:57.554
If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders

00:14:57.554 --> 00:14:59.601
without the unpleasant side effects,

00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:02.347
putting the oil back in our mental engines,

00:15:02.347 --> 00:15:05.531
just where it's needed. Thank you very much.
