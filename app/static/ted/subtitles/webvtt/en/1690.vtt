00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.012
Now, extinction is a different kind of death.

00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:08.635
It's bigger.

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:11.715
We didn't really realize that until 1914,

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:14.930
when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.948
died at the Cincinnati zoo.

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:21.489
This had been the most abundant bird in the world

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.096
that'd been in North America for six million years.

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.401
Suddenly it wasn't here at all.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:32.478
Flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long

00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:35.125
used to darken the sun.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:38.195
Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm,

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:41.000
a feathered tempest.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.444
And indeed it was a keystone species

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:47.460
that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.744
from the Mississippi to the Atlantic,

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:53.059
from Canada down to the Gulf.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.372
But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades.

00:00:56.372 --> 00:00:57.572
What happened?

00:00:57.572 --> 00:00:59.725
Well, commercial hunting happened.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.684
These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton,

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:06.004
and it was easy to do because when those big flocks

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.276
came down to the ground, they were so dense

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.644
that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up

00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:13.650
and slaughter them by the tens of thousands.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.668
It was the cheapest source of protein in America.

00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:18.643
By the end of the century, there was nothing left

00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:23.483
but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.358
There's an upside to the story.

00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:27.272
This made people realize that the same thing

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:29.764
was about to happen to the American bison,

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:33.169
and so these birds saved the buffalos.

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:34.843
But a lot of other animals weren't saved.

00:01:34.843 --> 00:01:39.634
The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:41.980
It was hunted to death for its feathers.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.082
There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen.

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:48.091
It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway.

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:51.465
A local newspaper spelled out, "There is no survivor,

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:56.282
there is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again."

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.953
There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things,

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:01.378
and it happened to lots of birds that people loved.

00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:03.586
It happened to lots of mammals.

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:06.209
Another keystone species is a famous animal

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.274
called the European aurochs.

00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:10.729
There was sort of a movie made about it recently.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.337
And the aurochs was like the bison.

00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:16.517
This was an animal that basically kept the forest

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:21.569
mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent,

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.913
from Spain to Korea.

00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:26.041
The documentation of this animal goes back

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.266
to the Lascaux cave paintings.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:31.458
The extinctions still go on.

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:34.487
There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.833
It went extinct in 2000.

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.590
There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.321
called the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia,

00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:45.391
called the Tasmanian tiger.

00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:49.709
It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.745
A little bit of film was shot.

00:03:03.593 --> 00:03:08.850
Sorrow, anger, mourning.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.006
Don't mourn. Organize.

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:15.625
What if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens,

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.622
fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old

00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:21.060
could be used to bring species back,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.684
what would you do? Where would you start?

00:03:22.684 --> 00:03:25.598
Well, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there.

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:27.690
I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.824
who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct,

00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:34.873
and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church,

00:03:34.873 --> 00:03:37.568
one of the leading genetic engineers

00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:40.577
who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:42.188
and a lot of confidence

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:44.500
that methodologies he was working on

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.589
might actually do the deed.

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.844
So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting

00:03:49.844 --> 00:03:52.108
at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together

00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:56.719
specialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists,

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.832
and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced

00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:04.123
by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.

00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:07.002
All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian

00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:09.657
was a little bit of toe pad tissue,

00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:13.040
because down in there is what is called ancient DNA.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.012
It's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented,

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:20.904
but with good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome.

00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:23.225
Then the question is, can you reassemble,

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:25.720
with that genome, the whole bird?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.224
George Church thinks you can.

00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:31.289
So in his book, "Regenesis," which I recommend,

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.752
he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species,

00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.288
and he has a machine called

00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:39.736
the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine.

00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:41.470
It's kind of like an evolution machine.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.176
You try combinations of genes that you write

00:04:44.176 --> 00:04:47.416
at the cell level and then in organs on a chip,

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:49.325
and the ones that win, that you can then put

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:52.022
into a living organism. It'll work.

00:04:52.022 --> 00:04:55.216
The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides,

00:04:55.216 --> 00:04:59.815
nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here

00:04:59.815 --> 00:05:02.381
right down to the individual base pair.

00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:06.520
The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.525
So what you're getting is the capability now

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:13.050
of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.953
It's called an allele.

00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:17.803
Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.

00:05:17.803 --> 00:05:20.994
So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome

00:05:20.994 --> 00:05:22.874
of an extinct species

00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:26.404
with the genome of its closest living relative.

00:05:26.404 --> 00:05:29.119
Now along the way, George points out that

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:32.930
his technology, the technology of synthetic biology,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.736
is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law.

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:41.024
It's been doing that since 2005, and it's likely to continue.

00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:43.728
Okay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon

00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:47.022
is the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here.

00:05:47.022 --> 00:05:51.110
Genetically, the band-tailed pigeon already is

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.478
mostly living passenger pigeon.

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.913
There's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon.

00:05:55.913 --> 00:05:58.657
If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits,

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:02.872
you've got the extinct bird back, cooing at you.

00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:04.780
Now, there's work to do.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.494
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter.

00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:10.136
So there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon,

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.836
genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon,

00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:16.394
and so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.

00:06:16.394 --> 00:06:19.265
Add them all up and the result won't be perfect.

00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:21.243
But it should be be perfect enough,

00:06:21.243 --> 00:06:23.889
because nature doesn't do perfect either.

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.065
So this meeting in Boston led to three things.

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:31.611
First off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit

00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:35.264
called Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally

00:06:35.264 --> 00:06:38.415
and try to have it go in a responsible way,

00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:41.703
and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon.

00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:45.768
Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak,

00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:49.024
who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14

00:06:49.024 --> 00:06:52.087
and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA,

00:06:52.087 --> 00:06:55.398
himself sequenced the passenger pigeon,

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:58.013
using money from his family and friends.

00:06:58.013 --> 00:07:00.160
We hired him full-time.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.824
Now, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian,

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.055
he's looking down at Martha,

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:08.840
the last passenger pigeon alive.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.575
So if he's successful, she won't be the last.

00:07:11.575 --> 00:07:14.457
The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization

00:07:14.457 --> 00:07:16.290
that there are scientists all over the world

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.264
working on various forms of de-extinction,

00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:20.079
but they'd never met each other.

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:22.063
And National Geographic got interested

00:07:22.063 --> 00:07:24.546
because National Geographic has the theory that

00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:27.919
the last century, discovery was basically finding things,

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:31.996
and in this century, discovery is basically making things.

00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:33.820
De-extinction falls in that category.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.654
So they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists,

00:07:37.654 --> 00:07:40.934
they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists,

00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:44.350
basically meeting to see if they had work to do together.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.716
Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:50.278
There's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,

00:07:50.278 --> 00:07:53.399
they're recreating extinct ecosystems

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:57.267
in northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii.

00:07:57.267 --> 00:07:59.542
Henri, from the Netherlands,

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:02.233
with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce,

00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:04.478
is working on the aurochs.

00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:08.831
The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle,

00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:14.405
and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.

00:08:14.405 --> 00:08:16.819
So what they're doing is working with seven breeds

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:21.574
of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there

00:08:21.574 --> 00:08:25.039
to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding,

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:27.102
the aurochs.

00:08:27.102 --> 00:08:30.135
Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.994
than it is in America,

00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:35.654
and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,

00:08:35.654 --> 00:08:38.862
they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job,

00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:40.804
its old ecological role,

00:08:40.804 --> 00:08:44.063
of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest

00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:47.874
so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.

00:08:47.874 --> 00:08:49.689
Another amazing story

00:08:49.689 --> 00:08:53.087
came from Alberto Fernández-Arias.

00:08:53.087 --> 00:08:56.406
Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.

00:08:56.406 --> 00:08:59.239
The last bucardo was a female named Celia

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:03.802
who was still alive, but then they captured her,

00:09:03.802 --> 00:09:06.214
they got a little bit of tissue from her ear,

00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:09.398
they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen,

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:11.184
released her back into the wild,

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:14.934
but a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.

00:09:14.934 --> 00:09:17.542
They took the DNA from that ear,

00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:20.982
they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat,

00:09:20.982 --> 00:09:23.056
the pregnancy came to term,

00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:25.271
and a live baby bucardo was born.

00:09:25.271 --> 00:09:28.119
It was the first de-extinction in history.

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:31.662
(Applause)

00:09:31.662 --> 00:09:32.889
It was short-lived.

00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:36.527
Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.

00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:39.568
This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes,

00:09:39.568 --> 00:09:42.648
but Alberto was confident that

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:45.048
cloning has moved along well since then,

00:09:45.048 --> 00:09:46.587
and this will move ahead, and eventually

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.594
there will be a population of bucardos

00:09:48.594 --> 00:09:51.851
back in the mountains in northern Spain.

00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:55.677
Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder.

00:09:55.677 --> 00:09:58.064
At the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo

00:09:58.064 --> 00:10:02.015
has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species

00:10:02.015 --> 00:10:04.993
over the last 35 years.

00:10:04.993 --> 00:10:07.024
Now, when it's frozen that deep,

00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:09.744
minus 196 degrees Celsius,

00:10:09.744 --> 00:10:12.376
the cells are intact and the DNA is intact.

00:10:12.376 --> 00:10:14.453
They're basically viable cells,

00:10:14.453 --> 00:10:18.081
so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology

00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:21.296
took some of that tissue from an endangered animal

00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:23.490
called the Javan banteng, put it in a cow,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.540
the cow went to term, and what was born

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.621
was a live, healthy baby Javan banteng,

00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:35.024
who thrived and is still alive.

00:10:35.024 --> 00:10:37.800
The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.488
is the ability now to take any kind of cell

00:10:40.488 --> 00:10:42.936
with induced pluripotent stem cells

00:10:42.936 --> 00:10:46.909
and turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs.

00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:49.192
So now we go to Mike McGrew

00:10:49.192 --> 00:10:52.688
who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland,

00:10:52.688 --> 00:10:54.992
and Mike's doing miracles with birds.

00:10:54.992 --> 00:10:58.512
So he'll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast,

00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:01.300
turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.730
Since it's so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.986
He then has a way to put the germ plasm

00:11:06.986 --> 00:11:10.530
into the embryo of a chicken egg

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.801
so that that chicken will have, basically,

00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:15.642
the gonads of a falcon.

00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:17.556
You get a male and a female each of those,

00:11:17.556 --> 00:11:20.497
and out of them comes falcons.

00:11:20.497 --> 00:11:22.456
(Laughter)

00:11:22.456 --> 00:11:27.581
Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens.

00:11:27.581 --> 00:11:30.058
Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting.

00:11:30.058 --> 00:11:32.487
He showed how all of this can be put together.

00:11:32.487 --> 00:11:35.033
The sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes

00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:37.411
of the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon,

00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:40.361
he'll take the techniques of George Church

00:11:40.361 --> 00:11:42.642
and get passenger pigeon DNA,

00:11:42.642 --> 00:11:45.327
the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew,

00:11:45.327 --> 00:11:47.586
get that DNA into chicken gonads,

00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:51.805
and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs,

00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:55.291
and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons.

00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:57.235
It does raise the question of,

00:11:57.235 --> 00:11:59.208
they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents

00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:01.834
to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.

00:12:01.834 --> 00:12:04.090
So what do you do about that?

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.763
Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens,

00:12:06.763 --> 00:12:09.130
so most of that is already in their DNA,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.914
but to supplement it, part of Ben's idea

00:12:11.914 --> 00:12:13.570
is to use homing pigeons

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.740
to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.474
and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds

00:12:19.474 --> 00:12:22.623
and feeding grounds.

00:12:22.623 --> 00:12:24.261
There were some conservationists,

00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:27.337
really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple,

00:12:27.337 --> 00:12:29.953
who is one of the founders of conservation biology,

00:12:29.953 --> 00:12:34.609
and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.

00:12:34.609 --> 00:12:36.570
They're excited about all this,

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.073
but they're also concerned that it might be competitive

00:12:39.073 --> 00:12:42.111
with the extremely important efforts to protect

00:12:42.111 --> 00:12:44.321
endangered species that are still alive,

00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:46.167
that haven't gone extinct yet.

00:12:46.167 --> 00:12:48.540
You see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.769
You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:56.647
so you're not using 25,000 elephants a year.

00:12:56.647 --> 00:12:59.697
But at the same time, conservation biologists are realizing

00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:02.281
that bad news bums people out.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:05.006
And so the Red List is really important, keep track of

00:13:05.006 --> 00:13:08.330
what's endangered and critically endangered, and so on.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.355
But they're about to create what they call a Green List,

00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:15.737
and the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you,

00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:18.041
species that were endangered, like the bald eagle,

00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:21.656
but they're much better off now, thanks to everybody's good work,

00:13:21.656 --> 00:13:23.822
and protected areas around the world

00:13:23.822 --> 00:13:25.583
that are very, very well managed.

00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:29.686
So basically, they're learning how to build on good news.

00:13:29.686 --> 00:13:32.797
And they see reviving extinct species

00:13:32.797 --> 00:13:35.677
as the kind of good news you might be able to build on.

00:13:35.677 --> 00:13:39.002
Here's a couple related examples.

00:13:39.002 --> 00:13:42.213
Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species.

00:13:42.213 --> 00:13:45.629
The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987.

00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:47.338
Everybody thought is was finished.

00:13:47.338 --> 00:13:50.158
Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo,

00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:54.178
there's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild.

00:13:54.178 --> 00:13:58.387
That technology will be used on de-extincted animals.

00:13:58.387 --> 00:14:01.854
Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa.

00:14:01.854 --> 00:14:05.237
In 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct.

00:14:05.237 --> 00:14:07.270
There were just 254 left.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.809
Now there are 880. They're increasing in population

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.902
by three percent a year.

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:16.293
The secret is, they have an eco-tourism program,

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:17.962
which is absolutely brilliant.

00:14:17.962 --> 00:14:20.597
So this photograph was taken last month by Ryan

00:14:20.597 --> 00:14:23.373
with an iPhone.

00:14:23.373 --> 00:14:27.688
That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors.

00:14:27.688 --> 00:14:31.423
Another interesting project, though it's going to need some help,

00:14:31.423 --> 00:14:33.334
is the northern white rhinoceros.

00:14:33.334 --> 00:14:35.295
There's no breeding pairs left.

00:14:35.295 --> 00:14:37.465
But this is the kind of thing that

00:14:37.465 --> 00:14:41.605
a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo.

00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:44.400
A bit of cloning, you can get them back.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.590
So where do we go from here?

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.254
These have been private meetings so far.

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:50.911
I think it's time for the subject to go public.

00:14:50.911 --> 00:14:52.378
What do people think about it?

00:14:52.378 --> 00:14:54.457
You know, do you want extinct species back?

00:14:54.457 --> 00:14:57.309
Do you want extinct species back?

00:14:57.309 --> 00:15:02.575
(Applause)

00:15:02.575 --> 00:15:05.071
Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.285
It is a Tinker Bell moment,

00:15:06.285 --> 00:15:08.681
because what are people excited about with this?

00:15:08.681 --> 00:15:10.732
What are they concerned about?

00:15:10.732 --> 00:15:13.179
We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon.

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:16.949
So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:20.270
that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.658
They're going to work on the genomes

00:15:21.658 --> 00:15:23.945
of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.

00:15:23.945 --> 00:15:27.854
As that data matures, they'll send it to George Church,

00:15:27.854 --> 00:15:31.749
who will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that.

00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:34.593
We'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew

00:15:34.593 --> 00:15:37.660
to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.228
that can produce passenger pigeon squabs

00:15:40.228 --> 00:15:42.692
that can be raised by band-tailed pigeon parents,

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.948
and then from then on, it's passenger pigeons all the way,

00:15:44.948 --> 00:15:48.084
maybe for the next six million years.

00:15:48.084 --> 00:15:50.399
You can do the same thing, as the costs come down,

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:53.621
for the Carolina parakeet, for the great auk,

00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:56.416
for the heath hen, for the ivory-billed woodpecker,

00:15:56.416 --> 00:15:58.522
for the Eskimo curlew, for the Caribbean monk seal,

00:15:58.522 --> 00:16:01.388
for the woolly mammoth.

00:16:01.388 --> 00:16:03.864
Because the fact is, humans have made a huge hole

00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:06.954
in nature in the last 10,000 years.

00:16:06.954 --> 00:16:08.993
We have the ability now,

00:16:08.993 --> 00:16:13.857
and maybe the moral obligation, to repair some of the damage.

00:16:13.857 --> 00:16:18.405
Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands,

00:16:18.405 --> 00:16:20.074
by expanding and protecting

00:16:20.074 --> 00:16:24.601
the populations of endangered species.

00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:26.756
But some species

00:16:26.756 --> 00:16:31.939
that we killed off totally

00:16:31.939 --> 00:16:35.253
we could consider bringing back

00:16:35.253 --> 00:16:38.420
to a world that misses them.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.630
Thank you.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:51.828
(Applause)

00:16:51.828 --> 00:16:53.682
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:16:53.682 --> 00:16:55.494
I've got a question.

00:16:55.494 --> 00:17:00.244
So, this is an emotional topic. Some people stand.

00:17:00.244 --> 00:17:03.100
I suspect there are some people out there sitting,

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.109
kind of asking tormented questions, almost, about,

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.019
well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute,

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:11.116
there's something wrong with mankind

00:17:11.116 --> 00:17:14.596
interfering in nature in this way.

00:17:14.596 --> 00:17:18.068
There's going to be unintended consequences.

00:17:18.068 --> 00:17:20.845
You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box

00:17:20.845 --> 00:17:24.831
of who-knows-what. Do they have a point?

00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:26.331
Stewart Brand: Well, the earlier point is

00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:29.882
we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct,

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.423
and many of them were keystone species,

00:17:32.423 --> 00:17:34.932
and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in

00:17:34.932 --> 00:17:36.725
by letting them go.

00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:39.306
Now, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is,

00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:40.844
so when these things come back,

00:17:40.844 --> 00:17:43.135
they might replace some birds that are there

00:17:43.135 --> 00:17:45.529
that people really know and love.

00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:48.276
I think that's, you know, part of how it'll work.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:51.161
This is a long, slow process --

00:17:51.161 --> 00:17:53.395
One of the things I like about it, it's multi-generation.

00:17:53.395 --> 00:17:55.452
We will get woolly mammoths back.

00:17:55.452 --> 00:17:57.228
CA: Well it feels like both the conversation

00:17:57.228 --> 00:17:59.516
and the potential here are pretty thrilling.

00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:01.230
Thank you so much for presenting. SB: Thank you.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.953
CA: Thank you. (Applause)
