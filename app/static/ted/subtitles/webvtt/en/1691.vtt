WEBVTT

00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:04.608
Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:09.307
of anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED.

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:13.304
That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:15.369
(Laughter)

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.942
I said, "Chris, that would take a miracle."

00:00:19.942 --> 00:00:25.097
He said, "Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?"

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:27.118
So, yeah.

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:31.115
Then I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:34.850
Let's go back before Christ, three millennia,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.217
to a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice,

00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:43.244
the march against inequality and poverty really began.

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:44.727
Three thousand years ago,

00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:47.780
civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.685
some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance,

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.593
smelling of sheep shit, I guess,

00:00:54.593 --> 00:00:59.172
proclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne,

00:00:59.172 --> 00:01:04.656
"We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you."

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:08.037
And the Pharaoh replies, "Oh, no.

00:01:08.037 --> 00:01:11.305
You, your miserableness, have got to be kidding."

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:15.117
And they say, "No, no, that's what it says here

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:17.128
in our holy book."

00:01:17.128 --> 00:01:19.956
Cut to our century, same country, same pyramids,

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:22.194
another people spreading the same idea

00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:24.185
of equality with a different book.

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:27.744
This time it's called the Facebook.

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:29.636
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square.

00:01:29.636 --> 00:01:32.049
They turn a social network from virtual to actual,

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.539
and kind of rebooted the 21st century.

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.022
Not to undersell how messy and ugly

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:40.770
the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.545
neither to oversell the role of technology,

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:46.912
but these things have given a sense of what's possible

00:01:46.912 --> 00:01:51.271
when the age-old model of power, the pyramid,

00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.083
gets turned upside down, putting the people on top

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:57.883
and the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:00.958
It's also shown us that something as powerful

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.983
as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality,

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.946
because facts, like people,

00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:10.296
want to be free, and when they're free,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.967
liberty is usually around the corner,

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:14.639
even for the poorest of the poor --

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.184
facts that can challenge cynicism

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:20.066
and the apathy that leads to inertia,

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.900
facts that tell us what's working and,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.633
more importantly, what's not, so we can fix it,

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:27.183
facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us

00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:30.717
meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:33.242
back in 2005,

00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:35.930
when he asked us to be that great generation

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.993
that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity,

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:40.968
extreme poverty,

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:45.067
facts that build a powerful momentum.

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:47.655
So I thought, forget the rock opera,

00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:52.781
forget the bombast, my usual tricks.

00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:56.805
The only thing singing today would be the facts,

00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:02.243
for I have truly embraced by inner nerd.

00:03:02.243 --> 00:03:08.531
So exit the rock star.

00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:17.691
Enter the evidence-based activist, the factivist.

00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:22.355
Because what the facts are telling us

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:25.632
is that the long, slow journey,

00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:27.924
humanity's long, slow journey of equality,

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.687
is actually speeding up.

00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:31.771
Look at what's been achieved.

00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:35.121
Look at the pictures these data sets print.

00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:38.045
Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium,

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:39.939
there are eight million more AIDS patients

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.670
getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.907
Malaria: There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa

00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:49.558
that have their death rates cut by 75 percent.

00:03:49.558 --> 00:03:53.238
For kids under five, child mortality, kids under five,

00:03:53.238 --> 00:03:56.658
it's down by 2.65 million a year.

00:03:56.658 --> 00:04:03.271
That's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day.

00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:08.521
Wow. Wow. (Applause)

00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:10.809
Let's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that.

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:14.639
Have you read anything anywhere in the last week

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.959
that is remotely as important as that number? Wow.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.947
Great news. It drives me nuts

00:04:22.947 --> 00:04:25.835
that most people don't seem to know this news.

00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:28.694
Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them.

00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:31.372
This is Michael and Benedicta,

00:04:31.372 --> 00:04:34.023
and they're alive thanks in large part

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:37.908
to Dr. Patricia Asamoah -- she's amazing --

00:04:37.924 --> 00:04:40.894
and the Global Fund, which all of you financially support,

00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:42.430
whether you know it or not.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.348
And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:48.986
that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids.

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:52.161
This fantastic news didn't happen by itself.

00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:54.036
It was fought for, it was campaigned for,

00:04:54.036 --> 00:04:55.707
it was innovated for.

00:04:55.707 --> 00:05:00.936
And this great news gives birth to even more great news,

00:05:00.936 --> 00:05:03.816
because the historic trend is this.

00:05:03.816 --> 00:05:06.424
The number of people living in back-breaking,

00:05:06.424 --> 00:05:09.011
soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined

00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:14.101
from 43 percent of the world's population in 1990

00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:17.005
to 33 percent by 2000

00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:21.776
and then to 21 percent by 2010.

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:26.039
Give it up for that. (Applause)

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.177
Halved. Halved.

00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:33.477
Now, the rate is still too high -- still too many people

00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:35.455
unnecessarily losing their lives.

00:05:35.455 --> 00:05:36.576
There's still work to do.

00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:42.228
But it's heart-stopping. It's mind-blowing stuff.

00:05:42.228 --> 00:05:46.708
And if you live on less than $1.25 a day,

00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:48.856
if you live in that kind of poverty,

00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:50.758
this is not just data.

00:05:50.758 --> 00:05:52.637
This is everything.

00:05:52.637 --> 00:05:58.436
If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids -- and I am --

00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:03.766
this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.

00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:06.635
And guess what? If the trajectory continues,

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:11.172
look where the amount of people living on $1.25 a day

00:06:11.172 --> 00:06:14.804
gets to by 2030.

00:06:14.804 --> 00:06:18.116
Can't be true, can it?

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:22.504
That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues,

00:06:22.504 --> 00:06:27.645
we get to, wow, the zero zone.

00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:29.120
For number-crunchers like us,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.629
that is the erogenous zone,

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.820
and it's fair to say that I am, by now,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.869
sexually aroused by the collating of data.

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:46.130
So virtual elimination of extreme poverty,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.730
as defined by people living on less than $1.25 a day,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.127
adjusted, of course, for inflation from a 1990 baseline.

00:06:54.127 --> 00:06:57.144
We do love a good baseline.

00:06:57.144 --> 00:06:58.865
That's amazing.

00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:02.765
Now I know that some of you think this progress

00:07:02.765 --> 00:07:05.456
is all in Asia or Latin America or

00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:06.788
model countries like Brazil --

00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:09.680
and who doesn't love a Brazilian model? --

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.790
but look at sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.465
There's a collection of 10 countries, some call them the lions,

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:20.193
who in the last decade have had a combination

00:07:20.193 --> 00:07:21.737
of 100 percent debt cancellation,

00:07:21.737 --> 00:07:24.478
a tripling of aid, a tenfold increase in FDI --

00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:25.933
that's foreign direct investment --

00:07:25.933 --> 00:07:29.855
which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources -- that's local money --

00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:32.519
which, when spent wisely -- that's good governance --

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.789
cut childhood mortality by a third,

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:36.496
doubled education completion rates,

00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:39.600
and they, too, halved extreme poverty,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.029
and at this rate, these 10 get to zero too.

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.282
So the pride of lions

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:48.998
is the proof of concept.

00:07:48.998 --> 00:07:52.429
There are all kinds of benefits to this.

00:07:52.429 --> 00:07:55.617
For a start, you won't have to listen

00:07:55.617 --> 00:07:59.969
to an insufferable little jumped-up Jesus like myself.

00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:05.177
How about that? (Applause)

00:08:05.177 --> 00:08:09.215
And 2028, 2030? It's just around the corner.

00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:13.496
I mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.

00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:18.823
(Laughter) I hope. I'm hoping.

00:08:18.823 --> 00:08:22.510
Makes us look really young.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.536
So why aren't we jumping up and down about this?

00:08:25.536 --> 00:08:29.247
Well, the opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy.

00:08:29.247 --> 00:08:33.061
We can't get this done until we really accept

00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:35.536
that we can get this done.

00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:37.789
Look at this graph.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:42.607
It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up.

00:08:42.607 --> 00:08:44.481
And the next one is really beautiful.

00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:48.014
It's called momentum.

00:08:48.014 --> 00:08:52.570
And it's how we can bend the arc of history

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.198
down towards zero,

00:08:54.198 --> 00:08:56.597
just doing the things that we know work.

00:08:56.597 --> 00:08:58.642
So inertia versus momentum.

00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:01.183
There is jeopardy, and of course,

00:09:01.183 --> 00:09:03.555
the closer you get, it gets harder.

00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:05.499
We know the obstacles that are in our way

00:09:05.499 --> 00:09:07.524
right now, in difficult times.

00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:12.665
In fact, today in your capital, in difficult times,

00:09:12.665 --> 00:09:15.240
some who mind the nation's purse want to cut

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.645
life-saving programs like the Global Fund.

00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:19.458
But you can do something about that.

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.442
You can tell politicians

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:24.348
that these cuts [can cost] lives.

00:09:24.348 --> 00:09:27.925
Right now today, in Oslo as it happens,

00:09:27.925 --> 00:09:30.292
oil companies are fighting to keep secret

00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:31.770
their payments to governments

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.487
for extracting oil in developing countries.

00:09:35.487 --> 00:09:37.206
You can do something about that too.

00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:39.066
You can join the One Campaign,

00:09:39.066 --> 00:09:43.419
and leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the telecom entrepreneur.

00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:47.242
We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some

00:09:47.242 --> 00:09:49.714
of the wealth under the ground

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:53.285
ends up in the hands of the people living above it.

00:09:53.285 --> 00:09:57.052
And right now, we know

00:09:57.052 --> 00:10:00.764
that the biggest disease of all

00:10:00.764 --> 00:10:03.727
is not a disease. It's corruption.

00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:05.551
But there's a vaccine for that too.

00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:09.042
It's called transparency, open data sets,

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:14.053
something the TED community is really on it.

00:10:14.053 --> 00:10:17.665
Daylight, you could call it, transparency.

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:20.227
And technology is really turbocharging this.

00:10:20.227 --> 00:10:24.978
It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff.

00:10:24.978 --> 00:10:27.960
So let me tell you about the U-report,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.567
which I'm really excited about. It's 150,000 millennials

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:33.902
all across Uganda, young people

00:10:33.902 --> 00:10:38.278
armed with 2G phones, an SMS social network

00:10:38.278 --> 00:10:41.344
exposing government corruption

00:10:41.344 --> 00:10:43.940
and demanding to know what's in the budget

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.803
and how their money is being spent.

00:10:46.803 --> 00:10:49.478
This is exciting stuff.

00:10:49.478 --> 00:10:52.841
Look, once you have these tools,

00:10:52.841 --> 00:10:54.565
you can't not use them.

00:10:54.565 --> 00:10:57.091
Once you have this knowledge, you can't un-know it.

00:10:57.091 --> 00:11:00.366
You can't delete this data from your brain,

00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:03.189
but you can delete the cliched image

00:11:03.189 --> 00:11:05.427
of supplicant, impoverished peoples

00:11:05.427 --> 00:11:07.499
not taking control of their own lives.

00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:09.881
You can erase that, you really can,

00:11:09.881 --> 00:11:15.358
because it's not true anymore. (Applause)

00:11:15.358 --> 00:11:18.210
It's transformational.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.083
2030? By 2030, robots,

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:24.877
not just serving us Guinness, but drinking it.

00:11:24.877 --> 00:11:27.011
By the time we get there,

00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:30.140
every place with a rough semblance of governance

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.170
might actually be on their way.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.975
So I'm here to -- I guess we're here

00:11:37.975 --> 00:11:43.483
to try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus,

00:11:43.483 --> 00:11:45.533
the one we call factivism.

00:11:45.533 --> 00:11:47.177
It's not going to kill you.

00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:51.270
In fact, it could save countless lives.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.949
I guess we in the One Campaign would love you

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:58.986
to be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on.

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:04.196
By doing so, you will join us and countless others

00:12:04.196 --> 00:12:09.159
in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken,

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:13.397
the ever-demanding journey of equality.

00:12:13.397 --> 00:12:16.634
Could we really be the great generation

00:12:16.634 --> 00:12:18.595
that Mandela asked us to be?

00:12:18.595 --> 00:12:22.575
Might we answer that clarion call with science,

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.234
with reason, with facts,

00:12:25.234 --> 00:12:29.272
and, dare I say it, emotions?

00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:35.404
Because as is obvious, factivists have feelings too.

00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:37.891
I'm thinking of Wael Ghonim, though.

00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:40.166
Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:44.269
behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo.

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:45.819
He got thrown in jail for it,

00:12:45.819 --> 00:12:50.542
but I have his words tattooed on my brain.

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:55.029
"We are going to win because we don't understand politics.

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:58.154
We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.

00:12:58.154 --> 00:13:01.442
We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda.

00:13:01.442 --> 00:13:03.413
We are going to win because the tears

00:13:03.413 --> 00:13:06.519
that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:09.383
We are going to win because we have dreams,

00:13:09.383 --> 00:13:12.893
and we're willing to stand up for those dreams."

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:15.206
Wael is right.

00:13:15.206 --> 00:13:17.068
We're going to win

00:13:17.068 --> 00:13:19.300
if we work together as one,

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.744
because the power of the people

00:13:21.744 --> 00:13:25.568
is so much stronger than the people in power.

00:13:25.568 --> 00:13:29.018
Thank you.

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:31.890
(Applause)

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.890
Thank you so much. (Applause)
