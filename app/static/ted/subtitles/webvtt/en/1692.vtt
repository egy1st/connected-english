WEBVTT

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.898
I have a friend in Portugal

00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:05.322
whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:08.474
and a washing machine so he could transport his family.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.018
He did it because he couldn't afford a car,

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:13.922
but also because he knew how to build one.

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:17.058
There was a time when we understood how things worked

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.890
and how they were made, so we could build and repair them,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.017
or at the very least

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:25.497
make informed decisions about what to buy.

00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:27.889
Many of these do-it-yourself practices

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:31.098
were lost in the second half of the 20th century.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:34.770
But now, the maker community and the open-source model

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.918
are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:41.113
and what they're made of back into our lives,

00:00:41.113 --> 00:00:44.137
and I believe we need to take them to the next level,

00:00:44.137 --> 00:00:47.105
to the components things are made of.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.257
For the most part, we still know

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.779
what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:54.808
and how they are produced.

00:00:54.808 --> 00:00:58.871
But now we have these amazing, futuristic composites --

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.074
plastics that change shape,

00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:03.426
paints that conduct electricity,

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:07.842
pigments that change color, fabrics that light up.

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:11.213
Let me show you some examples.

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:17.885
So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:19.828
instead of using the traditional

00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:22.426
printed circuit boards or wires.

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:24.815
In the case of this little example I'm holding,

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:28.696
we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:31.411
by turning on this little light.

00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:34.506
Conductive ink has been used by artists,

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:37.881
but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able

00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:42.376
to use it in laser printers and pens.

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:44.706
And this is a sheet of acrylic infused

00:01:44.706 --> 00:01:47.502
with colorless light-diffusing particles.

00:01:47.502 --> 00:01:50.119
What this means is that, while regular acrylic

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.467
only diffuses light around the edges,

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:55.737
this one illuminates across the entire surface

00:01:55.737 --> 00:01:58.650
when I turn on the lights around it.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.952
Two of the known applications for this material

00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:06.065
include interior design and multi-touch systems.

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:08.066
And thermochromic pigments

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.679
change color at a given temperature.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.465
So I'm going to place this on a hot plate

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:16.970
that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.816
and you can see what happens.

00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:25.576
So one of the principle applications for this material

00:02:25.576 --> 00:02:28.818
is, amongst other things, in baby bottles,

00:02:28.818 --> 00:02:34.172
so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink.

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:36.928
So these are just a few of what are commonly known

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:38.837
as smart materials.

00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:41.777
In a few years, they will be in many of the objects

00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:45.136
and technologies we use on a daily basis.

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:49.350
We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us,

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.719
but we can have walls that change color

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.481
depending on temperature,

00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.375
keyboards that roll up,

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:59.807
and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch.

00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:02.312
So I'm a social scientist by training,

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:06.169
so why am I here today talking about smart materials?

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.882
Well first of all, because I am a maker.

00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:11.288
I'm curious about how things work

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:12.915
and how they are made,

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:16.223
but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding

00:03:16.223 --> 00:03:19.044
of the components that make up our world,

00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:21.524
and right now, we don't know enough about

00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:25.213
these high-tech composites our future will be made of.

00:03:25.213 --> 00:03:28.738
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities.

00:03:28.738 --> 00:03:32.778
There's barely any information available on how to use them,

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:36.675
and very little is said about how they are produced.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.342
So for now, they exist mostly in this realm

00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:42.054
of trade secrets and patents

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:46.166
only universities and corporations have access to.

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:49.015
So a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I

00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:52.232
started a project we called Open Materials.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.039
It's a website where we,

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:56.551
and anyone else who wants to join us,

00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:59.607
share experiments, publish information,

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:02.807
encourage others to contribute whenever they can,

00:04:02.807 --> 00:04:06.816
and aggregate resources such as research papers

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:10.156
and tutorials by other makers like ourselves.

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:12.778
We would like it to become a large,

00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:15.316
collectively generated database

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:19.609
of do-it-yourself information on smart materials.

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.829
But why should we care

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.592
how smart materials work and what they are made of?

00:04:25.592 --> 00:04:29.770
First of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.122
and what we don't understand and use

00:04:32.122 --> 00:04:34.330
ends up shaping us.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.082
The objects we use, the clothes we wear,

00:04:37.082 --> 00:04:40.646
the houses we live in, all have a profound impact

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:44.229
on our behavior, health and quality of life.

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.370
So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.729
we should know and understand them.

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.073
Secondly, and just as important,

00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:56.433
innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers.

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:59.818
So many times, amateurs, not experts,

00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:02.137
have been the inventors and improvers

00:05:02.137 --> 00:05:04.617
of things ranging from mountain bikes

00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:07.929
to semiconductors, personal computers,

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:10.868
airplanes.

00:05:10.868 --> 00:05:14.897
The biggest challenge is that material science is complex

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:17.393
and requires expensive equipment.

00:05:17.393 --> 00:05:19.561
But that's not always the case.

00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:23.149
Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:25.749
when they published a paper on a simpler method

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:28.169
for making conductive ink.

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.081
Jordan Bunker, who had had

00:05:30.081 --> 00:05:33.041
no experience with chemistry until then,

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.828
read this paper and reproduced the experiment

00:05:35.828 --> 00:05:40.217
at his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances

00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:41.809
and tools.

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:43.410
He used a toaster oven,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.376
and he even made his own vortex mixer,

00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:50.411
based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.

00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.163
Jordan then published his results online,

00:05:53.163 --> 00:05:56.651
including all the things he had tried and didn't work,

00:05:56.651 --> 00:05:59.795
so others could study and reproduce it.

00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:02.467
So Jordan's main form of innovation

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:06.346
was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab

00:06:06.346 --> 00:06:07.848
at the university

00:06:07.848 --> 00:06:11.035
and recreate it in a garage in Chicago

00:06:11.035 --> 00:06:15.296
using only cheap materials and tools he made himself.

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:17.569
And now that he published this work,

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.293
others can pick up where he left

00:06:19.293 --> 00:06:23.837
and devise even simpler processes and improvements.

00:06:23.837 --> 00:06:26.053
Another example I'd like to mention

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:29.718
is Hannah Perner-Wilson's Kit-of-No-Parts.

00:06:29.718 --> 00:06:32.598
Her project's goal is to highlight

00:06:32.598 --> 00:06:35.070
the expressive qualities of materials

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.094
while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.

00:06:40.094 --> 00:06:42.534
Electronics kits are very powerful

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:45.086
in that they teach us how things work,

00:06:45.086 --> 00:06:48.062
but the constraints inherent in their design

00:06:48.062 --> 00:06:50.222
influence the way we learn.

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:52.710
So Hannah's approach, on the other hand,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.926
is to formulate a series of techniques

00:06:55.926 --> 00:06:58.625
for creating unusual objects

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:01.430
that free us from pre-designed constraints

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.841
by teaching us about the materials themselves.

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.574
So amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments,

00:07:07.574 --> 00:07:09.544
this is one of my favorites.

00:07:09.544 --> 00:07:12.961
["Paper speakers"]

00:07:12.961 --> 00:07:16.239
What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:20.681
with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:22.334
and a magnet.

00:07:22.334 --> 00:07:29.983
(Music: "Happy Together")

00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:36.767
So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT,

00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:39.550
Hannah created a series of paper speakers

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.953
out of a wide range of materials

00:07:41.953 --> 00:07:46.228
from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.

00:07:46.228 --> 00:07:48.964
Just like Jordan and so many other makers,

00:07:48.964 --> 00:07:50.591
Hannah published her recipes

00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:55.725
and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.929
But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches

00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:00.736
of material science

00:08:00.736 --> 00:08:04.938
in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.

00:08:04.938 --> 00:08:07.494
So Hannah's artisanal work,

00:08:07.494 --> 00:08:09.742
and the fact that she shared her findings,

00:08:09.742 --> 00:08:13.562
opens the doors to a series of new possibilities

00:08:13.562 --> 00:08:19.002
that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.

00:08:19.002 --> 00:08:21.907
So the interesting thing about makers

00:08:21.907 --> 00:08:24.950
is that we create out of passion and curiosity,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.029
and we are not afraid to fail.

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:30.917
We often tackle problems from unconventional angles,

00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:33.906
and, in the process, end up discovering alternatives

00:08:33.906 --> 00:08:36.338
or even better ways to do things.

00:08:36.338 --> 00:08:40.106
So the more people experiment with materials,

00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:43.582
the more researchers are willing to share their research,

00:08:43.582 --> 00:08:46.022
and manufacturers their knowledge,

00:08:46.022 --> 00:08:48.862
the better chances we have to create technologies

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.800
that truly serve us all.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.293
So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have

00:08:54.293 --> 00:08:58.004
when, in the early 1970s, he wrote,

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:01.002
"You must understand computers now."

00:09:01.002 --> 00:09:04.856
Back then, computers were these large mainframes

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:06.986
only scientists cared about,

00:09:06.986 --> 00:09:09.706
and no one dreamed of even having one at home.

00:09:09.706 --> 00:09:12.682
So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying,

00:09:12.682 --> 00:09:15.722
"You must understand smart materials now."

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:19.458
Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.722
about emerging technologies

00:09:21.722 --> 00:09:24.119
is the best way to ensure that we have a say

00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:26.282
in the making of our future.

00:09:26.282 --> 00:09:28.753
Thank you.

00:09:28.753 --> 00:09:32.753
(Applause)
