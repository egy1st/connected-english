00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:03.669
So, this book that I have in my hand

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.603
is a directory of everybody who had an email address

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:11.122
in 1982. (Laughter)

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:14.807
Actually, it's deceptively large.

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:18.244
There's actually only about 20 people on each page,

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:20.134
because we have the name, address

00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:23.227
and telephone number of every single person.

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:25.410
And, in fact, everybody's listed twice,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.968
because it's sorted once by name and once by email address.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:32.869
Obviously a very small community.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:36.300
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.900
I knew them both.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.656
We didn't all know each other,

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.769
but we all kind of trusted each other,

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.567
and that basic feeling of trust

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.154
permeated the whole network,

00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:51.511
and there was a real sense that

00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.517
we could depend on each other to do things.

00:00:54.517 --> 00:00:58.092
So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community,

00:00:58.092 --> 00:00:59.717
let me tell you what it was like

00:00:59.717 --> 00:01:03.822
to register a domain name in the early days.

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:06.452
Now, it just so happened that I got to register

00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:08.912
the third domain name on the Internet.

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:10.560
So I could have anything I wanted

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.005
other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:18.419
So I picked think.com, but then I thought,

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:21.405
you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there.

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:25.614
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case.

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:28.898
And then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."

00:01:28.898 --> 00:01:34.593
(Laughter)

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:38.222
That attitude of only taking what you need

00:01:38.222 --> 00:01:42.266
was really what everybody had on the network in those days,

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.563
and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network,

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.283
but it was actually kind of built into the protocols

00:01:48.283 --> 00:01:50.227
of the Internet itself.

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:54.086
So the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol,

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:57.815
and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it,

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:01.944
were fundamentally "from each according to their ability,

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:04.062
to each according to their need."

00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:07.075
And so, if you had some extra bandwidth,

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:08.518
you'd deliver a message for someone.

00:02:08.518 --> 00:02:11.511
If they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.

00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:13.525
You'd kind of depend on people to do that,

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:16.189
and that was the building block.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.816
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:21.252
was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War

00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:23.683
by the Defense Department,

00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:26.753
but it obviously worked really well,

00:02:26.753 --> 00:02:30.196
and we all saw what happened with the Internet.

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:32.468
It was incredibly successful.

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:35.765
In fact, it was so successful that there's no way

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:39.353
that these days you could make a book like this.

00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:45.519
My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.693
But, of course, you couldn't do it,

00:02:46.693 --> 00:02:48.483
because we don't know the names of all the people

00:02:48.483 --> 00:02:51.557
with Internet or email addresses,

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:53.089
and even if we did know their names,

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.522
I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name,

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:59.818
address and telephone number published to everyone.

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:03.520
So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.691
and so we dealt with that by making

00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:09.590
walled communities,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.327
secure subnetworks, VPNs,

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.923
little things that aren't really the Internet

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:17.894
but are made out of the same building blocks,

00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:20.134
but we're still basically building it out of those

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:24.401
same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust.

00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.123
And that means that it's vulnerable

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.519
to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen,

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.380
or certain kinds of deliberate attacks,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.485
but even the mistakes can be bad.

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:37.434
So, for instance,

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.387
in all of Asia recently,

00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:42.820
it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.100
because Pakistan made some mistakes

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.835
in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.

00:03:48.835 --> 00:03:51.929
They didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.833
because of the way that the protocols work.

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:58.057
Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is,

00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:00.648
you may remember a couple of years ago,

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:03.461
all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.353
because a single routing card in Salt Lake City

00:04:06.353 --> 00:04:08.715
had a bug in it.

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.988
Now, you don't really think

00:04:10.988 --> 00:04:14.014
that our airplane system depends on the Internet,

00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:15.020
and in some sense it doesn't.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.636
I'll come back to that later.

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:18.886
But the fact is that people couldn't take off

00:04:18.886 --> 00:04:21.161
because something was going wrong on the Internet,

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.736
and the router card was down.

00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:27.515
And so, there are many of those things that start to happen.

00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:30.654
Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.

00:04:30.654 --> 00:04:32.180
All of a sudden,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.512
a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet,

00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:39.643
including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations,

00:04:39.643 --> 00:04:42.411
started getting re-routed through China.

00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:45.133
So for a few hours, it all passed through China.

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:49.707
Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake,

00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:53.564
and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work,

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:55.599
but certainly somebody could make

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.872
a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to,

00:04:58.872 --> 00:05:02.230
and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.151
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks.

00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:10.549
So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:12.641
or Western civilization these days,

00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:14.830
they're not going to do it with tanks.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.243
That will not succeed.

00:05:17.243 --> 00:05:19.246
What they'll probably do is something

00:05:19.246 --> 00:05:22.537
very much like the attack that happened

00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:25.244
on the Iranian nuclear facility.

00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:27.518
Nobody has claimed credit for that.

00:05:27.518 --> 00:05:31.025
There was basically a factory of industrial machines.

00:05:31.025 --> 00:05:33.602
It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.

00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:36.189
It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet,

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.136
but it was possible for somebody to smuggle

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:40.668
a USB drive in there, or something like that,

00:05:40.668 --> 00:05:44.064
and software got in there that causes the centrifuges,

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:47.057
in that case, to actually destroy themselves.

00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:49.723
Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery

00:05:49.723 --> 00:05:54.145
or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:57.411
And so there's a lot of -- I'm sure you've read a lot in papers,

00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:59.602
about worries about cyberattacks

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:02.212
and defenses against those.

00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:04.192
But the fact is, people are mostly focused on

00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:06.475
defending the computers on the Internet,

00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:08.861
and there's been surprisingly little attention

00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:13.226
to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.

00:06:13.226 --> 00:06:15.089
And I think we probably do need to pay

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.177
some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:21.104
So actually, in the early days,

00:06:21.104 --> 00:06:22.828
back when it was the ARPANET,

00:06:22.828 --> 00:06:26.417
there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely

00:06:26.417 --> 00:06:29.702
because one single message processor

00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:32.178
actually got a bug in it.

00:06:32.178 --> 00:06:34.450
And the way the Internet works is

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.017
the routers are basically exchanging information

00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:40.607
about how they can get messages to places,

00:06:40.607 --> 00:06:44.505
and this one processor, because of a broken card,

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:46.514
decided it could actually get a message

00:06:46.514 --> 00:06:49.202
to some place in negative time.

00:06:49.202 --> 00:06:53.185
So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:56.335
So of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere

00:06:56.335 --> 00:06:58.211
was to send it to this guy,

00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:01.758
who would send it back in time and get it there super early,

00:07:01.758 --> 00:07:04.614
so every message in the Internet

00:07:04.614 --> 00:07:07.856
started getting switched through this one node,

00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:09.372
and of course that clogged everything up.

00:07:09.372 --> 00:07:11.527
Everything started breaking.

00:07:11.527 --> 00:07:13.567
The interesting thing was, though,

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:15.407
that the sysadmins were able to fix it,

00:07:15.407 --> 00:07:20.189
but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:21.587
Now, of course you couldn't do that today.

00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:23.981
I mean, everything off, it's like

00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:26.213
the service call you get from the cable company,

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:29.974
except for the whole world.

00:07:29.974 --> 00:07:32.033
Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.

00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:34.655
One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:37.624
use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.693
that go through the Internet right now,

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:42.975
and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it

00:07:42.975 --> 00:07:44.767
for more and more different things,

00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:47.705
like when you take off from LAX,

00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:49.586
you're really not thinking you're using the Internet.

00:07:49.586 --> 00:07:53.702
When you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:55.827
What's happening increasingly, though, is these systems

00:07:55.827 --> 00:07:57.694
are beginning to use the Internet.

00:07:57.694 --> 00:08:00.744
Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet,

00:08:00.744 --> 00:08:03.280
but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.185
for administrative functions,

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:08.248
and so if you take something like the cell phone system,

00:08:08.248 --> 00:08:12.568
which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part,

00:08:12.568 --> 00:08:15.527
Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:19.331
in terms of some of the control and administrative functions,

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.661
and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks

00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:23.925
because they work so well, they're cheap,

00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:25.025
they're repeated, and so on.

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:27.797
So all of our systems, more and more,

00:08:27.797 --> 00:08:29.577
are starting to use the same technology

00:08:29.577 --> 00:08:31.644
and starting to depend on this technology.

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.069
And so even a modern rocket ship these days

00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:36.795
actually uses Internet protocol to talk

00:08:36.795 --> 00:08:38.611
from one end of the rocket ship to the other.

00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:41.797
That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that.

00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:44.914
So we've built this system

00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:48.024
where we understand all the parts of it,

00:08:48.024 --> 00:08:51.722
but we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it,

00:08:51.722 --> 00:08:54.161
and it's gotten a very, very different scale

00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:56.332
than it was designed for.

00:08:56.332 --> 00:08:59.008
And in fact, nobody really exactly understands

00:08:59.008 --> 00:09:01.271
all the things it's being used for right now.

00:09:01.271 --> 00:09:03.774
It's turning into one of these big emergent systems

00:09:03.774 --> 00:09:07.255
like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.861
but nobody really exactly understands

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:13.088
how it operates and all the little details of it

00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:15.807
and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.

00:09:15.807 --> 00:09:18.940
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.635
and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that,

00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:24.096
you should treat it with the same skepticism

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:28.511
that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy

00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:30.778
or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:33.426
They have an informed opinion,

00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:35.967
but it's changing so quickly that even the experts

00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:37.785
don't know exactly what's going on.

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:40.477
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet,

00:09:40.477 --> 00:09:42.143
it's just somebody's guess.

00:09:42.143 --> 00:09:44.341
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now

00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:47.082
because it's different than it was an hour ago.

00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:49.883
It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring.

00:09:49.883 --> 00:09:51.397
And the problem with it is,

00:09:51.397 --> 00:09:54.738
I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster

00:09:54.738 --> 00:09:57.533
like the disaster we had in the financial system,

00:09:57.533 --> 00:10:02.877
where we take a system that's basically built on trust,

00:10:02.877 --> 00:10:05.498
was basically built for a smaller-scale system,

00:10:05.498 --> 00:10:08.407
and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:10.403
of how it was meant to operate.

00:10:10.403 --> 00:10:13.671
And so right now, I think it's literally true

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:17.176
that we don't know what the consequences

00:10:17.176 --> 00:10:19.610
of an effective denial-of-service attack

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.383
on the Internet would be,

00:10:21.383 --> 00:10:23.257
and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year,

00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:24.665
and worse next year, and so on.

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:27.214
But so what we need is a plan B.

00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:28.846
There is no plan B right now.

00:10:28.846 --> 00:10:32.349
There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept

00:10:32.349 --> 00:10:34.295
to be independent of the Internet,

00:10:34.295 --> 00:10:37.361
made out of completely different sets of building blocks.

00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:40.374
So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily

00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:43.108
have to have the performance of the Internet,

00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:44.625
but the police department has to be able

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.148
to call up the fire department even without the Internet,

00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:49.713
or the hospitals have to order fuel oil.

00:10:49.713 --> 00:10:54.327
This doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project.

00:10:54.327 --> 00:10:57.075
It's actually relatively simple to do, technically,

00:10:57.075 --> 00:11:00.877
because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground,

00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:02.836
existing wireless infrastructure.

00:11:02.836 --> 00:11:05.601
It's basically a matter of deciding to do it.

00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:08.085
But people won't decide to do it

00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:10.464
until they recognize the need for it,

00:11:10.464 --> 00:11:11.962
and that's the problem that we have right now.

00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:14.745
So there's been plenty of people,

00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:17.789
plenty of us have been quietly arguing

00:11:17.789 --> 00:11:20.707
that we should have this independent system for years,

00:11:20.707 --> 00:11:23.716
but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:27.390
when plan A seems to be working so well.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.819
So I think that, if people understand

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:33.873
how much we're starting to depend on the Internet,

00:11:33.873 --> 00:11:35.850
and how vulnerable it is,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.956
we could get focused on

00:11:37.956 --> 00:11:40.980
just wanting this other system to exist,

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.057
and I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it,

00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:47.067
I'd like to have such a system," then it will get built.

00:11:47.067 --> 00:11:48.490
It's not that hard a problem.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.725
It could definitely be done by people in this room.

00:11:51.725 --> 00:11:56.084
And so I think that this is actually,

00:11:56.084 --> 00:11:59.263
of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference,

00:11:59.263 --> 00:12:01.941
this is probably one of the very easiest to fix.

00:12:01.941 --> 00:12:04.708
So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it.

00:12:04.708 --> 00:12:07.319
Thank you very much.

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:11.173
