00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:04.507
When I was little, I thought my country
was the best on the planet.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.111
And I grew up singing a song
called "Nothing To Envy."

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:10.682
And I was very proud.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.605
In school, we spent a lot of time
studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.704
but we never learned much
about the outside world,

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:22.925
except that America, South Korea,
Japan are the enemies.

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:27.195
Although I often wondered
about the outside world,

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.859
I thought I would spend
my entire life in North Korea,

00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:33.267
until everything suddenly changed.

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:39.108
When I was seven years old,
I saw my first public execution.

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:42.200
But I thought my life
in North Korea was normal.

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:44.693
My family was not poor,

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:47.946
and myself, I had never
experienced hunger.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:52.955
But one day, in 1995,
my mom brought home a letter

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.979
from a coworker's sister.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.014
It read, "When you read this,

00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:02.870
our five family members
will not exist in this world,

00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:05.832
because we haven't eaten
for the past three weeks.

00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:09.409
We are lying on the floor together,

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:15.102
and our bodies are so weak,
we are waiting to die."

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:20.131
I was so shocked.

00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:26.084
This was the first time I heard
that people in my country were suffering.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.000
Soon after, when I was walking
past a train station,

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:35.206
I saw something terrible that to this day
I can't erase from my memory.

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:39.377
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:42.566
while an emaciated child in her arms

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.825
just stared helplessly
at his mother's face.

00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:49.398
But nobody helped them,

00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:54.363
because they were so focused on taking
care of themselves and their families.

00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:59.616
A huge famine hit North Korea
in the mid-1990s.

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:04.766
Ultimately, more than a million
North Koreans died during the famine,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.356
and many only survived by eating
grass, bugs and tree bark.

00:02:11.683 --> 00:02:14.943
Power outages also became
more and more frequent,

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:19.382
so everything around me
was completely dark at night,

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.852
except for the sea of lights in China,

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:24.382
just across the river from my home.

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:28.628
I always wondered
why they had lights, but we didn't.

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:33.976
This is a satellite picture
showing North Korea at night,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.521
compared to neighbors.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:39.355
This is the Amnok River,

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.833
which serves as a part of the border
between North Korea and China.

00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:48.549
As you can see, the river can be
very narrow at certain points,

00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:51.444
allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:54.412
But many die.

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:59.204
Sometimes, I saw dead bodies
floating down the river.

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:07.103
I can't reveal many details
about how I left North Korea,

00:03:07.127 --> 00:03:11.265
but I only can say that
during the ugly years of the famine,

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:15.863
I was sent to China to live
with distant relatives.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.983
But I only thought that I would
be separated from my family

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:22.575
for a short time.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.515
I could have never imagined

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.784
that it would take 14 years
to live together.

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.062
In China, it was hard living
as a young girl without my family.

00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:36.405
I had no idea what life
was going to be like

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:37.912
as a North Korean refugee.

00:03:38.476 --> 00:03:42.069
But I soon learned it's not
only extremely difficult,

00:03:42.093 --> 00:03:44.491
it's also very dangerous,

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:51.228
since North Korean refugees are considered
in China as illegal migrants.

00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:56.733
So I was living in constant fear
that my identity could be revealed,

00:03:56.757 --> 00:04:00.108
and I would be repatriated
to a horrible fate,

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:01.826
back in North Korea.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.667
One day, my worst nightmare came true,

00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:08.414
when I was caught by the Chinese police,

00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:12.505
and brought to the police station
for interrogation.

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:16.187
Someone had accused me
of being North Korean,

00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:19.592
so they tested my Chinese
language abilities,

00:04:19.616 --> 00:04:22.162
and asked me tons of questions.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.392
I was so scared.

00:04:25.352 --> 00:04:27.487
I thought my heart was going to explode.

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:33.021
If anything seemed unnatural,
I could be imprisoned and repatriated.

00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:35.735
I thought my life was over.

00:04:36.632 --> 00:04:39.508
But I managed to control
all the emotions inside me,

00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:41.277
and answer the questions.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.638
After they finished questioning me,

00:04:43.662 --> 00:04:46.087
one official said to another,

00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.277
"This was a false report.
She's not North Korean."

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:52.823
And they let me go. It was a miracle.

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:58.426
Some North Koreans in China
seek asylum in foreign embassies.

00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:02.681
But many can be caught
by the Chinese police,

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:03.965
and repatriated.

00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:06.167
These girls were so lucky.

00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:07.856
Even though they were caught,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.587
they were eventually released,
after heavy international pressure.

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:15.926
These North Koreans were not so lucky.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.948
Every year, countless North Koreans
are caught in China

00:05:19.972 --> 00:05:22.543
and repatriated to North Korea,

00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:27.746
where they can be tortured, imprisoned,
or publicly executed.

00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:31.857
Even though I was
really fortunate to get out,

00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:34.713
many other North Koreans
have not been so lucky.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.716
It's tragic that North Koreans
have to hide their identities

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.981
and struggle so hard just to survive.

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:45.948
Even after learning a new
language and getting a job,

00:05:45.972 --> 00:05:49.591
their whole world can be turned
upside down in an instant.

00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:53.759
That's why, after 10 years
of hiding my identity,

00:05:53.783 --> 00:05:57.115
I decided to risk going to South Korea.

00:05:57.964 --> 00:06:00.922
And I started a new life yet again.

00:06:00.946 --> 00:06:02.534
Settling down in South Korea

00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:05.569
was a lot more challenging
than I had expected.

00:06:06.331 --> 00:06:09.664
English was so important in South Korea,

00:06:09.688 --> 00:06:12.251
so I had to start learning
my third language.

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:17.997
Also, I realized there was a wide gap
between North and South.

00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.174
We are all Korean, but inside,

00:06:20.198 --> 00:06:24.923
we have become very different,
due to 67 years of division.

00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:28.911
I even went through an identity crisis.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.308
Am I South Korean or North Korean?

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.430
Where am I from? Who am I?

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.955
Suddenly, there was no country
I could proudly call my own.

00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:47.454
Even though adjusting to life
in South Korea was not easy,

00:06:47.478 --> 00:06:51.779
I made a plan -- I started studying
for the university entrance exam.

00:06:52.323 --> 00:06:56.061
Just as I was starting
to get used to my new life,

00:06:56.085 --> 00:06:58.521
I received a shocking phone call.

00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:01.251
The North Korean authorities
intercepted some money

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:02.910
that I sent to my family,

00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:07.956
and, as a punishment, my family
was going to be forcibly removed

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.773
to a desolate location in the countryside.

00:07:11.503 --> 00:07:13.154
They had to get out quickly.

00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:16.726
So I started planning
how to help them escape.

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.105
North Koreans have to travel
incredible distances

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:22.883
on the path to freedom.

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.358
It's almost impossible to cross the border

00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:29.315
between North Korea and South Korea.

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:32.682
So, ironically, I took
a flight back to China

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:35.728
and headed toward the North Korean border.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:39.521
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese,

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:44.394
I had to guide them somehow
through more than 2,000 miles

00:07:44.418 --> 00:07:47.965
in China, and then into Southeast Asia.

00:07:48.743 --> 00:07:50.837
The journey by bus took one week,

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:53.582
and we were almost caught several times.

00:07:54.201 --> 00:08:00.336
One time, our bus was stopped
and boarded by a Chinese police officer.

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.102
He took everyone's I.D. cards,

00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:05.843
and he started asking them questions.

00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:10.645
Since my family couldn't
understand Chinese,

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:13.205
I thought my family
was going to be arrested.

00:08:13.832 --> 00:08:16.553
As the Chinese officer
approached my family,

00:08:16.577 --> 00:08:19.231
I impulsively stood up, and I told him

00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:23.318
that these are deaf and dumb people
that I was chaperoning.

00:08:24.017 --> 00:08:26.108
He looked at me suspiciously,

00:08:26.132 --> 00:08:29.104
but luckily, he believed me.

00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:32.897
We made it all the way
to the border of Laos.

00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:37.968
But I had to spend almost all my money

00:08:37.992 --> 00:08:40.206
to bribe the border guards in Laos.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.327
But even after we got past the border,

00:08:43.351 --> 00:08:48.278
my family was arrested and jailed
for illegal border crossing.

00:08:48.809 --> 00:08:50.957
After I paid the fine and bribe,

00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:53.950
my family was released in one month.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.552
But soon after, my family
was arrested and jailed again,

00:08:58.576 --> 00:09:00.410
in the capital of Laos.

00:09:01.568 --> 00:09:04.689
This was one of the lowest
points in my life.

00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:10.758
I did everything to get
my family to freedom,

00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:13.132
and we came so close,

00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:15.429
but my family was thrown in jail,

00:09:15.453 --> 00:09:18.424
just a short distance
from the South Korean embassy.

00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:22.053
I went back and forth
between the immigration office

00:09:22.077 --> 00:09:23.955
and the police station,

00:09:23.979 --> 00:09:26.892
desperately trying to get my family out.

00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:30.599
but I didn't have enough money
to pay a bribe or fine anymore.

00:09:31.099 --> 00:09:32.488
I lost all hope.

00:09:32.924 --> 00:09:36.686
At that moment, I heard
one man's voice ask me,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.823
"What's wrong?"

00:09:37.847 --> 00:09:42.795
I was so surprised that a total stranger
cared enough to ask.

00:09:43.502 --> 00:09:45.907
In my broken English,
and with a dictionary,

00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:49.861
I explained the situation,
and without hesitating,

00:09:49.885 --> 00:09:52.132
the man went to the ATM,

00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:54.909
and he paid the rest
of the money for my family,

00:09:54.933 --> 00:09:58.002
and two other North Koreans
to get out of jail.

00:09:59.192 --> 00:10:02.525
I thanked him with all my heart,
and I asked him,

00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:04.225
"Why are you helping me?"

00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:06.686
"I'm not helping you," he said.

00:10:07.384 --> 00:10:09.479
"I'm helping the North Korean people."

00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:14.157
I realized that this
was a symbolic moment in my life.

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:20.039
The kind stranger symbolized new hope
for me and the North Korean people,

00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:21.531
when we needed it most.

00:10:22.014 --> 00:10:24.864
And he showed me
that the kindness of strangers

00:10:24.888 --> 00:10:27.868
and the support
of the international community

00:10:27.892 --> 00:10:31.751
are truly the rays of hope
we North Korean people need.

00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:35.284
Eventually, after our long journey,

00:10:35.308 --> 00:10:38.482
my family and I were reunited
in South Korea.

00:10:39.045 --> 00:10:41.990
But getting to freedom
is only half the battle.

00:10:42.577 --> 00:10:46.053
Many North Koreans
are separated from their families,

00:10:46.077 --> 00:10:48.637
and when they arrive in a new country,

00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:51.172
they start with little or no money.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.482
So we can benefit
from the international community

00:10:55.506 --> 00:11:00.298
for education, English language training,
job training, and more.

00:11:01.068 --> 00:11:02.885
We can also act as a bridge

00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:06.552
between the people inside North Korea
and the outside world.

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:12.505
Because many of us stay in contact
with family members still inside,

00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:14.673
and we send information and money

00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:17.903
that is helping to change
North Korea from inside.

00:11:19.332 --> 00:11:24.485
I've been so lucky, received
so much help and inspiration in my life,

00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:27.730
so I want to help give
aspiring North Koreans

00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:32.411
a chance to prosper
with international support.

00:11:33.561 --> 00:11:36.866
I'm confident that you will see
more and more North Koreans

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.017
succeeding all over the world,

00:11:39.041 --> 00:11:40.739
including the TED stage.
