00:00:00.354 --> 00:00:03.486
Chris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:05.642
would persuade you to think of trying

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:09.000
to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.402
Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.554
I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:17.626
to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?

00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:21.118
I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:23.477
and sustainable energy production.

00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:25.522
That sort of overall sustainable energy problem

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.021
is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.226
independent of environmental concerns.

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:33.143
In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,

00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:36.223
given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:40.278
we need to find some sustainable means of operating.

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:44.288
CA: Most of American electricity comes from

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:45.950
burning fossil fuels.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.565
How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?

00:00:50.565 --> 00:00:53.524
EM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.

00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:56.484
One is that, even if you take the same source fuel

00:00:56.484 --> 00:00:58.473
and produce power at the power plant

00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:01.367
and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:03.346
So if you take, say, natural gas,

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:05.954
which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:08.952
if you burn that in a modern

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:11.147
General Electric natural gas turbine,

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:12.985
you'll get about 60 percent efficiency.

00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:15.696
If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:17.596
you get about 20 percent efficiency.

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:19.176
And the reason is, in the stationary power plant,

00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:21.544
you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,

00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:23.259
is voluminous,

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.713
and you can take the waste heat

00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:26.082
and run a steam turbine and generate

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:27.866
a secondary power source.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.652
So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,

00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:35.056
even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:37.528
charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:39.639
CA: That scale delivers efficiency.

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.378
EM: Yes, it does.

00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:44.396
And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.799
of power generation anyway, electricity generation.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.868
So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:53.333
then it makes sense for us to have electric cars

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.908
as the mode of transport.

00:01:55.908 --> 00:01:57.343
CA: So we've got some video here

00:01:57.343 --> 00:01:59.834
of the Tesla being assembled,

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:02.548
which, if we could play that first video --

00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:07.492
So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle?

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:11.068
EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:13.138
and I should say that I think, actually,

00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:15.596
all modes of transport will become fully electric

00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:20.663
with the ironic exception of rockets.

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:23.420
There's just no way around Newton's third law.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.872
The question is how do you accelerate

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:28.452
the advent of electric transport?

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.900
And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.227
a really energy efficient car,

00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:35.084
so that means making it incredibly light,

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.110
and so what you're seeing here

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.856
is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:40.442
made in North America.

00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:43.130
In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.747
to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.

00:02:46.747 --> 00:02:48.907
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:50.275
of any car of its size.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:53.940
So as a result, the energy usage is very low,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.156
and it has the most advanced battery pack,

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.740
and that's what gives it the range that's competitive,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.679
so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:05.268
CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.539
but you think the math can still work out intelligently --

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.675
by combining light body, heavy battery,

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:12.948
you can still gain spectacular efficiency.

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:14.780
EM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.541
to offset the mass of the pack,

00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.570
and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.295
And in fact, customers of the Model S

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:24.374
are sort of competing with each other

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:27.393
to try to get the highest possible range.

00:03:27.393 --> 00:03:30.923
I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:34.011
CA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,

00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:36.601
broke the world record.EM: Congratulations.

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:38.213
CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that

00:03:38.213 --> 00:03:41.027
to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:44.939
and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter)

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.829
EM: I mean, you can certainly drive --

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.467
if you drive it 65 miles an hour,

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:53.431
under normal conditions,

00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.315
250 miles is a reasonable number.

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:56.453
CA: Let's show that second video

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.299
showing the Tesla in action on ice.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.967
Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.

00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:04.382
What is the most surprising thing about the experience

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:05.890
of driving the car?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.368
EM: In creating an electric car,

00:04:07.368 --> 00:04:09.766
the responsiveness of the car is really incredible.

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:12.453
So we wanted really to have people feel as though

00:04:12.453 --> 00:04:14.556
they've almost got to mind meld with the car,

00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:17.730
so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.776
and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:23.610
like the car has ESP.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.106
You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.

00:04:26.106 --> 00:04:28.233
You can't do that with a gasoline car.

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.215
I think that's really a profound difference,

00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:33.002
and people only experience that when they have a test drive.

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:37.296
CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:40.871
Is there a road map where this becomes

00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.450
a mass-market vehicle?

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.010
EM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.282
to have a sort of three-step process,

00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:51.048
where version one was an expensive car at low volume,

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:54.113
version two is medium priced and medium volume,

00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:56.402
and then version three would be low price, high volume.

00:04:56.402 --> 00:04:58.085
So we're at step two at this point.

00:04:58.085 --> 00:05:01.035
So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.

00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:04.034
Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.

00:05:04.034 --> 00:05:06.138
And our third generation car, which should hopefully

00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:07.867
be out in about three or four years

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:10.522
will be a $30,000 car.

00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:13.004
But whenever you've got really new technology,

00:05:13.004 --> 00:05:15.098
it generally takes about three major versions

00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:18.318
in order to make it a compelling mass-market product.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.042
And so I think we're making progress in that direction,

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:23.314
and I feel confident that we'll get there.

00:05:23.314 --> 00:05:25.223
CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,

00:05:25.223 --> 00:05:28.971
you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.

00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:33.218
There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.

00:05:33.218 --> 00:05:36.058
Do you see that coming, really, truly,

00:05:36.058 --> 00:05:38.311
or just on a few key routes?

00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:41.186
EM: There actually are far more charging stations

00:05:41.186 --> 00:05:43.411
than people realize,

00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:45.770
and at Tesla we developed something

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.978
called a Supercharging technology,

00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:51.290
and we're offering that if you buy a Model S

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.755
for free, forever.

00:05:52.755 --> 00:05:55.410
And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.240
We actually have California and Nevada covered,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.514
and we've got the Eastern seaboard

00:06:00.514 --> 00:06:02.766
from Boston to D.C. covered.

00:06:02.766 --> 00:06:04.148
By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive

00:06:04.148 --> 00:06:06.291
from L.A. to New York

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.893
just using the Supercharger network,

00:06:07.893 --> 00:06:12.110
which charges at five times the rate of anything else.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.536
And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:19.535
to stop time, of about six or seven.

00:06:19.535 --> 00:06:21.765
So if you drive for three hours,

00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:23.403
you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:25.900
because that's normally what people will stop for.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.020
So if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.558
by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,

00:06:30.558 --> 00:06:32.297
hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going.

00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:35.654
CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:39.630
So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.597
Wait for an hour, but the good news is,

00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:43.036
you're helping save the planet,

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.729
and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything.

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.593
EM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people

00:06:47.593 --> 00:06:51.118
to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.

00:06:51.118 --> 00:06:58.846
It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles

00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:00.944
and then stop for half an hour

00:07:00.944 --> 00:07:02.309
and then keep going.

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.591
That's the natural cadence of a trip.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:09.972
CA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.

00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:12.614
You've been working on this solar company SolarCity.

00:07:12.614 --> 00:07:15.126
What's unusual about that?

00:07:15.126 --> 00:07:17.486
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,

00:07:17.486 --> 00:07:21.126
we have to have sustainable electricity production

00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:22.774
as well as consumption,

00:07:22.774 --> 00:07:26.596
so I'm quite confident that the primary means

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:29.077
of power generation will be solar.

00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:31.412
I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.

00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:34.646
We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,

00:07:34.646 --> 00:07:37.538
and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:40.414
for purposes of human civilization.

00:07:40.414 --> 00:07:42.420
What most people know but don't realize they know

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.774
is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.

00:07:45.774 --> 00:07:49.014
If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball

00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:51.176
at three degrees Kelvin,

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:54.974
and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.630
The whole ecosystem is solar-powered.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.981
CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,

00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:02.245
effectively, thousands of years of sun power

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.310
compressed into a small space,

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.289
so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar,

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:10.378
and to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas,

00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:13.822
fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here?

00:08:13.822 --> 00:08:17.131
EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar

00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:21.047
will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas.

00:08:21.047 --> 00:08:23.434
(Applause)CA: How?

00:08:23.434 --> 00:08:27.007
EM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble.

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:30.041
CA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers.

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:31.192
What are you doing?

00:08:31.192 --> 00:08:34.440
EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.982
or you can lease a solar system.

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.972
Most people choose to lease.

00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:40.038
And the thing about solar power is that

00:08:40.038 --> 00:08:42.789
it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs,

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.014
so once it's installed, it's just there.

00:08:46.014 --> 00:08:50.515
It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.

00:08:50.515 --> 00:08:53.453
So therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost

00:08:53.453 --> 00:08:55.428
of that initial installation low,

00:08:55.428 --> 00:08:58.063
and then get the cost of the financing low,

00:08:58.063 --> 00:09:01.687
because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.

00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:05.103
And we've made huge progress in that direction,

00:09:05.103 --> 00:09:08.671
and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas.

00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:11.448
CA: So your current proposition to consumers is,

00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:13.664
don't pay so much up front.

00:09:13.664 --> 00:09:16.344
EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.

00:09:16.344 --> 00:09:18.983
We will install panels on your roof.

00:09:18.983 --> 00:09:22.584
You will then pay, how long is a typical lease?

00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:25.828
EM: Typical leases are 20 years,

00:09:25.828 --> 00:09:30.491
but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.

00:09:30.491 --> 00:09:34.641
It's no money down, and your utility bill decreases.

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.521
Pretty good deal.

00:09:36.521 --> 00:09:38.434
CA: So that seems like a win for the consumer.

00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:40.889
No risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now.

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:43.284
For you, the dream here then is that --

00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:48.059
I mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term?

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:51.241
I mean, how do you, the company, benefit?

00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:54.783
EM: Well, essentially,

00:09:54.783 --> 00:10:00.670
SolarCity raises a chunk of capital

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.340
from say, a company or a bank.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.553
Google is one of our big partners here.

00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:08.977
And they have an expected return on that capital.

00:10:08.977 --> 00:10:13.363
With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:16.809
and then charges the homeowner or business owner

00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:20.519
a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:24.032
CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.

00:10:24.032 --> 00:10:27.796
You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility.

00:10:27.796 --> 00:10:29.471
EM: Exactly. What it amounts to

00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:32.812
is a giant distributed utility.

00:10:32.812 --> 00:10:35.695
I think it's a good thing, because utilities

00:10:35.695 --> 00:10:38.532
have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.

00:10:38.532 --> 00:10:40.627
So effectively it's the first time

00:10:40.627 --> 00:10:43.892
there's been competition for this monopoly,

00:10:43.892 --> 00:10:46.892
because the utilities have been the only ones

00:10:46.892 --> 00:10:49.539
that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.

00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:51.430
So I think it's actually very empowering

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.067
for homeowners and businesses.

00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:55.425
CA: And you really picture a future

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:59.344
where a majority of power in America,

00:10:59.344 --> 00:11:04.046
within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?

00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:09.844
EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,

00:11:09.844 --> 00:11:11.956
and most likely a majority,

00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:17.216
and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.

00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:20.684
I made that bet with someone —CA: Definition of plurality is?

00:11:20.684 --> 00:11:22.430
EM: More from solar than any other source.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.188
CA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with?

00:11:26.188 --> 00:11:29.588
EM: With a friend who will remain nameless.

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:33.908
CA: Just between us. (Laughter)

00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:36.700
EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.503
so in roughly 18 years,

00:11:38.503 --> 00:11:42.060
I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.829
CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:46.045
with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.

00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:50.822
You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.

00:11:50.822 --> 00:11:53.258
You decided to build a space company.

00:11:53.258 --> 00:11:55.331
Why on Earth would someone do that?

00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:57.511
(Laughter)

00:11:57.511 --> 00:12:00.324
EM: I got that question a lot, that's true.

00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:02.583
People would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy

00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:05.484
who made a small fortune in the space industry?"

00:12:05.484 --> 00:12:09.732
Obviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline.

00:12:09.732 --> 00:12:12.278
And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out

00:12:12.278 --> 00:12:14.565
the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.

00:12:14.565 --> 00:12:17.606
And they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?"

00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:22.668
CA: And strangely, you were. So what happened?

00:12:22.668 --> 00:12:25.850
EM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.600
We came very close to failure,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.734
but we managed to get through that point in 2008.

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:36.884
The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,

00:12:36.884 --> 00:12:38.838
and in particular to try to crack a problem

00:12:38.838 --> 00:12:40.422
that I think is vital

00:12:40.422 --> 00:12:42.449
for humanity to become a space-faring civilization,

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:47.333
which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:50.424
CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?

00:12:50.424 --> 00:12:54.438
So that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?

00:12:54.438 --> 00:12:57.817
You've dreamed of Mars and beyond?

00:12:57.817 --> 00:12:59.953
EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,

00:12:59.953 --> 00:13:01.349
but I didn't think I'd be involved in this.

00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:03.334
It was really more from the standpoint of

00:13:03.334 --> 00:13:07.204
what are the things that need to happen in order for

00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:10.024
the future to be an exciting and inspiring one?

00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:14.113
And I really think there's a fundamental difference,

00:13:14.113 --> 00:13:15.509
if you sort of look into the future,

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:18.966
between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:22.081
that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,

00:13:22.081 --> 00:13:24.293
and I think that's really exciting,

00:13:24.293 --> 00:13:27.464
compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth

00:13:27.464 --> 00:13:29.752
until some eventual extinction event.

00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:31.504
CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building

00:13:31.504 --> 00:13:34.848
a rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.

00:13:34.848 --> 00:13:37.127
How on Earth have you done that?

00:13:37.127 --> 00:13:40.238
NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this?

00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:42.639
EM: Well, we've made significant advances

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:45.402
in the technology of the airframe, the engines,

00:13:45.402 --> 00:13:48.623
the electronics and the launch operation.

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:51.344
There's a long list of innovations

00:13:51.344 --> 00:13:53.512
that we've come up with there

00:13:53.512 --> 00:13:59.187
that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but --

00:13:59.187 --> 00:14:02.600
CA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.215
You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me.

00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:07.455
EM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's

00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:10.203
more dangerous to patent than not to patent.

00:14:10.203 --> 00:14:12.899
EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments,

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:17.368
the enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:17.368 --> 00:14:20.787
CA: That's really, really interesting.

00:14:20.787 --> 00:14:23.416
But the big innovation is still ahead,

00:14:23.416 --> 00:14:26.155
and you're working on it now. Tell us about this.

00:14:26.155 --> 00:14:27.844
EM: Right, so the big innovation—

00:14:27.844 --> 00:14:32.081
CA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here.

00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:36.155
EM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that

00:14:36.155 --> 00:14:37.697
they're all expendable.

00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:39.959
All rockets that fly today are fully expendable.

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:42.093
The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,

00:14:42.093 --> 00:14:45.019
but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:47.115
and the parts that were reusable

00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:52.171
took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.

00:14:52.171 --> 00:14:55.757
So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.

00:14:55.757 --> 00:14:57.939
Obviously that doesn't work very well for —

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:01.159
CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land?

00:15:01.159 --> 00:15:05.490
EM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.855
be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site

00:15:08.855 --> 00:15:11.872
and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours.

00:15:11.872 --> 00:15:16.555
CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause)

00:15:16.555 --> 00:15:19.763
And so what a lot of people don't realize is,

00:15:19.763 --> 00:15:22.361
the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.

00:15:22.361 --> 00:15:24.065
It's much like on a jet.

00:15:24.065 --> 00:15:27.581
So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent

00:15:27.581 --> 00:15:29.483
of the cost of the rocket.

00:15:29.483 --> 00:15:31.635
So it's possible to achieve, let's say,

00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:34.475
roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:37.555
if you can effectively reuse the rocket.

00:15:37.555 --> 00:15:38.995
That's why it's so important.

00:15:38.995 --> 00:15:41.217
Every mode of transport that we use,

00:15:41.217 --> 00:15:44.147
whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,

00:15:44.147 --> 00:15:46.483
is reusable, but not rockets.

00:15:46.483 --> 00:15:49.771
So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.

00:15:49.771 --> 00:15:51.238
CA: You asked me the question earlier

00:15:51.238 --> 00:15:55.033
of how popular traveling on cruises would be

00:15:55.033 --> 00:16:01.168
if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic.

00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:03.363
CA: Definitely more expensive.

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:07.334
So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology,

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:11.507
and, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take,

00:16:11.507 --> 00:16:15.304
at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale.

00:16:15.304 --> 00:16:17.586
You'd like to see a colony on Mars.

00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:21.138
EM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination

00:16:21.138 --> 00:16:24.171
of companies and governments, needs to make progress

00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:27.130
in the direction of making life multi-planetary,

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.762
of establishing a base on another planet,

00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:33.107
on Mars -- being the only realistic option --

00:16:33.107 --> 00:16:34.489
and then building that base up

00:16:34.489 --> 00:16:37.438
until we're a true multi-planet species.

00:16:37.438 --> 00:16:40.411
CA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable,"

00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:44.230
how is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.335
How's it going?

00:16:45.335 --> 00:16:48.499
EM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently

00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:51.083
with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project,

00:16:51.083 --> 00:16:55.259
where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight,

00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:58.008
the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky.

00:16:58.008 --> 00:17:01.044
And we've had some good tests.

00:17:01.044 --> 00:17:03.105
CA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah.

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:04.748
So that's just to give a sense of scale.

00:17:04.748 --> 00:17:06.188
We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash

00:17:06.188 --> 00:17:10.043
and bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter)

00:17:10.043 --> 00:17:11.995
CA: All right, let's see that video then,

00:17:11.995 --> 00:17:14.026
because this is actually amazing when you think about it.

00:17:14.026 --> 00:17:19.733
You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then --

00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:21.651
EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size

00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:24.277
of a 12-story building.

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:30.247
(Rocket launch)

00:17:35.098 --> 00:17:39.071
So now it's hovering at about 40 meters,

00:17:39.071 --> 00:17:40.947
and it's constantly adjusting

00:17:40.947 --> 00:17:43.908
the angle, the pitch 
and yaw of the main engine,

00:17:43.908 --> 00:17:47.539
and maintaining roll 
with cold gas thrusters.

00:17:54.046 --> 00:18:00.359
CA: How cool is that? (Applause)

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:05.033
Elon, how have you done this?

00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:10.347
These projects are so -- Paypal, SolarCity,

00:18:10.347 --> 00:18:13.025
Tesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different,

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:15.610
they're such ambitious projects at scale.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.074
How on Earth has one person

00:18:18.074 --> 00:18:20.549
been able to innovate in this way?

00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:22.386
What is it about you?

00:18:22.386 --> 00:18:27.782
EM: I don't know, actually.

00:18:27.782 --> 00:18:30.022
I don't have a good answer for you.

00:18:30.022 --> 00:18:33.657
I work a lot. I mean, a lot.

00:18:33.657 --> 00:18:35.970
CA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.534
CA: My theory is that you

00:18:39.534 --> 00:18:43.690
have an ability to think at a system level of design

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.333
that pulls together design, technology and business,

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:50.809
so if TED was TBD, design, technology and business,

00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:53.306
into one package,

00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:55.665
synthesize it in a way that very few people can and --

00:18:55.665 --> 00:18:59.759
and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident

00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:04.375
in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks.

00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:09.254
You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.

00:19:09.254 --> 00:19:11.351
I mean, almost no one can do that.

00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:14.623
Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce?

00:19:14.623 --> 00:19:18.047
Can we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?

00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:19.786
It is truly amazing what you've done.

00:19:19.786 --> 00:19:21.795
EM: Well, thanks. Thank you.

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:26.605
Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking.

00:19:26.605 --> 00:19:29.229
It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.

00:19:29.229 --> 00:19:33.967
Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is,

00:19:33.983 --> 00:19:37.358
boil things down to their fundamental truths

00:19:37.358 --> 00:19:38.749
and reason up from there,

00:19:38.749 --> 00:19:41.335
as opposed to reasoning by analogy.

00:19:41.335 --> 00:19:43.549
Through most of our life, we get through life

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:44.637
by reasoning by analogy,

00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:48.175
which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.

00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:49.655
And you have to do that.

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:54.229
Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day.

00:19:54.229 --> 00:19:56.373
But when you want to do something new,

00:19:56.373 --> 00:20:00.105
you have to apply the physics approach.

00:20:00.105 --> 00:20:02.353
Physics is really figuring out how to discover

00:20:02.353 --> 00:20:04.998
new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.

00:20:04.998 --> 00:20:06.901
It's really counterintuitive.

00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:09.422
So I think that's an important thing to do,

00:20:09.422 --> 00:20:13.980
and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.101
and solicit it, particularly from friends.

00:20:16.101 --> 00:20:19.567
This may sound like simple advice,

00:20:19.567 --> 00:20:21.989
but hardly anyone does that,

00:20:21.989 --> 00:20:24.341
and it's incredibly helpful.

00:20:24.341 --> 00:20:27.703
CA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.

00:20:27.703 --> 00:20:28.987
Learn from this man.

00:20:28.987 --> 00:20:32.477
Elon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED.

00:20:32.477 --> 00:20:35.887
EM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool.

00:20:35.887 --> 00:20:38.148
Look at that. (Applause)

00:20:38.148 --> 00:20:42.975
Just take a bow. That was fantastic.

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.436
Thank you so much.
