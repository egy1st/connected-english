00:00:00.723 --> 00:00:02.899
So let me ask for a show of hands.

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.091
How many people here are over the age of 48?

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:09.972
Well, there do seem to be a few.

00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:12.147
Well, congratulations,

00:00:12.147 --> 00:00:16.017
because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy,

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:19.115
you are now in excess of the average life span

00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:21.902
of somebody who was born in 1900.

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:25.436
But look what happened in the course of that century.

00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:27.098
If you follow that curve,

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:29.712
you'll see that it starts way down there.

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:32.181
There's that dip there for the 1918 flu.

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:34.603
And here we are at 2010,

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:37.659
average life expectancy of a child born today, age 79,

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:39.555
and we are not done yet.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:40.890
Now, that's the good news.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.731
But there's still a lot of work to do.

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:44.365
So, for instance, if you ask,

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.091
how many diseases do we now know

00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:49.150
the exact molecular basis?

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.708
Turns out it's about 4,000, which is pretty amazing,

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.944
because most of those molecular discoveries

00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:57.609
have just happened in the last little while.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.905
It's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned,

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:03.012
but how many of those 4,000 diseases

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:05.360
now have treatments available?

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.248
Only about 250.

00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:10.006
So we have this huge challenge, this huge gap.

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:12.586
You would think this wouldn't be too hard,

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:14.112
that we would simply have the ability

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:17.138
to take this fundamental information that we're learning

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:20.283
about how it is that basic biology teaches us

00:01:20.283 --> 00:01:22.185
about the causes of disease

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:25.211
and build a bridge across this yawning gap

00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:27.591
between what we've learned about basic science

00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:29.086
and its application,

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:32.343
a bridge that would look maybe something like this,

00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:35.955
where you'd have to put together a nice shiny way

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:38.923
to get from one side to the other.

00:01:38.923 --> 00:01:41.523
Well, wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy?

00:01:41.523 --> 00:01:43.668
Unfortunately, it's not.

00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:46.259
In reality, trying to go from fundamental knowledge

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.923
to its application is more like this.

00:01:48.923 --> 00:01:50.838
There are no shiny bridges.

00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:52.490
You sort of place your bets.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.451
Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat

00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:55.975
and a sailboat and a tugboat

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:57.703
and you set them off on their way,

00:01:57.703 --> 00:02:00.367
and the rains come and the lightning flashes,

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:01.881
and oh my gosh, there are sharks in the water

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:03.902
and the swimmer gets into trouble,

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:05.486
and, uh oh, the swimmer drowned

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:08.698
and the sailboat capsized,

00:02:08.698 --> 00:02:10.399
and that tugboat, well, it hit the rocks,

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.039
and maybe if you're lucky, somebody gets across.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.028
Well, what does this really look like?

00:02:15.028 --> 00:02:17.082
Well, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:20.083
What's a drug? A drug is made up

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.408
of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon,

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.659
oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.882
all cobbled together in a shape,

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:29.259
and it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact,

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.572
that particular drug is going to hit its target.

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:34.795
Is it going to land where it's supposed to?

00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:37.951
So look at this picture here -- a lot of shapes dancing around for you.

00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:40.338
Now what you need to do, if you're trying to develop

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:41.795
a new treatment for autism

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.014
or Alzheimer's disease or cancer

00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:45.806
is to find the right shape in that mix

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:48.723
that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe.

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:51.890
And when you look at what happens to that pipeline,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.391
you start out maybe with thousands,

00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:55.033
tens of thousands of compounds.

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:57.182
You weed down through various steps

00:02:57.182 --> 00:02:58.565
that cause many of these to fail.

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:01.905
Ultimately, maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these,

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:04.947
and if all goes well, 14 years after you started,

00:03:04.947 --> 00:03:06.958
you will get one approval.

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.988
And it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:11.132
for that one success.

00:03:11.132 --> 00:03:14.436
So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would,

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:15.644
and say, "How can we do better?"

00:03:15.644 --> 00:03:18.321
And that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning.

00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:20.134
How can we make this go faster?

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:23.199
How can we make it more successful?

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.540
Well, let me tell you about a few examples

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.796
where this has actually worked.

00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:29.747
One that has just happened in the last few months

00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:33.457
is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis.

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:35.111
But it's taken a long time to get there.

00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:39.713
Cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in 1989

00:03:39.713 --> 00:03:42.041
by my group working with another group in Toronto,

00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.176
discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:45.804
on chromosome 7.

00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:47.842
That picture you see there?

00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:49.945
Here it is. That's the same kid.

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:53.289
That's Danny Bessette, 23 years later,

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:54.568
because this is the year,

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.006
and it's also the year where Danny got married,

00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:00.063
where we have, for the first time, the approval by the FDA

00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:03.800
of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.738
based upon all this molecular understanding.

00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:07.162
That's the good news.

00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:10.791
The bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis,

00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:13.000
and it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.335
for that next generation to help him.

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:18.530
But it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.223
How do we go faster?

00:04:20.223 --> 00:04:22.921
Well, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology,

00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:25.585
and a very important technology that we depend on

00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:27.881
for all of this is the human genome,

00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:30.469
the ability to be able to look at a chromosome,

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.139
to unzip it, to pull out all the DNA,

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.089
and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code,

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:38.170
the A's, C's, G's and T's

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.441
that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things,

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:42.955
and the cost of doing this,

00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:45.610
which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.523
has in the course of the last 10 years

00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:49.922
fallen faster than Moore's Law, down to the point

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:53.929
where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced, or mine,

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:57.728
and we're headed for the $1,000 genome fairly soon.

00:04:57.728 --> 00:04:59.054
Well, that's exciting.

00:04:59.054 --> 00:05:02.864
How does that play out in terms of application to a disease?

00:05:02.864 --> 00:05:05.144
I want to tell you about another disorder.

00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:07.456
This one is a disorder which is quite rare.

00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:10.224
It's called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria,

00:05:10.224 --> 00:05:13.529
and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging.

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.312
Only about one in every four million kids has this disease,

00:05:17.312 --> 00:05:20.672
and in a simple way, what happens is,

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:23.373
because of a mutation in a particular gene,

00:05:23.373 --> 00:05:26.040
a protein is made that's toxic to the cell

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.337
and it causes these individuals to age

00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:30.921
at about seven times the normal rate.

00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:34.064
Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell.

00:05:34.064 --> 00:05:37.199
The normal cell, if you looked at it under the microscope,

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.088
would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell,

00:05:40.088 --> 00:05:43.967
which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries

00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:45.722
and it looks kind of like that.

00:05:45.722 --> 00:05:47.586
A progeria cell, on the other hand,

00:05:47.586 --> 00:05:50.688
because of this toxic protein called progerin,

00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:52.972
has these lumps and bumps in it.

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:55.987
So what we would like to do after discovering this

00:05:55.987 --> 00:05:57.839
back in 2003

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.057
is to come up with a way to try to correct that.

00:06:01.057 --> 00:06:04.145
Well again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways,

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:06.144
it was possible to pick

00:06:06.144 --> 00:06:08.761
one of those many, many compounds that might have been useful

00:06:08.761 --> 00:06:10.222
and try it out.

00:06:10.222 --> 00:06:12.797
In an experiment done in cell culture

00:06:12.797 --> 00:06:14.839
and shown here in a cartoon,

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.533
if you take that particular compound

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:20.789
and you add it to that cell that has progeria,

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.010
and you watch to see what happened,

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.972
in just 72 hours, that cell becomes,

00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:28.240
for all purposes that we can determine,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.082
almost like a normal cell.

00:06:30.082 --> 00:06:34.423
Well that was exciting, but would it actually work in a real human being?

00:06:34.423 --> 00:06:37.808
This has led, in the space of only four years

00:06:37.808 --> 00:06:41.309
from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial,

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:43.506
to a test of that very compound.

00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:45.469
And the kids that you see here

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.031
all volunteered to be part of this,

00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:49.492
28 of them,

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.587
and you can see as soon as the picture comes up

00:06:52.587 --> 00:06:55.969
that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:57.388
all afflicted by this disease,

00:06:57.388 --> 00:06:59.637
all looking quite similar to each other.

00:06:59.637 --> 00:07:01.311
And instead of telling you more about it,

00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:05.297
I'm going to invite one of them, Sam Berns from Boston,

00:07:05.297 --> 00:07:07.730
who's here this morning, to come up on the stage

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.950
and tell us about his experience

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.860
as a child affected with progeria.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.918
Sam is 15 years old. His parents, Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon,

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:18.039
both physicians, are here with us this morning as well.

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.577
Sam, please have a seat.

00:07:20.577 --> 00:07:27.897
(Applause)

00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:30.075
So Sam, why don't you tell these folks

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.450
what it's like being affected with this condition called progeria?

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.258
Sam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways.

00:07:37.258 --> 00:07:41.222
I cannot play sports or do physical activities,

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:44.426
but I have been able to take interest in things

00:07:44.426 --> 00:07:47.405
that progeria, luckily, does not limit.

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:49.962
But when there is something that I really do want to do

00:07:49.962 --> 00:07:52.979
that progeria gets in the way of, like marching band

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:56.405
or umpiring, we always find a way to do it,

00:07:56.405 --> 00:07:59.922
and that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life.

00:07:59.922 --> 00:08:01.632
(Applause)

00:08:01.632 --> 00:08:03.668
Francis Collins: So what would you like to say to researchers

00:08:03.668 --> 00:08:06.765
here in the auditorium and others listening to this?

00:08:06.765 --> 00:08:09.362
What would you say to them both about research on progeria

00:08:09.362 --> 00:08:11.248
and maybe about other conditions as well?

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:14.394
SB: Well, research on progeria has come so far

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:16.636
in less than 15 years,

00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:21.005
and that just shows the drive that researchers can have

00:08:21.005 --> 00:08:24.423
to get this far, and it really means a lot

00:08:24.423 --> 00:08:27.674
to myself and other kids with progeria,

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.498
and it shows that if that drive exists,

00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:33.099
anybody can cure any disease,

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:37.046
and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future,

00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:40.803
and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases

00:08:40.803 --> 00:08:43.810
that Francis was talking about.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.939
FC: Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today

00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:52.074
to be here, and he is — (Applause) --

00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:56.890
He is, by the way, a straight-A+ student in the ninth grade

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.223
in his school in Boston.

00:08:58.223 --> 00:09:00.424
Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam.

00:09:00.424 --> 00:09:04.077
SB: Thank you very much. FC: Well done. Well done, buddy.

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:15.895
(Applause)

00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:18.602
So I just want to say a couple more things

00:09:18.602 --> 00:09:21.734
about that particular story, and then try to generalize

00:09:21.734 --> 00:09:24.230
how could we have stories of success

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.743
all over the place for these diseases, as Sam says,

00:09:27.743 --> 00:09:30.262
these 4,000 that are waiting for answers.

00:09:30.262 --> 00:09:32.134
You might have noticed that the drug

00:09:32.134 --> 00:09:34.903
that is now in clinical trial for progeria

00:09:34.903 --> 00:09:36.667
is not a drug that was designed for that.

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:39.529
It's such a rare disease, it would be hard for a company

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:43.259
to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug.

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:45.419
This is a drug that was developed for cancer.

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:47.584
Turned out, it didn't work very well for cancer,

00:09:47.584 --> 00:09:49.907
but it has exactly the right properties, the right shape,

00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:52.799
to work for progeria, and that's what's happened.

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:56.027
Wouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically?

00:09:56.027 --> 00:09:59.823
Could we, in fact, encourage all the companies that are out there

00:09:59.823 --> 00:10:01.661
that have drugs in their freezers

00:10:01.661 --> 00:10:03.863
that are known to be safe in humans

00:10:03.863 --> 00:10:06.155
but have never actually succeeded in terms

00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:09.011
of being effective for the treatments they were tried for?

00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:11.395
Now we're learning about all these new molecular pathways --

00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:14.474
some of those could be repositioned or repurposed,

00:10:14.474 --> 00:10:16.873
or whatever word you want to use, for new applications,

00:10:16.873 --> 00:10:19.842
basically teaching old drugs new tricks.

00:10:19.842 --> 00:10:22.529
That could be a phenomenal, valuable activity.

00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:25.575
We have many discussions now between NIH and companies

00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:27.699
about doing this that are looking very promising.

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:30.313
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this.

00:10:30.313 --> 00:10:33.352
There are quite a number of success stories one can point to

00:10:33.352 --> 00:10:35.705
about how this has led to major advances.

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:37.912
The first drug for HIV/AIDS

00:10:37.912 --> 00:10:39.641
was not developed for HIV/AIDS.

00:10:39.641 --> 00:10:42.159
It was developed for cancer. It was AZT.

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:44.160
It didn't work very well for cancer, but became

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.276
the first successful antiretroviral,

00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:48.848
and you can see from the table there are others as well.

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:52.492
So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort?

00:10:52.492 --> 00:10:54.716
Well, we have to come up with a partnership

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:57.576
between academia, government, the private sector,

00:10:57.576 --> 00:11:00.029
and patient organizations to make that so.

00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:01.679
At NIH, we have started this new

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:04.879
National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:08.494
It just started last December, and this is one of its goals.

00:11:08.494 --> 00:11:09.935
Let me tell you another thing we could do.

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.854
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug

00:11:12.854 --> 00:11:15.225
to see if it's effective and safe

00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:17.326
without having to put patients at risk,

00:11:17.326 --> 00:11:19.879
because that first time you're never quite sure?

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.030
How do we know, for instance, whether drugs are safe

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.275
before we give them to people? We test them on animals.

00:11:25.275 --> 00:11:27.917
And it's not all that reliable, and it's costly,

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:29.607
and it's time-consuming.

00:11:29.607 --> 00:11:32.470
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.702
You probably know, if you've been paying attention

00:11:34.702 --> 00:11:36.002
to some of the science literature

00:11:36.002 --> 00:11:37.658
that you can now take a skin cell

00:11:37.658 --> 00:11:40.539
and encourage it to become a liver cell

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:43.614
or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us.

00:11:43.614 --> 00:11:46.766
So what if you used those cells as your test

00:11:46.766 --> 00:11:49.711
for whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe?

00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:53.942
Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip.

00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:57.463
This is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston,

00:11:57.463 --> 00:12:00.638
and what they have done here, if we can run the little video,

00:12:00.638 --> 00:12:02.774
is to take cells from an individual,

00:12:02.774 --> 00:12:05.883
turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung,

00:12:05.883 --> 00:12:07.688
and determine what would happen

00:12:07.688 --> 00:12:10.765
if you added to this various drug compounds

00:12:10.765 --> 00:12:13.230
to see if they are toxic or safe.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.501
You can see this chip even breathes.

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:18.118
It has an air channel. It has a blood channel.

00:12:18.118 --> 00:12:19.821
And it has cells in between

00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:22.259
that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound.

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:24.031
Are those cells happy or not?

00:12:24.031 --> 00:12:27.062
You can do this same kind of chip technology

00:12:27.062 --> 00:12:29.271
for kidneys, for hearts, for muscles,

00:12:29.271 --> 00:12:31.735
all the places where you want to see whether a drug

00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:34.016
is going to be a problem, for the liver.

00:12:34.016 --> 00:12:37.064
And ultimately, because you can do this for the individual,

00:12:37.064 --> 00:12:39.278
we could even see this moving to the point

00:12:39.278 --> 00:12:42.719
where the ability to develop and test medicines

00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:45.905
will be you on a chip, what we're trying to say here is

00:12:45.905 --> 00:12:49.406
the individualizing of the process of developing drugs

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:51.654
and testing their safety.

00:12:51.654 --> 00:12:53.306
So let me sum up.

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:55.566
We are in a remarkable moment here.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.669
For me, at NIH now for almost 20 years,

00:12:57.669 --> 00:13:00.270
there has never been a time where there was more excitement

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.855
about the potential that lies in front of us.

00:13:02.855 --> 00:13:04.647
We have made all these discoveries

00:13:04.647 --> 00:13:07.012
pouring out of laboratories across the world.

00:13:07.012 --> 00:13:10.374
What do we need to capitalize on this? First of all, we need resources.

00:13:10.374 --> 00:13:13.929
This is research that's high-risk, sometimes high-cost.

00:13:13.929 --> 00:13:15.900
The payoff is enormous, both in terms of health

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.780
and in terms of economic growth. We need to support that.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.081
Second, we need new kinds of partnerships

00:13:21.081 --> 00:13:23.302
between academia and government and the private sector

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:26.649
and patient organizations, just like the one I've been describing here,

00:13:26.649 --> 00:13:30.229
in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds.

00:13:30.229 --> 00:13:33.465
And third, and maybe most important, we need talent.

00:13:33.465 --> 00:13:35.606
We need the best and the brightest

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:38.463
from many different disciplines to come and join this effort --

00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:40.909
all ages, all different groups --

00:13:40.909 --> 00:13:42.996
because this is the time, folks.

00:13:42.996 --> 00:13:46.621
This is the 21st-century biology that you've been waiting for,

00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:49.083
and we have the chance to take that

00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:51.573
and turn it into something which will, in fact,

00:13:51.573 --> 00:13:53.903
knock out disease. That's my goal.

00:13:53.903 --> 00:13:55.787
I hope that's your goal.

00:13:55.787 --> 00:13:58.467
I think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets

00:13:58.467 --> 00:14:00.476
and the surfers and the bankers

00:14:00.476 --> 00:14:02.754
and all the other people who join this stage

00:14:02.754 --> 00:14:04.504
and think about what we're trying to do here

00:14:04.504 --> 00:14:05.669
and why it matters.

00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:08.439
It matters for now. It matters as soon as possible.

00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:11.557
If you don't believe me, just ask Sam.

00:14:11.557 --> 00:14:13.000
Thank you all very much.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.831
(Applause)
