00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:02.363
In 1991 I had

00:00:02.363 --> 00:00:05.121
maybe the most profound and transformative

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:06.687
experience of my life.

00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:11.414
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:13.605
I took a couple victory laps in there.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.827
And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California,

00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:20.484
and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus,

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:22.550
and we were relaxing next to this beautiful

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.739
idyllic lake in the mountains.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.135
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise,

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:31.851
and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in

00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:34.819
from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:36.292
rolling toward us,

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:38.939
and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley,

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:43.337
so help me God, every single animal in that place

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:45.553
stopped making noise at the same time.

00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:50.637
(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.

00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:52.697
And then the clouds came over us, and then,

00:00:52.697 --> 00:00:57.007
boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.469
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.472
I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz,

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:05.973
and decided to set it to music,

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:08.154
a piece for choir called "Cloudburst,"

00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:11.317
which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:15.692
Now fast forward to just three years ago.

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:19.133
(Music) And we released to YouTube this,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.389
the Virtual Choir Project,

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:24.596
185 singers from 12 different countries.

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:28.033
You can see my little video there conducting these people,

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:29.188
alone in their dorm rooms

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:32.277
or in their living rooms at home.

00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:36.003
Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.550
Virtual Choir 2,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.112
2,052 singers from 58 different countries,

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:47.403
this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."

00:01:47.403 --> 00:01:52.697
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3,

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:55.253
"Water Night," another piece that I had written,

00:01:55.253 --> 00:02:01.517
this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:06.936
(Music)

00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:09.943
And when I was speaking to Chris about the future

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:12.093
of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this,

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:16.854
he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:19.357
Could we do this all in real time?

00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:22.397
Could we have people singing together in real time?

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:23.992
And with the help of Skype,

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:26.096
that is what we are going to attempt today.

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:28.269
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.421
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.

00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:33.917
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach,

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:37.245
Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College,

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:40.565
some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and â€”

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:47.603
(Applause) --

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:49.789
and in the second half of the piece,

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.611
the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.661
from 30 different countries.

00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:57.245
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go,

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.077
but there's still less than a second of latency,

00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:02.156
but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:03.608
We deal in milliseconds.

00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:06.075
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst"

00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:08.578
so that it embraces the latency

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:11.483
and the performers sing into the latency

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.981
instead of trying to be exactly together.

00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:17.245
So with deep humility, and for your approval,

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:19.357
we present "Cloudburst."

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:24.076
(Applause)

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:27.833
(Piano)

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:34.785
[The rain ...]

00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:44.809
[Eyes of shadow-water]

00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:50.002
[eyes of well-water]

00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:11.275
[eyes of dream-water.]

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:21.451
[Blue suns, green whirlwinds,]

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.731
[birdbeaks of light pecking open]

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:45.459
[pomegranate stars.]

00:04:51.694 --> 00:04:57.898
[But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?]

00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:15.044
[Only blood, only dust,]

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:22.867
[only naked footsteps on the thorns?]

00:05:34.903 --> 00:05:38.587
[The rain awakens...]

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:55.583
[We must sleep with open eyes,]

00:05:55.583 --> 00:06:00.026
[we must dream with our hands,]

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.426
[we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,]

00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:17.090
[of the sun dreaming its worlds.]

00:06:27.628 --> 00:06:33.690
[We must dream aloud,]

00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:56.315
[we must sing till the song puts forth roots,]

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.899
[trunk, branches, birds, stars.]

00:07:45.475 --> 00:07:50.455
[We must find the lost word,]

00:08:00.322 --> 00:08:03.375
[and remember what the blood,]

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:12.658
[the tides, the earth, and the body say,]

00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:41.759
[and return to the point of departure...]

00:08:52.561 --> 00:09:02.415
(Music)

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:37.169
(Applause)

00:11:37.169 --> 00:11:39.478
["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre]

00:11:39.478 --> 00:11:46.881
Eric Whitacre: Beth. Annabelle, where are you? Jacob.

00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:51.413
(Applause)

00:12:08.622 --> 00:12:13.485
Thank you.
