WEBVTT

00:00:01.387 --> 00:00:05.106
Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:09.594
made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:13.698
Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:17.154
all harbor resident microbial landscapes.

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:19.914
As we design these things, we could be thinking

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:22.728
about designing these invisible worlds,

00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:24.971
and also thinking about how they interact

00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:27.727
with our personal ecosystems.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:31.370
Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.730
and these creatures define who we are.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.608
The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.

00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:41.066
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:44.075
The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath,

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:45.547
or not,

00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:48.526
and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems

00:00:48.526 --> 00:00:51.594
interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.

00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:53.186
So, for example, when you touch a pencil,

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.018
microbial exchange happens.

00:00:56.018 --> 00:01:00.914
If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:03.537
this opens a path to influencing

00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:06.928
our health in unprecedented ways.

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:09.392
I get asked all of the time from people,

00:01:09.392 --> 00:01:13.462
"Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"

00:01:13.462 --> 00:01:16.010
And I believe the answer is yes.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.935
I think we're doing it right now,

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:21.043
but we're doing it unconsciously.

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:23.008
I'm going to share data with you

00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:26.736
from one aspect of my research focused on architecture

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:29.862
that demonstrates how, through both conscious

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:32.072
and unconscious design,

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:35.081
we're impacting these invisible worlds.

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:39.310
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.994
and I worked with a team of architects and biologists

00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:46.168
to sample over 300 rooms in this building.

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:50.178
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building,

00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:53.488
and to do this, we sampled dust.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:57.396
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells,

00:01:57.396 --> 00:02:00.800
broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.527
This means that people in my group

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:05.840
were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.360
This is a picture of Tim, who,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.814
right when I snapped this picture, reminded me,

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:13.384
he said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in

00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:16.355
I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest,

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:20.112
and things have changed dramatically for me."

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:23.864
So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices,

00:02:23.864 --> 00:02:26.940
and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.480
that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.952
The way that you look at this data is,

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.530
first, look around the outside of the circle.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.552
You'll see broad bacterial groups,

00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:42.392
and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe,

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:45.408
it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:47.904
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of

00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:50.465
alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:54.660
you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.023
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.

00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:01.045
If you look inside the restrooms,

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:04.175
they all have really similar ecosystems,

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:06.503
and if you were to look inside the classrooms,

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:09.369
those also have similar ecosystems.

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.783
But if you look across these space types,

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:14.180
you can see that they're fundamentally different

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.335
from one another.

00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:19.328
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.

00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:21.815
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes,

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:25.854
it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."

00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:30.377
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:34.589
This perspective is a really powerful one for designers,

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.016
because you can bring on principles of ecology,

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:40.928
and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal,

00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:43.655
the way organisms move around.

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:47.839
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:48.910
and by air.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.747
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building

00:03:51.747 --> 00:03:53.600
was look at the air system.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.832
Mechanical engineers design air handling units

00:03:56.832 --> 00:03:59.024
to make sure that people are comfortable,

00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:01.577
that the air flow and temperature is just right.

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:05.121
They do this using principles of physics and chemistry,

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:09.495
but they could also be using biology.

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:11.607
If you look at the microbes

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:14.657
in one of the air handling units in this building,

00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:18.648
you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.

00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:22.183
And if you compare this to the microbes

00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:24.327
in a different air handling unit,

00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:27.039
you'll see that they're fundamentally different.

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.590
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.447
and what that means is that mechanical engineers

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:36.123
are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability

00:04:36.123 --> 00:04:41.707
to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.

00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:45.815
Another facet of how microbes get around is by people,

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:48.982
and designers often cluster rooms together

00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:51.037
to facilitate interactions among people,

00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:54.509
or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.183
Given that microbes travel around with people,

00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:59.856
you might expect to see rooms that are close together

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:02.111
have really similar biomes.

00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:04.591
And that is exactly what we found.

00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.758
If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another,

00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:09.957
they have very similar ecosystems,

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:13.096
but if you go to an office

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:16.144
that is a farther walking distance away,

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:18.880
the ecosystem is fundamentally different.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.425
And when I see the power that dispersal has

00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:25.705
on these biogeographic patterns,

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:28.264
it makes me think that it's possible

00:05:28.264 --> 00:05:32.000
to tackle really challenging problems,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.461
like hospital-acquired infections.

00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:37.067
I believe this has got to be, in part,

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:40.710
a building ecology problem.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.502
All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.

00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:47.967
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.

00:05:47.967 --> 00:05:49.508
He's an architect,

00:05:49.508 --> 00:05:54.841
and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.

00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:57.785
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.

00:05:57.785 --> 00:06:00.881
When he met me and realized that it was possible for him

00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:03.057
to study in a quantitative way

00:06:03.057 --> 00:06:05.633
how his design choices impacted

00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:08.593
the ecology and biology of this building,

00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:13.102
he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.

00:06:13.102 --> 00:06:14.970
He went from thinking just about energy

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.458
to also starting to think about human health.

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:22.319
He helped design some of the air handling systems

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.513
in this building and the way it was ventilated.

00:06:24.513 --> 00:06:27.235
So what I'm first going to show you is

00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:30.794
air that we sampled outside of the building.

00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:34.961
What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:38.937
in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.

00:06:38.937 --> 00:06:41.925
Next I'm going to show you what happened

00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:45.574
when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.

00:06:45.574 --> 00:06:47.189
We blocked them off at night

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.455
so that they got no ventilation.

00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:51.632
A lot of buildings are operated this way,

00:06:51.632 --> 00:06:53.383
probably where you work,

00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:56.354
and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.

00:06:56.354 --> 00:07:00.281
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant

00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:03.340
until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.922
When you walked into those rooms,

00:07:04.922 --> 00:07:06.897
they smelled really bad,

00:07:06.897 --> 00:07:09.999
and our data suggests that it had something to do with

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:13.066
leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:15.745
from people the day before.

00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:17.917
Contrast this to rooms

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:22.198
that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy

00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:25.978
where air came in from the outside through louvers.

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:30.775
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,

00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:32.910
and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.021
He felt like he had made a good choice

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.755
with the design process

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:39.150
because it was both energy efficient

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.439
and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:47.481
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture,

00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:49.994
but they're relevant to the design of anything.

00:07:49.994 --> 00:07:54.164
Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want

00:07:54.164 --> 00:07:55.582
in a plane

00:07:55.582 --> 00:07:58.515
or on a phone.

00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:00.969
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.849
It's called BLIS, and it's been shown

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:06.033
to both ward off pathogens

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.178
and give you good breath.

00:08:08.178 --> 00:08:14.197
Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?

00:08:14.197 --> 00:08:16.567
A conscious approach to design,

00:08:16.567 --> 00:08:19.448
I'm calling it bioinformed design,

00:08:19.448 --> 00:08:20.934
and I think it's possible.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:22.372
Thank you.

00:08:22.372 --> 00:08:26.125
(Applause)
