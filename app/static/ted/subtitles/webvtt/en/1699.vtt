00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:03.756
This is where I live. I live in Kenya,

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:06.823
at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:08.811
Those are my dad's cows at the back,

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.791
and behind the cows,

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:13.095
that's the Nairobi National Park.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.600
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.062
which means wild animals like zebras

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:23.983
migrate out of the park freely.

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:27.996
So predators like lions follow them,

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:30.791
and this is what they do.

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:33.792
They kill our livestock.

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:36.239
This is one of the cows which was killed at night,

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.279
and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:42.705
and I felt so bad,

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:47.192
because it was the only bull we had.

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:49.979
My community, the Maasai, we believe that

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:56.036
we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:59.811
for herding them, and that's why we value them so much.

00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:03.570
So I grew up hating lions so much.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.623
The morans are the warriors

00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:09.940
who protect our community and the livestock,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.019
and they're also upset about this problem.

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:16.024
So they kill the lions.

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:19.938
It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi.

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:24.477
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few.

00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:29.438
So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community

00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:32.312
is responsible for his dad's cows,

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:35.442
and that's the same thing which happened to me.

00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:38.857
So I had to find a way of solving this problem.

00:01:38.857 --> 00:01:43.671
And the first idea I got was to use fire,

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:47.464
because I thought lions were scared of fire.

00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:52.183
But I came to realize that that didn't really help,

00:01:52.183 --> 00:01:54.792
because it was even helping the lions

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:58.303
to see through the cowshed.

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:01.632
So I didn't give up. I continued.

00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:04.272
And a second idea I got was

00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:06.339
to use a scarecrow.

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:07.953
I was trying to trick the lions

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:10.860
[into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.936
But lions are very clever. (Laughter)

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:19.382
They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,

00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:22.656
but the second day, they'll come and they say,

00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:25.766
this thing is not moving here, it's always here. (Laughter)

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:29.003
So he jumps in and kills the animals.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.956
So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:36.799
and that day, the lions didn't come.

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.357
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.

00:02:41.357 --> 00:02:43.930
So I had an idea.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.240
Since I was a small boy,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.498
I used to work in my room for the whole day,

00:02:49.498 --> 00:02:52.604
and I even took apart my mom's new radio,

00:02:52.604 --> 00:02:54.422
and that day she almost killed me,

00:02:54.422 --> 00:03:00.676
but I learned a lot about electronics. (Laughter)

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:04.036
So I got an old car battery,

00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:07.826
an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:12.877
and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks.

00:03:12.877 --> 00:03:17.431
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:22.259
And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight.

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.140
So I set up everything.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.364
As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,

00:03:28.364 --> 00:03:30.485
and the battery supplies the power

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:33.540
to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.261
And the indicator box makes the lights flash.

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.012
As you can see, the bulbs face outside,

00:03:42.012 --> 00:03:44.500
because that's where the lions come from.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.564
And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.

00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:51.292
The lights flash and trick

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:53.234
the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,

00:03:53.234 --> 00:03:55.160
but I was sleeping in my bed.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.900
(Laughter)

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.569
(Applause)

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.164
Thanks.

00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:09.440
So I set it up in my home two years ago,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.760
and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.772
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea.

00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:19.236
One of them was this grandmother.

00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:23.512
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:25.646
and she asked me if I could put the lights for her.

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:26.924
And I said, "Yes."

00:04:26.924 --> 00:04:31.524
So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:34.940
Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.165
and they're really working.

00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:42.345
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya

00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:47.458
for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.693
and it's also being used

00:04:49.693 --> 00:04:53.738
to scare elephants away from people's farms.

00:04:53.738 --> 00:04:56.778
Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship

00:04:56.778 --> 00:04:59.428
in one of the best schools in Kenya,

00:04:59.428 --> 00:05:01.335
Brookhouse International School,

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:04.262
and I'm really excited about this.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:08.112
My new school now is coming in and helping

00:05:08.112 --> 00:05:12.644
by fundraising and creating an awareness.

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:17.927
I even took my friends back to my community,

00:05:17.927 --> 00:05:21.124
and we're installing the lights to the homes

00:05:21.124 --> 00:05:25.773
which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them.

00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:29.670
So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.344
herding my father's cows,

00:05:31.344 --> 00:05:34.298
and I used to see planes flying over,

00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:38.509
and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.597
And here I am today.

00:05:41.597 --> 00:05:47.533
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.

00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:52.969
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.663
I used to hate lions, but now because my invention

00:05:56.663 --> 00:05:59.981
is saving my father's cows and the lions,

00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:03.681
we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.

00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:06.901
Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much.

00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:17.801
(Applause)

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.682
Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is

00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:25.793
to hear a story like yours.

00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:27.829
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep.

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.406
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.

00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:32.264
What's the next one on your list?

00:06:32.264 --> 00:06:34.938
RT: My next invention is,

00:06:34.938 --> 00:06:37.520
I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.681
RT: But I know electric fences are already invented,

00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:41.918
but I want to make mine.

00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:44.009
(Laughter)

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.179
CA: You already tried it once, right, and you --RT: I tried it before,

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:53.936
but I stopped because it gave me a shock. (Laughter)

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:57.262
CA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.

00:06:57.262 --> 00:07:00.230
We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.787
Thank you so much.RT: Thank you. (Applause)
