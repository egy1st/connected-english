WEBVTT

00:00:00.946 --> 00:00:02.670
I'm here to show you

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.371
how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.

00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:10.174
You're about to experience a new, available

00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:13.154
and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:15.282
how we waterproof our lives.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.002
What I have here is a cinder block

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.498
that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:23.090
that can be applied to almost any material.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.427
It's called Ultra-Ever Dry,

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:27.853
and when you apply it to any material,

00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:30.958
it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.484
So this is a cinder block, uncoated,

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:37.785
and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:40.439
Not anymore.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:44.666
Porous, nonporous.

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.418
So what's superhydrophobic?

00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:49.911
Superhydrophobic is how we measure

00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:52.393
a drop of water on a surface.

00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:54.793
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is,

00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:57.721
and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.

00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.667
A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.607
to about 90 degrees.

00:01:03.607 --> 00:01:06.695
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:09.476
But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees,

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:13.488
and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.

00:01:13.488 --> 00:01:15.037
So as part of the demonstration,

00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:17.551
what I have is a pair of gloves,

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:19.719
and we've coated one of the gloves

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.423
with the nanotechnology coating,

00:01:22.423 --> 00:01:24.223
and let's see if you can tell which one,

00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:26.559
and I'll give you a hint.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.904
Did you guess the one that was dry?

00:01:35.904 --> 00:01:40.606
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience,

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:43.278
what's occurred is that we're able to now

00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:45.791
look at atoms and molecules and actually control them

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:48.223
for great benefits.

00:01:48.223 --> 00:01:50.222
And we're talking really small here.

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:52.494
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers,

00:01:52.494 --> 00:01:56.321
and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter,

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:57.968
and to put some scale to that,

00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:01.274
if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,

00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:04.089
and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them,

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:06.937
you'd be the width of a human hair.

00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:09.945
So very small, but very useful.

00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:12.849
And it's not just water that this works with.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.600
It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.769
water-based paint,

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.417
mud,

00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:22.800
and also some refined oils as well.

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:31.605
You can see the difference.

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.095
Moving onto the next demonstration,

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:35.389
we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it,

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.639
we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating,

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.414
and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle,

00:02:42.414 --> 00:02:44.375
and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:45.925
like you'd normally think it would,

00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:49.519
except when it hits the coating, it stops,

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.304
and I can't even coax it to leave.

00:02:53.304 --> 00:02:54.907
It's that afraid of the water.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.627
(Applause)

00:02:58.627 --> 00:03:00.379
So what's going on here? What's happening?

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.667
Well, the surface of the spray coating

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.428
is actually filled with nanoparticles

00:03:05.428 --> 00:03:07.502
that form a very rough and craggly surface.

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:10.091
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.

00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.862
And it has billions of interstitial spaces,

00:03:12.862 --> 00:03:15.971
and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles,

00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.323
reach up and grab the air molecules,

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.386
and cover the surface with air.

00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:23.131
It's an umbrella of air all across it,

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:25.771
and that layer of air is what the water hits,

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.819
the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.835
So if I put this inside this water here,

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:34.955
you can see a silver reflective coating around it,

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:36.411
and that silver reflective coating

00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:38.682
is the layer of air that's protecting the water

00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:42.449
from touching the paddle, and it's dry.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.837
So what are the applications?

00:03:47.837 --> 00:03:50.285
I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.

00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:51.783
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says,

00:03:51.783 --> 00:03:53.712
"Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."

00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:55.774
The applications in a general sense

00:03:55.774 --> 00:03:58.604
could be anything that's anti-wetting.

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:00.869
We've certainly seen that today.

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:03.453
It could be anything that's anti-icing,

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:06.908
because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.

00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:09.180
It could be anti-corrosion.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.206
No water, no corrosion.

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:13.404
It could be anti-bacterial.

00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:16.113
Without water, the bacteria won't survive.

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:19.932
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.501
So imagine how something like this

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:29.622
could help revolutionize your field of work.

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:32.021
And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration,

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.622
but before I do that, I would like to say thank you,

00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:36.665
and think small.

00:04:45.098 --> 00:04:52.646
(Applause)

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:57.035
It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.

00:04:57.035 --> 00:05:01.817
Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter)

00:05:01.817 --> 00:05:03.567
[Two minutes later...]

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:06.251
He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.

00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.814
It's happening!

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:12.814
(Applause)
