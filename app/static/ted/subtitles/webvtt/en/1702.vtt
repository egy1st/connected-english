00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:03.535
Once upon a time,

00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:06.975
there was a place called Lesterland.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.930
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.667
Like the United States, it has about 311 million people,

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.005
and of that 311 million people,

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:21.888
it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.016
If Matt's in the audience,

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:25.706
I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second,

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:28.371
this character from your series.

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.794
So 144,000 are called Lester,

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:35.074
which means about .05 percent is named Lester.

00:00:35.074 --> 00:00:38.802
Now, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power.

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:41.965
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland.

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:44.178
One is called the general election.

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:47.519
The other is called the Lester election.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.504
And in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:53.776
but in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:54.910
And here's the trick.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.561
In order to run in the general election,

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.107
you must do extremely well

00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:02.480
in the Lester election.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.581
You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.

00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:09.531
Now, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?

00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:10.924
What we can say, number one,

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:13.560
as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.838
that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials,

00:01:17.838 --> 00:01:20.486
because, after all, there is a general election,

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:23.438
but only after the Lesters have had their way

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.940
with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.543
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters

00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:33.305
is going to produce a subtle, understated,

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:35.734
we could say camouflaged, bending

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:38.925
to keep the Lesters happy.

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:42.194
Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt,

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:43.870
but it's dependent upon the Lesters

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.880
and dependent upon the people.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.522
It has competing dependencies,

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:50.932
we could say conflicting dependencies,

00:01:50.932 --> 00:01:55.202
depending upon who the Lesters are.

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.546
Okay. That's Lesterland.

00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:00.305
Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:03.546
Number one, the United States is Lesterland.

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:05.422
The United States is Lesterland.

00:02:05.422 --> 00:02:07.803
The United States also looks like this, also has two elections,

00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:10.942
one we called the general election,

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:14.186
the second we should call the money election.

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:16.352
In the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:18.946
if you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:22.162
In the money election, it's the funders who get to vote,

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:24.922
the funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland,

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:27.081
the trick is, to run in the general election,

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.901
you must do extremely well in the money election.

00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:32.522
You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:35.074
But you must do extremely well.

00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:39.602
And here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:45.091
in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland.

00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:46.995
Now you say, really?

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:50.138
Really .05 percent?

00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:52.354
Well, here are the numbers from 2010:

00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:54.650
.26 percent of America

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.386
gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate,

00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:01.850
.05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate,

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.282
.01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent --

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:08.490
gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.566
and in this election cycle, my favorite statistic

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:15.421
is .000042 percent

00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:19.458
— for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans —

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:23.418
gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent

00:03:23.418 --> 00:03:26.168
in the cycle we have just seen ending.

00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:28.898
So I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers,

00:03:28.898 --> 00:03:30.607
and I say it's fair for me to say

00:03:30.607 --> 00:03:34.858
it's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America.

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:38.160
In this sense, the funders are our Lesters.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.660
Now, what can we say about this democracy in USA-land?

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.002
Well, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:46.839
we could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:50.868
over the elected officials. We have a general election,

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:54.077
but only after the funders have had their way

00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:58.240
with the candidates who wish to run in that general election.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.763
And number two, obviously,

00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:03.035
this dependence upon the funders

00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:06.967
produces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:09.604
to keep the funders happy.

00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:12.648
Candidates for Congress and members of Congress

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:16.931
spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time

00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:19.107
raising money to get back to Congress

00:04:19.107 --> 00:04:20.882
or to get their party back into power,

00:04:20.882 --> 00:04:24.307
and the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them,

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:26.424
these humans, as they spend their time

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:29.843
behind the telephone, calling people they've never met,

00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:33.311
but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:35.679
As anyone would, as they do this,

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:39.527
they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness

00:04:39.527 --> 00:04:42.867
about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money.

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:44.283
They become, in the words of "The X-Files,"

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:47.727
shape-shifters, as they constantly adjust their views

00:04:47.727 --> 00:04:50.589
in light of what they know will help them to raise money,

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.158
not on issues one to 10,

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:55.253
but on issues 11 to 1,000.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.967
Leslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia,

00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:58.577
describes that when she went to Congress,

00:04:58.577 --> 00:05:02.502
she was told by a colleague, "Always lean to the green."

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.138
Then to clarify, she went on,

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:08.832
"He was not an environmentalist." (Laughter)

00:05:08.832 --> 00:05:10.912
So here too we have a democracy,

00:05:10.912 --> 00:05:12.927
a democracy dependent upon the funders

00:05:12.927 --> 00:05:14.714
and dependent upon the people,

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.851
competing dependencies,

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:18.870
possibly conflicting dependencies

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.481
depending upon who the funders are.

00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:25.242
Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.253
Here's point number two.

00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:30.035
The United States is worse than Lesterland,

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:32.916
worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.268
if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said,

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:38.532
"Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election,"

00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:42.683
we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.

00:05:42.683 --> 00:05:44.972
You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:47.620
There are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.348
not many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.

00:05:50.348 --> 00:05:52.476
We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think,

00:05:52.476 --> 00:05:55.484
"What could we do to make Lesterland better?"

00:05:55.484 --> 00:06:00.259
It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.502
But in our land, in this land, in USA-land,

00:06:03.502 --> 00:06:06.125
there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there,

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:08.097
many of them in this room here today,

00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:12.581
but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters,

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:16.969
because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.094
are not comprising it for the public interest.

00:06:19.094 --> 00:06:23.486
It's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland.

00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:25.907
And finally, point number three:

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:28.854
Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland,

00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:31.158
against the background of its history, its traditions,

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:36.101
in our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption,

00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:37.574
a corruption.

00:06:37.574 --> 00:06:41.597
Now, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash

00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:43.465
secreted among members of Congress.

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:46.525
I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption.

00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:48.430
I don't mean any criminal act.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.821
The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:56.874
It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.

00:06:56.874 --> 00:07:00.369
The framers gave us what they called a republic,

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:04.551
but by a republic they meant a representative democracy,

00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:07.738
and by a representative democracy, they meant a government,

00:07:07.738 --> 00:07:10.717
as Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch

00:07:10.717 --> 00:07:15.662
that would be dependent upon the people alone.

00:07:15.662 --> 00:07:16.677
So here's the model of government.

00:07:16.677 --> 00:07:19.282
They have the people and the government

00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:21.715
with this exclusive dependency,

00:07:21.715 --> 00:07:25.818
but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence,

00:07:25.818 --> 00:07:28.491
no longer a dependence upon the people alone,

00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:30.920
increasingly a dependence upon the funders.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.058
Now this is a dependence too,

00:07:34.058 --> 00:07:37.922
but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone

00:07:37.922 --> 00:07:42.228
so long as the funders are not the people.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.491
This is a corruption.

00:07:44.491 --> 00:07:46.991
Now, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.

00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:49.355
One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan,

00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:51.525
equal-opportunity corruption.

00:07:51.525 --> 00:07:56.178
It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.

00:07:56.178 --> 00:07:58.650
It blocks the right too, as it makes

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.570
principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.762
So the right wants smaller government.

00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:07.458
When Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:11.370
for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.050
The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.083
and as he reported back to me,

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:18.282
the response was, "Hell no!

00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:20.058
If we deregulate these guys,

00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:23.816
how are we going to raise money from them?"

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:27.623
This is a system that's designed to save the status quo,

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:31.256
including the status quo of big and invasive government.

00:08:31.256 --> 00:08:33.706
It works against the left and the right,

00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:35.252
and that, you might say, is good news.

00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:37.041
But here's the bad news.

00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:40.944
It's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption,

00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:43.200
because in any system

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.100
where the members are dependent upon

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.272
the tiniest fraction of us for their election,

00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:51.064
that means the tiniest number of us,

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:53.344
the tiniest, tiniest number of us,

00:08:53.344 --> 00:08:55.055
can block reform.

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:57.953
I know that should have been, like, a rock or something.

00:08:57.953 --> 00:08:59.990
I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.384
Block reform.

00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:06.360
Because there is an economy here, an economy of influence,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.914
an economy with lobbyists at the center

00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:11.568
which feeds on polarization.

00:09:11.568 --> 00:09:13.417
It feeds on dysfunction.

00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:16.056
The worse that it is for us,

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:19.992
the better that it is for this fundraising.

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:23.104
Henry David Thoreau: "There are a thousand hacking

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:27.976
at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."

00:09:27.976 --> 00:09:31.369
This is the root.

00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:35.512
Okay, now, every single one of you knows this.

00:09:35.512 --> 00:09:39.141
You couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it.

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:42.725
You ignore it. This is an impossible problem.

00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:45.273
You focus on the possible problems,

00:09:45.273 --> 00:09:48.536
like eradicating polio from the world,

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:51.670
or taking an image of every single street across the globe,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.976
or building the first real universal translator,

00:09:54.976 --> 00:09:58.578
or building a fusion factory in your garage.

00:09:58.578 --> 00:10:01.496
These are the manageable problems, so you ignore —

00:10:01.496 --> 00:10:07.128
(Laughter) (Applause) —

00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:09.577
so you ignore this corruption.

00:10:09.577 --> 00:10:15.047
But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore.

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:18.152
(Applause)

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:21.735
We need a government that works.

00:10:21.735 --> 00:10:24.600
And not works for the left or the right,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.064
but works for the left and the right,

00:10:27.064 --> 00:10:29.096
the citizens of the left and right,

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:32.688
because there is no sensible reform possible

00:10:32.688 --> 00:10:35.217
until we end this corruption.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:39.402
So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.

00:10:39.402 --> 00:10:41.962
Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform

00:10:41.962 --> 00:10:44.330
or a simpler tax system or inequality.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.518
Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you,

00:10:46.518 --> 00:10:50.359
look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:52.185
There will never be a Christmas.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:54.897
We will never get your issue solved

00:10:54.897 --> 00:10:57.863
until we fix this issue first.

00:10:57.863 --> 00:11:01.193
So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:05.369
Yours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue,

00:11:05.369 --> 00:11:08.090
the issue we have to solve before we get to fix

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.063
the issues you care about.

00:11:10.063 --> 00:11:13.361
No sensible reform, and we cannot afford

00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:17.282
a world, a future, with no sensible reform.

00:11:17.282 --> 00:11:20.153
Okay. So how do we do it?

00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:23.641
Turns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.491
If the problem is members spending an extraordinary

00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:29.651
amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America,

00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:33.911
the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising

00:11:33.911 --> 00:11:36.579
but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans,

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:37.752
to spread it out,

00:11:37.752 --> 00:11:41.033
to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:44.225
of dependence upon the people alone.

00:11:44.225 --> 00:11:47.655
And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment,

00:11:47.655 --> 00:11:48.914
changing the First Amendment.

00:11:48.914 --> 00:11:52.273
To do this would require a single statute,

00:11:52.273 --> 00:11:54.465
a statute establishing what we think of

00:11:54.465 --> 00:11:57.161
as small dollar funded elections,

00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:59.369
a statute of citizen-funded campaigns,

00:11:59.369 --> 00:12:01.465
and there's any number of these proposals out there:

00:12:01.465 --> 00:12:02.911
Fair Elections Now Act,

00:12:02.911 --> 00:12:05.337
the American Anti-Corruption Act,

00:12:05.337 --> 00:12:08.427
an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:10.761
to give vouchers to people to fund elections,

00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:13.956
an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.

00:12:13.956 --> 00:12:18.060
Each of these would fix this corruption

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.409
by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:25.067
The analytics are easy here.

00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:30.580
It's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard,

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:36.939
because this reform would shrink K Street,

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:41.799
and Capitol Hill, as Congressman Jim Cooper,

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:44.779
a Democrat from Tennessee, put it,

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:49.599
has become a farm league for K Street, a farm league for K Street.

00:12:49.599 --> 00:12:51.564
Members and staffers and bureaucrats have

00:12:51.564 --> 00:12:53.775
an increasingly common business model in their head,

00:12:53.775 --> 00:12:56.843
a business model focused on their life after government,

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:59.164
their life as lobbyists.

00:12:59.164 --> 00:13:02.710
Fifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.368
left to become lobbyists, 42 percent of the House.

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:06.844
Those numbers have only gone up,

00:13:06.844 --> 00:13:09.190
and as United Republic calculated last April,

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.403
the average increase in salary for those who they tracked

00:13:12.403 --> 00:13:17.765
was 1,452 percent.

00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:24.131
So it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this?

00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:28.195
Now I get this skepticism.

00:13:28.195 --> 00:13:33.131
I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility.

00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:35.459
But I don't buy it.

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:39.307
This is a solvable issue.

00:13:39.307 --> 00:13:42.467
If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:44.306
in the 20th century,

00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:47.587
issues like racism, or sexism,

00:13:47.587 --> 00:13:50.700
or the issue that we've been fighting in this century, homophobia,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.187
those are hard issues.

00:13:53.187 --> 00:13:56.107
You don't wake up one day no longer a racist.

00:13:56.107 --> 00:14:00.418
It takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA,

00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:02.863
out of the soul of a people.

00:14:02.863 --> 00:14:06.108
But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.

00:14:06.108 --> 00:14:08.651
Change the incentives, and the behavior changes,

00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:11.338
and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems

00:14:11.338 --> 00:14:14.468
have seen overnight a change in the practice.

00:14:14.468 --> 00:14:16.449
When Connecticut adopted this system,

00:14:16.449 --> 00:14:20.639
in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:24.886
gave up large contributions and took small contributions only.

00:14:24.886 --> 00:14:26.865
It's solvable,

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:29.675
not by being a Democrat,

00:14:29.675 --> 00:14:31.470
not by being a Republican.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.122
It's solvable by being citizens, by being citizens,

00:14:35.122 --> 00:14:38.105
by being TEDizens.

00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:42.442
Because if you want to kickstart reform,

00:14:42.442 --> 00:14:45.893
look, I could kickstart reform

00:14:45.893 --> 00:14:49.481
at half the price of fixing energy policy,

00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:52.263
I could give you back a republic.

00:14:52.263 --> 00:14:55.907
Okay. But even if you're not yet with me,

00:14:55.907 --> 00:14:59.492
even if you believe this is impossible,

00:14:59.492 --> 00:15:02.929
what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me

00:15:02.929 --> 00:15:05.527
as I've spoken about this issue again and again is,

00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:09.353
even if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant.

00:15:09.353 --> 00:15:11.341
Irrelevant.

00:15:11.341 --> 00:15:14.909
I spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke,

00:15:14.909 --> 00:15:16.752
I write in my book, and she said to me,

00:15:16.752 --> 00:15:22.445
"Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless.

00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:25.295
There's nothing we can do."

00:15:25.295 --> 00:15:27.220
When she said that, I scrambled.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.362
I tried to think, "How do I respond to that hopelessness?

00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:31.025
What is that sense of hopelessness?"

00:15:31.025 --> 00:15:35.887
And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son.

00:15:35.887 --> 00:15:39.072
And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying,

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:46.381
"Your son has terminal brain cancer, and there's nothing you can do.

00:15:46.381 --> 00:15:48.635
Nothing you can do."

00:15:48.635 --> 00:15:51.730
So would I do nothing?

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.102
Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do?

00:15:54.102 --> 00:15:57.925
I'm going off to build Google Glass.

00:15:57.925 --> 00:16:01.571
Of course not. I would do everything I could,

00:16:01.571 --> 00:16:05.151
and I would do everything I could because this is what love means,

00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:07.467
that the odds are irrelevant and that you do

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:11.046
whatever the hell you can, the odds be damned.

00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:14.887
And then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals

00:16:14.887 --> 00:16:17.146
love this country.

00:16:17.146 --> 00:16:20.119
(Laughter)

00:16:20.119 --> 00:16:22.379
And so when the pundits and the politicians

00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:24.689
say that change is impossible,

00:16:24.689 --> 00:16:27.751
what this love of country says back is,

00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:30.487
"That's just irrelevant."

00:16:30.487 --> 00:16:32.527
We lose something dear,

00:16:32.527 --> 00:16:35.734
something everyone in this room loves and cherishes,

00:16:35.734 --> 00:16:39.682
if we lose this republic, and so we act

00:16:39.682 --> 00:16:44.976
with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong.

00:16:44.976 --> 00:16:47.412
So here's my question:

00:16:47.412 --> 00:16:52.023
Do you have that love?

00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:54.848
Do you have that love?

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.531
Because if you do,

00:16:56.531 --> 00:17:01.920
then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.460
When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.466
in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said,

00:17:10.466 --> 00:17:13.924
"Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"

00:17:13.924 --> 00:17:21.685
Franklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it."

00:17:21.685 --> 00:17:26.584
A republic. A representative democracy.

00:17:26.584 --> 00:17:33.793
A government dependent upon the people alone.

00:17:33.793 --> 00:17:38.378
We have lost that republic.

00:17:38.378 --> 00:17:42.726
All of us have to act to get it back.

00:17:42.726 --> 00:17:44.370
Thank you very much.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:50.423
(Applause)

00:17:50.423 --> 00:18:01.099
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
