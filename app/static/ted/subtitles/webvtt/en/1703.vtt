00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:03.629
This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.189
where I work as a curator.

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.237
It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:11.213
and that it grows,

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:16.565
and basically it means I collect dead animals.

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:18.956
Back in 1995,

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:23.452
we got a new wing next to the museum.

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:25.593
It was made of glass,

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:31.099
and this building really helped me to do my job good.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.225
The building was a true bird-killer.

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.803
You may know that birds don't understand

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:40.965
the concept of glass. They don't see it,

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:44.571
so they fly into the windows and get killed.

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:46.811
The only thing I had to do was go out,

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:50.868
pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:53.986
(Laughter)

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.765
And in those days,

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:59.203
I developed an ear to identify birds

00:00:59.203 --> 00:01:04.789
just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass.

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:08.771
And it was on June 5, 1995,

00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:12.537
that I heard a loud bang against the glass

00:01:12.537 --> 00:01:17.147
that changed my life and ended that of a duck.

00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:22.942
And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:26.126
This is the dead duck. It flew against the window.

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:27.820
It's laying dead on its belly.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.175
But next to the dead duck is a live duck,

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:33.489
and please pay attention.

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.979
Both are of the male sex.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.083
And then this happened.

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:43.789
The live duck mounted the dead duck,

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.452
and started to copulate.

00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:49.177
Well, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.

00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:51.925
I said, "Something's wrong here."

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:57.897
One is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.

00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:00.779
I look. Both are of the male sex.

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:05.418
Homosexual necrophilia.

00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:10.463
So I -- (Laughter)

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.407
I took my camera, I took my notebook,

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:18.818
took a chair, and started to observe this behavior.

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:24.435
After 75 minutes — (Laughter) —

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:29.244
I had seen enough, and I got hungry,

00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:31.883
and I wanted to go home.

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:35.443
So I went out, collected the duck,

00:02:35.443 --> 00:02:37.399
and before I put it in the freezer,

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:42.275
I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:45.883
And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis,

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:48.924
so it was indeed of the male sex.

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:52.219
It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.810
and only 300 possess a penis.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.197
[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)]

00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:03.131
I knew I'd seen something special,

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.553
but it took me six years to decide to publish it.

00:03:08.553 --> 00:03:11.408
(Laughter)

00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:14.939
I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.678
or at the coffee machine,

00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:19.988
but to share this among your peers is something different.

00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:21.806
I didn't have the framework.

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:24.851
So after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish,

00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:28.155
so I published "The first case of homosexual necrophilia

00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:29.750
in the mallard."

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.299
And here's the situation again.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.851
A is my office,

00:03:34.851 --> 00:03:37.315
B is the place where the duck hit the glass,

00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:40.373
and C is from where I watched it.

00:03:40.373 --> 00:03:43.070
And here are the ducks again.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.077
As you probably know, in science,

00:03:45.077 --> 00:03:47.260
when you write a kind of special paper,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.259
only six or seven people read it.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.984
(Laughter)

00:03:56.844 --> 00:03:59.444
But then something good happened.

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:03.952
I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:08.805
and he told me, "You've won a prize with your duck paper:

00:04:08.805 --> 00:04:12.488
the Ig Nobel Prize."

00:04:12.488 --> 00:04:14.402
And the Ig Nobel Prize —

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:18.819
(Laughter) (Applause) —

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.838
the Ig Nobel Prize honors research

00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:23.915
that first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,

00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:26.699
with the ultimate goal to make more people

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.763
interested in science.

00:04:29.763 --> 00:04:33.899
That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.588
(Laughter)

00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:40.344
I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams

00:04:40.344 --> 00:04:41.917
didn't call me from Stockholm.

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:44.070
He called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.017
So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,

00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:50.472
and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony

00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:52.825
held at Harvard University, and this ceremony

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:58.065
is a very nice experience.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.346
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.

00:05:01.346 --> 00:05:02.759
That's the first thing.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.793
And there are nine other winners who get prizes.

00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:09.169
Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.230
who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.209
"Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:20.645
under farming conditions in Britain."

00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:24.925
(Laughter)

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:28.081
And I think there are one or two more

00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:31.002
Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room.

00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:34.729
Dan, where are you? Dan Ariely?

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.651
Applause for Dan.

00:05:36.651 --> 00:05:39.953
(Applause)

00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:43.697
Dan won his prize in medicine

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:47.872
for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine

00:05:47.872 --> 00:05:50.729
works better than low-priced fake medicine.

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.000
(Laughter)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.818
So here's my one minute of fame,

00:05:57.818 --> 00:06:02.295
my acceptance speech,

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.508
and here's the duck.

00:06:04.508 --> 00:06:09.430
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.104
I'm going to pass it around.

00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:17.393
(Laughter)

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:18.870
Yeah?

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.179
You can pass it around.

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:22.560
Please note it's a museum specimen,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.978
but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu.

00:06:27.978 --> 00:06:31.984
After winning this prize, my life changed.

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:34.114
In the first place, people started to send me

00:06:34.114 --> 00:06:37.661
all kinds of duck-related things,

00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:40.713
and I got a real nice collection.

00:06:40.713 --> 00:06:43.040
(Laughter)

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.704
More importantly,

00:06:49.704 --> 00:06:53.776
people started to send me their observations

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:56.310
of remarkable animal behavior,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.482
and believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet,

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:01.183
I know about it.

00:07:01.183 --> 00:07:05.531
(Laughter)

00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:10.313
This is a moose.

00:07:10.313 --> 00:07:11.840
It's a moose trying to copulate

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.329
with a bronze statue of a bison.

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:19.122
This is in Montana, 2008.

00:07:19.122 --> 00:07:23.202
This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.

00:07:23.202 --> 00:07:26.433
This is the Netherlands, 2011.

00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:30.709
These are cane toads in Australia.

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:31.964
This is roadkill.

00:07:31.964 --> 00:07:35.208
Please note that this is necrophilia.

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:36.916
It's remarkable: the position.

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:41.348
The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.

00:07:41.348 --> 00:07:45.532
These are pigeons in Rotterdam.

00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:51.373
Barn swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.

00:07:51.373 --> 00:07:55.137
This is a turkey in Wisconsin

00:07:55.137 --> 00:08:01.216
on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.

00:08:01.216 --> 00:08:03.664
It took all day,

00:08:03.664 --> 00:08:08.795
and the prisoners had a great time.

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:10.727
So what does this mean?

00:08:10.727 --> 00:08:13.975
I mean, the question I ask myself,

00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:15.676
why does this happen in nature?

00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:17.487
Well, what I concluded

00:08:17.487 --> 00:08:19.946
from reviewing all these cases

00:08:19.946 --> 00:08:23.914
is that it is important that this happens

00:08:23.914 --> 00:08:27.961
only when death is instant

00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:30.176
and in a dramatic way

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.113
and in the right position for copulation.

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:38.771
At least, I thought it was till I got these slides.

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:41.194
And here you see a dead duck.

00:08:41.194 --> 00:08:43.786
It's been there for three days,

00:08:43.786 --> 00:08:45.840
and it's laying on its back.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.698
So there goes my theory of necrophilia.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.088
Another example of the impact

00:08:53.088 --> 00:08:55.081
of glass buildings on the life of birds.

00:08:55.081 --> 00:08:58.426
This is Mad Max, a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam.

00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:04.312
The only thing this bird did was fly against this window

00:09:04.312 --> 00:09:09.264
from 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:12.213
Here he goes, and here's a short video.

00:09:12.213 --> 00:09:13.935
(Music) (Clunk)

00:09:20.073 --> 00:09:21.257
(Clunk)

00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:36.019
(Clunk)

00:09:44.905 --> 00:09:46.420
(Clunk)

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.175
So what this bird does

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:53.273
is fight his own image.

00:09:53.273 --> 00:09:55.551
He sees an intruder in his territory,

00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:58.623
and it's coming all the time and he's there,

00:09:58.623 --> 00:10:00.466
so there is no end to it.

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:03.649
And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years --

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:06.895
that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?

00:10:06.895 --> 00:10:09.943
It's not. I show you here some slides,

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.994
some frames from the video,

00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:15.241
and at the last moment before he hits the glass,

00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:17.252
he puts his feet in front,

00:10:17.252 --> 00:10:22.071
and then he bangs against the glass.

00:10:22.071 --> 00:10:26.715
So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day.

00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:29.417
That's on June 5 every year.

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:32.649
At five minutes to six in the afternoon,

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:36.563
we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

00:10:36.563 --> 00:10:39.202
the duck comes out of the museum,

00:10:39.202 --> 00:10:41.697
and we try to discuss new ways

00:10:41.697 --> 00:10:45.551
to prevent birds from colliding with windows.

00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:47.986
And as you know, or as you may not know,

00:10:47.986 --> 00:10:50.585
this is one of the major causes of death

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:52.090
for birds in the world.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.961
In the U.S. alone, a billion birds die

00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:58.186
in collision with glass buildings.

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:04.113
And when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant

00:11:04.113 --> 00:11:08.871
and we have a six-course duck dinner.

00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:11.721
So I hope to see you

00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:14.776
next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,

00:11:14.776 --> 00:11:16.123
for Dead Duck Day.

00:11:16.123 --> 00:11:17.394
Thank you.

00:11:17.394 --> 00:11:19.412
(Applause)

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:25.124
Oh, sorry.

00:11:25.124 --> 00:11:27.233
May I have my duck back, please?

00:11:27.233 --> 00:11:30.341
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:35.019
Thank you.
