00:00:01.058 --> 00:00:04.636
Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle

00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:08.542
that weighs less than a bicycle,

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:11.888
that you can carry with you anywhere,

00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:16.380
that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.628
and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:20.980
on about a dollar of electricity.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.268
But when I say the word electric vehicle,

00:00:23.268 --> 00:00:26.156
people think about vehicles. They think about cars

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:29.874
and motorcycles and bicycles, and the vehicles that you use every day.

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:32.170
But if you come about it from a different perspective,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.472
you can create some more interesting,

00:00:34.472 --> 00:00:37.152
more novel concepts.

00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:39.408
So we built something.

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:42.102
I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.

00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:44.192
So this is the motor.

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:45.801
This motor has enough power to take you

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:49.608
up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour,

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:51.434
about 30 kilometers an hour,

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:55.524
and this battery, this battery right here

00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:59.472
has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers,

00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:02.275
which is enough to cover about half of the car trips

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:04.672
in the U.S. alone.

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:06.451
But the best part about these components

00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.648
is that we bought them at a toy store.

00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:11.072
These are from remote control airplanes.

00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:13.216
And the performance of these things has gotten so good

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:15.512
that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently,

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:17.015
you can really change things.

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:19.012
So today we're going to show you one example

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.089
of how you can use this.

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:23.888
Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is,

00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:26.966
but also how the portability that comes with this

00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:31.313
can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.

00:01:31.313 --> 00:01:36.676

00:02:44.517 --> 00:02:48.829
(Cheers)

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.122
So we're going to show you what this thing can do.

00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:54.815
It's really maneuverable. You have a hand-held remote,

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:58.394
so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking,

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:02.723
go in reverse if you like, also have braking.

00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:11.488
It's incredible just how light this thing is.

00:03:11.488 --> 00:03:13.617
I mean, this is something you can pick up and carry with you

00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:16.553
anywhere you go.

00:03:16.553 --> 00:03:19.729
So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.585
about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:25.977
This uses 20 times less energy

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:29.344
for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car,

00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:32.977
which means not only is this thing fast to charge

00:03:32.977 --> 00:03:34.666
and really cheap to build,

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:38.017
but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.652
in terms of your transportation.

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.411
So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:45.345
for each person in this room to get around in a city,

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:47.465
now you can look at much smaller amounts

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:49.905
and more sustainable transportation.

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:51.267
So next time you think about a vehicle,

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:54.573
I hope, like us, you're thinking about something new.

00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:55.711
Thank you.

00:03:55.711 --> 00:04:01.665
(Applause)
