WEBVTT

00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:03.116
This is me building a prototype

00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:06.036
for six hours straight.

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:09.957
This is slave labor to my own project.

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:14.947
This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:19.713
And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:22.501
with brute-force assembly techniques.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.335
And this is exactly why I started studying

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:29.604
how to program physical materials to build themselves.

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:31.364
But there is another world.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.359
Today at the micro- and nanoscales,

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.110
there's an unprecedented revolution happening.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.242
And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:42.966
to change shape, change properties

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.952
and even compute outside of silicon-based matter.

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:48.459
There's even a software called cadnano

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:51.242
that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:54.326
like nano robots or drug delivery systems

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:58.629
and use DNA to self-assemble those functional structures.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.702
But if we look at the human scale,

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:03.758
there's massive problems that aren't being addressed

00:01:03.758 --> 00:01:06.126
by those nanoscale technologies.

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:08.225
If we look at construction and manufacturing,

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:12.418
there's major inefficiencies, energy consumption

00:01:12.418 --> 00:01:14.745
and excessive labor techniques.

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:17.250
In infrastructure, let's just take one example.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.733
Take piping.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.458
In water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:26.917
that have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:28.208
We bury them in the ground.

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:30.829
If anything changes -- if the environment changes,

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.466
the ground moves, or demand changes --

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:37.716
we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them.

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:41.084
So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds,

00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:46.255
that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:47.932
and the built environment.

00:01:47.932 --> 00:01:50.118
And I don't mean automated machines.

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:52.577
I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans.

00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:56.461
But I mean programmable materials that build themselves.

00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:58.517
And that's called self-assembly,

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:03.034
which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure

00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:05.527
through only local interaction.

00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:08.702
So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?

00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:10.677
We need a few simple ingredients.

00:02:10.677 --> 00:02:13.516
The first ingredient is materials and geometry,

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:16.985
and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source.

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:18.643
And you can use passive energy --

00:02:18.643 --> 00:02:23.327
so heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics.

00:02:23.327 --> 00:02:26.402
And then you need smartly designed interactions.

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:28.535
And those interactions allow for error correction,

00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:32.535
and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:35.767
So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built,

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:39.051
from one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional

00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.118
and even four-dimensional systems.

00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:44.004
So in one-dimensional systems --

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.911
this is a project called the self-folding proteins.

00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:51.618
And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein --

00:02:51.618 --> 00:02:54.299
in this case it's the crambin protein --

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.945
you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions --

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:01.096
and you break that down into a series of components.

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:03.370
And then we embed elastic.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.711
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it,

00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:10.562
it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.

00:03:10.562 --> 00:03:12.662
And this gives us a tangible model

00:03:12.662 --> 00:03:16.396
of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.680
and all of the intricacies of the geometry.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.128
So we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.

00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:24.930
And we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems --

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.229
so flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures.

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:33.682
In three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal

00:03:33.682 --> 00:03:35.646
with Autodesk and Arthur Olson

00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:37.344
where we looked at autonomous parts --

00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:41.663
so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.

00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:44.429
And we built 500 of these glass beakers.

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:46.896
They had different molecular structures inside

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:49.120
and different colors that could be mixed and matched.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.369
And we gave them away to all the TEDsters.

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.870
And so these became intuitive models

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.362
to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.179
This is the polio virus.

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.111
You shake it hard and it breaks apart.

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:02.557
And then you shake it randomly

00:04:02.557 --> 00:04:06.061
and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.

00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:09.028
And this is demonstrating that through random energy,

00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:13.656
we can build non-random shapes.

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:17.180
We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.334
Last year at TED Long Beach,

00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:22.545
we built an installation that builds installations.

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:26.082
The idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:28.583
So we built a large rotating chamber,

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:31.796
and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower,

00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:33.381
adding energy to the system

00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:36.827
and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works

00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:38.206
and how we could use this

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:42.952
as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products.

00:04:42.952 --> 00:04:44.619
So remember, I said 4D.

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:48.314
So today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project,

00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:50.200
which is a collaboration with Stratasys,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.035
and it's called 4D printing.

00:04:52.035 --> 00:04:53.995
The idea behind 4D printing

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:56.995
is that you take multi-material 3D printing --

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:59.184
so you can deposit multiple materials --

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:01.068
and you add a new capability,

00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:02.934
which is transformation,

00:05:02.934 --> 00:05:04.251
that right off the bed,

00:05:04.251 --> 00:05:08.578
the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:12.078
And this is like robotics without wires or motors.

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:13.729
So you completely print this part,

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.533
and it can transform into something else.

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:21.494
We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.

00:05:21.494 --> 00:05:24.617
And this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:27.819
and try to optimize which parts are folding when.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.549
But most importantly, we can use this same software

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:33.457
for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems

00:05:33.457 --> 00:05:36.300
and human scale self-assembly systems.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.813
These are parts being printed with multi-material properties.

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:41.530
Here's the first demonstration.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.434
A single strand dipped in water

00:05:43.434 --> 00:05:45.783
that completely self-folds on its own

00:05:45.783 --> 00:05:49.701
into the letters M I T.

00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:51.523
I'm biased.

00:05:51.523 --> 00:05:54.972
This is another part, single strand, dipped in a bigger tank

00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:59.595
that self-folds into a cube, a three-dimensional structure, on its own.

00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:01.446
So no human interaction.

00:06:01.446 --> 00:06:03.335
And we think this is the first time

00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:05.582
that a program and transformation

00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:08.832
has been embedded directly into the materials themselves.

00:06:08.832 --> 00:06:11.562
And it also might just be the manufacturing technique

00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:15.696
that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future.

00:06:15.696 --> 00:06:16.882
So I know you're probably thinking,

00:06:16.882 --> 00:06:21.114
okay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment?

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.369
So I've started a lab at MIT,

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:25.251
and it's called the Self-Assembly Lab.

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.395
And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials

00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:29.586
for the built environment.

00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:31.549
And we think there's a few key sectors

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:33.863
that have fairly near-term applications.

00:06:33.863 --> 00:06:35.918
One of those is in extreme environments.

00:06:35.918 --> 00:06:38.464
These are scenarios where it's difficult to build,

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.952
our current construction techniques don't work,

00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:44.512
it's too large, it's too dangerous, it's expensive, too many parts.

00:06:44.512 --> 00:06:46.879
And space is a great example of that.

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.245
We're trying to design new scenarios for space

00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:52.545
that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:56.235
that can go from highly functional systems from one to another.

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:58.346
Let's go back to infrastructure.

00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:02.245
In infrastructure, we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:05.045
And we're developing a new paradigm for piping.

00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:08.668
Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract

00:07:08.668 --> 00:07:11.418
to change capacity or change flow rate,

00:07:11.418 --> 00:07:15.952
or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.

00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:18.562
So this isn't expensive pumps or valves.

00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:22.845
This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own.

00:07:22.845 --> 00:07:24.660
So I want to remind you today

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.044
of the harsh realities of assembly in our world.

00:07:28.044 --> 00:07:31.509
These are complex things built with complex parts

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:34.294
that come together in complex ways.

00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:37.493
So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from

00:07:37.493 --> 00:07:41.546
to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world,

00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:45.245
how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale,

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:48.320
so that we can go from a world like this

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.270
to a world that's more like this.

00:08:00.632 --> 00:08:02.542
Thank you.

00:08:02.542 --> 00:08:04.843
(Applause)
