WEBVTT

00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:03.270
In two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.370
of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.220
I mean, nine years is a long time.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.138
And given "Jeopardy's" average demographics,

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:12.430
I think what that means

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.621
is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:17.804
(Laughter)

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:19.243
But not all, a few are still alive.

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:21.756
Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:24.458
And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.912
I think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:29.103
For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:32.337
as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.

00:00:32.337 --> 00:00:34.625
And I can't complain about this.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:37.038
I feel like that was always sort of my destiny,

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:40.505
although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:43.271
If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager,

00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:46.459
it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name.

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:47.624
(Laughter)

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:51.855
And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.

00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:55.079
But if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.208
I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:01.140
with whatever great fact I had just read about --

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.841
Haley's comet or giant squids

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:06.770
or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.987
I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:14.088
And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.

00:01:14.088 --> 00:01:15.588
(Laughter)

00:01:15.588 --> 00:01:18.421
And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.

00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:21.827
I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:24.352
because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,

00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:27.685
that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:31.912
I was going to miss my game shows.

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:33.602
And later, in the mid-'80s,

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:35.213
when "Jeopardy" came back on the air,

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:39.286
I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:44.788
It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:47.202
And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,

00:01:47.202 --> 00:01:49.619
where there was only one English language TV channel.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.869
There was Armed Forces TV,

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.035
and if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:56.351
So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."

00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.352
I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:04.535
I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:07.369
and holding my own, back when that was a fad.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.417
There's a weird sense of mastery you get

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:12.662
when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.

00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:16.218
You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.

00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:19.202
And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power --

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:26.386
the right fact deployed at exactly the right place.

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:28.202
I never had a guidance counselor

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:30.586
who thought this was a legitimate career path,

00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:33.035
that thought you could major in trivia

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:36.452
or be a professional ex-game show contestant.

00:02:36.452 --> 00:02:38.852
And so I sold out way too young.

00:02:38.852 --> 00:02:40.286
I didn't try to figure out what one does with that.

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:42.751
I studied computers because I heard that was the thing,

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.612
and I became a computer programmer --

00:02:44.612 --> 00:02:46.411
not an especially good one,

00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:51.420
not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.745
But that's what I was doing.

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:55.585
And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background --

00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:59.801
a few years later, I think 2009 or so,

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.339
when I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying,

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.662
"It's early days yet, but IBM tells us

00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:09.746
they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.'

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:11.244
Are you up for this?"

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:12.834
This was the first I'd heard of it.

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:15.502
And of course I said yes, for several reasons.

00:03:15.502 --> 00:03:17.754
One, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.

00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:21.395
It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.

00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:23.430
(Laughter)

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.835
And I would do it for nothing.

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:26.568
I don't think they know that, luckily,

00:03:26.568 --> 00:03:29.786
but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:31.918
I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.

00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:36.152
And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.

00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:38.018
People playing computers on game shows

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:41.070
was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.618
and now I could be on the stage with it.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:43.702
I was not going to say no.

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:44.835
The third reason I said yes

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:47.435
is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.571
I had taken some artificial intelligence classes.

00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.901
I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy."

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:57.101
People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program

00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.661
that can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English

00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:04.286
and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.853
unpack the meaning of the clue.

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:11.494
The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,

00:04:11.494 --> 00:04:13.719
very hard for a computer.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.828
And I thought, well this is going to be child's play.

00:04:16.828 --> 00:04:21.752
Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.

00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:23.603
(Laughter)

00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:25.203
But as the years went on,

00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:28.994
as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,

00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:31.085
I started to get occasional updates from them,

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:32.870
and I started to get a little more worried.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.953
I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:42.870
It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy,"

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.521
tens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top

00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:48.803
with their performance plotted on number of --

00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:52.869
I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.828
clues responded to --

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:57.219
versus the accuracy of those answers.

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:00.578
So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.

00:05:00.578 --> 00:05:02.369
And at first, it was very low.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:05.736
There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:07.920
But then you see the line start to go up.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.403
And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.

00:05:10.403 --> 00:05:12.077
And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart

00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:18.202
some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:19.770
And thought, what are these?

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.662
"The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."

00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:25.854
And I saw this line coming for me.

00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:26.954
And I realized, this is it.

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:28.994
This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.

00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:30.937
(Laughter)

00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:33.119
It's not the Terminator's gun sight;

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:37.286
it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.421
the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.173
And when the game eventually happened about a year later,

00:05:45.173 --> 00:05:48.036
it was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:50.537
We were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:52.803
Watson does not travel.

00:05:52.803 --> 00:05:53.903
Watson's actually huge.

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:58.436
It's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,

00:05:58.436 --> 00:05:59.854
trillions of bytes of memory.

00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:02.287
We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.

00:06:02.287 --> 00:06:05.912
The only other "Jeopardy" contestant to this day I've ever been inside.

00:06:05.912 --> 00:06:09.236
And so Watson does not travel.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:13.270
You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.327
So me and the other human player

00:06:15.327 --> 00:06:18.535
wound up at this secret IBM research lab

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:21.083
in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:22.665
to play the computer.

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:24.715
And we realized right away

00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:27.614
that the computer had a big home court advantage.

00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:29.965
There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.

00:06:29.965 --> 00:06:32.632
Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,

00:06:32.632 --> 00:06:34.932
and there's the thing in the middle of their court.

00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:38.168
And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:40.065
cheering on their little darling,

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:42.431
having poured millions of dollars into this

00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:45.369
hoping against hope that the humans screw up,

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:47.166
and holding up "Go Watson" signs

00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:51.814
and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.

00:06:51.814 --> 00:06:57.681
I think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.

00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:03.085
If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their gut,

00:07:03.085 --> 00:07:04.752
it's an unpleasant sight.

00:07:04.752 --> 00:07:07.799
But they were right. They were exactly right.

00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:10.215
I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR,

00:07:10.215 --> 00:07:13.382
but Watson won handily.

00:07:13.382 --> 00:07:16.249
And I remember standing there behind the podium

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:19.014
as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.

00:07:19.014 --> 00:07:22.383
It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.

00:07:22.383 --> 00:07:26.498
And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.

00:07:26.498 --> 00:07:29.251
And I remember thinking, this is it.

00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:30.848
I felt obsolete.

00:07:30.848 --> 00:07:33.899
I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:36.750
seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.841
I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete

00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:45.620
under this new regime of thinking computers.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.577
And it hasn't been the last.

00:07:47.577 --> 00:07:50.219
If you watch the news, you'll see occasionally --

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.911
and I see this all the time --

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:56.669
that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.078
without actually needing a human pharmacist.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.269
And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals

00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:05.661
because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.

00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:08.169
You don't need human assistants for that anymore.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.302
I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score

00:08:11.302 --> 00:08:13.086
from a baseball or football game

00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:15.662
and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.087
and was commenting on it.

00:08:17.087 --> 00:08:21.086
And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job

00:08:21.086 --> 00:08:22.521
as the humans they're replacing,

00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:26.338
but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.

00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:31.355
So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.

00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:34.701
I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:36.826
we'll enter a new golden age of leisure

00:08:36.826 --> 00:08:39.119
when we'll all have time for the things we really love

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:46.091
because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.805
I've heard other people say quite the opposite,

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.021
that this is yet another tier of the middle class

00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:55.055
that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:56.619
and that this is actually something ominous,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.124
something that we should worry about.

00:08:58.124 --> 00:08:59.973
I'm not an economist myself.

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:03.245
All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.

00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:06.305
And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:08.536
Here's the one thing that I was ever good at,

00:09:08.536 --> 00:09:12.689
and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people

00:09:12.689 --> 00:09:15.222
and thousands of processors working in parallel

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.306
and they could do the same thing.

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:20.537
They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,

00:09:20.537 --> 00:09:23.272
and "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."

00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:27.005
And it made me think, what does this mean,

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:28.744
if we're going to be able to start outsourcing,

00:09:28.744 --> 00:09:32.369
not just lower unimportant brain functions.

00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:34.844
I'm sure many of you remember a distant time

00:09:34.844 --> 00:09:37.671
when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.

00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:39.662
And suddenly there was a machine that did that,

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.055
and now we don't need to remember that anymore.

00:09:42.055 --> 00:09:43.938
I have read that there's now actually evidence

00:09:43.938 --> 00:09:48.382
that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships,

00:09:48.382 --> 00:09:50.036
physically shrinks and atrophies

00:09:50.036 --> 00:09:52.638
in people who use tools like GPS,

00:09:52.638 --> 00:09:55.202
because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.

00:09:55.202 --> 00:09:57.536
We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.

00:09:57.536 --> 00:10:00.140
And as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.953
gets smaller and dumber.

00:10:01.953 --> 00:10:05.744
And it made me think, what happens when computers are now better

00:10:05.744 --> 00:10:09.244
at knowing and remembering stuff than we are?

00:10:09.244 --> 00:10:13.320
Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.087
Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?

00:10:17.087 --> 00:10:20.959
As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:28.183
this was a terrifying idea to me.

00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:33.160
The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.369
The things we know are still important.

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.371
I came to believe there were two advantages

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:42.042
that those of us who have these things in our head have

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:46.868
over somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."

00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:49.536
There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time.

00:10:49.536 --> 00:10:51.092
The advantage of volume, first,

00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:53.724
just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:55.141
There's so much information out there.

00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:56.425
Being a Renaissance man or woman,

00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:58.591
that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.

00:10:58.591 --> 00:10:59.857
Now it's really not possible

00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:02.941
to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.

00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:04.545
There's just too much.

00:11:04.545 --> 00:11:07.042
They say that the scope of human information

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.091
is now doubling every 18 months or so,

00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:11.627
the sum total of human information.

00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:15.209
That means between now and late 2014,

00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:18.676
we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,

00:11:18.676 --> 00:11:22.756
as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.

00:11:22.756 --> 00:11:24.827
It's doubling every 18 months now.

00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:28.186
This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make

00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:31.462
require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.

00:11:31.462 --> 00:11:36.494
A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?

00:11:36.494 --> 00:11:37.928
Who do I vote for?

00:11:37.928 --> 00:11:39.694
Do I take this job or that one?

00:11:39.694 --> 00:11:43.328
These are the decisions that require correct judgments

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.448
about many different kinds of facts.

00:11:45.448 --> 00:11:47.185
If we have those facts at our mental fingertips,

00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:49.885
we're going to be able to make informed decisions.

00:11:49.885 --> 00:11:52.552
If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,

00:11:52.552 --> 00:11:54.412
we may be in trouble.

00:11:54.412 --> 00:11:56.350
According to a National Geographic survey I just saw,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.670
somewhere along the lines of 80 percent

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.685
of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy

00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:05.652
cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.

00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:08.218
If you can't do that first step,

00:12:08.218 --> 00:12:11.253
are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know

00:12:11.253 --> 00:12:14.219
to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?

00:12:14.219 --> 00:12:15.484
Quite probably not.

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:16.801
At some point you're just going to be like,

00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:18.668
"You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."

00:12:18.668 --> 00:12:20.468
And you'll make a less informed decision.

00:12:20.468 --> 00:12:23.952
The other issue is the advantage of time that you have

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.886
if you have all these things at your fingertips.

00:12:25.886 --> 00:12:29.302
I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.

00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:31.985
She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:35.318
on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.

00:12:35.318 --> 00:12:36.968
She runs up to them on the beach one morning

00:12:36.968 --> 00:12:39.553
and says, "Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."

00:12:39.553 --> 00:12:42.100
And they say, "What do you mean? We just got here."

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.200
And she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.135
he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea

00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:49.827
and you see the waves churning way out there,

00:12:49.827 --> 00:12:54.025
that's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach."

00:12:54.025 --> 00:12:56.220
What would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.564
Her parents thought about it,

00:12:57.564 --> 00:12:59.698
and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.

00:12:59.698 --> 00:13:01.713
They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel,

00:13:01.713 --> 00:13:05.597
and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,

00:13:05.597 --> 00:13:08.502
because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,

00:13:08.502 --> 00:13:10.097
the day after Christmas, 2004,

00:13:10.097 --> 00:13:14.063
that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.

00:13:14.063 --> 00:13:16.537
But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach,

00:13:16.537 --> 00:13:21.751
because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.

00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:23.848
Now when facts come in handy like that --

00:13:23.848 --> 00:13:27.463
I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,

00:13:27.463 --> 00:13:31.735
one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time --

00:13:31.735 --> 00:13:34.480
normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.583
But in this case it happened in real life.

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:38.202
And it happens in real life all the time.

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.416
It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.

00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:45.129
It's a meeting or job interview or first date

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:46.803
or some relationship that gets lubricated

00:13:46.803 --> 00:13:50.183
because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.

00:13:50.183 --> 00:13:52.734
You say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah."

00:13:52.734 --> 00:13:54.367
Or your alma mater or your job,

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:56.284
and I know just a little something about it,

00:13:56.284 --> 00:13:57.833
enough to get the ball rolling.

00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:59.702
People love that shared connection that gets created

00:13:59.702 --> 00:14:01.994
when somebody knows something about you.

00:14:01.994 --> 00:14:06.004
It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.

00:14:06.004 --> 00:14:07.416
That's often the advantage of time.

00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:08.901
And it's not effective if you say, "Well, hold on.

00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:14.465
You're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.

00:14:14.465 --> 00:14:16.367
Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."

00:14:16.367 --> 00:14:19.400
That doesn't work. That's just annoying.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.847
(Laughter)

00:14:21.847 --> 00:14:27.549
The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson,

00:14:27.549 --> 00:14:33.917
Samuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."

00:14:33.917 --> 00:14:38.450
And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:43.983
I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good,

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:46.783
that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads

00:14:46.783 --> 00:14:48.801
are what make us who we are,

00:14:48.801 --> 00:14:51.318
as individuals and as a species.

00:14:51.318 --> 00:14:55.415
I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.

00:14:55.415 --> 00:14:58.751
I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced

00:14:58.751 --> 00:15:00.661
by these little bubbles of specialty,

00:15:00.661 --> 00:15:04.167
so that none of us know about the common associations

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:06.683
that used to bind our civilization together.

00:15:06.683 --> 00:15:08.617
I don't want to be the last trivia know-it-all

00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:10.035
sitting on a mountain somewhere,

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:14.400
reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of "Simpsons" episodes

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.066
and the lyrics of Abba songs.

00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:22.549
I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share

00:15:22.549 --> 00:15:25.735
and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,

00:15:25.735 --> 00:15:28.340
to our search engines and our smartphones.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.967
In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,

00:15:32.967 --> 00:15:35.550
things don't always end well.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.348
Those movies are never about beautiful utopias.

00:15:39.348 --> 00:15:45.083
It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in "2001."

00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:48.318
Things always go terribly wrong.

00:15:48.318 --> 00:15:50.250
And I feel like we're sort of at the point now

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:54.333
where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:55.850
This is a question of leadership,

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.517
because it becomes a question of who leads the future.

00:15:59.517 --> 00:16:05.700
On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.002
where information is more universally available

00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:10.663
than it's ever been in human history,

00:16:10.663 --> 00:16:13.034
where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.

00:16:13.034 --> 00:16:14.577
And on the other hand,

00:16:14.577 --> 00:16:17.350
we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.369
where the machines have taken over

00:16:19.369 --> 00:16:22.418
and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore,

00:16:22.418 --> 00:16:25.033
that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud,

00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:31.144
and why would we ever bother learning anything new.

00:16:31.144 --> 00:16:34.933
Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.

00:16:34.933 --> 00:16:37.166
And we can all make that choice.

00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:40.501
We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn,

00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:43.637
who don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,

00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:44.960
I don't have to learn anymore,"

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.037
or "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime.

00:16:48.037 --> 00:16:50.396
I don't have to learn new things anymore."

00:16:50.396 --> 00:16:53.703
No, every day we should be striving to learn something new.

00:16:53.703 --> 00:16:57.895
We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.

00:16:57.895 --> 00:17:00.620
That's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.701
These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants

00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:05.803
sitting at home memorizing the phone book.

00:17:05.803 --> 00:17:07.119
I've met a lot of them.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.669
For the most part, they are just normal folks

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:12.767
who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:16.086
thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.

00:17:16.086 --> 00:17:18.619
We can live in one of these two worlds.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.920
We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.750
continue to be the thing that makes us special,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:30.120
or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.768
Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.

00:17:32.768 --> 00:17:35.020
Thank you very much.
