00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:05.650
So just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home?

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.590
Not very many of you.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.586
Okay. And actually of those hands,

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:12.619
if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home?

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.076
So a couple.

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:14.979
That's okay.

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.454
That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive --

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.325
that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving.

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:24.327
So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use,

00:00:24.327 --> 00:00:26.579
whether you're eight or 80.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.303
And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem,

00:00:29.303 --> 00:00:32.036
because you have to build a small, portable robot

00:00:32.036 --> 00:00:34.412
that's not only really affordable,

00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:35.953
but it has to be something

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:39.940
that people actually want to take home and have around their kids.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.237
This robot can't be creepy or uncanny.

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:45.448
He should be friendly and cute.

00:00:45.448 --> 00:00:48.359
So meet Romo.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.216
Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love --

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:55.065
your iPhone -- as his brain.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:59.176
And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor,

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:03.627
we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:07.311
and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks,

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:12.243
which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past.

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:15.860
When Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.977
So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face.

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:22.476
If I duck down, he'll follow me.

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:24.802
He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me.

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:28.078
If I come over here, he'll turn to follow me.

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:32.279
If I come over here -- (Laughs)

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:33.662
He's smart.

00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:35.876
And if I get too close to him,

00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:39.009
he gets scared just like any other creature.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.459
So in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own.

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.352
Thanks, little guy.

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:45.734
(Sneezing sound)

00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:47.825
Bless you.

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:52.443
And if I want to explore the world -- uh-oh, Romo's tired --

00:01:52.443 --> 00:01:54.458
if I want to explore the world with Romo,

00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:57.392
I can actually connect him from any other iOS device.

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:58.952
So here's the iPad.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.693
And Romo will actually stream video to this device.

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:03.326
So I can see everything that Romo sees,

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:05.358
and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:06.794
Now this is a free app on the App Store,

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:08.516
so if any of you guys had this app on your phones,

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:12.243
we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together.

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:13.925
So I'll show you really quickly,

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.771
Romo actually -- he's streaming video,

00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:17.961
so you can see me and the entire TED audience.

00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:19.493
If I get in front of Romo here.

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:22.534
And if I want to control him, I can just drive.

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:26.986
So I can drive him around,

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:28.912
and I can take pictures of you.

00:02:28.912 --> 00:02:31.317
I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.819
So I'll snap a picture.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.379
And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad,

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.969
I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.700
So there are all of you through Romo's eyes.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.786
And finally, because Romo is an extension of me,

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.804
I can express myself through his emotions.

00:02:48.804 --> 00:02:54.070
So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.453
But the most important thing about Romo

00:02:55.453 --> 00:03:00.543
is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive.

00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:03.127
You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo.

00:03:03.127 --> 00:03:06.095
In fact, who would like to drive a robot?

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:08.627
Okay. Awesome.

00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:10.261
Here you go.

00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:13.115
Thank you, Scott.

00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:15.869
And even cooler, you actually don't have to be

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:20.276
in the same geographic location as the robot to control him.

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:23.561
So he actually streams two-way audio and video

00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:25.202
between any two smart devices.

00:03:25.202 --> 00:03:27.010
So you can log in through the browser,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.494
and it's kind of like Skype on wheels.

00:03:28.494 --> 00:03:30.228
So we were talking before about telepresence,

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:31.660
and this is a really cool example.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.977
You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone,

00:03:35.977 --> 00:03:37.494
and her mom buys her a robot.

00:03:37.494 --> 00:03:40.395
That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot,

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:43.024
send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country.

00:03:43.024 --> 00:03:46.378
Grandma can log into that robot and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter

00:03:46.378 --> 00:03:48.702
for fifteen minutes every single night,

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:52.013
when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year.

00:03:52.013 --> 00:03:53.545
Thanks, Scott.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:59.229
(Applause)

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.576
So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today.

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:06.536
But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future.

00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:10.061
This is actually something that one of our engineers, Dom, built in a weekend.

00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.429
It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly.

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:17.525
This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:19.704
and create any behavior for this robot you want.

00:04:19.704 --> 00:04:22.485
You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo.

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:25.345
And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser,

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:27.315
which is what you see Romo doing on the left.

00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:28.666
And then if you have something you like,

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:31.761
you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life,

00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:33.245
run the program in real life.

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:34.952
And then if you have something you're proud of,

00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:38.493
you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world.

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:41.619
So all of these wi-fiâ€“enabled robots actually learn from each other.

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:45.929
The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:50.518
is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal.

00:04:50.518 --> 00:04:53.124
They change from person to person.

00:04:53.124 --> 00:04:55.540
So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.691
that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination.

00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:03.543
So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like.

00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:06.027
To be honest, I have no idea.

00:05:06.027 --> 00:05:11.130
But what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.457
or a large humanoid robot away.

00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:17.458
The future of personal robotics is happening today,

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:21.041
and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.036
and the creativity of people like yourselves.

00:05:24.036 --> 00:05:26.218
So we can't wait to get you all robots,

00:05:26.218 --> 00:05:27.946
and we can't wait to see what you build.

00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:29.128
Thank you.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:32.673
(Applause)
