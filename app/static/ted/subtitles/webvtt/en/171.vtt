00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I was excited, with this phone call.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So I went to bed that night pretty excited.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Not sure of all the details, but excited.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It wasn't at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Woke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
To tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So, I called back Major Heilshorn,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
who's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And he knew me, so I was like, "Greg?"

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
He's like, "Yes, Deborah?"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Told him my idea, and you know,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
he is one of the bravest men in the world,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Within 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
He gave me my pick of units.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I picked one unit -- Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
they're mountain infantry -- for two reasons.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
One, they're infantry.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Number two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
so I knew they would have Internet access.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This was a big thing that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I think when Major H told me,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The opening one was,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
"What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?"

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Gave them about a nine minute response,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and there we went.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
many of you may not have had a chance to see it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So, I want to show the trailer,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If we could roll?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Video) Stephen Pink: This is Sergeant Stephen Pink.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Michael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Zack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Soldier: We're not supposed to talk to the media.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
SP: I'm not the media, dammit!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
MM: The day is here. Life will change.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Voice: The real deal, man! Narrator: You ready?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Soldier: Bring it on! Narrator: You ready? Voice 2: Iraq, here we come!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
ZB: Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's natural instinct.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
SP: If you let fear get to you,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
then you're not going to be doing your job.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
MM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It's unbelievable.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
ZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Soldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Man down! Man down!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
MM: Keep going, brother. You wanna play?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Michael Moriarty's Wife: It's really hard for him to not have his dad.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
MM: This little kid is in the middle of a war zone.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Stephen Pink's Girlfriend: In the beginning, he's like, "Write something dirty!"

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
George W. Bush: The world's newest democracy.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
MM: They're shooting at me.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
SP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and say we're there to create democracy.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Soldier: We've got a drive through window at Burger King now.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
SP: We're here to create money.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
MM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Jon Baril: The worst thing in my life.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
SP: Baril, don't look at it, bud.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Michael Moriarty's Wife: He's not the same person anymore.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
MM: I will not go back.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Kevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and we just killed one.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Soldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
There they are! Right there! Fire, fire!

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
JB: It'll be a better country in 20 years, 'cause we were there.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I hope.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
(Applause) Deborah Scranton: Thank you.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
One of the things I'd like to talk to you about

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I don't know how many of you might imagine it,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Paul? Come on, stand up.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This is Paul Anthony.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
He served -- (Applause) -- with the Marines,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and I want to tell you a little, brief story.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We were one of the lucky ones

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Right? And we started talking.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
People will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes,"

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and then we'll start talking about war.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We got in a conversation with some other people in the class,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and it went on and on.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I mean, we were there for an hour, talking.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
you guys to think about and hopefully to help with,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
which is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and about politics.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And really -- because maybe we're going to disagree.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Maybe it's going to get uncomfortable.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And you know, Paul was talking,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and he then turned to Constance and said,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
"You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
because I know she has my back."

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And I want to say, I was nervous.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Because I'm used to doing Q&amp;As.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I really related to what James was saying yesterday,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
because I'm behind the camera.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
You know, I can answer questions about my movie,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
because I know you have my back.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
This film was not about the Internet,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
but it could not have been made without it.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
In the meantime, the soldiers -- we would email and IM.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I didn't save all of them,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
because I didn't realize at the beginning

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that it would be something that I would want to keep track of.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that I was able to save.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000
The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to really get inside of it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So I wanted to show you a clip,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
If we could roll the clip.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
(Video) SP: Today is sport. [Unclear] Radio: [Unclear] Christian soldiers.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
SP: We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So, what we do, we ride with the windows down.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Because, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
We don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
It's not true. Very unsafe.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Whoa.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Soldier: Right there.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
SP: All right, let's get over to that site.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Be advised, we're leaving Taji right now.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
we're heading to that location now.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Soldier: That's a fucking car bomb!

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Soldier: Motherfuckers!

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Soldiers: Get your vest on!

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Hey, get over the fucking -- yeah, yeah.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Any one-four elements get to the gate!

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
SP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
we need you at the gate of Taji right now, over.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Soldier: I'll walk you through it.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
(Voices)

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
SP: Stay low. Head over to the right.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Get your bag, get your bag!

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
(Screams)

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
SP: It was mass casualties.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Probably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
SP: It just looked like, you know,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
someone had thrown a quarter through a guy,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Everything was cauterized,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and it was just like there was a void going through the body.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
This is the scene north.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
This is blood.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And you know, you walk,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and you hear the pieces of skin.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And that's it, that's all that's left.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall, shaking and screaming.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Medics who were terrified and couldn't perform.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
They can work on the post for pennies, but can't die there.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They've got to die outside.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I would've slit his throat right there.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
21:00 hours, and it's just our squad

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
going through today's events in our heads,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
whether we want to or not.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
News Anchor: More violence in Iraq.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
near a coalition base north of Baghdad.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
SP: We made the news.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I feel exploited and proud at the same time.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I've lost all faith in the media --

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I'll do that, then I'm gonna jerk off.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Because these pages smell like Linds,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Another mission at 06:00.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
DS: Now -- (Applause) -- thanks.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
When I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
It's a new way of trying to make a documentary.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
When I met the guys, and 10 of them agreed to take cameras --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
in total, 21 ended up filming.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Five soldiers filmed the entire time.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
There are three featured in the film.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And the tone from the email was,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
you know, it had been a very bad day, obviously.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So, I pinged Mike and I said,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
"Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?"

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Because the thing that very often is missing is,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
in the military what they call "hot wash."

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And if you let time go by,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
it kind of softens and smooths the edges.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And for me, I really wanted that.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, in order to get the intimacy,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to share that experience with you, the guys --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
the two most popular mounts --

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
there was a camera on the turret, the gun turret,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and then on the dashboard of the Humvee.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Most of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So you get to experience that in real time, right?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
within 24 hours of that episode happening.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Steve Pink reading his journal

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
happened five months after he came home.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And you know, you earn someone's trust,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
especially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So, it wasn't until five months after he was home

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
that he would read that journal.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
in the format that they have.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
American soldiers saying,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
"Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
OK, this is a perfect example.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
They didn't have to go outside the wire.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
There were not Americans hurt out there.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the Iraqis who work on the post.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So, when you may hear soldiers complaining,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that's what they're talking about, you know?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
as a way of bridging.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&amp;As,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and people are really opinionated.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But it seems like people don't want to hear so much,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
or listen, or try to have an exchange.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think --

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
you know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and my concern is that we have to have these conversations.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
we think we know.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
But we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
There's such a disconnect.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I'll share one story.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And at screenings, inevitably --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
you know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And usually, the first questions are,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
"Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?"

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Or you know, these things.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But there's always a few guys, almost always, who are the last ones.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
that then became my story, was --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler --

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
In this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
A soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
a foot away from me.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
He's a big guy.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And he looked at me, and I smiled,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And he wasn't going to blink.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And he said, "My gunner was throwing candy."

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And I knew what he was going to say.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The gunner was throwing candy.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
They used to throw candy to the kids.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Kids got too close, very often.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And he said, "I killed a child.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And I'm a father. I have children.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I haven't been able to tell my wife.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster."

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I hugged him, of course,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and I said, you know, "It's going to be OK."

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And he said, "I'm going to bring her to see your film.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And then I'm going to tell her."

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So when I talk about a disconnect,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
which there obviously are. You know, these days,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
it's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and everybody seemed involved.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And often, I'll hear people say,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
who maybe know that I did this film,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and they say, "Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers."

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And I've started to ask them,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
"Well, that's nice. What are you doing?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Are you volunteering at a VA?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
You go and see anybody?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Do you, if you find out your neighbor's been, do you spend some time?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Not necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Do you give money to any of the charities?"

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I think, I challenge us to say --

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
to operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Are you a friend to them?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Do you really care?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guys

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
to please, you know, reach out a hand.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And really do give them a hug.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Thank you.
