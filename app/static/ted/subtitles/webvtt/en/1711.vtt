00:00:01.243 --> 00:00:05.195
I want to share some personal friends and stories with you

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:07.232
that I've actually never talked about in public before

00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:09.592
to help illustrate the idea

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:11.511
and the need and the hope

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.793
for us to reinvent our health care system around the world.

00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:18.180
Twenty-four years ago, I had -- a sophomore in college,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.002
I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.933
And I ended up in student health,

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.102
and they ran some labwork and came back right away,

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:28.275
and said, "Kidney problems."

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:31.725
And before I knew it, I was involved and thrown into

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:34.945
this six months of tests and trials and tribulations

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:37.629
with six doctors across two hospitals

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.325
in this clash of medical titans

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.369
to figure out which one of them was right

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:44.833
about what was wrong with me.

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.106
And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound,

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:50.929
and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once,

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.281
and I'm like, "Uh oh, this is bad news."

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:56.844
And their diagnosis was this:

00:00:56.844 --> 00:00:58.754
They said, "You have two rare kidney diseases

00:00:58.754 --> 00:01:01.435
that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually,

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.972
you have cancer-like cells in your immune system

00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:05.889
that we need to start treatment right away,

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:08.346
and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant,

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:11.765
and you're not likely to live more than two or three years."

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:14.729
Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis,

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.129
it just sucked me in immediately,

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:19.771
as if I began preparing myself as a patient

00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:23.868
to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me,

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:26.508
until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room,

00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:28.566
who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.560
and took me off to the medical library

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.494
and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases,

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:36.014
and said, "Eric, these people who get this

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:37.962
are normally in their '70s and '80s.

00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:41.073
They don't know anything about you. Wake up.

00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:44.195
Take control of your health and get on with your life."

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:45.737
And I did.

00:01:45.737 --> 00:01:48.097
Now, these people making these proclamations to me

00:01:48.097 --> 00:01:49.423
were not bad people.

00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:51.984
In fact, these professionals were miracle workers,

00:01:51.984 --> 00:01:56.050
but they're working in a flawed, expensive system that's set up the wrong way.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.305
It's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need.

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:02.972
It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us.

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:06.887
It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails,

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:09.487
and so something either works or you die.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:13.695
And it's dependent on passive patients

00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:17.457
who just take it and don't ask any questions.

00:02:17.457 --> 00:02:19.019
Now the problem with this model

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.505
is that it's unsustainable globally.

00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:23.459
It's unaffordable globally.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.946
We need to invent what I call a personal health system.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.269
So what does this personal health system look like,

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.310
and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail?

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.463
Now, I'm going to start by actually sharing with you

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:38.359
a new friend of mine, Libby,

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.073
somebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months.

00:02:41.073 --> 00:02:44.949
This is Libby, or actually, this is an ultrasound image of Libby.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.820
This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.671
Now, this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today,

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.611
and you'll notice, on the edge of this image,

00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:56.520
there's some dark spots there, which was really concerning to me.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.049
So we're going to actually do a live exam

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.424
to sort of see how Libby's doing.

00:03:00.424 --> 00:03:03.142
This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here.

00:03:03.142 --> 00:03:05.276
Don't you in the front row worry or anything.

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:06.558
(Laughter)

00:03:06.558 --> 00:03:10.285
I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante.

00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:11.759
This is a portable ultrasound.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.302
It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet.

00:03:14.302 --> 00:03:16.432
Mobisante is up in Redmond, Washington,

00:03:16.432 --> 00:03:20.082
and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself.

00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:22.287
They're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this.

00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:25.098
This is a concept demo, so I want to make that clear.

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:26.185
All right, I gotta gel up.

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:30.636
Now the people in the front row are very nervous. (Laughter)

00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:34.681
And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk,

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.128
who's another friend of mine.

00:03:36.128 --> 00:03:40.014
He's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon.

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:43.508
So let me just make sure. Hey, Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay?

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:45.684
And actually, can you see Libby?

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:46.862
Thomas Batuik: Hi there, Eric.

00:03:46.862 --> 00:03:48.107
You look busy. How are you?

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:50.835
Eric Dishman: I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off

00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:53.404
in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful.

00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:58.061
So I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get?

00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:01.798
And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there.

00:04:01.798 --> 00:04:04.527
TB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here,

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:05.802
give me a lay of the land.

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:09.318
ED: All right.TB: Okay. Turn it a little bit inside,

00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.718
a little bit toward the middle for me.

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:16.514
Okay, that's good. How about up a little bit?

00:04:16.514 --> 00:04:19.564
Okay, freeze that image. That's a good one for me.

00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:22.251
ED: All right. Now last week, when I did this,

00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:25.052
you had me measure that spot to the right.

00:04:25.052 --> 00:04:26.739
Should I do that again?

00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:27.783
TB: Yeah, let's do that.

00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:31.087
ED: All right. This is kind of hard to do

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:33.258
with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring,

00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:34.513
but I've got it, I think,

00:04:34.513 --> 00:04:37.064
and I'll save that image and send it to you.

00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:39.536
So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means.

00:04:39.536 --> 00:04:41.641
It's not something I was very happy about.

00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:43.584
TB: Many people after a kidney transplant

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.852
will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:50.133
Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief,

00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:52.541
but it does warrant looking at,

00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:55.516
so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today,

00:04:55.516 --> 00:04:58.444
make sure that it's not growing, it's not creating any problems.

00:04:58.444 --> 00:05:00.660
Based on the other images we have,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.044
I'm really happy how it looks today.

00:05:03.044 --> 00:05:05.441
ED: All right. Well, I guess we'll double check it when I come in.

00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.006
I've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks,

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:09.715
and I'm going to let you do that in the clinic,

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:12.155
because I don't think I can do that one on myself.

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:14.800
TB: Good choice.ED: All right, thanks, Dr. Batiuk.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.931
All right. So what you're sort of seeing here

00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:19.039
is an example of disruptive technologies,

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.235
of mobile, social and analytic technologies.

00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:25.146
These are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible.

00:05:25.146 --> 00:05:27.731
Now there's really three pillars

00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:29.628
of this personal health I want to talk to you about now,

00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:33.420
and it's care anywhere, care networking and care customization.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.103
And you just saw a little bit of the first two

00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:36.644
with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk.

00:05:36.644 --> 00:05:39.524
So let's start with care anywhere.

00:05:39.524 --> 00:05:42.252
Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics

00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:46.152
in the 1780s. It is time to update our thinking.

00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:49.646
We have got to untether clinicians and patients

00:05:49.646 --> 00:05:52.264
from the notion of traveling to a special

00:05:52.264 --> 00:05:54.844
bricks-and-mortar place for all of our care,

00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:57.145
because these places are often the wrong tool,

00:05:57.145 --> 00:05:59.611
and the most expensive tool, for the job.

00:05:59.611 --> 00:06:03.163
And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients,

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:05.300
especially in an era of superbugs

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.416
and hospital-acquired infections.

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:10.298
And many countries are going to go brickless from the start

00:06:10.298 --> 00:06:12.264
because they're never going to be able to afford

00:06:12.264 --> 00:06:16.784
the mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built.

00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:19.540
Now I personally learned that hospitals

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.056
can be a very dangerous place at a young age.

00:06:22.056 --> 00:06:23.896
This was me in third grade.

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:26.312
I broke my elbow very seriously, had to have surgery,

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:28.639
worried that they were going to actually lose the arm.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.575
Recovering from the surgery in the hospital, I get bedsores.

00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:33.808
Those bedsores become infected,

00:06:33.808 --> 00:06:36.744
and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to,

00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:38.695
and now my whole body breaks out,

00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:41.255
and now all of those become infected.

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.802
The longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became,

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:45.387
and the more expensive it became,

00:06:45.387 --> 00:06:48.732
and this happens to millions of people around the world every year.

00:06:48.732 --> 00:06:51.075
The future of personal health that I'm talking about

00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:55.533
says care must occur at home as the default model,

00:06:55.533 --> 00:06:57.013
not in a hospital or clinic.

00:06:57.013 --> 00:06:58.573
You have to earn your way into those places

00:06:58.573 --> 00:07:02.139
by being sick enough to use that tool for the job.

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.245
Now the smartphones that we're already carrying

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:07.971
can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them,

00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.142
and a whole array of others, today,

00:07:10.142 --> 00:07:11.664
and as sensing is built into these,

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.694
we'll be able to do vital signs monitor

00:07:13.694 --> 00:07:16.533
and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before.

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:19.085
Many of us will have implantables that will actually look

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:21.822
real-time at what's going on with our blood chemistry

00:07:21.822 --> 00:07:24.069
and in our proteins right now.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.764
Now the software is also getting smarter, right?

00:07:26.764 --> 00:07:29.861
Think about a coach, an agent online,

00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:31.997
that's going to help me do safe self-care.

00:07:31.997 --> 00:07:34.302
That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound

00:07:34.302 --> 00:07:36.525
will likely have real-time image processing,

00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:38.670
and the device will say, "Up, down, left, right,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.326
ah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:43.175
off to your doctor."

00:07:43.175 --> 00:07:45.382
Now, if we've got all these networked devices

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.762
that are helping us to do care anywhere,

00:07:47.762 --> 00:07:49.557
it stands to reason that we also need a team

00:07:49.557 --> 00:07:51.544
to be able to interact with all of that stuff,

00:07:51.544 --> 00:07:54.165
and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about,

00:07:54.165 --> 00:07:55.737
care networking.

00:07:55.737 --> 00:07:58.883
We have got to go beyond this paradigm

00:07:58.883 --> 00:08:02.534
of isolated specialists doing parts care

00:08:02.534 --> 00:08:06.753
to multidisciplinary teams doing person care.

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:10.149
Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best,

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:12.244
and it is deadly at worst.

00:08:12.244 --> 00:08:14.647
Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused

00:08:14.647 --> 00:08:16.595
by communication and coordination problems

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:18.916
amongst medical team members.

00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:21.155
I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school,

00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:23.269
when we're under treatment for the kidney,

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:25.883
and suddenly, they're like, "Oh, we think you have a heart problem."

00:08:25.883 --> 00:08:27.768
And I have these palpitations that are showing up.

00:08:27.768 --> 00:08:30.274
They put me through five weeks of tests --

00:08:30.274 --> 00:08:33.773
very expensive, very scary -- before the nurse finally notices

00:08:33.773 --> 00:08:35.869
the piece of the paper, my meds list

00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:37.391
that I've been carrying to every single appointment,

00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:39.577
and says, "Oh my gosh."

00:08:39.577 --> 00:08:41.546
Three different specialists had prescribed

00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:43.585
three different versions of the same drug to me.

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:47.860
I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.673
I had a care coordination problem.

00:08:50.673 --> 00:08:53.439
And this happens to millions of people every year.

00:08:53.439 --> 00:08:57.073
I want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen

00:08:57.073 --> 00:09:00.805
to make health care a coordinated team sport.

00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:03.107
Now this is the most frightening thing to me.

00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:07.365
Out of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world,

00:09:07.365 --> 00:09:10.712
the first time I've ever had a true team-based care experience

00:09:10.712 --> 00:09:13.483
was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months

00:09:13.483 --> 00:09:14.541
for me to go get this.

00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:17.510
And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.020
There's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.636
We just talked to him. Here's Jenny, one of the nurses,

00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:24.948
Allison, who helped manage the transplant list,

00:09:24.948 --> 00:09:27.092
and a dozen other people who aren't pictured,

00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:29.628
a pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist,

00:09:29.628 --> 00:09:31.870
even a financial counselor, Lisa,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.597
who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles.

00:09:34.597 --> 00:09:37.196
I wept the day I graduated.

00:09:37.196 --> 00:09:38.823
I should have been happy, because I was so well

00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:40.476
that I could go back to my normal doctors,

00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:43.771
but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team.

00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.367
And here's the most important part.

00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:48.406
The other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley.

00:09:48.406 --> 00:09:52.508
Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home

00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:55.252
so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics.

00:09:55.252 --> 00:09:57.716
That's the only way that the model works.

00:09:57.716 --> 00:09:59.532
My team is actually working in China

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.271
on one of these self-care models

00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:03.644
for a project we called Age-Friendly Cities.

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.438
We're trying to help build a social network

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.922
that can help track and train the care of seniors

00:10:07.922 --> 00:10:09.429
caring for themselves

00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:11.834
as well as the care provided by their family members

00:10:11.834 --> 00:10:14.316
or volunteer community health workers,

00:10:14.316 --> 00:10:16.572
as well as have an exchange network online,

00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:19.900
where, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.770
if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.428
and we exchange all of that online.

00:10:25.428 --> 00:10:27.818
The most important point I want to make to you about this

00:10:27.818 --> 00:10:31.132
is the sacred and somewhat over-romanticized

00:10:31.132 --> 00:10:33.906
doctor-patient one-on-one

00:10:33.906 --> 00:10:36.022
is a relic of the past.

00:10:36.022 --> 00:10:38.474
The future of health care is smart teams,

00:10:38.474 --> 00:10:42.043
and you'd better be on that team for yourself.

00:10:42.043 --> 00:10:44.335
Now, the last thing that I want to talk to you about

00:10:44.335 --> 00:10:45.575
is care customization,

00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:48.500
because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.308
those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system,

00:10:51.308 --> 00:10:54.341
but there's still too much guesswork.

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:58.429
Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948

00:10:58.429 --> 00:11:01.811
to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis,

00:11:01.811 --> 00:11:04.108
and those are important things, don't get me wrong.

00:11:04.108 --> 00:11:05.973
These population studies that we've done have created

00:11:05.973 --> 00:11:08.552
tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives,

00:11:08.552 --> 00:11:10.987
but the problem is that health care

00:11:10.987 --> 00:11:15.067
is treating us as averages, not unique individuals,

00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:16.614
because at the end of the day,

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:19.869
the patient is not the same thing as the population

00:11:19.869 --> 00:11:23.147
who are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork.

00:11:23.147 --> 00:11:24.985
The technologies that are coming,

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.074
high-performance computing, analytics,

00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:28.991
big data that everyone's talking about,

00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:31.910
will allow us to build predictive models for each of us

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.864
as individual patients.

00:11:33.864 --> 00:11:38.323
And the magic here is, experiment on my avatar

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:43.124
in software, not my body in suffering.

00:11:43.124 --> 00:11:45.607
Now, I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you

00:11:45.607 --> 00:11:48.166
of this kind of care customization on my own journey.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.343
The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:55.220
that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.974
It's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live.

00:11:57.974 --> 00:12:01.041
I was optimizing my life for quality of life,

00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:05.421
and quality of life for me means time in snow.

00:12:05.421 --> 00:12:08.251
So on my chart, I forced them to put, "Patient goal:

00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:12.017
low doses of drugs over longer periods of time,

00:12:12.017 --> 00:12:15.263
side effects friendly to skiing."

00:12:15.263 --> 00:12:17.915
And I think that's why I achieved longevity.

00:12:17.915 --> 00:12:20.147
I think that time-in-snow therapy was as important

00:12:20.147 --> 00:12:22.280
as the pharmaceuticals that I had.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.595
Now the second example of customization -- and by the way,

00:12:24.595 --> 00:12:26.491
you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals,

00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:29.860
so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.572
But the second example I want to give you is,

00:12:31.572 --> 00:12:33.359
I happened to be an early guinea pig,

00:12:33.359 --> 00:12:36.963
and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced.

00:12:36.963 --> 00:12:39.285
Now it took about two weeks of processing

00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:41.409
on Intel's highest-end servers to make this happen,

00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:44.441
and another six months of human and computing labor

00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:47.003
to make sense of all of that data.

00:12:47.003 --> 00:12:50.053
And at the end of all of that, they said, "Yes,

00:12:50.053 --> 00:12:52.491
those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans

00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:54.875
all of those years ago were wrong,

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:57.149
and we have a better path forward."

00:12:57.149 --> 00:12:59.534
The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out

00:12:59.534 --> 00:13:01.731
how to make that computing for personalized medicine

00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:05.484
go from months and weeks to even hours,

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:07.155
and make this kind of tool available,

00:13:07.155 --> 00:13:10.973
not just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world,

00:13:10.973 --> 00:13:13.779
but in the mainstream -- every patient, every clinic

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:15.928
with access to whole genome sequencing.

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:18.271
And I tell you, this kind of care customization

00:13:18.271 --> 00:13:21.097
for everything from your goals to your genetics

00:13:21.097 --> 00:13:22.862
will be the most game-changing transformation

00:13:22.862 --> 00:13:26.444
that we witness in health care during our lifetime.

00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:29.378
So these three pillars of personal health,

00:13:29.378 --> 00:13:32.236
care anywhere, care networking, care customization,

00:13:32.236 --> 00:13:33.483
are happening in pieces now,

00:13:33.483 --> 00:13:37.266
but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up

00:13:37.266 --> 00:13:41.267
as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles.

00:13:41.267 --> 00:13:42.920
It's what my friend Verna said:

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.041
Wake up and take control of your health.

00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:46.630
Because at the end of the day these technologies

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.527
are simply about people caring for other people

00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:53.938
and ourselves in some powerful new ways.

00:13:53.938 --> 00:13:55.498
And it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you

00:13:55.498 --> 00:13:58.049
to one last friend, very quickly.

00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:01.916
Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney

00:14:01.916 --> 00:14:06.597
that I was never supposed to have.

00:14:06.597 --> 00:14:22.276
(Applause)

00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:27.349
So Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you.

00:14:27.349 --> 00:14:29.233
Tracey Gamley: For me, it was really easy.

00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:31.184
I only had one night in the hospital.

00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:32.888
The surgery was done laparoscopically,

00:14:32.888 --> 00:14:36.094
so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen,

00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:38.133
and I had four weeks away from work

00:14:38.133 --> 00:14:40.016
and went back to doing everything I'd done before

00:14:40.016 --> 00:14:41.532
without any changes.

00:14:41.532 --> 00:14:44.518
ED: Well, I probably will never get a chance to say this to you

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:46.977
in such a large audience ever again.

00:14:46.977 --> 00:14:49.764
So "thank you" feel likes a really trite word,

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.226
but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life.

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:58.109
(Applause)

00:14:58.109 --> 00:15:00.558
This TED stage and all of the TED stages

00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:03.284
are often about celebrating innovation

00:15:03.284 --> 00:15:04.393
and celebrating new technologies,

00:15:04.393 --> 00:15:06.678
and I've done that here today,

00:15:06.678 --> 00:15:09.007
and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers,

00:15:09.007 --> 00:15:13.040
I mean, my gosh, artificial kidneys, even printable kidneys, that are coming.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.221
But until such time that these amazing technologies

00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:19.259
are available to all of us, and even when they are,

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:23.686
it's up to us to care for, and even save, one another.

00:15:23.686 --> 00:15:26.124
I hope you will go out and make personal health happen

00:15:26.124 --> 00:15:30.052
for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much.

00:15:30.052 --> 00:15:34.699
(Applause)
