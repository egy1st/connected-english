00:00:00.797 --> 00:00:03.451
I'd like you to come back with me for a moment

00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:05.475
to the 19th century,

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:09.923
specifically to June 24, 1833.

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:12.978
The British Association for the Advancement of Science

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:16.769
is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.980
It's the first night of the meeting,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.843
and a confrontation is about to take place

00:00:21.843 --> 00:00:25.451
that will change science forever.

00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:28.428
An elderly, white-haired man stands up.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.890
The members of the Association are shocked to realize

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.914
that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge,

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:39.874
who hadn't even left his house in years until that day.

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:42.770
They're even more shocked by what he says.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.206
"You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers."

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:51.250
Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.298
pondered the cosmos from their armchairs.

00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:56.754
They were not mucking around in the fossil pits

00:00:56.754 --> 00:01:00.118
or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles

00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:03.090
like the members of the British Association.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.677
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.

00:01:07.677 --> 00:01:11.055
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.271
and quieted the audience.

00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:16.098
He politely agreed that an appropriate name

00:01:16.098 --> 00:01:19.914
for the members of the association did not exist.

00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:25.458
"If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term,"

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:30.274
he said, "then, by analogy with 'artist,'

00:01:30.274 --> 00:01:34.214
we may form 'scientist.'"

00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:36.843
This was the first time the word scientist

00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:38.697
was uttered in public,

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:42.293
only 179 years ago.

00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:45.438
I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school,

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.482
and it kind of blew me away.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.666
I mean, how could the word scientist

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:53.155
not have existed until 1833?

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.346
What were scientists called before?

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:58.671
What had changed to make a new name necessary

00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:01.801
precisely at that moment?

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:04.895
Prior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.067
were talented amateurs.

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:09.355
Think of the country clergyman or squire

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:11.868
collecting his beetles or fossils,

00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:14.163
like Charles Darwin, for example,

00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:18.339
or, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley,

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.695
who was the literary companion

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:22.855
to the Marquis of Lansdowne

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:25.727
when he discovered oxygen.

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:28.527
After this, they were scientists,

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:32.361
professionals with a particular scientific method,

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:36.096
goals, societies and funding.

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:39.372
Much of this revolution can be traced to four men

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:42.631
who met at Cambridge University in 1812:

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:47.186
Charles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell.

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:49.663
These were brilliant, driven men

00:02:49.663 --> 00:02:52.935
who accomplished amazing things.

00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:55.934
Charles Babbage, I think known to most TEDsters,

00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:58.729
invented the first mechanical calculator

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:02.752
and the first prototype of a modern computer.

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:06.812
John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere,

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:11.042
and, in his spare time, co-invented photography.

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:13.190
I'm sure we could all be that productive

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.074
without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time.

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:19.364
Richard Jones became an important economist

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:21.891
who later influenced Karl Marx.

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:25.413
And Whewell not only coined the term scientist,

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:29.448
as well as the words anode, cathode and ion,

00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:32.484
but spearheaded international big science

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:35.580
with his global research on the tides.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.292
In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813,

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:43.055
the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.815
They talked about science

00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:47.937
and the need for a new scientific revolution.

00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:49.828
They felt science had stagnated

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:53.080
since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.318
in the 17th century.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.384
It was time for a new revolution,

00:03:57.384 --> 00:03:59.508
which they pledged to bring about,

00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:02.229
and what's so amazing about these guys is,

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.012
not only did they have these

00:04:04.012 --> 00:04:06.605
grandiose undergraduate dreams,

00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:08.845
but they actually carried them out,

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:11.893
even beyond their wildest dreams.

00:04:11.893 --> 00:04:12.985
And I'm going to tell you today

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:17.942
about four major changes to science these men made.

00:04:17.942 --> 00:04:20.365
About 200 years before,

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:23.093
Francis Bacon and then, later, Isaac Newton,

00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:26.805
had proposed an inductive scientific method.

00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:29.342
Now that's a method that starts from

00:04:29.342 --> 00:04:31.797
observations and experiments

00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:35.269
and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws,

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:37.753
which are always subject to revision or rejection

00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:40.298
should new evidence arise.

00:04:40.298 --> 00:04:45.681
However, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:48.630
by arguing that the science of economics

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.779
should use a different, deductive method.

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:55.458
The problem was that an influential group at Oxford

00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:59.539
began arguing that because it worked so well in economics,

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.209
this deductive method ought to be applied

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:04.883
to the natural sciences too.

00:05:04.883 --> 00:05:08.539
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed.

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.821
They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method

00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:13.453
in all the sciences

00:05:13.453 --> 00:05:16.311
that were widely read by natural philosophers,

00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:19.733
university students and members of the public.

00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:21.489
Reading one of Herschel's books

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:24.279
was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.076
that he would later say, "Scarcely anything in my life

00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:30.663
made so deep an impression on me.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.271
It made me wish to add my might

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:36.799
to the accumulated store of natural knowledge."

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:39.911
It also shaped Darwin's scientific method,

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.770
as well as that used by his peers.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.548
[Science for the public good]

00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:48.142
Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge

00:05:48.142 --> 00:05:50.775
ought to be used for the good of the king or queen,

00:05:50.775 --> 00:05:53.688
or for one's own personal gain.

00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:56.391
For example, ship captains needed to know

00:05:56.391 --> 00:06:00.578
information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.

00:06:00.578 --> 00:06:02.771
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge

00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:05.787
and sell it to the ship captains.

00:06:05.787 --> 00:06:08.395
The philosophical breakfast club changed that,

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:09.745
working together.

00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:11.825
Whewell's worldwide study of the tides

00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:14.963
resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps

00:06:14.963 --> 00:06:17.950
that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.051
to all ship captains.

00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:22.853
Herschel helped by making tidal observations

00:06:22.853 --> 00:06:24.821
off the coast of South Africa,

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:27.171
and, as he complained to Whewell,

00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:32.323
he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble.

00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:35.051
The four men really helped each other in every way.

00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:38.363
They also relentlessly lobbied the British government

00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:40.999
for the money to build Babbage's engines

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:42.990
because they believed these engines

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.824
would have a huge practical impact on society.

00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:49.444
In the days before pocket calculators,

00:06:49.444 --> 00:06:52.780
the numbers that most professionals needed --

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.388
bankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers —

00:06:56.388 --> 00:06:59.472
were to be found in lookup books like this,

00:06:59.472 --> 00:07:01.868
filled with tables of figures.

00:07:01.868 --> 00:07:04.276
These tables were calculated

00:07:04.276 --> 00:07:07.195
using a fixed procedure over and over

00:07:07.195 --> 00:07:11.864
by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers,

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.743
but these calculations were really difficult.

00:07:14.743 --> 00:07:16.991
I mean, this nautical almanac

00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:20.861
published the lunar differences for every month of the year.

00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:25.527
Each month required 1,365 calculations,

00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:28.511
so these tables were filled with mistakes.

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:32.676
Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator

00:07:32.676 --> 00:07:36.655
devised to accurately compute any of these tables.

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:40.191
Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years

00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:42.951
by a team from the Science Museum of London

00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:44.634
using his own plans.

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:48.772
This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California,

00:07:48.772 --> 00:07:52.479
and it calculates accurately. It actually works.

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:55.094
Later, Babbage's analytical engine

00:07:55.094 --> 00:07:59.379
was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense.

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:02.333
It had a separate memory and central processor.

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:05.786
It was capable of iteration, conditional branching

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:07.258
and parallel processing,

00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:10.230
and it was programmable using punched cards,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.702
an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:17.938
Tragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day

00:08:17.938 --> 00:08:20.125
because most people thought that

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.020
non-human computers would have no usefulness

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.602
for the public.

00:08:24.602 --> 00:08:26.614
[New scientific institutions]

00:08:26.614 --> 00:08:30.119
Founded in Bacon's time, the Royal Society of London

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:33.116
was the foremost scientific society in England

00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:35.357
and even in the rest of the world.

00:08:35.357 --> 00:08:37.822
By the 19th century, it had become

00:08:37.822 --> 00:08:39.655
a kind of gentleman's club

00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:44.662
populated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility.

00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:46.815
The members of the philosophical breakfast club

00:08:46.815 --> 00:08:49.829
helped form a number of new scientific societies,

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:52.229
including the British Association.

00:08:52.229 --> 00:08:54.612
These new societies required

00:08:54.612 --> 00:08:58.102
that members be active researchers publishing their results.

00:08:58.102 --> 00:09:00.942
They reinstated the tradition of the Q&amp;A

00:09:00.942 --> 00:09:03.212
after scientific papers were read,

00:09:03.212 --> 00:09:05.532
which had been discontinued by the Royal Society

00:09:05.532 --> 00:09:08.437
as being ungentlemanly.

00:09:08.437 --> 00:09:13.333
And for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science.

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:15.993
Members were encouraged to bring their wives,

00:09:15.993 --> 00:09:19.919
daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association,

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:22.689
and while the women were expected to attend

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:26.530
only the public lectures and the social events like this one,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.639
they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:33.523
The British Association would later be the first

00:09:33.523 --> 00:09:37.167
of the major national science organizations in the world

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:39.872
to admit women as full members.

00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:41.313
[External funding for science]

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:42.708
Up to the 19th century,

00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:45.020
natural philosophers were expected to pay

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.333
for their own equipment and supplies.

00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:49.796
Occasionally, there were prizes,

00:09:49.796 --> 00:09:53.125
such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century,

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:56.208
for solving the so-called longitude problem,

00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:59.053
but prizes were only given after the fact,

00:09:59.053 --> 00:10:00.837
when they were given at all.

00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:03.741
On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club,

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:07.052
the British Association began to use the extra money

00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:09.726
generated by its meetings to give grants

00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:12.948
for research in astronomy, the tides, fossil fish,

00:10:12.948 --> 00:10:15.775
shipbuilding, and many other areas.

00:10:15.775 --> 00:10:17.550
These grants not only allowed

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.893
less wealthy men to conduct research,

00:10:19.893 --> 00:10:22.829
but they also encouraged thinking outside the box,

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:26.902
rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question.

00:10:26.902 --> 00:10:29.301
Eventually, the Royal Society

00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:32.710
and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit,

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.558
and this has become -- fortunately it's become --

00:10:35.574 --> 00:10:40.324
a major part of the scientific landscape today.

00:10:40.324 --> 00:10:43.338
So the philosophical breakfast club

00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:46.485
helped invent the modern scientist.

00:10:46.485 --> 00:10:49.713
That's the heroic part of their story.

00:10:49.713 --> 00:10:52.652
There's a flip side as well.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.636
They did not foresee at least one consequence

00:10:55.636 --> 00:10:58.172
of their revolution.

00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:00.548
They would have been deeply dismayed

00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:05.032
by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture.

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:07.689
It's shocking to realize

00:11:07.689 --> 00:11:11.029
that only 28 percent of American adults

00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:14.580
have even a very basic level of science literacy,

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.651
and this was tested by asking simple questions like,

00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:21.460
"Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time?"

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.222
and "What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"

00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:30.215
Once scientists became members of a professional group,

00:11:30.215 --> 00:11:33.580
they were slowly walled off from the rest of us.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.507
This is the unintended consequence of the revolution

00:11:37.507 --> 00:11:40.542
that started with our four friends.

00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:42.335
Charles Darwin said,

00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:46.420
"I sometimes think that general and popular treatises

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.189
are almost as important for the progress of science

00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:50.776
as original work."

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:53.890
In fact, "Origin of Species" was written

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.999
for a general and popular audience,

00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:59.892
and was widely read when it first appeared.

00:11:59.892 --> 00:12:03.903
Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten,

00:12:03.903 --> 00:12:08.322
that science is not only for scientists.

00:12:08.322 --> 00:12:09.943
Thank you.

00:12:09.943 --> 00:12:15.190
