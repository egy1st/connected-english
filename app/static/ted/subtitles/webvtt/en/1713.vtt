WEBVTT

00:00:00.532 --> 00:00:04.644
Let's talk dirty.

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:07.380
A few years ago, oddly enough,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.114
I needed the bathroom,

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:13.464
and I found one, a public bathroom,

00:00:13.464 --> 00:00:15.828
and I went into the stall,

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:19.125
and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life:

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:23.667
use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:25.748
And for some reason that day, instead,

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.932
I asked myself a question,

00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:31.808
and it was, where does this stuff go?

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:35.700
And with that question, I found myself plunged

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.724
into the world of sanitation --

00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:41.289
there's more coming -- (Laughter) —

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.858
sanitation, toilets and poop,

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:48.931
and I have yet to emerge.

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.236
And that's because it's such an enraging,

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:54.452
yet engaging place to be.

00:00:54.452 --> 00:00:57.708
To go back to that toilet,

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:00.502
it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet,

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:01.937
it wasn't as nice as this one

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:04.868
from the World Toilet Organization.

00:01:04.868 --> 00:01:09.135
That's the other WTO. (Laughter)

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.749
But it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water,

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:15.013
it had soap so I could wash my hands,

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:18.077
and I did because I'm a woman, and we do that.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:23.685
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:26.096
But that day, when I asked that question,

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:28.829
I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.044
that a toilet like that was my right,

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:34.222
when in fact it's a privilege.

00:01:34.222 --> 00:01:39.481
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.

00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:43.421
They don't have a bucket or a box.

00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:47.629
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:50.126
And they have to do what this little boy is doing

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:53.061
by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway,

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:55.709
which is called open defecation,

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.064
or poo-pooing in the open.

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:01.298
And he does that every day,

00:02:01.298 --> 00:02:03.797
and every day, probably, that guy in the picture

00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:05.651
walks on by,

00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:09.109
because he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him.

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.229
But he should, because the problem

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.589
with all that poop lying around

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.597
is that poop carries passengers.

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:20.896
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.

00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:23.317
All those things, the eggs, the cysts,

00:02:23.317 --> 00:02:26.093
the bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel

00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:29.501
in one gram of human feces.

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:33.213
How? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.

00:02:33.213 --> 00:02:35.709
He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house,

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.364
and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food

00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:40.768
and his environment

00:02:40.768 --> 00:02:43.165
with whatever diseases he may be carrying

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:48.914
by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.

00:02:48.914 --> 00:02:51.186
In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:53.813
that most of us in this room are lucky to live in,

00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:56.862
the most common symptoms associated with those diseases,

00:02:56.862 --> 00:02:59.688
diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:03.379
It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.229
Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly,

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.837
as a legacy of empire.

00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:11.577
But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea

00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:14.368
in a leading photo image agency,

00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:16.388
this is the picture that you come up with.

00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:18.253
(Laughter)

00:03:18.253 --> 00:03:23.432
Still not sure about the bikini.

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:25.928
And here's another image of diarrhea.

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:29.040
This is Marie Saylee, nine months old.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.839
You can't see her, because she's buried

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:34.122
under that green grass in a little village in Liberia,

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:37.684
because she died in three days from diarrhea --

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:41.313
the Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.

00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:43.792
And that's her dad.

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:45.354
But she wasn't alone that day,

00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:49.154
because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea,

00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:51.824
and they do every day.

00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:56.823
Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide,

00:03:56.823 --> 00:03:59.495
and you've probably been asked to care about things

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:02.656
like HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles,

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:04.000
but diarrhea kills more children

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.712
than all those three things put together.

00:04:07.712 --> 00:04:12.054
It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.

00:04:12.054 --> 00:04:15.202
And the cost to the world is immense:

00:04:15.202 --> 00:04:17.691
260 billion dollars lost every year

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:20.684
on the losses to poor sanitation.

00:04:20.684 --> 00:04:22.365
These are cholera beds in Haiti.

00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:25.864
You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:28.048
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding

00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:31.764
given to any of those other diseases.

00:04:31.764 --> 00:04:34.176
But we know how to fix this.

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:37.696
We know, because in the mid-19th century,

00:04:37.696 --> 00:04:40.085
wonderful Victorian engineers

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:42.888
installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment

00:04:42.888 --> 00:04:47.599
and the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.508
Child mortality dropped by the most

00:04:49.508 --> 00:04:51.698
it had ever dropped in history.

00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:54.644
The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance

00:04:54.644 --> 00:04:57.824
of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal,

00:04:57.824 --> 00:05:00.667
and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia,

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.075
and surgery.

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:04.796
It's a wonderful waste disposal device.

00:05:04.796 --> 00:05:08.414
But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell,

00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:11.193
we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door —

00:05:11.193 --> 00:05:14.197
and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.

00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:15.852
We don't have a neutral word for it.

00:05:15.852 --> 00:05:17.795
Poop's not particularly adequate.

00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:21.920
Shit offends people. Feces is too medical.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.112
Because I can't explain otherwise,

00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:27.680
when I look at the figures, what's going on.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.254
We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation,

00:05:30.254 --> 00:05:32.584
but if you look at the budgets of countries,

00:05:32.584 --> 00:05:34.905
developing and developed,

00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:37.456
you'll think there's something wrong with the math,

00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:40.282
because you'll expect absurdities like

00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:43.164
Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military

00:05:43.164 --> 00:05:45.445
than it does on water and sanitation,

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:48.253
even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea

00:05:48.253 --> 00:05:50.352
in Pakistan every year.

00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:52.312
But then you look at that already minuscule

00:05:52.312 --> 00:05:54.206
water and sanitation budget,

00:05:54.206 --> 00:05:57.690
and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.643
which is great; we all need water.

00:05:59.643 --> 00:06:01.950
No one's going to refuse clean water.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.901
But the humble latrine, or flush toilet,

00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:07.010
reduces disease by twice as much

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.434
as just putting in clean water.

00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:10.745
Think about it. That little boy

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.600
who's running back into his house,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.710
he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply,

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.170
but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.674
And I think that the real waste of human waste

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.442
is that we are wasting it as a resource

00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:29.202
and as an incredible trigger for development,

00:06:29.202 --> 00:06:31.352
because these are a few things that toilets

00:06:31.352 --> 00:06:34.282
and poop itself can do for us.

00:06:34.282 --> 00:06:37.458
So a toilet can put a girl back in school.

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:40.290
Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.808
because they have no adequate sanitation.

00:06:43.808 --> 00:06:45.573
They've been used to sitting through lessons

00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:48.490
for years and years holding it in.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.250
We've all done that, but they do it every day,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.806
and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating,

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:56.149
it just gets too much.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.690
And I understand that. Who can blame them?

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.616
So if you met an educationalist and said,

00:07:01.616 --> 00:07:04.490
"I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.688
with just one simple thing,"

00:07:06.688 --> 00:07:09.501
you'd make a lot of friends in education.

00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:12.036
That's not the only thing it can do for you.

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:15.096
Poop can cook your dinner.

00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:16.790
It's got nutrients in it.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.251
We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:21.103
We don't keep them all.

00:07:21.103 --> 00:07:23.730
In Rwanda, they are now getting

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.574
75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system

00:07:26.574 --> 00:07:29.936
from the contents of prisoners' bowels.

00:07:29.936 --> 00:07:33.722
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.

00:07:33.722 --> 00:07:35.874
They're genocidal inmates, most of them,

00:07:35.874 --> 00:07:39.522
and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines,

00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:42.833
because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank,

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:44.589
pretty much like a stomach,

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.402
then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas,

00:07:47.402 --> 00:07:49.427
and you can cook with it.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.570
And you might think it's just good karma

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.042
to see these guys stirring shit,

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:56.342
but it's also good economic sense,

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.408
because they're saving a million dollars a year.

00:07:58.408 --> 00:08:00.414
They're cutting down on deforestation,

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:03.317
and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible,

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:08.059
infinite and free at the point of production.

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:11.407
It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.559
Here's a woman who's about to get a dose

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:15.312
of the brown stuff in those syringes,

00:08:15.312 --> 00:08:17.248
which is what you think it is,

00:08:17.248 --> 00:08:20.292
except not quite, because it's actually donated.

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:23.174
There is now a new career path called stool donor.

00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:24.994
It's like the new sperm donor.

00:08:24.994 --> 00:08:27.987
Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff,

00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:31.431
and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.

00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:32.943
She's been suffering for years.

00:08:32.943 --> 00:08:36.035
She gets a dose of healthy human feces,

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:40.516
and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.

00:08:40.516 --> 00:08:44.914
It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.

00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:46.936
Maybe it's the ick factor.

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:49.806
That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists

00:08:49.806 --> 00:08:52.783
in Canada who have now created a stool sample,

00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:55.567
a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:57.855
So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple,

00:08:57.855 --> 00:08:59.740
we give everyone a toilet.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.893
And this is where it gets really interesting,

00:09:01.893 --> 00:09:04.818
because it's not that simple, because we are not simple.

00:09:04.818 --> 00:09:08.911
So the really interesting, exciting work --

00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:11.847
this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that

00:09:11.847 --> 00:09:14.175
we need to understand human psychology.

00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:16.551
We need to understand software

00:09:16.551 --> 00:09:18.903
as well as just giving someone hardware.

00:09:18.903 --> 00:09:20.685
They've found in many developing countries that

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.407
governments have gone in and given out free latrines

00:09:23.407 --> 00:09:25.563
and gone back a few years later and found that they've

00:09:25.563 --> 00:09:29.686
got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms

00:09:29.686 --> 00:09:32.053
with their owners happily walking past them

00:09:32.053 --> 00:09:35.863
and going over to the open defecating ground.

00:09:35.863 --> 00:09:38.887
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.

00:09:38.887 --> 00:09:41.388
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it

00:09:41.388 --> 00:09:43.327
in the early 20th century.

00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:46.086
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:50.253
They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.

00:09:50.253 --> 00:09:51.608
In India now there's a campaign

00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:54.154
which persuades young brides

00:09:54.154 --> 00:09:57.252
not to marry into families that don't have a toilet.

00:09:57.252 --> 00:09:59.920
It's called "No Loo, No I Do."

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.267
(Laughter)

00:10:02.267 --> 00:10:04.242
And in case you think that poster's just propaganda,

00:10:04.242 --> 00:10:06.342
here's Priyanka, 23 years old.

00:10:06.342 --> 00:10:08.463
I met her last October in India,

00:10:08.463 --> 00:10:11.520
and she grew up in a conservative environment.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.616
She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India,

00:10:14.616 --> 00:10:18.782
and she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so,

00:10:18.782 --> 00:10:20.553
she moved into her in-law's house.

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.588
And she was horrified to get there and find

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:23.880
that they didn't have a toilet.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.247
She'd grown up with a latrine.

00:10:25.247 --> 00:10:27.201
It was no big deal, but it was a latrine.

00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:29.224
And the first night she was there, she was told

00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:30.431
that at 4 o'clock in the morning --

00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:33.270
her mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.090
and go and do it in the dark in the open.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.160
And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.034
She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.

00:10:41.034 --> 00:10:43.516
After three days, she did an unthinkable thing.

00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:45.256
She left.

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:46.841
And if you know anything about rural India,

00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:50.319
you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:51.376
But not just that.

00:10:51.376 --> 00:10:53.788
She got her toilet, and now she goes around

00:10:53.788 --> 00:10:55.386
all the other villages in India

00:10:55.386 --> 00:10:57.139
persuading other women to do the same thing.

00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:00.600
It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.775
and really exciting.

00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:04.864
Another version of this, another village in India

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:06.861
near where Priyanka lives

00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:10.736
is this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago,

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:12.187
it had no toilets whatsoever.

00:11:12.187 --> 00:11:14.481
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.

00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:18.823
Some visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks

00:11:18.823 --> 00:11:21.617
like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit

00:11:21.617 --> 00:11:23.834
and watching the flies go one to the other.

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:26.401
Somehow, people who'd been thinking

00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:27.930
that what they were doing was not disgusting at all

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.802
suddenly thought, "Oops."

00:11:29.802 --> 00:11:32.129
Not only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:35.257
That's what really made them change their behavior.

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:37.793
So this woman, this boy's mother

00:11:37.793 --> 00:11:40.278
installed this latrine in a few hours.

00:11:40.278 --> 00:11:42.661
Her entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind,

00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:44.229
but she installed the latrine in a few hours.

00:11:44.229 --> 00:11:47.902
It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.

00:11:47.902 --> 00:11:51.093
So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation,

00:11:51.093 --> 00:11:53.289
even though these are pretty exciting times

00:11:53.289 --> 00:11:55.867
because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

00:11:55.867 --> 00:11:57.929
reinventing the toilet, which is great,

00:11:57.929 --> 00:12:00.483
we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike,

00:12:00.483 --> 00:12:04.218
which is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.

00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:05.932
But there are things to worry about.

00:12:05.932 --> 00:12:08.690
It's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.036
It's about 50 or so years off track.

00:12:11.036 --> 00:12:12.372
We're not going to meet targets,

00:12:12.372 --> 00:12:15.657
providing people with sanitation at this rate.

00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:19.138
So when I get sad about sanitation,

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:22.457
I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago

00:12:22.457 --> 00:12:25.046
was a nation of people who used pit latrines

00:12:25.046 --> 00:12:27.178
and wiped with sticks,

00:12:27.178 --> 00:12:30.505
and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos,

00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:31.985
washlet toilets.

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:34.329
They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely,

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:37.074
hands-free cleaning experience,

00:12:37.074 --> 00:12:39.246
and they have various other features

00:12:39.246 --> 00:12:42.221
like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device

00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:44.562
which is known as the "marriage-saver."

00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:46.018
(Laughter)

00:12:46.018 --> 00:12:48.423
But most importantly, what they have done in Japan,

00:12:48.423 --> 00:12:49.923
which I find so inspirational,

00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:52.487
is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.

00:12:52.487 --> 00:12:53.988
They've made it conversational.

00:12:53.988 --> 00:12:57.390
People go out and upgrade their toilet.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:01.798
They talk about it. They've sanitized it.

00:13:01.798 --> 00:13:06.278
I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.

00:13:06.278 --> 00:13:08.548
All we really need to do

00:13:08.548 --> 00:13:10.390
is look at this issue

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.702
as the urgent, shameful issue that it is.

00:13:14.702 --> 00:13:17.475
And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.

00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:19.639
Our sewers are crumbling.

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:21.806
Things are going wrong here too.

00:13:21.806 --> 00:13:24.705
The solution to all of this is pretty easy.

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:26.426
I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon

00:13:26.426 --> 00:13:28.779
and just ask you to do one thing,

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:31.855
and that's to go out, protest,

00:13:31.855 --> 00:13:34.093
speak about the unspeakable,

00:13:34.093 --> 00:13:35.632
and talk shit.

00:13:35.632 --> 00:13:37.586
Thank you.

00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:42.910
(Applause)
