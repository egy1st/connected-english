WEBVTT

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.491
So let's start with some good news,

00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:05.840
and the good news has to do with what do we know

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.107
based on biomedical research

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:11.561
that actually has changed the outcomes

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:14.660
for many very serious diseases?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.907
Let's start with leukemia,

00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:19.435
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL,

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:21.873
the most common cancer of children.

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:23.835
When I was a student,

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:27.675
the mortality rate was about 95 percent.

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:30.808
Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:34.435
a mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent.

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:37.051
Six thousand children each year

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:41.240
who would have previously died of this disease are cured.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.031
If you want the really big numbers,

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:45.859
look at these numbers for heart disease.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.651
Heart disease used to be the biggest killer,

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:49.155
particularly for men in their 40s.

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:52.649
Today, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.710
from heart disease --

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.595
remarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year.

00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:02.316
AIDS, incredibly, has just been named,

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:04.597
in the past month, a chronic disease,

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:07.512
meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:11.583
is expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years,

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:13.853
as we said only a decade ago,

00:01:13.853 --> 00:01:16.245
but is thought to live decades,

00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:20.741
probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether.

00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:23.766
These are just remarkable, remarkable changes

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.355
in the outlook for some of the biggest killers.

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:28.434
And one in particular

00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:30.479
that you probably wouldn't know about, stroke,

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.080
which has been, along with heart disease,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.258
one of the biggest killers in this country,

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:36.049
is a disease in which now we know

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.978
that if you can get people into the emergency room

00:01:38.978 --> 00:01:41.152
within three hours of the onset,

00:01:41.152 --> 00:01:43.757
some 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital

00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:46.876
without any disability whatsoever.

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:49.133
Remarkable stories,

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.164
good-news stories,

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:54.229
all of which boil down to understanding

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.581
something about the diseases that has allowed us

00:01:57.581 --> 00:02:00.904
to detect early and intervene early.

00:02:00.904 --> 00:02:03.039
Early detection, early intervention,

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.109
that's the story for these successes.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.845
Unfortunately, the news is not all good.

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:11.194
Let's talk about one other story

00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:12.885
which has to do with suicide.

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:15.537
Now this is, of course, not a disease, per se.

00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:18.625
It's a condition, or it's a situation

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:20.414
that leads to mortality.

00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:23.494
What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is.

00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:27.703
There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States.

00:02:27.703 --> 00:02:30.461
That means one about every 15 minutes.

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:33.237
Third most common cause of death amongst people

00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:36.013
between the ages of 15 and 25.

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:38.261
It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize

00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:40.773
that this is twice as common as homicide

00:02:40.773 --> 00:02:43.422
and actually more common as a source of death

00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:46.757
than traffic fatalities in this country.

00:02:46.757 --> 00:02:49.389
Now, when we talk about suicide,

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.501
there is also a medical contribution here,

00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:54.933
because 90 percent of suicides

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:56.703
are related to a mental illness:

00:02:56.703 --> 00:02:59.749
depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.807
anorexia, borderline personality. There's a long list

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:04.917
of disorders that contribute,

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:08.941
and as I mentioned before, often early in life.

00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:12.145
But it's not just the mortality from these disorders.

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:13.787
It's also morbidity.

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:16.048
If you look at disability,

00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:18.200
as measured by the World Health Organization

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.725
with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years,

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:23.821
it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of

00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:25.135
except an economist,

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:28.577
except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost

00:03:28.577 --> 00:03:31.760
in terms of disability from medical causes,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.653
and as you can see, virtually 30 percent

00:03:34.653 --> 00:03:36.917
of all disability from all medical causes

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:39.477
can be attributed to mental disorders,

00:03:39.477 --> 00:03:41.861
neuropsychiatric syndromes.

00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:44.013
You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense.

00:03:44.013 --> 00:03:46.685
I mean, cancer seems far more serious.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.717
Heart disease seems far more serious.

00:03:49.717 --> 00:03:52.757
But you can see actually they are further down this list,

00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:55.037
and that's because we're talking here about disability.

00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:57.829
What drives the disability for these disorders

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.733
like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression?

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:04.708
Why are they number one here?

00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:06.217
Well, there are probably three reasons.

00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:08.189
One is that they're highly prevalent.

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.484
About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:14.061
in the course of their lifetime.

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:16.381
A second, of course, is that, for some people,

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.965
these become truly disabling,

00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:21.093
and it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:25.357
But what really drives these numbers, this high morbidity,

00:04:25.357 --> 00:04:27.786
and to some extent the high mortality,

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:31.734
is the fact that these start very early in life.

00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:34.829
Fifty percent will have onset by age 14,

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:37.949
75 percent by age 24,

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.414
a picture that is very different than what one would see

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.685
if you're talking about cancer or heart disease,

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:47.085
diabetes, hypertension -- most of the major illnesses

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:51.181
that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality.

00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:57.491
These are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people.

00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:00.358
Now, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories.

00:05:00.358 --> 00:05:01.806
This is obviously not one of them.

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:04.685
This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult,

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:07.269
and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me.

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:12.621
My job is to actually make sure that we make progress

00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:14.973
on all of these disorders.

00:05:14.973 --> 00:05:16.683
I work for the federal government.

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.701
Actually, I work for you. You pay my salary.

00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:21.085
And maybe at this point, when you know what I do,

00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:23.205
or maybe what I've failed to do,

00:05:23.205 --> 00:05:25.414
you'll think that I probably ought to be fired,

00:05:25.414 --> 00:05:27.569
and I could certainly understand that.

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.901
But what I want to suggest, and the reason I'm here

00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:33.156
is to tell you that I think we're about to be

00:05:33.156 --> 00:05:37.819
in a very different world as we think about these illnesses.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.925
What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders,

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:42.641
diseases of the mind.

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.037
That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days,

00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:48.237
and people feel that, for whatever reason,

00:05:48.237 --> 00:05:51.614
it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders

00:05:51.614 --> 00:05:55.525
and to talk about these as disorders of behavior.

00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:57.792
Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior,

00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.792
and they are disorders of the mind.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:02.197
But what I want to suggest to you

00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:03.949
is that both of those terms,

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.967
which have been in play for a century or more,

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:09.787
are actually now impediments to progress,

00:06:09.787 --> 00:06:14.117
that what we need conceptually to make progress here

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:19.325
is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders.

00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:21.187
Now, for some of you, you're going to say,

00:06:21.187 --> 00:06:23.406
"Oh my goodness, here we go again.

00:06:23.406 --> 00:06:26.034
We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance

00:06:26.034 --> 00:06:27.769
or we're going to hear about drugs

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:32.595
or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion

00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:35.535
that will take our subjective experience

00:06:35.535 --> 00:06:41.607
and turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of

00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:44.825
very flat, unidimensional understanding

00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:48.927
of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia.

00:06:48.927 --> 00:06:53.425
When we talk about the brain, it is anything but

00:06:53.425 --> 00:06:56.688
unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.

00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:59.647
It depends, of course, on what scale

00:06:59.647 --> 00:07:01.943
or what scope you want to think about,

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:08.223
but this is an organ of surreal complexity,

00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:11.694
and we are just beginning to understand

00:07:11.694 --> 00:07:13.867
how to even study it, whether you're thinking about

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:16.449
the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:18.594
or the 100 trillion synapses

00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:20.953
that make up all the connections.

00:07:20.953 --> 00:07:24.529
We have just begun to try to figure out

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:28.057
how do we take this very complex machine

00:07:28.057 --> 00:07:30.801
that does extraordinary kinds of information processing

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.518
and use our own minds to understand

00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:37.049
this very complex brain that supports our own minds.

00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:39.609
It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:43.439
that we simply don't have a brain

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:46.337
that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself.

00:07:46.337 --> 00:07:48.651
In a sense, it actually makes you feel that

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:51.489
when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition,

00:07:51.489 --> 00:07:52.812
something you can observe,

00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:55.817
that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic

00:07:55.817 --> 00:08:00.785
than trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ

00:08:00.785 --> 00:08:03.213
that we're beginning to try to understand.

00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:06.869
Now, already in the case of the brain disorders

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:08.597
that I've been talking to you about,

00:08:08.597 --> 00:08:10.870
depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.032
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:08:13.032 --> 00:08:15.974
while we don't have an in-depth understanding

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:19.700
of how they are abnormally processed

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.805
or what the brain is doing in these illnesses,

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:24.860
we have been able to already identify

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.436
some of the connectional differences, or some of the ways

00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:29.940
in which the circuitry is different

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.756
for people who have these disorders.

00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:33.514
We call this the human connectome,

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:35.895
and you can think about the connectome

00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:37.767
sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.871
You'll hear more about this in a few minutes.

00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:42.822
The important piece here is that as you begin to look

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:46.799
at people who have these disorders, the one in five of us

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:48.627
who struggle in some way,

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:50.915
you find that there's a lot of variation

00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:54.131
in the way that the brain is wired,

00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:56.733
but there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns

00:08:56.733 --> 00:09:00.547
are risk factors for developing one of these disorders.

00:09:00.547 --> 00:09:03.539
It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders

00:09:03.539 --> 00:09:06.307
like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease

00:09:06.307 --> 00:09:08.699
where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex.

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:11.959
Here we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours,

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:14.706
or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:15.953
and the way that the brain functions.

00:09:15.953 --> 00:09:19.123
You could, if you want, compare this to,

00:09:19.123 --> 00:09:22.172
on the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack,

00:09:22.172 --> 00:09:23.995
where you have dead tissue in the heart,

00:09:23.995 --> 00:09:27.592
versus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning

00:09:27.592 --> 00:09:29.843
because of the communication problems within it.

00:09:29.843 --> 00:09:31.812
Either one would kill you; in only one of them

00:09:31.812 --> 00:09:34.412
will you find a major lesion.

00:09:34.412 --> 00:09:37.244
As we think about this, probably it's better to actually go

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:40.467
a little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia,

00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:42.603
because I think that's a good case

00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:46.128
for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters.

00:09:46.128 --> 00:09:50.006
These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.178
at the National Institute of Mental Health

00:09:52.178 --> 00:09:55.894
in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia,

00:09:55.894 --> 00:09:57.364
and you can see already in the top

00:09:57.364 --> 00:09:59.901
there's areas that are red or orange, yellow,

00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:02.039
are places where there's less gray matter,

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:03.577
and as they followed them over five years,

00:10:03.577 --> 00:10:05.815
comparing them to age match controls,

00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:07.637
you can see that, particularly in areas like

00:10:07.637 --> 00:10:09.953
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

00:10:09.953 --> 00:10:14.283
or the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter.

00:10:14.283 --> 00:10:15.826
And it's important, if you try to model this,

00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:17.782
you can think about normal development

00:10:17.782 --> 00:10:21.035
as a loss of cortical mass, loss of cortical gray matter,

00:10:21.035 --> 00:10:24.699
and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark,

00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:26.268
and at some point, when you overshoot,

00:10:26.268 --> 00:10:29.259
you cross a threshold, and it's that threshold

00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:32.835
where we say, this is a person who has this disease,

00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:35.123
because they have the behavioral symptoms

00:10:35.123 --> 00:10:37.244
of hallucinations and delusions.

00:10:37.244 --> 00:10:38.721
That's something we can observe.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:44.363
But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold.

00:10:44.363 --> 00:10:47.359
They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier,

00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:50.499
that perhaps not at age 22 or 20,

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:53.267
but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:55.627
the trajectory for development is quite different

00:10:55.627 --> 00:10:59.142
at the level of the brain, not at the level of behavior.

00:10:59.142 --> 00:11:01.237
Why does this matter? Well first because,

00:11:01.237 --> 00:11:04.379
for brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change.

00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:07.289
We know that for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for Huntington's.

00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:09.723
There are changes in the brain a decade or more

00:11:09.723 --> 00:11:14.763
before you see the first signs of a behavioral change.

00:11:14.763 --> 00:11:17.707
The tools that we have now allow us to detect

00:11:17.707 --> 00:11:22.004
these brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge.

00:11:22.004 --> 00:11:25.403
But most important, go back to where we started.

00:11:25.403 --> 00:11:28.619
The good-news stories in medicine

00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:31.563
are early detection, early intervention.

00:11:31.563 --> 00:11:35.227
If we waited until the heart attack,

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:39.202
we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives

00:11:39.202 --> 00:11:41.611
every year in this country to heart disease.

00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:44.019
That is precisely what we do today

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:48.531
when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders,

00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:51.733
brain circuit disorders, has a behavioral disorder.

00:11:51.733 --> 00:11:54.957
We wait until the behavior becomes manifest.

00:11:54.957 --> 00:11:59.516
That's not early detection. That's not early intervention.

00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:01.321
Now to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this.

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:04.475
We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know

00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:07.024
what the tools will be,

00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:11.283
nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able

00:12:11.283 --> 00:12:15.488
to get there before the behavior emerges as different.

00:12:15.488 --> 00:12:18.425
But this tells us how we need to think about it,

00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:19.914
and where we need to go.

00:12:19.914 --> 00:12:21.116
Are we going to be there soon?

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:23.794
I think that this is something that will happen

00:12:23.794 --> 00:12:26.625
over the course of the next few years, but I'd like to finish

00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:29.160
with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.521
by somebody who's thought a lot about changes

00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:33.849
in concepts and changes in technology.

00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:36.113
"We always overestimate the change that will occur

00:12:36.113 --> 00:12:38.336
in the next two years and underestimate

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:42.212
the change that will occur in the next 10." -- Bill Gates.

00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:43.575
Thanks very much.

00:12:43.575 --> 00:12:46.258
