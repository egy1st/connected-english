00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:09.482
One year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:11.674
to go find a man I'd never met

00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:13.810
but who had changed my life.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.555
I didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming.

00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:19.056
I didn't have an exact address,

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:21.671
but I knew his name, Abed,

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:26.323
I knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara,

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:31.134
and I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city,

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:33.355
he broke my neck.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:37.619
And so, on an overcast morning in January, I headed north

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:42.325
off in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:45.197
The road dropped and I exited Jerusalem.

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:47.837
I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck,

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:50.163
heavy with four tons of floor tiles,

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:52.981
had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner

00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:56.119
of the minibus where I sat.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.773
I was then 19 years old.

00:00:58.773 --> 00:01:02.100
I'd grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.044
in eight months, and the night before the crash,

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:07.210
I delighted in my new body,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.351
playing basketball with friends

00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.457
into the wee hours of a May morning.

00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:14.152
I palmed the ball in my large right hand,

00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:18.497
and when that hand reached the rim, I felt invincible.

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:22.343
I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court.

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:24.891
I didn't see Abed coming.

00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:27.263
From my seat, I was looking up at a stone town

00:01:27.263 --> 00:01:30.249
on a hilltop, bright in the noontime sun,

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.725
when from behind there was a great bang,

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.642
as loud and violent as a bomb.

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:38.118
My head snapped back over my red seat.

00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:41.204
My eardrum blew. My shoes flew off.

00:01:41.204 --> 00:01:44.458
I flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones,

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:48.674
and when I landed, I was a quadriplegic.

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:51.095
Over the coming months, I learned to breathe on my own,

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.100
then to sit and to stand and to walk,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.568
but my body was now divided vertically.

00:01:56.568 --> 00:02:00.029
I was a hemiplegic, and back home in New York,

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:04.664
I used a wheelchair for four years, all through college.

00:02:04.664 --> 00:02:08.142
College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year.

00:02:08.142 --> 00:02:11.020
There I rose from my chair for good,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.979
I leaned on my cane, and I looked back,

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.960
finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.751
to photographs of the crash,

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:22.762
and when I saw this photograph,

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:27.569
I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.316
I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid,

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:33.632
and I mourned that it was lost,

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:36.018
mourned all I had not yet done,

00:02:36.018 --> 00:02:39.910
but was now impossible.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.274
It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave

00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:48.490
the morning after the crash,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.372
of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.327
Reading his words, I welled with anger.

00:02:55.327 --> 00:02:58.827
It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man,

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:01.650
and it came from magical thinking.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.773
On this xeroxed piece of paper,

00:03:03.773 --> 00:03:07.326
the crash had not yet happened.

00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:09.415
Abed could still turn his wheel left

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:12.799
so that I would see him whoosh by out my window

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.241
and I would remain whole.

00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:19.099
"Be careful, Abed, look out. Slow down."

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.412
But Abed did not slow,

00:03:21.412 --> 00:03:25.220
and on that xeroxed piece of paper, my neck again broke,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.223
and again, I was left without anger.

00:03:29.223 --> 00:03:31.623
I decided to find Abed,

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:33.363
and when I finally did,

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:36.916
he responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance,

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.091
it seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call.

00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:41.465
And maybe he had.

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:44.638
I didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record --

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:48.419
27 violations by the age of 25,

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.110
the last, his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day —

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.203
and I didn't mention my prior record --

00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:56.911
the quadriplegia and the catheters,

00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:59.432
the insecurity and the loss —

00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:02.124
and when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash,

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:04.484
I didn't say that I knew from the police report

00:04:04.484 --> 00:04:07.187
that he'd escaped serious injury.

00:04:07.187 --> 00:04:10.920
I said I wanted to meet.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.563
Abed said that I should call back in a few weeks,

00:04:13.563 --> 00:04:16.139
and when I did, and a recording told me

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.412
that his number was disconnected,

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:23.388
I let Abed and the crash go.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.618
Many years passed.

00:04:25.618 --> 00:04:29.887
I walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack

00:04:29.887 --> 00:04:32.557
on trips in six continents.

00:04:32.557 --> 00:04:35.996
I pitched overhand in a weekly softball game

00:04:35.996 --> 00:04:38.224
that I started in Central Park,

00:04:38.224 --> 00:04:41.137
and home in New York, I became a journalist and an author,

00:04:41.137 --> 00:04:45.223
typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger.

00:04:45.223 --> 00:04:47.730
A friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.622
mirrored my own, each centering on a life

00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:52.982
that had changed in an instant,

00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:55.803
owing, if not to a crash, then to an inheritance,

00:04:55.803 --> 00:04:58.436
a swing of the bat, a click of the shutter, an arrest.

00:04:58.436 --> 00:05:02.410
Each of us had a before and an after.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.513
I'd been working through my lot after all.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:09.686
Still, Abed was far from my mind, when last year,

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:12.476
I returned to Israel to write of the crash,

00:05:12.476 --> 00:05:15.108
and the book I then wrote, "Half-Life,"

00:05:15.108 --> 00:05:18.056
was nearly complete when I recognized

00:05:18.056 --> 00:05:20.493
that I still wanted to meet Abed,

00:05:20.493 --> 00:05:23.400
and finally I understood why:

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.729
to hear this man say two words: "I'm sorry."

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.647
People apologize for less.

00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:34.459
And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.676
somewhere in his same town,

00:05:36.676 --> 00:05:39.748
and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat,

00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:43.741
when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:47.123
But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck?

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:51.205
(Laughter)

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:53.351
I pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh,

00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:55.410
and bought a brick of Turkish delight:

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.599
pistachios glued in rosewater. Better.

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.012
Back on Highway 1, I envisioned what awaited.

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:07.194
Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me.

00:06:07.194 --> 00:06:11.391
Abed would say, "I'm sorry."

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.417
I then began to wonder, as I had many times before,

00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:15.655
how my life would have been different

00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:17.061
had this man not injured me,

00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.942
had my genes been fed a different helping of experience.

00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:23.155
Who was I?

00:06:23.155 --> 00:06:25.972
Was I who I had been before the crash,

00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:30.033
before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book?

00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:32.322
Was I what had been done to me?

00:06:32.322 --> 00:06:36.715
Were all of us the results of things done to us, done for us,

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:39.055
the infidelity of a parent or spouse,

00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:41.242
money inherited?

00:06:41.242 --> 00:06:45.380
Were we instead our bodies, their inborn endowments and deficits?

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.345
It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience,

00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:51.835
but how to tease out the one from the other?

00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:54.677
As Yeats put that same universal question,

00:06:54.677 --> 00:06:57.871
"O body swayed to music, o brightening glance,

00:06:57.871 --> 00:07:04.186
how can we know the dancer from the dance?"

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:06.445
I'd been driving for an hour

00:07:06.445 --> 00:07:10.172
when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance.

00:07:10.172 --> 00:07:13.981
The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue.

00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:16.539
The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.749
as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake,

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:21.389
that had propelled me as a teen

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.810
to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.400
But I also saw in my reflection

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.247
that, had Abed not injured me,

00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:33.234
I would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor

00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:36.757
and a husband and a father.

00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:39.235
I would be less mindful of time and of death,

00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:41.056
and, oh, I would not be disabled,

00:07:41.056 --> 00:07:44.564
would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:47.219
The frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:49.565
come from biting at all the many things

00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:52.346
a solitary hand cannot open.

00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:57.785
The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined.

00:07:57.785 --> 00:07:59.911
It was approaching 11 when I exited right

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:02.070
toward Afula, and passed a large quarry

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.523
and was soon in Kfar Kara.

00:08:04.523 --> 00:08:06.986
I felt a pang of nerves.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:10.789
But Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas,

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:13.019
and I pulled into a lot by a gas station

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:16.360
to listen and to calm.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.592
I'd been told that in an Arab town,

00:08:18.592 --> 00:08:20.797
one need only mention the name of a local

00:08:20.797 --> 00:08:23.077
and it will be recognized.

00:08:23.077 --> 00:08:25.087
And I was mentioning Abed and myself,

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:27.445
noting deliberately that I was here in peace,

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:29.581
to the people in this town,

00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:32.864
when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon.

00:08:32.864 --> 00:08:35.306
He listened to me.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.130
You know, it was most often when speaking to people

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.070
that I wondered where I ended and my disability began,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.948
for many people told me what they told no one else.

00:08:44.948 --> 00:08:47.254
Many cried.

00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:49.898
And one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same

00:08:49.898 --> 00:08:51.794
and I later asked her why,

00:08:51.794 --> 00:08:53.768
she told me that, best she could tell, her tears

00:08:53.768 --> 00:08:57.044
had had something to do with my being happy and strong,

00:08:57.044 --> 00:08:59.731
but vulnerable too.

00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:02.014
I listened to her words. I suppose they were true.

00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:04.276
I was me,

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:06.430
but I was now me despite a limp,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.592
and that, I suppose, was what now made me, me.

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.394
Anyway, Mohamed told me

00:09:12.394 --> 00:09:15.175
what perhaps he would not have told another stranger.

00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:19.286
He led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off.

00:09:19.286 --> 00:09:21.984
And as I sat contemplating what to say,

00:09:21.984 --> 00:09:25.418
a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe.

00:09:25.418 --> 00:09:27.798
I stepped from my car and said "Shalom,"

00:09:27.798 --> 00:09:29.835
and identified myself,

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.264
and she told me that her husband Abed

00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:34.116
would be home from work in four hours.

00:09:34.116 --> 00:09:36.632
Her Hebrew was not good, and she later confessed

00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:39.772
that she thought that I had come to install the Internet.

00:09:39.772 --> 00:09:43.496
(Laughter)

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:46.521
I drove off and returned at 4:30,

00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:47.797
thankful to the minaret up the road

00:09:47.797 --> 00:09:50.331
that helped me find my way back.

00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:52.428
And as I approached the front door,

00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:55.853
Abed saw me, my jeans and flannel and cane,

00:09:55.853 --> 00:10:00.639
and I saw Abed, an average-looking man of average size.

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:03.662
He wore black and white: slippers over socks,

00:10:03.662 --> 00:10:05.761
pilling sweatpants, a piebald sweater,

00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:09.073
a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead.

00:10:09.073 --> 00:10:11.570
He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.853
And so at once, we shook hands, and smiled,

00:10:15.853 --> 00:10:17.940
and I gave him my gift,

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.331
and he told me I was a guest in his home,

00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:22.744
and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch.

00:10:22.744 --> 00:10:25.505
It was then that Abed resumed at once

00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:27.361
the tale of woe he had begun over the phone

00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:30.325
16 years before.

00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:33.630
He'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.827
He had problems with his side and his legs too,

00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:38.369
and, oh, he'd lost his teeth in the crash.

00:10:38.369 --> 00:10:41.340
Did I wish to see him remove them?

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.870
Abed then rose and turned on the TV

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.728
so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room,

00:10:46.728 --> 00:10:48.967
and returned with polaroids of the crash

00:10:48.967 --> 00:10:51.577
and his old driver's license.

00:10:51.577 --> 00:10:55.384
"I was handsome," he said.

00:10:55.384 --> 00:10:57.562
We looked down at his laminated mug.

00:10:57.562 --> 00:11:00.318
Abed had been less handsome than substantial,

00:11:00.318 --> 00:11:04.110
with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.047
It was this youth who on May 16, 1990,

00:11:07.047 --> 00:11:09.196
had broken two necks including mine,

00:11:09.196 --> 00:11:13.144
and bruised one brain and taken one life.

00:11:13.144 --> 00:11:15.743
Twenty-one years later, he was now thinner than his wife,

00:11:15.743 --> 00:11:17.492
his skin slack on his face,

00:11:17.492 --> 00:11:20.223
and looking at Abed looking at his young self,

00:11:20.223 --> 00:11:22.606
I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self

00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:26.932
after the crash, and recognized his longing.

00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:31.049
"The crash changed both of our lives," I said.

00:11:31.049 --> 00:11:33.777
Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck,

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:36.365
and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver

00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:39.538
in the left lane who did not let him pass.

00:11:39.538 --> 00:11:42.260
I did not want to recap the crash with Abed.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.029
I'd hoped for something simpler:

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:48.834
to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:51.423
And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony

00:11:51.423 --> 00:11:53.469
the morning after the crash,

00:11:53.469 --> 00:11:55.854
Abed did not even mention the bus driver.

00:11:55.854 --> 00:11:59.218
No, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth.

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:02.226
I had come for remorse.

00:12:02.226 --> 00:12:04.382
And so I now went looking for remorse

00:12:04.382 --> 00:12:06.667
and threw truth under the bus.

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:09.793
"I understand," I said, "that the crash was not your fault,

00:12:09.793 --> 00:12:14.182
but does it make you sad that others suffered?"

00:12:14.182 --> 00:12:16.577
Abed spoke three quick words.

00:12:16.577 --> 00:12:20.369
"Yes, I suffered."

00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:23.305
Abed then told me why he'd suffered.

00:12:23.305 --> 00:12:26.444
He'd lived an unholy life before the crash,

00:12:26.444 --> 00:12:28.773
and so God had ordained the crash,

00:12:28.773 --> 00:12:32.596
but now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased.

00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:35.737
It was then that God intervened:

00:12:35.737 --> 00:12:38.511
news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before

00:12:38.511 --> 00:12:41.283
had killed three people up north.

00:12:41.283 --> 00:12:43.656
We looked up at the wreckage.

00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:46.677
"Strange," I said.

00:12:46.677 --> 00:12:49.462
"Strange," he agreed.

00:12:49.462 --> 00:12:52.157
I had the thought that there, on Route 804,

00:12:52.157 --> 00:12:54.287
there were perpetrators and victims,

00:12:54.287 --> 00:12:56.023
dyads bound by a crash.

00:12:56.023 --> 00:12:58.484
Some, as had Abed, would forget the date.

00:12:58.484 --> 00:13:01.694
Some, as had I, would remember.

00:13:01.694 --> 00:13:04.819
The report finished and Abed spoke.

00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:07.192
"It is a pity," he said, "that the police

00:13:07.192 --> 00:13:12.086
in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers."

00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:15.114
I was baffled.

00:13:15.114 --> 00:13:17.893
Abed had said something remarkable.

00:13:17.893 --> 00:13:21.359
Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash?

00:13:21.359 --> 00:13:23.261
Was it evidence of guilt, an assertion

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.644
that he should have been put away longer?

00:13:25.644 --> 00:13:29.256
He'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade.

00:13:29.256 --> 00:13:31.282
I forgot my discretion.

00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:34.726
"Um, Abed," I said,

00:13:34.726 --> 00:13:38.957
"I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash."

00:13:38.957 --> 00:13:42.918
"Well," he said, "I once went 60 in a 40."

00:13:42.918 --> 00:13:46.319
And so 27 violations --

00:13:46.319 --> 00:13:49.024
driving through a red light, driving at excessive speed,

00:13:49.024 --> 00:13:51.006
driving on the wrong side of a barrier,

00:13:51.006 --> 00:13:53.046
and finally, riding his brakes down that hill --

00:13:53.046 --> 00:13:55.504
reduced to one.

00:13:55.504 --> 00:13:58.991
And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality,

00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:02.106
the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable.

00:14:02.106 --> 00:14:06.023
The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim.

00:14:06.023 --> 00:14:12.727
It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:16.023
Abed and I sat with our coffee.

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:18.815
We'd spent 90 minutes together,

00:14:18.815 --> 00:14:21.177
and he was now known to me.

00:14:21.177 --> 00:14:23.545
He was not a particularly bad man

00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:25.878
or a particularly good man.

00:14:25.878 --> 00:14:28.036
He was a limited man

00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:31.066
who'd found it within himself to be kind to me.

00:14:31.066 --> 00:14:32.576
With a nod to Jewish custom,

00:14:32.576 --> 00:14:36.523
he told me that I should live to be 120 years old.

00:14:36.523 --> 00:14:38.344
But it was hard for me to relate to one who had

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:41.642
so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing,

00:14:41.642 --> 00:14:46.006
to one whose life was so unexamined that he said

00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:50.781
he thought two people had died in the crash.

00:14:53.012 --> 00:14:56.636
There was much I wished to say to Abed.

00:14:56.636 --> 00:15:00.341
I wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability,

00:15:00.341 --> 00:15:02.516
it would be okay,

00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:04.314
for people are wrong to marvel

00:15:04.314 --> 00:15:07.556
at those like me who smile as we limp.

00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:11.492
People don't know that they have lived through worse,

00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:15.154
that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck,

00:15:15.154 --> 00:15:17.505
that problems of the mind are greater still,

00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:21.681
more injurious, than a hundred broken necks.

00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:24.531
I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are

00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:26.032
most of all

00:15:26.032 --> 00:15:28.465
is not our minds and not our bodies

00:15:28.465 --> 00:15:30.273
and not what happens to us,

00:15:30.273 --> 00:15:33.135
but how we respond to what happens to us.

00:15:33.135 --> 00:15:35.713
"This," wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl,

00:15:35.713 --> 00:15:37.530
"is the last of the human freedoms:

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:42.430
to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.254
I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers

00:15:45.254 --> 00:15:49.125
and paralyzees must evolve, reconcile to reality,

00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:51.102
but we all must --

00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:55.988
the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:59.833
and the bankrupt and everyone.

00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:02.438
I wished to tell him that one does not have to say

00:16:02.438 --> 00:16:04.454
that a bad thing is good,

00:16:04.454 --> 00:16:07.002
that a crash is from God and so a crash is good,

00:16:07.002 --> 00:16:08.693
a broken neck is good.

00:16:08.693 --> 00:16:11.953
One can say that a bad thing sucks,

00:16:11.953 --> 00:16:16.075
but that this natural world still has many glories.

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:21.101
I wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear:

00:16:21.101 --> 00:16:24.328
We have to rise above bad fortune.

00:16:24.328 --> 00:16:27.354
We have to be in the good and enjoy the good,

00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:33.238
study and work and adventure and friendship -- oh, friendship --

00:16:33.238 --> 00:16:37.007
and community and love.

00:16:37.007 --> 00:16:39.766
But most of all, I wished to tell him

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:42.135
what Herman Melville wrote,

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:45.062
that "truly to enjoy bodily warmth,

00:16:45.062 --> 00:16:48.119
some small part of you must be cold,

00:16:48.119 --> 00:16:50.422
for there is no quality in this world

00:16:50.422 --> 00:16:53.714
that is not what it is merely by contrast."

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:56.155
Yes, contrast.

00:16:56.155 --> 00:16:58.494
If you are mindful of what you do not have,

00:16:58.494 --> 00:17:01.722
you may be truly mindful of what you do have,

00:17:01.722 --> 00:17:05.616
and if the gods are kind, you may truly enjoy what you have.

00:17:05.616 --> 00:17:08.045
That is the one singular gift you may receive

00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:11.016
if you suffer in any existential way.

00:17:11.016 --> 00:17:13.345
You know death, and so may wake each morning

00:17:13.345 --> 00:17:15.375
pulsing with ready life.

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:16.970
Some part of you is cold,

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.469
and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm,

00:17:20.469 --> 00:17:23.391
or even to be cold.

00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:25.415
When one morning, years after the crash,

00:17:25.415 --> 00:17:28.198
I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot

00:17:28.198 --> 00:17:31.661
felt the flash of cold, nerves at last awake,

00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:36.948
it was exhilarating, a gust of snow.

00:17:36.948 --> 00:17:40.184
But I didn't say these things to Abed.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:44.985
I told him only that he had killed one man, not two.

00:17:44.985 --> 00:17:49.459
I told him the name of that man.

00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:53.272
And then I said, "Goodbye."

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.189
Thank you.

00:17:55.189 --> 00:18:01.924
(Applause)

00:18:01.924 --> 00:18:04.660
Thanks a lot.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.660
(Applause)
