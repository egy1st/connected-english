00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:12.619
When I was 14 years old,

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:14.606
I had low self-esteem.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.219
I felt I was not talented at anything.

00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:22.303
One day, I bought a yo-yo.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.868
When I tried my first trick,
it looked like this:

00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:33.529
(Laughter)

00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:36.331
I couldn't even do the simplest trick,

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:38.672
but it was very natural for me,

00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:42.664
because I was not dextrous,
and hated all sports.

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.298
But after one week of practicing,

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:48.715
my throws became more like this:

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:55.735
A bit better.

00:00:56.834 --> 00:01:00.744
I thought, the yo-yo
is something for me to be good at.

00:01:00.768 --> 00:01:03.475
For the first time in my life,

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.324
I found my passion.

00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:09.825
I was spending all my time practicing.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:14.174
It took me hours and hours a day
to build my skills up to the next level.

00:01:15.348 --> 00:01:19.378
And then, four years later,
when I was 18 years old,

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:23.325
I was standing onstage
at the World YoYo Contest.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.499
And I won.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:26.049
I was so excited.

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:28.652
"Yes, I did it! I became a hero.

00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:31.020
I may get many sponsors, a lot of money,

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:33.830
tons of interviews,
and be on TV!" I thought.

00:01:33.854 --> 00:01:35.576
(Laughter)

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.820
But after coming back to Japan,

00:01:38.844 --> 00:01:41.848
totally nothing changed in my life.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:43.474
(Laughter)

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:46.843
I realized society
didn't value my passion.

00:01:48.168 --> 00:01:50.712
So I went back to my college

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.843
and became a typical Japanese worker
as a systems engineer.

00:01:55.244 --> 00:02:00.851
I felt my passion,
heart and soul, had left my body.

00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:03.878
I felt I was not alive anymore.

00:02:04.394 --> 00:02:08.296
So I started to consider what I should do,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.769
and I thought, I wanted to make
my performance better,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.350
and to show onstage
how spectacular the yo-yo could be

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:19.994
to change the public's image of the yo-yo.

00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.472
So I quit my company

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.089
and started a career
as a professional performer.

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:33.054
I started to learn classic ballet,
jazz dance, acrobatics and other things

00:02:33.078 --> 00:02:34.875
to make my performance better.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.672
As a result of these efforts,
and the help of many others,

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:39.846
it happened.

00:02:40.956 --> 00:02:44.766
I won the World YoYo Contest again
in the artistic performance division.

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:48.140
I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil.

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:52.583
Today, I am standing on the TED stage

00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:55.166
with the yo-yo in front of you.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.372
(Applause)

00:02:59.543 --> 00:03:02.809
What I learned from the yo-yo is,

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.888
if I make enough effort with huge passion,

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:08.928
there is no impossible.

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:12.968
Could you let me share my passion with you

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.623
through my performance?

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:19.390
(Applause)

00:03:45.997 --> 00:03:48.668
(Water sound)

00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:58.461
(Music)

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.371
(Music ends)

00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:44.322
(Applause)

00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:51.602
(Music)

00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:08.153
(Music ends)

00:09:08.177 --> 00:09:15.177
(Applause)

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.509
(Applause ends)

00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:40.533
(Music)

00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:10.738
(Applause)
