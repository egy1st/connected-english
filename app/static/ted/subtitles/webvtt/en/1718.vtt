00:00:00.743 --> 00:00:03.605
We always hear that texting is a scourge.

00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:08.445
The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.945
of any kind of serious literacy, or at least writing ability,

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.588
among young people in the United States

00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:16.889
and now the whole world today.

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:20.393
The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true,

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:22.896
and it's easy to think that it is true,

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:24.795
but in order to see it in another way,

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.464
in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing,

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:31.029
not just energetic, but a miraculous thing,

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.776
a kind of emergent complexity

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:35.237
that we're seeing happening right now,

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:37.543
we have to pull the camera back for a bit

00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:40.961
and look at what language really is,

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:43.034
in which case, one thing that we see

00:00:43.034 --> 00:00:47.658
is that texting is not writing at all.

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:49.480
What do I mean by that?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.036
Basically, if we think about language,

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:55.837
language has existed for perhaps 150,000 years,

00:00:55.837 --> 00:00:57.974
at least 80,000 years,

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:02.125
and what it arose as is speech. People talked.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:05.149
That's what we're probably genetically specified for.

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.340
That's how we use language most.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.822
Writing is something that came along much later,

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:12.878
and as we saw in the last talk,

00:01:12.878 --> 00:01:15.546
there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened,

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:17.862
but according to traditional estimates,

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:21.384
if humanity had existed for 24 hours,

00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:26.575
then writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m.

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:30.220
That's how much of a latterly thing writing is.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.608
So first there's speech, and then writing comes along

00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:35.370
as a kind of artifice.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.376
Now don't get me wrong, writing has certain advantages.

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:41.959
When you write, because it's a conscious process,

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.097
because you can look backwards,

00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:46.927
you can do things with language that are much less likely

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:49.391
if you're just talking.

00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:53.292
For example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's

00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:57.098
"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:"

00:01:57.098 --> 00:02:00.349
"The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours,

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.651
till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:05.424
into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.011
was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself."

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:12.330
That's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.566
Or at least, they shouldn't if they're interested

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:19.080
in reproducing. That --

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.799
(Laughter)

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.777
is not the way any human being speaks casually.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.362
Casual speech is something quite different.

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:29.218
Linguists have actually shown

00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:31.929
that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way,

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.607
we tend to speak in word packets of maybe

00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:36.417
seven to 10 words.

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:39.096
You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:42.089
yourself or a group of people talking.

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:43.544
That's what speech is like.

00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:47.849
Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.539
It's much less reflective -- very different from writing.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.475
So we naturally tend to think, because we see language

00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:56.917
written so often, that that's what language is,

00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:00.885
but actually what language is, is speech. They are two things.

00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:04.139
Now of course, as history has gone by,

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.930
it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.944
between speech and writing.

00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:14.767
So, for example, in a distant era now,

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:17.269
it was common when one gave a speech

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.386
to basically talk like writing.

00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:22.736
So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:25.269
in an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go,

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.802
"Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak

00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:31.073
in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech.

00:03:31.073 --> 00:03:34.932
It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one.

00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:38.894
It's basically talking like you write, and so, for example,

00:03:38.894 --> 00:03:40.889
we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.100
because of the movie.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.183
The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event.

00:03:46.183 --> 00:03:50.098
For two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:53.338
on a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:54.835
and barely did then.

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:57.216
The point of it was to listen to him

00:03:57.216 --> 00:03:58.772
speaking like writing.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:01.120
Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.553
It was perfectly natural.

00:04:02.553 --> 00:04:05.044
That's what people did then, speaking like writing.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.510
Well, if you can speak like writing,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.308
then logically it follows that you might want to also

00:04:11.308 --> 00:04:14.174
sometimes write like you speak.

00:04:14.174 --> 00:04:16.224
The problem was just that in the material,

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:19.679
mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:22.986
for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it.

00:04:22.986 --> 00:04:25.006
It's almost impossible to do that with your hand

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:28.441
except in shorthand, and then communication is limited.

00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:30.957
On a manual typewriter it was very difficult,

00:04:30.957 --> 00:04:33.244
and even when we had electric typewriters,

00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:35.403
or then computer keyboards, the fact is

00:04:35.403 --> 00:04:37.702
that even if you can type easily enough to keep up

00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:40.495
with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have

00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:42.840
somebody who can receive your message quickly.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.051
Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message,

00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:48.655
then you have the conditions that allow

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:52.166
that we can write like we speak.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:55.384
And that's where texting comes in.

00:04:55.384 --> 00:04:59.153
And so, texting is very loose in its structure.

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:03.450
No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.808
but then again, do you think about those things when you talk?

00:05:05.808 --> 00:05:09.481
No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?

00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:12.610
What texting is, despite the fact that it involves

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.436
the brute mechanics of something that we call writing,

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:18.734
is fingered speech. That's what texting is.

00:05:18.734 --> 00:05:22.199
Now we can write the way we talk.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.978
And it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless

00:05:24.978 --> 00:05:29.834
easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline.

00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:33.118
We see this general bagginess of the structure,

00:05:33.118 --> 00:05:36.467
the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to

00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:38.739
learning on the blackboard, and so we think

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:41.978
that something has gone wrong.

00:05:41.978 --> 00:05:44.941
It's a very natural sense.

00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:48.975
But the fact of the matter is that what is going on

00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:52.546
is a kind of emergent complexity.

00:05:52.546 --> 00:05:55.302
That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech.

00:05:55.302 --> 00:05:58.288
And in order to understand it, what we want to see

00:05:58.288 --> 00:06:03.033
is the way, in this new kind of language,

00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:06.609
there is new structure coming up.

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:12.332
And so, for example, there is in texting a convention,

00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:15.254
which is LOL.

00:06:15.254 --> 00:06:17.998
Now LOL, we generally think of

00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:20.462
as meaning "laughing out loud."

00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:22.755
And of course, theoretically, it does,

00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:25.184
and if you look at older texts, then people used it

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.704
to actually indicate laughing out loud.

00:06:27.704 --> 00:06:31.947
But if you text now, or if you are someone who

00:06:31.947 --> 00:06:35.244
is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become,

00:06:35.244 --> 00:06:36.934
you'll notice that LOL

00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:39.004
does not mean laughing out loud anymore.

00:06:39.004 --> 00:06:42.794
It's evolved into something that is much subtler.

00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:46.241
This is an actual text that was done

00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:50.173
by a non-male person of about 20 years old

00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:51.668
not too long ago.

00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:54.620
"I love the font you're using, btw."

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.382
Julie: "lol thanks gmail is being slow right now"

00:06:58.382 --> 00:07:00.124
Now if you think about it, that's not funny.

00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:03.024
No one's laughing. (Laughter)

00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:04.994
And yet, there it is, so you assume

00:07:04.994 --> 00:07:06.351
there's been some kind of hiccup.

00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:08.185
Then Susan says "lol, I know,"

00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:10.482
again more guffawing than we're used to

00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:13.712
when you're talking about these inconveniences.

00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:16.456
So Julie says, "I just sent you an email."

00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:18.007
Susan: "lol, I see it."

00:07:18.007 --> 00:07:21.625
Very funny people, if that's what LOL means.

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:23.753
This Julie says, "So what's up?"

00:07:23.753 --> 00:07:26.395
Susan: "lol, I have to write a 10 page paper."

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:28.709
She's not amused. Let's think about it.

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:31.390
LOL is being used in a very particular way.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.081
It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation.

00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:38.330
We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.169
Any spoken language that's used by real people has them.

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:43.945
If you happen to speak Japanese, think about

00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:47.303
that little word "ne" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences.

00:07:47.303 --> 00:07:49.648
If you listen to the way black youth today speak,

00:07:49.648 --> 00:07:51.434
think about the use of the word "yo."

00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:53.380
Whole dissertations could be written about it,

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.654
and probably are being written about it.

00:07:55.654 --> 00:07:59.448
A pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.

00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:03.497
It's a way of using the language between actual people.

00:08:03.497 --> 00:08:06.736
Another example is "slash."

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.504
Now, we can use slash in the way that we're used to,

00:08:09.504 --> 00:08:11.144
along the lines of, "We're going to have

00:08:11.144 --> 00:08:14.626
a party-slash-networking session."

00:08:14.626 --> 00:08:16.720
That's kind of like what we're at.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.259
Slash is used in a very different way

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:23.217
in texting among young people today.

00:08:23.217 --> 00:08:25.070
It's used to change the scene.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.019
So for example, this Sally person says,

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:29.824
"So I need to find people to chill with"

00:08:29.824 --> 00:08:31.343
and Jake says, "Haha" --

00:08:31.343 --> 00:08:34.231
you could write a dissertation about "Haha" too, but we don't have time for that —

00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:36.720
"Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?"

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.330
Sally: "For this summer program at NYU."

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.224
Jake: "Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players

00:08:42.224 --> 00:08:44.021
trying to shoot with one eye."

00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:45.296
The slash is interesting.

00:08:45.296 --> 00:08:48.452
I don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that,

00:08:48.452 --> 00:08:53.193
but you notice that he's changing the topic.

00:08:53.193 --> 00:08:55.011
Now that seems kind of mundane,

00:08:55.011 --> 00:08:56.453
but think about how in real life,

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:59.111
if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic,

00:08:59.111 --> 00:09:00.723
there are ways of doing it gracefully.

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:02.442
You don't just zip right into it.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:06.637
You'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance,

00:09:06.637 --> 00:09:10.747
or you'll say something like, "Hmm, makes you think --"

00:09:10.747 --> 00:09:13.107
when it really didn't, but what you're really --

00:09:13.107 --> 00:09:15.342
(Laughter) —

00:09:15.342 --> 00:09:18.050
what you're really trying to do is change the topic.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.977
You can't do that while you're texting,

00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:23.708
and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium.

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:25.960
All spoken languages have what a linguist calls

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.353
a new information marker -- or two, or three.

00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:33.647
Texting has developed one from this slash.

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:36.632
So we have a whole battery of new constructions

00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:39.219
that are developing, and yet it's easy to think,

00:09:39.219 --> 00:09:41.666
well, something is still wrong.

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:45.441
There's a lack of structure of some sort.

00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:47.347
It's not as sophisticated

00:09:47.347 --> 00:09:49.553
as the language of The Wall Street Journal.

00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:51.327
Well, the fact of the matter is,

00:09:51.327 --> 00:09:53.778
look at this person in 1956,

00:09:53.778 --> 00:09:56.060
and this is when texting doesn't exist,

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.895
"I Love Lucy" is still on the air.

00:09:57.895 --> 00:10:01.658
"Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table,

00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:02.995
cannot write grammatically -- "

00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:05.204
We've heard that sort of thing before,

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:09.195
not just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher.

00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:11.896
1917. This is the time when we all assume

00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:15.147
that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.565
because the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate,

00:10:17.565 --> 00:10:18.776
or something like that.

00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:21.720
So, "From every college in the country goes up the cry,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.353
'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'"

00:10:24.353 --> 00:10:26.761
And so on. You can go even further back than this.

00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.945
It's the President of Harvard. It's 1871.

00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:32.487
There's no electricity. People have three names.

00:10:32.487 --> 00:10:34.912
"Bad spelling,

00:10:34.912 --> 00:10:38.180
incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing."

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.329
And he's talking about people who are otherwise

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:42.220
well prepared for college studies.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.066
You can go even further back.

00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:47.919
1841, some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:51.096
because of what he has for a long time "noted with regret

00:10:51.096 --> 00:10:54.605
the almost entire neglect of the original" blah blah blah blah blah.

00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:59.893
Or you can go all the way back to 63 A.D. -- (Laughter) --

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:02.274
and there's this poor man who doesn't like the way

00:11:02.274 --> 00:11:03.495
people are speaking Latin.

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:06.651
As it happens, he was writing about what had become French.

00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:13.053
And so, there are always — (Laughter) (Applause) —

00:11:13.053 --> 00:11:15.224
there are always people worrying about these things

00:11:15.224 --> 00:11:18.497
and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning.

00:11:18.497 --> 00:11:23.144
And so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is

00:11:23.144 --> 00:11:26.724
that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing

00:11:26.724 --> 00:11:28.350
that young people are developing,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.110
which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills,

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.277
and that means that they're able to do two things.

00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:38.174
Increasing evidence is that being bilingual

00:11:38.174 --> 00:11:40.407
is cognitively beneficial.

00:11:40.407 --> 00:11:42.562
That's also true of being bidialectal.

00:11:42.562 --> 00:11:45.652
That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing.

00:11:45.652 --> 00:11:50.570
And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.872
that young people are using today, not consciously, of course,

00:11:53.872 --> 00:11:57.559
but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire.

00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:58.788
It's very simple.

00:11:58.788 --> 00:12:02.498
If somebody from 1973 looked at

00:12:02.498 --> 00:12:06.604
what was on a dormitory message board in 1993,

00:12:06.604 --> 00:12:08.437
the slang would have changed a little bit

00:12:08.437 --> 00:12:10.255
since the era of "Love Story,"

00:12:10.255 --> 00:12:13.568
but they would understand what was on that message board.

00:12:13.568 --> 00:12:16.292
Take that person from 1993 -- not that long ago,

00:12:16.292 --> 00:12:19.550
this is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- those people.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.919
Take those people and they read

00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:24.819
a very typical text written by a 20-year-old today.

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:27.710
Often they would have no idea what half of it meant

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.638
because a whole new language has developed

00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:33.932
among our young people doing something as mundane

00:12:33.932 --> 00:12:36.203
as what it looks like to us when they're batting around

00:12:36.203 --> 00:12:37.878
on their little devices.

00:12:37.878 --> 00:12:41.539
So in closing, if I could go into the future,

00:12:41.539 --> 00:12:45.914
if I could go into 2033,

00:12:45.914 --> 00:12:48.827
the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon

00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:52.720
had done a sequel to "The Wire." I would want to know.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.703
And — I really would ask that —

00:12:55.703 --> 00:12:58.793
and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey."

00:12:58.793 --> 00:13:00.302
That'd be the second thing.

00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:02.838
And then the third thing would be,

00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:06.029
please show me a sheaf of texts

00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:07.986
written by 16-year-old girls,

00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:10.440
because I would want to know where this language

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.395
had developed since our times,

00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:16.028
and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:18.548
so we could examine this linguistic miracle

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.898
happening right under our noses.

00:13:20.898 --> 00:13:22.414
Thank you very much.

00:13:22.414 --> 00:13:27.582
(Applause)

00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:31.189
Thank you. (Applause)
