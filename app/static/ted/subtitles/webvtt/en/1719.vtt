00:00:00.713 --> 00:00:03.422
That's how we traveled in the year 1900.

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:05.791
That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating.

00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:07.420
It doesn't have air conditioning.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.477
That horse is pulling it along

00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:11.775
at one percent of the speed of sound,

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:13.527
and the rutted dirt road

00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:17.909
turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains.

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.654
That's a Boeing 707.

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.955
Only 60 years later, it travels

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.172
at 80 percent of the speed of sound,

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:27.805
and we don't travel any faster today

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:30.944
because commercial supersonic air travel

00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:32.913
turned out to be a bust.

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:35.465
So I started wondering and pondering,

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:38.487
could it be that the best years of American economic growth

00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:40.146
are behind us?

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:44.625
And that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.852
is almost over.

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:50.614
Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial.

00:00:50.614 --> 00:00:52.988
There are four headwinds that are just hitting

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:55.373
the American economy in the face.

00:00:55.373 --> 00:01:00.031
They're demographics, education, debt and inequality.

00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.664
They're powerful enough to cut growth in half.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:08.322
So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:11.090
And here's my theme: Because of the headwinds,

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.771
if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been

00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:17.638
in the last 150 years, growth is cut in half.

00:01:17.638 --> 00:01:20.349
If innovation is less powerful,

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:22.803
invents less great, wonderful things,

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:26.813
then growth is going to be even lower than half of history.

00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:29.968
Now here's eight centuries of economic growth.

00:01:29.968 --> 00:01:33.632
The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth,

00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:36.755
zero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year.

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:39.655
The white line is for the U.K., and then the U.S.

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:42.186
takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900,

00:01:42.186 --> 00:01:43.677
when the line switches to red.

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:45.663
You'll notice that, for the first four centuries,

00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:49.533
there's hardly any growth at all, just 0.2 percent.

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.152
Then growth gets better and better.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:54.130
It maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.887
and then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note.

00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:00.383
That last downward notch in the red line

00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:02.614
is not actual data.

00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:05.754
That is a forecast that I made six years ago

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:08.383
that growth would slow down to 1.3 percent.

00:02:08.383 --> 00:02:10.393
But you know what the actual facts are?

00:02:10.393 --> 00:02:12.206
You know what the growth in per-person income has been

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:15.098
in the United States in the last six years?

00:02:15.098 --> 00:02:17.438
Negative.

00:02:17.438 --> 00:02:19.709
This led to a fantasy.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.955
What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:28.923
I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted,

00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:31.717
but I decided I would end it at 0.2,

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:36.542
just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries.

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:39.906
Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:43.967
at 2.0 percent per year over the whole period,

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:47.155
1891 to 2007,

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:50.779
and remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007.

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.084
But if growth slows down,

00:02:53.084 --> 00:02:57.067
instead of doubling our standard of living every generation,

00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:01.905
Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents,

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:04.875
or even a quarter [more well off than] their parents.

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:09.240
Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.604
The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices.

00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:15.180
You'll notice that in 1891, over on the left,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.910
we were at about 5,000 dollars.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.815
Today we're at about 44,000 dollars of total output

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:22.482
per member of the population.

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:24.900
Now what if we could achieve that historic

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.883
two-percent growth for the next 70 years?

00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:29.215
Well, it's a matter of arithmetic.

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:33.355
Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years.

00:03:33.355 --> 00:03:37.056
That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000.

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:39.507
Well, we're not going to do that,

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:41.333
and the reason is the headwinds.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:42.974
The first headwind is demographics.

00:03:42.974 --> 00:03:45.312
It's a truism that your standard of living

00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:48.824
rises faster than productivity, rises faster than output per hour,

00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:51.434
if hours per person increased.

00:03:51.434 --> 00:03:53.936
And we got that gift back in the '70s and '80s

00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:56.454
when women entered the labor force.

00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:58.691
But now it's turned around.

00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.891
Now hours per person are shrinking,

00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:03.765
first because of the retirement of the baby boomers,

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:07.919
and second because there's been a very significant

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.916
dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:15.854
who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution.

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:18.015
The next headwind is education.

00:04:18.015 --> 00:04:20.660
We've got problems all over our educational system

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.181
despite Race to the Top.

00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:26.263
In college, we've got cost inflation in higher education

00:04:26.263 --> 00:04:29.175
that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care.

00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:33.431
We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt,

00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:36.418
and our college completion rate

00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:43.369
is 15 points, 15 percentage points below Canada.

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:45.476
We have a lot of debt.

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:50.458
Our economy grew from 2000 to 2007

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:53.690
on the back of consumers massively overborrowing.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.626
Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons

00:04:56.626 --> 00:04:59.362
why our economic recovery is so sluggish today.

00:04:59.362 --> 00:05:00.948
And everybody of course knows

00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:03.077
that the federal government debt is growing

00:05:03.077 --> 00:05:06.406
as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate,

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.568
and the only way that's going to stop is some combination

00:05:09.568 --> 00:05:14.645
of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements,

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:16.730
also called transfer payments.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.899
And that gets us down from the 1.5,

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:22.300
where we've reached for education, down to 1.3.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.718
And then we have inequality.

00:05:24.718 --> 00:05:27.471
Over the 15 years before the financial crisis,

00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:30.737
the growth rate of the bottom 99 percent

00:05:30.737 --> 00:05:33.860
of the income distribution was half a point slower

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.636
than the averages we've been talking about before.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:38.922
All the rest went to the top one percent.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.274
So that brings us down to 0.8.

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:44.649
And that 0.8 is the big challenge.

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:46.863
Are we going to grow at 0.8?

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:49.318
If so, that's going to require that our inventions

00:05:49.318 --> 00:05:51.665
are as important as the ones that happened

00:05:51.665 --> 00:05:54.583
over the last 150 years.

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:58.622
So let's see what some of those inventions were.

00:05:58.622 --> 00:06:02.124
If you wanted to read in 1875 at night,

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:05.446
you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp.

00:06:05.446 --> 00:06:07.603
They created pollution, they created odors,

00:06:07.603 --> 00:06:10.008
they were hard to control, the light was dim,

00:06:10.008 --> 00:06:12.156
and they were a fire hazard.

00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:17.251
By 1929, electric light was everywhere.

00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:21.400
We had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.385
Central Manhattan became possible.

00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:27.632
And then, in addition to that, at the same time,

00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:31.128
hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools

00:06:31.128 --> 00:06:33.836
and hand-powered electric tools,

00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:36.694
all achieved by electricity.

00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:40.907
Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women.

00:06:40.907 --> 00:06:43.595
Women, back in the late 19th century,

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:46.251
spent two days a week doing the laundry.

00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.966
They did it on a scrub board.

00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:50.034
Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry.

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:51.566
Then they had to bring them in.

00:06:51.566 --> 00:06:54.519
The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week.

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:58.106
And then we had the electric washing machine.

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:01.180
And by 1950, they were everywhere.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.208
But the women still had to shop every day,

00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:06.500
but no they didn't, because electricity

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.401
brought us the electric refrigerator.

00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:12.593
Back in the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes

00:07:12.593 --> 00:07:17.122
was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating.

00:07:17.122 --> 00:07:19.438
The bedrooms were cold. They were unheated.

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:22.118
But by 1929, certainly by 1950,

00:07:22.118 --> 00:07:26.010
we had central heating everywhere.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.602
What about the internal combustion engine,

00:07:28.602 --> 00:07:30.942
which was invented in 1879?

00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:34.760
In America, before the motor vehicle,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.732
transportation depended entirely on the urban horse,

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:41.618
which dropped, without restraint,

00:07:41.618 --> 00:07:45.423
25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.347
together with a gallon of urine.

00:07:47.347 --> 00:07:50.560
That comes out at five to 10 tons daily

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.993
per square mile in cities.

00:07:52.993 --> 00:07:58.934
Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.

00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:01.332
That's the percentage of American agricultural land

00:08:01.332 --> 00:08:03.525
it took to feed the horses.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:07.487
Of course, when the motor vehicle was invented,

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.691
and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929,

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:13.786
that agricultural land could be used for human consumption

00:08:13.786 --> 00:08:15.320
or for export.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.960
And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.876
only 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households

00:08:23.876 --> 00:08:30.460
in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.271
Back before the turn of the century,

00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:34.672
women had another problem.

00:08:34.672 --> 00:08:39.267
All the water for cooking, cleaning and bathing

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:43.937
had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside.

00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:46.412
It's a historical fact that in 1885,

00:08:46.412 --> 00:08:48.726
the average North Carolina housewife

00:08:48.726 --> 00:08:54.096
walked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water.

00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:58.500
But by 1929, cities around the country

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.515
had put in underground water pipes.

00:09:01.515 --> 00:09:04.941
They had put in underground sewer pipes,

00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:10.123
and as a result, one of the great scourges of the late 19th century,

00:09:10.123 --> 00:09:14.369
waterborne diseases like cholera, began to disappear.

00:09:14.369 --> 00:09:17.971
And an amazing fact for techno-optimists

00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:20.543
is that in the first half of the 20th century,

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:23.255
the rate of improvement of life expectancy

00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:26.056
was three times faster than it was

00:09:26.056 --> 00:09:28.927
in the second half of the 19th century.

00:09:28.927 --> 00:09:34.013
So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves.

00:09:34.013 --> 00:09:36.195
And I'll just give you a few examples.

00:09:36.195 --> 00:09:39.463
We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound.

00:09:39.463 --> 00:09:43.071
Electrification, central heat, ownership of motor cars,

00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:45.434
they all went from zero to 100 percent.

00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:49.084
Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm.

00:09:49.084 --> 00:09:51.926
We went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent

00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:56.054
by the early postwar years.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.297
What about the electronic revolution?

00:09:58.297 --> 00:10:00.418
Here's an early computer.

00:10:00.418 --> 00:10:03.728
It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:08.281
By 1960 we had telephone bills, bank statements

00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.052
were being produced by computers.

00:10:10.052 --> 00:10:12.916
The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers

00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:15.831
were invented in the 1970s.

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:19.086
The 1980s brought us Bill Gates, DOS,

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:21.871
ATM machines to replace bank tellers,

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.764
bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector.

00:10:25.764 --> 00:10:27.631
Fast forward through the '90s,

00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:29.199
we had the dotcom revolution

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:32.323
and a temporary rise in productivity growth.

00:10:32.323 --> 00:10:34.775
But I'm now going to give you an experiment.

00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:37.863
You have to choose either option A or option B.

00:10:37.863 --> 00:10:40.378
(Laughter)

00:10:40.378 --> 00:10:43.719
Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago.

00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:46.629
So you get Google, you get Amazon,

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:49.716
you get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets.

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:51.545
Or you get everything invented to yesterday,

00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:53.621
including Facebook and your iPhone,

00:10:53.621 --> 00:10:55.980
but you have to give up, go out to the outhouse,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.844
and carry in the water.

00:10:58.844 --> 00:11:02.294
Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century,

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:03.817
maybe for a couple of days,

00:11:03.817 --> 00:11:05.943
in some cases for more than a week,

00:11:05.943 --> 00:11:09.483
electricity, running water, heating, gasoline for their cars,

00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:12.399
and a charge for their iPhones.

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:15.910
The problem we face is that all these great inventions,

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.914
we have to match them in the future,

00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:21.502
and my prediction that we're not going to match them

00:11:21.502 --> 00:11:24.697
brings us down from the original two-percent growth

00:11:24.697 --> 00:11:29.767
down to 0.2, the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning.

00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:32.774
So here we are back to the horse and buggy.

00:11:32.774 --> 00:11:35.095
I'd like to award an Oscar

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:38.748
to the inventors of the 20th century,

00:11:38.748 --> 00:11:41.489
the people from Alexander Graham Bell

00:11:41.489 --> 00:11:43.192
to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers,

00:11:43.192 --> 00:11:44.915
I'd like to call them all up here,

00:11:44.915 --> 00:11:46.785
and they're going to call back to you.

00:11:46.785 --> 00:11:50.448
Your challenge is, can you match what we achieved?

00:11:50.448 --> 00:11:51.982
Thank you.

00:11:51.982 --> 00:11:57.013
(Applause)
