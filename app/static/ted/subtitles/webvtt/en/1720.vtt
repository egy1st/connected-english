WEBVTT

00:00:00.605 --> 00:00:02.877
Growth is not dead.

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:04.263
(Applause)

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:08.226
Let's start the story 120 years ago,

00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:11.858
when American factories began to electrify their operations,

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:15.202
igniting the Second Industrial Revolution.

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:16.313
The amazing thing is

00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:19.090
that productivity did not increase in those factories

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.346
for 30 years. Thirty years.

00:00:22.346 --> 00:00:25.820
That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.042
You see, the first wave of managers

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:31.459
simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors,

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:34.469
but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.810
of electricity's flexibility.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.794
It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes,

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:43.521
and then productivity soared,

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:47.186
often doubling or even tripling in those factories.

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:51.909
Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology,

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.139
like the steam engine before it.

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:57.555
General purpose technologies drive most economic growth,

00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:01.009
because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations,

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.641
like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:08.251
Is there a general purpose technology of our era?

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.759
Sure. It's the computer.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.418
But technology alone is not enough.

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:16.184
Technology is not destiny.

00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:17.764
We shape our destiny,

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.280
and just as the earlier generations of managers

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.578
needed to redesign their factories,

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:24.807
we're going to need to reinvent our organizations

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:27.362
and even our whole economic system.

00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:30.964
We're not doing as well at that job as we should be.

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:32.194
As we'll see in a moment,

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:34.916
productivity is actually doing all right,

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:38.778
but it has become decoupled from jobs,

00:01:38.778 --> 00:01:43.197
and the income of the typical worker is stagnating.

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:45.716
These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:49.428
as the end of innovation,

00:01:49.428 --> 00:01:51.557
but they are actually the growing pains

00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:57.147
of what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age.

00:01:57.147 --> 00:01:59.029
Let's look at some data.

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:01.931
So here's GDP per person in America.

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.697
There's some bumps along the way, but the big story

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:07.412
is you could practically fit a ruler to it.

00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:10.688
This is a log scale, so what looks like steady growth

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:13.731
is actually an acceleration in real terms.

00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:15.891
And here's productivity.

00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:18.562
You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s,

00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:22.300
but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.991
when factories were learning how to electrify their operations.

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:29.120
After a lag, productivity accelerated again.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.691
So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself,

00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:34.259
but sometimes it rhymes."

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.395
Today, productivity is at an all-time high,

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:39.372
and despite the Great Recession,

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:43.624
it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s,

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:47.760
the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.434
It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:53.177
And that's just the United States.

00:02:53.177 --> 00:02:56.425
The global news is even better.

00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:58.785
Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:01.281
in the past decade than ever in history.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:06.332
If anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress,

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:08.244
because the new machine age

00:03:08.244 --> 00:03:09.908
is more about knowledge creation

00:03:09.908 --> 00:03:12.239
than just physical production.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.177
It's mind not matter, brain not brawn,

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:17.239
ideas not things.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.809
That creates a problem for standard metrics,

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:23.311
because we're getting more and more stuff for free,

00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.952
like Wikipedia, Google, Skype,

00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:29.015
and if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk.

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:32.318
Now getting stuff for free is a good thing, right?

00:03:32.318 --> 00:03:34.083
Sure, of course it is.

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:37.951
But that's not how economists measure GDP.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:43.543
Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics.

00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:45.655
According to the numbers, the music industry

00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:48.655
is half the size that it was 10 years ago,

00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:52.311
but I'm listening to more and better music than ever.

00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:54.503
You know, I bet you are too.

00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:57.226
In total, my research estimates

00:03:57.226 --> 00:04:01.980
that the GDP numbers miss over 300 billion dollars per year

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.326
in free goods and services on the Internet.

00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:07.115
Now let's look to the future.

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:09.378
There are some super smart people

00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:14.397
who are arguing that we've reached the end of growth,

00:04:14.397 --> 00:04:17.955
but to understand the future of growth,

00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:20.638
we need to make predictions

00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:23.928
about the underlying drivers of growth.

00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:27.734
I'm optimistic, because the new machine age

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:32.764
is digital, exponential and combinatorial.

00:04:32.764 --> 00:04:35.028
When goods are digital, they can be replicated

00:04:35.028 --> 00:04:39.537
with perfect quality at nearly zero cost,

00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:43.555
and they can be delivered almost instantaneously.

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:46.355
Welcome to the economics of abundance.

00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:50.045
But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world.

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:54.645
Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress.

00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:56.793
In the age of big data,

00:04:56.793 --> 00:05:01.079
we can measure the world in ways we never could before.

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:05.174
Secondly, the new machine age is exponential.

00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:11.109
Computers get better faster than anything else ever.

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:14.677
A child's Playstation today is more powerful

00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:18.733
than a military supercomputer from 1996.

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:21.940
But our brains are wired for a linear world.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.828
As a result, exponential trends take us by surprise.

00:05:25.828 --> 00:05:28.430
I used to teach my students that there are some things,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.364
you know, computers just aren't good at,

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:32.749
like driving a car through traffic.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.762
(Laughter)

00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:38.253
That's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmen

00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:40.637
because we just rode down Route 101

00:05:40.637 --> 00:05:44.306
in, yes, a driverless car.

00:05:44.306 --> 00:05:46.889
Thirdly, the new machine age is combinatorial.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.937
The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up,

00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:52.793
like low-hanging fruit,

00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:55.956
but the reality is that each innovation

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:59.212
creates building blocks for even more innovations.

00:05:59.212 --> 00:06:02.557
Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks,

00:06:02.557 --> 00:06:04.629
an undergraduate student of mine

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.740
built an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.439
He was able to do that so easily

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.266
because he built it on top of Facebook,

00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:14.199
and Facebook was built on top of the web,

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.897
and that was built on top of the Internet,

00:06:15.897 --> 00:06:18.315
and so on and so forth.

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:23.080
Now individually, digital, exponential and combinatorial

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.430
would each be game-changers.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.620
Put them together, and we're seeing a wave

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.013
of astonishing breakthroughs,

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:32.073
like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah

00:06:32.073 --> 00:06:34.869
or leap tall buildings in a single bound.

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:37.101
You know, robots are even revolutionizing

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:38.930
cat transportation.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.200
(Laughter)

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.932
But perhaps the most important invention,

00:06:43.932 --> 00:06:48.997
the most important invention is machine learning.

00:06:48.997 --> 00:06:52.373
Consider one project: IBM's Watson.

00:06:52.373 --> 00:06:53.962
These little dots here,

00:06:53.962 --> 00:06:58.822
those are all the champions on the quiz show "Jeopardy."

00:06:58.822 --> 00:07:01.366
At first, Watson wasn't very good,

00:07:01.366 --> 00:07:06.988
but it improved at a rate faster than any human could,

00:07:06.988 --> 00:07:09.675
and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart

00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:11.327
to my class at MIT,

00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:14.869
Watson beat the world "Jeopardy" champion.

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.858
At age seven, Watson is still kind of in its childhood.

00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:24.176
Recently, its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised.

00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:30.122
The next day, it started answering questions with profanities.

00:07:30.122 --> 00:07:32.396
Damn. (Laughter)

00:07:32.396 --> 00:07:34.676
But you know, Watson is growing up fast.

00:07:34.676 --> 00:07:38.888
It's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them.

00:07:38.888 --> 00:07:42.612
It's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs,

00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:44.562
and getting some of them.

00:07:44.562 --> 00:07:46.451
Isn't it ironic that at the very moment

00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:48.685
we are building intelligent machines,

00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:52.134
perhaps the most important invention in human history,

00:07:52.134 --> 00:07:56.109
some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating?

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.528
Like the first two industrial revolutions,

00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:01.662
the full implications of the new machine age

00:08:01.662 --> 00:08:04.344
are going to take at least a century to fully play out,

00:08:04.344 --> 00:08:07.376
but they are staggering.

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:10.712
So does that mean we have nothing to worry about?

00:08:10.712 --> 00:08:14.392
No. Technology is not destiny.

00:08:14.392 --> 00:08:16.961
Productivity is at an all time high,

00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:19.944
but fewer people now have jobs.

00:08:19.944 --> 00:08:23.064
We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever,

00:08:23.064 --> 00:08:26.968
but for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.

00:08:26.968 --> 00:08:29.280
This is the great decoupling

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.256
of productivity from employment,

00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:35.360
of wealth from work.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.706
You know, it's not surprising that millions of people

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:40.552
have become disillusioned by the great decoupling,

00:08:40.552 --> 00:08:42.299
but like too many others,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.396
they misunderstand its basic causes.

00:08:45.396 --> 00:08:48.006
Technology is racing ahead,

00:08:48.006 --> 00:08:51.556
but it's leaving more and more people behind.

00:08:51.556 --> 00:08:55.075
Today, we can take a routine job,

00:08:55.075 --> 00:08:58.166
codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions,

00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:00.993
and then replicate it a million times.

00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:03.272
You know, I recently overheard a conversation

00:09:03.272 --> 00:09:05.224
that epitomizes these new economics.

00:09:05.224 --> 00:09:09.421
This guy says, "Nah, I don't use H&amp;R Block anymore.

00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.869
TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did,

00:09:11.869 --> 00:09:16.427
but it's faster, cheaper and more accurate."

00:09:16.427 --> 00:09:18.226
How can a skilled worker

00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:21.235
compete with a $39 piece of software?

00:09:21.235 --> 00:09:23.202
She can't.

00:09:23.202 --> 00:09:25.982
Today, millions of Americans do have faster,

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.369
cheaper, more accurate tax preparation,

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:29.855
and the founders of Intuit

00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:32.348
have done very well for themselves.

00:09:32.348 --> 00:09:36.562
But 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs.

00:09:36.562 --> 00:09:38.640
That is a microcosm of what's happening,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.317
not just in software and services, but in media and music,

00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:47.003
in finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade --

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.898
in short, in every industry.

00:09:50.898 --> 00:09:53.993
People are racing against the machine,

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:57.083
and many of them are losing that race.

00:09:57.083 --> 00:10:00.969
What can we do to create shared prosperity?

00:10:00.969 --> 00:10:03.986
The answer is not to try to slow down technology.

00:10:03.986 --> 00:10:06.543
Instead of racing against the machine,

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:10.220
we need to learn to race with the machine.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.349
That is our grand challenge.

00:10:13.349 --> 00:10:15.673
The new machine age

00:10:15.673 --> 00:10:18.786
can be dated to a day 15 years ago

00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:21.664
when Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion,

00:10:21.664 --> 00:10:25.370
played Deep Blue, a supercomputer.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.382
The machine won that day,

00:10:27.382 --> 00:10:30.350
and today, a chess program running on a cell phone

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.646
can beat a human grandmaster.

00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:36.011
It got so bad that, when he was asked

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:38.574
what strategy he would use against a computer,

00:10:38.574 --> 00:10:42.590
Jan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied,

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.361
"I'd bring a hammer."

00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:48.041
(Laughter)

00:10:48.041 --> 00:10:52.585
But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.239
Neither is a human,

00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:58.818
because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament

00:10:58.818 --> 00:11:00.734
where teams of humans and computers

00:11:00.734 --> 00:11:02.833
could work together,

00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:05.990
and the winning team had no grandmaster,

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.455
and it had no supercomputer.

00:11:08.455 --> 00:11:12.630
What they had was better teamwork,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.646
and they showed that a team of humans and computers,

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:20.694
working together, could beat any computer

00:11:20.694 --> 00:11:24.214
or any human working alone.

00:11:24.214 --> 00:11:25.878
Racing with the machine

00:11:25.878 --> 00:11:28.221
beats racing against the machine.

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:30.785
Technology is not destiny.

00:11:30.785 --> 00:11:32.527
We shape our destiny.

00:11:32.527 --> 00:11:33.974
Thank you.

00:11:33.974 --> 00:11:38.990
(Applause)
