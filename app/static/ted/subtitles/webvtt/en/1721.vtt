00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:06.278
Liu Bolin: By making myself invisible,

00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:09.223
I try to question the inter-canceling relationship

00:00:09.223 --> 00:00:13.102
between our civilization and its development.

00:00:13.102 --> 00:00:15.278
Interpreter: By making myself invisible, I try to explore and question

00:00:15.278 --> 00:00:19.270
the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.622
between our civilization and its development.

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:29.828
LB: This is my first work, created in November 2005.

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:32.965
And this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:36.500
before the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.337
I also want to use this work to let more people

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:44.029
pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom.

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:46.717
In the meantime, from the beginning, this series has a

00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:51.341
protesting, reflective

00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.161
and uncompromising spirit.

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:57.809
When applying makeup, I borrow a sniper's method

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.165
to better protect myself

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:04.089
and to detect the enemy, as he did. (Laughter)

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.557
After finishing this series of protests,

00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:12.637
I started questioning why my fate was like this,

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:15.371
and I realized that it's not just me --

00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:19.199
all Chinese are as confused as I am.

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:21.925
As you can see, these works

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:28.290
are about family planning, election in accordance with the law

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.573
and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress.

00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:34.821
This work is called Xia Gang ("leaving post").

00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:38.246
"Xia Gang" is a Chinese euphemism for "laid off".

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:45.813
It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy.

00:01:45.813 --> 00:01:47.685
From 1998 to 2000,

00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:50.941
21.37 million people

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.718
lost their jobs in China.

00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:56.642
The six people in the photo

00:01:56.642 --> 00:01:58.565
are Xia Gang workers.

00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:03.423
I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.589
On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution:

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:09.750
"The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party."

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.413
For half a month

00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:13.725
I looked for these 6 people to participate in my work.

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:18.637
We can only see six men in this picture,but in fact, those who are hidden here

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:23.998
are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible.

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.142
This piece is called The Studio.

00:02:26.142 --> 00:02:27.397
This spring,

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.822
I happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris

00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:35.084
to shoot a work in the news studio of France 3 --

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:37.917
I picked the news photos of the day.

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:40.229
One is about the war in the Middle East,

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.317
and another one is about a public demonstration in France.

00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:49.061
I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions.

00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:52.042
This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.

00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:57.185
Interpreter: This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.

00:02:57.185 --> 00:03:01.038
(Applause)

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:04.029
LB: I tried to disappear into JR's eye,

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.079
but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes.

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.710
So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.144
But still they are not big enough for JR, unfortunately.

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:16.713
Interpreter: So I tried to disappear into JR's eye,

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:19.837
but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes.

00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:22.790
So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.601
But it doesn't work, my eyes are still small.

00:03:27.601 --> 00:03:30.768
LB: This one is about 9/11 memories.

00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:40.613
This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River.

00:03:40.613 --> 00:03:44.685
Kenny Scharf's graffiti.

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:48.717
(Laughter)

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:52.944
This is Venice, Italy.

00:03:52.944 --> 00:03:54.945
Because global temperatures rise,

00:03:54.945 --> 00:04:03.989
the sea level rises, and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades.

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.553
This is the ancient city of Pompeii.

00:04:06.568 --> 00:04:17.645
Interpreter: This is the ancient city of Pompeii.

00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:19.383
LB: This is the Borghese Gallery

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:22.784
in Rome.

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:27.069
When I work on a new piece, I pay more attention to the expression of ideas.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.805
For instance, why would I make myself invisible?

00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:37.381
What will making myself invisible here cause people to think?

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:53.941
This one is called Instant Noodles.

00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:57.645
Interpreter: This one is called Instant Noodles. (Laughter)

00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:02.533
LB: Since August 2012,

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:07.329
harmful phosphors have been found

00:05:07.344 --> 00:05:09.603
in the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets.

00:05:09.603 --> 00:05:12.155
These phosphors can even cause cancer.

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:14.012
To create this artwork,

00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:16.100
I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.002
and put them in my studio, making it look like a supermarket.

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.981
And my task is to stand there, trying to be still,

00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:26.437
setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant

00:05:26.437 --> 00:05:29.645
and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body

00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:33.790
on the front of my body. If the background is simple,

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.294
I usually have to stand for three to four hours.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.911
The background of this piece is more complex,

00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:43.489
so I need three to four days in advance for preparation.

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:46.629
This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot.

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.907
There is no Photoshop involved.

00:05:48.907 --> 00:05:54.134
Interpreter: This is the suit I [was] wearing when I did the supermarket shoot.

00:05:54.134 --> 00:06:00.141
There is no Photoshop involved. (Laughter)

00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:12.989
LB: These works are on China's cultural memories.

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:14.327
And this one,

00:06:14.327 --> 00:06:16.989
this is about food safety in China.

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:22.845
Unsafe food can harm people's health,

00:06:22.845 --> 00:06:26.853
and a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds. (Laughter)

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:29.589
The next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages,

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:34.374
in different countries and at different times.

00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:39.243
I think that in art, an artist's attitude is the most important element.

00:06:39.243 --> 00:06:43.365
If an artwork is to touch someone,

00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:47.029
it must be the result of not only technique, but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life.

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:51.405
And the repeated struggles in life create artwork,

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:57.029
no matter in what form.

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:18.509
(Music)

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:19.757
That's all I want to say.

00:07:19.757 --> 00:07:23.757
Thank you. (Applause)
