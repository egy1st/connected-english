00:00:00.731 --> 00:00:03.171
Miranda Wang: We're here
to talk about accidents.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:05.603
How do you feel about accidents?

00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:07.197
When we think about accidents,

00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.388
we usually consider them to be harmful,

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:13.715
unfortunate or even dangerous,
and they certainly can be.

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.004
But are they always that bad?

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.648
The discovery that had led
to penicillin, for example,

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:22.085
is one of the most fortunate
accidents of all time.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.772
Without biologist Alexander
Fleming's moldy accident,

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:27.900
caused by a neglected workstation,

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:32.252
we wouldn't be able to fight
off so many bacterial infections.

00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:34.181
Jeanny Yao: Miranda and I are here today

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:36.421
because we'd like to share
how our accidents

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:38.581
have led to discoveries.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.109
In 2011, we visited the Vancouver
Waste Transfer Station

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:45.618
and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste.

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:47.983
We realized that when
plastics get to the dump,

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.339
it's difficult to sort them
because they have similar densities,

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:53.363
and when they're mixed with organic matter

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.711
and construction debris,
it's truly impossible

00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:58.765
to pick them out and environmentally
eliminate them.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.205
MW: However, plastics are useful

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.317
because they're durable, flexible,

00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:06.589
and can be easily molded
into so many useful shapes.

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:08.645
The downside of this convenience

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:11.054
is that there's a high cost to this.

00:01:11.078 --> 00:01:13.294
Plastics cause serious problems, such as

00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:15.485
the destruction of ecosystems,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.176
the pollution of natural resources,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.921
and the reduction of available land space.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.565
This picture you see here
is the Great Pacific Gyre.

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:24.870
When you think about plastic pollution

00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:26.190
and the marine environment,

00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:28.024
we think about the Great Pacific Gyre,

00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:31.213
which is supposed to be a floating
island of plastic waste.

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:33.456
But that's no longer an accurate depiction

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.437
of plastic pollution
in the marine environment.

00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:40.148
Right now, the ocean is actually
a soup of plastic debris,

00:01:40.172 --> 00:01:42.421
and there's nowhere you
can go in the ocean

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:45.912
where you wouldn't be able
to find plastic particles.

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:48.081
JY: In a plastic-dependent society,

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:51.060
cutting down production is a good
goal, but it's not enough.

00:01:51.084 --> 00:01:54.301
And what about the waste
that's already been produced?

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:58.029
Plastics take hundreds to thousands
of years to biodegrade.

00:01:58.053 --> 00:01:59.642
So we thought, you know what?

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:03.048
Instead of waiting for that garbage
to sit there and pile up,

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:05.464
let's find a way to break them down

00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:07.522
with bacteria.

00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:09.156
Sounds cool, right?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.947
Audience: Yeah. JY: Thank you.

00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:12.269
But we had a problem.

00:02:12.293 --> 00:02:15.973
You see, plastics have
very complex structures

00:02:15.997 --> 00:02:18.117
and are difficult to biodegrade.

00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:20.298
Anyhow, we were curious and hopeful

00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:21.918
and still wanted to give it a go.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:24.104
MW: With this idea in mind,
Jeanny and I read through

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:26.693
some hundreds of scientific
articles on the Internet,

00:02:26.717 --> 00:02:28.965
and we drafted a research proposal

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.213
in the beginning of our grade 12 year.

00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:34.471
We aimed to find bacteria
from our local Fraser River

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:38.062
that can degrade a harmful
plasticizer called phthalates.

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:40.848
Phthalates are additives used
in everyday plastic products

00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:45.281
to increase their flexibility,
durability and transparency.

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:47.213
Although they're part of the plastic,

00:02:47.237 --> 00:02:49.865
they're not covalently bonded
to the plastic backbone.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.845
As a result, they easily
escape into our environment.

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.479
Not only do phthalates
pollute our environment,

00:02:55.503 --> 00:02:57.412
but they also pollute our bodies.

00:02:57.436 --> 00:03:00.418
To make the matter worse,
phthalates are found in products

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:04.194
to which we have a high
exposure, such as babies' toys,

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:08.684
beverage containers, cosmetics,
and even food wraps.

00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:10.540
Phthalates are horrible because

00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:12.665
they're so easily taken into our bodies.

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.003
They can be absorbed by skin
contact, ingested, and inhaled.

00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:20.915
JY: Every year, at least 470
million pounds of phthalates

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.304
contaminate our air, water and soil.

00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:25.995
The Environmental Protection Agency

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.956
even classified this group
as a top-priority pollutant

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.012
because it's been shown to cause
cancer and birth defects

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:34.408
by acting as a hormone disruptor.

00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:37.194
We read that each year,
the Vancouver municipal government

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:39.606
monitors phthalate
concentration levels in rivers

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.356
to assess their safety.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.666
So we figured, if there
are places along our Fraser River

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.749
that are contaminated with phthalates,

00:03:46.773 --> 00:03:49.963
and if there are bacteria
that are able to live in these areas,

00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:53.869
then perhaps, perhaps these
bacteria could have evolved

00:03:53.893 --> 00:03:55.965
to break down phthalates.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.037
MW: So we presented this good idea

00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:01.028
to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University
of British Columbia,

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:04.248
and surprisingly, he actually
took us into his lab

00:04:04.272 --> 00:04:08.513
and asked his graduate students
Adam and James to help us.

00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:10.222
Little did we know at that time

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:13.807
that a trip to the dump
and some research on the Internet

00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:16.300
and plucking up the courage
to act upon inspiration

00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:18.692
would take us on a life-changing journey

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:21.100
of accidents and discoveries.

00:04:21.124 --> 00:04:23.162
JY: The first step in our project

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:25.758
was to collect soil samples
from three different sites

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:27.230
along the Fraser River.

00:04:27.254 --> 00:04:30.103
Out of thousands of bacteria,
we wanted to find ones

00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:31.425
that could break down phthalates,

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.584
so we enriched our cultures
with phthalates

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:35.232
as the only carbon source.

00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:37.733
This implied that, if anything
grew in our cultures,

00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:40.186
then they must be able
to live off of phthalates.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.076
Everything went well from there,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.229
and we became amazing scientists.
(Laughter)

00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:48.097
MW: Um... uh, Jeanny. JY: I'm just joking.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.792
MW: Okay. Well, it was partially my fault.

00:04:50.816 --> 00:04:53.962
You see, I accidentally cracked the flask

00:04:53.986 --> 00:04:55.743
that had contained our third
enrichment culture,

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:58.588
and as a result, we had to wipe
down the incubator room

00:04:58.612 --> 00:05:00.292
with bleach and ethanol twice.

00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:03.078
And this is only one of the examples
of the many accidents

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:05.303
that happened during our experimentation.

00:05:05.327 --> 00:05:08.803
But this mistake turned
out to be rather serendipitous.

00:05:08.827 --> 00:05:11.019
We noticed that the unharmed cultures

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:14.219
came from places
of opposite contamination levels,

00:05:14.243 --> 00:05:16.751
so this mistake actually
led us to think that

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.411
perhaps we can compare

00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:21.163
the different degradative
potentials of bacteria

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:25.134
from sites
of opposite contamination levels.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.060
JY: Now that we grew the bacteria,

00:05:27.084 --> 00:05:30.396
we wanted to isolate strains
by streaking onto mediate plates,

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.252
because we thought that would be

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:35.740
less accident-prone,
but we were wrong again.

00:05:35.764 --> 00:05:39.573
We poked holes in our agar while streaking

00:05:39.597 --> 00:05:41.842
and contaminated some samples and funghi.

00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:44.581
As a result, we had to streak
and restreak several times.

00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:47.249
Then we monitored phthalate utilization

00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:49.071
and bacterial growth,

00:05:49.095 --> 00:05:51.711
and found that they shared
an inverse correlation,

00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:54.298
so as bacterial populations increased,

00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:56.136
phthalate concentrations decreased.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.168
This means that our bacteria were
actually living off of phthalates.

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:03.383
MW: So now that we found bacteria
that could break down phthalates,

00:06:03.407 --> 00:06:05.675
we wondered what these bacteria were.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.366
So Jeanny and I took
three of our most efficient strains

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.123
and then performed gene
amplification sequencing on them

00:06:11.147 --> 00:06:14.251
and matched our data with an online
comprehensive database.

00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:15.924
We were happy to see that,

00:06:15.948 --> 00:06:19.540
although our three strains had
been previously identified bacteria,

00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:22.563
two of them were not previously associated

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:26.597
with phthalate degradation, so this
was actually a novel discovery.

00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:30.650
JY: To better understand
how this biodegradation works,

00:06:30.674 --> 00:06:34.302
we wanted to verify the catabolic
pathways of our three strains.

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:37.214
To do this, we extracted
enzymes from our bacteria

00:06:37.238 --> 00:06:40.782
and reacted with an intermediate
of phthalic acid.

00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:43.934
MW: We monitored this experiment
with spectrophotometry

00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.179
and obtained this beautiful graph.

00:06:46.203 --> 00:06:48.589
This graph shows
that our bacteria really do have

00:06:48.613 --> 00:06:51.227
a genetic pathway
to biodegrade phthalates.

00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:54.589
Our bacteria can transform phthalates,
which is a harmful toxin,

00:06:54.613 --> 00:06:56.997
into end products such
as carbon dioxide, water

00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:58.236
and alcohol.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.403
I know some of you
in the crowd are thinking,

00:07:00.427 --> 00:07:03.258
well, carbon dioxide is horrible,
it's a greenhouse gas.

00:07:03.282 --> 00:07:06.552
But if our bacteria did not
evolve to break down phthalates,

00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:09.148
they would have used some other
kind of carbon source,

00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:11.211
and aerobic respiration would have led it

00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:14.523
to have end products such
as carbon dioxide anyway.

00:07:14.547 --> 00:07:16.825
We were also interested to see that,

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:18.984
although we've obtained greater diversity

00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:21.954
of bacteria biodegraders
from the bird habitat site,

00:07:21.978 --> 00:07:25.026
we obtained the most efficient
degraders from the landfill site.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.407
So this fully shows that nature evolves

00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.648
through natural selection.

00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:32.745
JY: So Miranda and I shared this research

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:35.924
at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge
competition and were recognized

00:07:35.948 --> 00:07:38.960
with the greatest
commercialization potential.

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:41.096
Although we're not the first
ones to find bacteria

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.597
that can break down phthalates,

00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:45.095
we were the first ones
to look into our local river

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:48.807
and find a possible solution
to a local problem.

00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:51.108
We have not only shown that bacteria

00:07:51.132 --> 00:07:54.520
can be the solution to plastic
pollution, but also that

00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.821
being open to uncertain
outcomes and taking risks

00:07:57.845 --> 00:08:01.096
create opportunities
for unexpected discoveries.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.597
Throughout this journey, we have also
discovered our passion for science,

00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:06.439
and are currently continuing research

00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:09.930
on other fossil fuel
chemicals in university.

00:08:09.954 --> 00:08:11.478
We hope that in the near future,

00:08:11.502 --> 00:08:13.881
we'll be able to create model organisms

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:15.763
that can break down not only phthalates

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:19.432
but a wide variety
of different contaminants.

00:08:19.456 --> 00:08:22.128
We can apply this to wastewater
treatment plants

00:08:22.152 --> 00:08:23.616
to clean up our rivers

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.952
and other natural resources.

00:08:25.976 --> 00:08:28.491
And perhaps one day
we'll be able to tackle

00:08:28.515 --> 00:08:32.529
the problem of solid plastic waste.

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:34.864
MW: I think our journey
has truly transformed

00:08:34.888 --> 00:08:36.929
our view of microorganisms,

00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:38.477
and Jeanny and I have shown that

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:40.620
even mistakes can lead to discoveries.

00:08:40.644 --> 00:08:41.910
Einstein once said,

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:44.297
"You can't solve problems
by using the same kind

00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:47.565
of thinking you used
when you created them."
