WEBVTT

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.623
Bean bags are awesome.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.220
But I see a few people out there
who are standing,

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:24.609
we've got some over here,

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.391
and standing takes more
work than lounging.

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:32.601
Using the Live Strong
Organization's online database

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.110
of weight loss resources,

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:36.412
you can calculate

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.558
that by the time I'm done
with this speech,

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:40.472
those of you who are standing

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:44.889
will have burned 7.5 more calories

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:47.450
than those of you who are bean-bagging it.

00:00:47.474 --> 00:00:48.537
(Laughter)

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.876
Okay, here's a question,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.630
speaking of weight loss,
specifically weight,

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:54.804
this speech is live.

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:56.686
I'm actually here in front of you guys,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.907
we're all here together.

00:00:57.931 --> 00:00:59.781
But this speech is being recorded

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:03.671
and it will become a video
that people can access all over the world

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:05.631
on computers, mobile devices,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:06.885
televisions.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.851
I weight about 190 pounds.

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:15.754
How much will the video weigh?

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:19.976
Asking questions like that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.770
is what I do every week
on my channel Vsauce.

00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:24.405
For the last two years,

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.868
I have been asking really fun questions,

00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:28.238
mind-boggling questions,

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:31.257
and approaching them
as sincerely as I can,

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:34.423
celebrating scientific
concepts and scientists.

00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:36.377
And I research and write

00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.453
and produce and host

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:38.719
and edit and upload

00:01:38.743 --> 00:01:40.792
and run the social media all by myself,

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:42.635
but it's not lonely,

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.889
because Vsauce has
more than 2 million subscribers,

00:01:45.913 --> 00:01:50.032
and every month, my videos are seen
by more than 20 million people.

00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:52.016
Yeah.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.217
(Applause)

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.680
It's very exciting.

00:01:55.704 --> 00:02:01.730
I've found that asking a strange question
is a great way to get people in,

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.905
not just people, but fans.

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.549
And fans are different
than just viewers or an audience,

00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:08.901
because fans want to come back.

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:11.482
They subscribe to you on YouTube

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.602
and they want to watch
everything you've made

00:02:13.626 --> 00:02:15.769
and everything you plan
to make in the future

00:02:15.793 --> 00:02:18.240
because we are curious people

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:23.642
and sparking curiosity is great bait.

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:25.905
It's a great way to catch a human.

00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:27.837
And once you've caught them,

00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:31.001
you have this captive
audience that you can,

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.627
with the goal in mind
of answering the question,

00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.505
accidentally teach a lot of things to.

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.019
So, let's take a look
at some of my videos.

00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:40.367
Here are eight of them.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.055
But down here in the lower-right corner,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.281
"What Color is a Mirror?"

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:46.697
When people see that,

00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.150
it's very difficult not to click,
because you think,

00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:50.475
"Come on, are you serious?

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.194
How could you possibly
answer that question?"

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:58.011
Well, so far, 7.6 million
people have watched

00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:00.885
this five-minute video
about what color a mirror is.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.909
And in that episode, I answer the question

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:07.139
and I get a chance to explain
what would normally be kind of dry topics:

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:08.171
optics,

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:10.211
diffuse versus specular reflection,

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:12.634
how light works,
how light works on the retina,

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.420
and even the etymology of color terms

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.258
like white and black.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.100
Okay, spoiler alert:

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:21.425
mirrors are not clear,

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.316
they are not silvery,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.931
like they're often illustrated.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.385
Mirrors, technically speaking,

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.434
are just a tiny, tiny, little bit ...

00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:30.707
green.

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.940
You can demonstrate this
by putting two mirrors next to each other,

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:36.114
facing so they reflect
back and forth forever.

00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:39.110
Look down that infinite reflection,
and it will get dimmer,

00:03:39.134 --> 00:03:42.844
because some light is lost
or absorbed every time,

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:46.000
but it will also become greener,

00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:47.806
because green light,

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.859
that is light of a wavelength
that we perceive as green,

00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:53.669
is best reflected by most mirrors.

00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:56.363
Okay, so, how much does a video weigh?

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:59.393
Well, when you stream
a video onto your computer,

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:01.552
that information is temporarily stored

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:03.091
using electrons.

00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:08.922
And the number of electrons on your device
won't actually increase or decrease.

00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:11.945
But it takes energy
to store them in one place,

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.506
and, thanks to our friend Albert Einstein,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.795
we know that energy and mass are related.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.363
Okay, so here's the thing:

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:20.339
let's say you're watching a YouTube video

00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:23.085
at a really nice resolution, 720p.

00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:25.003
Assuming a typical bit rate,

00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:30.166
we can figure that a minute
of YouTube video

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.484
is going to need to involve
about 10 million electrons on your device.

00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:41.173
Plugging all those electrons
and the energy it takes to hold them

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.354
in the correct place
for you to see the video,

00:04:43.378 --> 00:04:44.486
into that formula,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.431
we can figure out
that one minute of YouTube video

00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:50.770
increases the mass of your computer

00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:54.558
by about 10 to the negative 19th grams.

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:57.180
Written out, it looks like this.

00:04:57.787 --> 00:04:58.788
(Whistle)

00:04:58.812 --> 00:04:59.884
That's like nothing.

00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:04.313
You could call that nothing,
and you wouldn't really get in trouble,

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:07.489
because the best scales
we've ever invented

00:05:07.513 --> 00:05:10.552
that we could try to use
to actually to detect that change

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:13.352
are only accurate to 10
to the negative 9th grams.

00:05:13.852 --> 00:05:15.012
So, we can't measure it,

00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:17.852
but we can, like we just did,
calculate it.

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:20.271
And that's really cool
because when I was a kid,

00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:25.334
my school had two shelves
of science books.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.469
That was really cool,

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.774
but I read all of them
within, like, two grades,

00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:30.711
and it was hard to get more books

00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:33.044
because books are heavy,
you need space for them

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:35.965
and moving books around is tougher
than what we can do today.

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:37.440
With numbers that small,

00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:39.936
I can fit thousands of books

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.031
on my own little personal
electronic reader.

00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:45.210
I can stream hours and hours

00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:47.256
and days and days of YouTube video

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.021
without my computer
ever getting measurably heavier.

00:05:52.123 --> 00:05:54.307
And as information becomes that light,

00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:55.903
it becomes a lot more democratic,

00:05:55.927 --> 00:05:58.133
meaning that more teachers

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:03.508
and presenters and creators
and viewers than ever before

00:06:03.532 --> 00:06:04.643
can be involved.

00:06:06.638 --> 00:06:07.738
Right now, on YouTube,

00:06:07.762 --> 00:06:10.481
there is an explosion
of content like this happening.

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:13.269
The three Vsauce channels
are down there in the corner.

00:06:13.293 --> 00:06:15.509
But everyone else,
all together, collectively,

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:18.199
their views dwarf what I can do alone

00:06:18.223 --> 00:06:20.128
or with the people that I work with,

00:06:20.152 --> 00:06:22.299
and that is really, really exciting.

00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:25.096
It turns out that tapping
into people's curiosity

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.285
and responsibly answering their questions

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:32.251
is a brilliant way to build
fans and an audience

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:33.337
and get in viewers.

00:06:33.361 --> 00:06:36.617
It's even a great way
for brands and companies

00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:38.046
to build trust.

00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:43.188
So, calculating the weight of a video

00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:45.199
is kind of a funny question,

00:06:45.223 --> 00:06:51.945
but I cannot wait to see
what we ask and answer next.

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:53.863
As always, thanks for watching.

00:06:53.887 --> 00:06:54.887
(Applause)
