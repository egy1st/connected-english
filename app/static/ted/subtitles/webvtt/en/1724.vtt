00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:02.617
Let's face it:

00:00:02.617 --> 00:00:05.062
Driving is dangerous.

00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:08.160
It's one of the things that we don't like to think about,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.812
but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:16.602
show up on dashboards around the world

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:20.739
betrays the fact that we know this to be true.

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.333
Car accidents are the leading cause of death

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:28.503
in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States --

00:00:28.503 --> 00:00:31.346
leading cause of death --

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:35.209
and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:37.494
with drugs or alcohol.

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:39.755
So what happens?

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:43.974
No one can say for sure, but I remember my first accident.

00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:47.777
I was a young driver out on the highway,

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:50.035
and the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on.

00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:51.835
I'm like, "Okay, all right, this guy is slowing down,

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:53.117
I'll slow down too."

00:00:53.117 --> 00:00:55.043
I step on the brake.

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:57.297
But no, this guy isn't slowing down.

00:00:57.297 --> 00:01:00.475
This guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:03.015
It was just going 65 -- to zero?

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:04.535
I slammed on the brakes.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:07.594
I felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going,

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:10.290
and it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.229
and the air bag deploys, the car is totaled,

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.786
and fortunately, no one was hurt.

00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:20.997
But I had no idea that car was stopping,

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:24.642
and I think we can do a lot better than that.

00:01:24.642 --> 00:01:28.787
I think we can transform the driving experience

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:32.666
by letting our cars talk to each other.

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.090
I just want you to think a little bit

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.978
about what the experience of driving is like now.

00:01:36.978 --> 00:01:41.006
Get into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble.

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.922
You can't really directly sense the world around you.

00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:46.103
You're in this extended body.

00:01:46.103 --> 00:01:48.266
You're tasked with navigating it down

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.322
partially-seen roadways,

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:54.746
in and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds.

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:59.226
Okay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes.

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.988
Okay, so that's all you have,

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:02.723
eyes that weren't really designed for this task,

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:06.474
but then people ask you to do things like,

00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:08.023
you want to make a lane change,

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:10.344
what's the first thing they ask you do?

00:02:10.344 --> 00:02:13.439
Take your eyes off the road. That's right.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.535
Stop looking where you're going, turn,

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.553
check your blind spot,

00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:21.024
and drive down the road without looking where you're going.

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:24.159
You and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.400
Why do we do this? Because we have to,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.979
we have to make a choice, do I look here or do I look here?

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.500
What's more important?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.211
And usually we do a fantastic job

00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:36.980
picking and choosing what we attend to on the road.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.630
But occasionally we miss something.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.091
Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late.

00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:47.079
In countless accidents, the driver says,

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.387
"I didn't see it coming."

00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:52.668
And I believe that. I believe that.

00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:55.593
We can only watch so much.

00:02:55.593 --> 00:03:00.737
But the technology exists now that can help us improve that.

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:05.033
In the future, with cars exchanging data with each other,

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:08.961
we will be able to see not just three cars ahead

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:10.555
and three cars behind, to the right and left,

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:13.721
all at the same time, bird's eye view,

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.849
we will actually be able to see into those cars.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.220
We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.460
to see how fast that guy's going or stopping.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.970
If that guy's going down to zero, I'll know.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.829
And with computation and algorithms and predictive models,

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.102
we will be able to see the future.

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:35.658
You may think that's impossible.

00:03:35.658 --> 00:03:38.389
How can you predict the future? That's really hard.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.008
Actually, no. With cars, it's not impossible.

00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:44.740
Cars are three-dimensional objects

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.072
that have a fixed position and velocity.

00:03:47.072 --> 00:03:48.703
They travel down roads.

00:03:48.703 --> 00:03:51.115
Often they travel on pre-published routes.

00:03:51.115 --> 00:03:55.053
It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions

00:03:55.053 --> 00:03:57.917
about where a car's going to be in the near future.

00:03:57.917 --> 00:03:59.919
Even if, when you're in your car

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.913
and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom! --

00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:04.209
85 miles an hour down, lane-splitting --

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.756
I know you've had this experience --

00:04:06.756 --> 00:04:09.359
that guy didn't "just come out of nowhere."

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.002
That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:14.192
(Laughter)

00:04:14.192 --> 00:04:17.781
Right? I mean, somebody's seen him.

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:20.549
Ten, 20, 30 miles back, someone's seen that guy,

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.933
and as soon as one car sees that guy

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:25.164
and puts him on the map, he's on the map --

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.340
position, velocity,

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.661
good estimate he'll continue going 85 miles an hour.

00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:31.845
You'll know, because your car will know, because

00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:34.120
that other car will have whispered something in his ear,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.043
like, "By the way, five minutes,

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.818
motorcyclist, watch out."

00:04:38.818 --> 00:04:41.521
You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave.

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:42.886
I mean, they're Newtonian objects.

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:45.795
That's very nice about them.

00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:48.829
So how do we get there?

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:51.095
We can start with something as simple

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:53.965
as sharing our position data between cars,

00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:55.857
just sharing GPS.

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:58.301
If I have a GPS and a camera in my car,

00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:00.532
I have a pretty precise idea of where I am

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.264
and how fast I'm going.

00:05:02.264 --> 00:05:03.921
With computer vision, I can estimate where

00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:07.458
the cars around me are, sort of, and where they're going.

00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:08.428
And same with the other cars.

00:05:08.428 --> 00:05:10.242
They can have a precise idea of where they are,

00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:12.388
and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are.

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:15.619
What happens if two cars share that data,

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:17.574
if they talk to each other?

00:05:17.574 --> 00:05:20.352
I can tell you exactly what happens.

00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:22.691
Both models improve.

00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.746
Everybody wins.

00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:27.323
Professor Bob Wang and his team

00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:30.061
have done computer simulations of what happens

00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:33.492
when fuzzy estimates combine, even in light traffic,

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:36.116
when cars just share GPS data,

00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:38.629
and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.656
and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors

00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:44.789
that are in cars now on these robots:

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.627
stereo cameras, GPS,

00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:48.501
and the two-dimensional laser range finders

00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:50.741
that are common in backup systems.

00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:55.225
We also attach a discrete short-range communication radio,

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:57.134
and the robots talk to each other.

00:05:57.134 --> 00:05:58.673
When these robots come at each other,

00:05:58.673 --> 00:06:01.644
they track each other's position precisely,

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:04.381
and they can avoid each other.

00:06:04.381 --> 00:06:07.607
We're now adding more and more robots into the mix,

00:06:07.607 --> 00:06:09.078
and we encountered some problems.

00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:11.437
One of the problems, when you get too much chatter,

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:15.165
it's hard to process all the packets, so you have to prioritize,

00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:17.522
and that's where the predictive model helps you.

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:21.894
If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories,

00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:23.661
you don't pay as much attention to those packets.

00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.364
You prioritize the one guy

00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:26.697
who seems to be going a little off course.

00:06:26.697 --> 00:06:29.223
That guy could be a problem.

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:32.225
And you can predict the new trajectory.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.988
So you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how.

00:06:34.988 --> 00:06:38.713
And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way.

00:06:38.713 --> 00:06:41.346
And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone?

00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:44.529
How can these cars whisper, "You need to get out of the way?"

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.046
Well, it depends on two things:

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:48.215
one, the ability of the car,

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:51.432
and second the ability of the driver.

00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:52.937
If one guy has a really great car,

00:06:52.937 --> 00:06:55.862
but they're on their phone or, you know, doing something,

00:06:55.862 --> 00:06:57.792
they're not probably in the best position

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.762
to react in an emergency.

00:07:00.762 --> 00:07:02.427
So we started a separate line of research

00:07:02.427 --> 00:07:04.978
doing driver state modeling.

00:07:04.978 --> 00:07:07.307
And now, using a series of three cameras,

00:07:07.307 --> 00:07:09.577
we can detect if a driver is looking forward,

00:07:09.577 --> 00:07:12.437
looking away, looking down, on the phone,

00:07:12.437 --> 00:07:15.498
or having a cup of coffee.

00:07:15.498 --> 00:07:17.568
We can predict the accident

00:07:17.568 --> 00:07:21.219
and we can predict who, which cars,

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:24.705
are in the best position to move out of the way

00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:27.714
to calculate the safest route for everyone.

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:32.349
Fundamentally, these technologies exist today.

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:35.173
I think the biggest problem that we face

00:07:35.173 --> 00:07:38.186
is our own willingness to share our data.

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:40.817
I think it's a very disconcerting notion,

00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:43.203
this idea that our cars will be watching us,

00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:46.574
talking about us to other cars,

00:07:46.574 --> 00:07:50.001
that we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip.

00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:53.898
But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy,

00:07:53.898 --> 00:07:57.639
just like right now, when I look at your car from the outside,

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:00.002
I don't really know about you.

00:08:00.002 --> 00:08:01.139
If I look at your license plate number,

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.025
I don't really know who you are.

00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:07.274
I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs.

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:10.249
(Laughter)

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:13.434
And I think it's going to be a great thing.

00:08:13.434 --> 00:08:15.084
I want you to consider for a moment

00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:19.202
if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you

00:08:19.202 --> 00:08:21.322
to know that you're braking,

00:08:21.322 --> 00:08:24.246
that you're coming to a dead stop.

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:26.987
By sharing our data willingly,

00:08:26.987 --> 00:08:29.799
we can do what's best for everyone.

00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:32.875
So let your car gossip about you.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:35.913
It's going to make the roads a lot safer.

00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:37.704
Thank you.

00:08:37.704 --> 00:08:42.689
(Applause)
