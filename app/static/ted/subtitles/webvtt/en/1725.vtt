00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:03.286
I've noticed something interesting
about society and culture.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.868
Everything risky requires a license.

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:10.848
So, learning to drive,
owning a gun, getting married.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.511
There's a certain --

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:14.835
(Laughter)

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.580
That's true in everything risky,
except technology.

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:20.939
For some reason,
there's no standard syllabus,

00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:22.929
there's no basic course.

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:26.572
They just sort of give you your computer
and then kick you out of the nest.

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:28.873
You're supposed to learn
this stuff -- how?

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:30.124
Just by osmosis.

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:33.040
Nobody ever sits down and tells you,
"This is how it works."

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:36.017
So today I'm going to tell you ten things

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:39.407
that you thought everybody knew,
but it turns out they don't.

00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:42.217
First of all, on the web,
if you want to scroll down,

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.482
don't pick up the mouse
and use the scroll bar.

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:46.033
That's a terrible waste of time.

00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:48.097
Do that only if you're paid by the hour.

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:49.998
Instead, hit the space bar.

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:53.861
The space bar scrolls down one page.

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:56.766
Hold down the Shift key
to scroll back up again.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.702
So, space bar to scroll down one page;
works in every browser,

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.979
in every kind of computer.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:04.725
Also on the web, when you're filling in
one of these forms like your addresses,

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:06.958
I assume you know
that you can hit the Tab key

00:01:06.982 --> 00:01:08.561
to jump from box to box to box.

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.355
But what about the pop-up menu
where you put in your state?

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.660
Don't open the pop-up menu.

00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:15.548
That's a terrible waste of calories.

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:19.142
Type the first letter of your state
over and over and over.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.394
So if you want Connecticut, go, C, C, C.

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:24.830
If you want Texas, go T, T,
and you jump right to that thing

00:01:24.854 --> 00:01:26.918
without even opening the pop-up menu.

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:30.162
Also on the web,
when the text is too small,

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:33.686
what you do is hold down the Control key
and hit plus, plus, plus.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.529
You make the text larger with each tap.

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:38.985
Works on every computer,
every web browser,

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.979
or minus, minus, to get smaller again.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.569
If you're on the Mac,
it might be Command instead.

00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:47.433
When you're typing
on your Blackberry, Android, iPhone,

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:50.719
don't bother switching layouts
to the punctuation layout

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.577
to hit the period and then a space,

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:54.506
then try to capitalize the next letter.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.533
Just hit the space bar twice.

00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:59.986
The phone puts the period,
the space, and the capital for you.

00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:01.726
Go space, space.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.631
It is totally amazing.

00:02:03.938 --> 00:02:06.952
Also when it comes
to cell phones, on all phones,

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:10.562
if you want to redial
somebody that you've dialed before,

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:13.107
all you have to do is hit the call button,

00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:16.702
and it puts the last phone number
into the box for you,

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:19.857
and at that point you can hit
call again to actually dial it.

00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:23.405
No need to go to the recent calls list
if you're trying to call somebody

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:24.920
just hit the call button again.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.427
Something that drives me crazy:

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:29.046
When I call you and leave a message
on your voice mail,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.840
I hear you saying, "Leave a message,"

00:02:30.864 --> 00:02:34.221
and then I get these 15 seconds
of freaking instructions,

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:37.909
like we haven't had
answering machines for 45 years!

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:41.597
(Laughter)

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:43.074
I'm not bitter.

00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:44.105
(Laughter)

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.341
So it turns out
there's a keyboard shortcut

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.723
that lets you jump directly
to the beep like this.

00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:50.334
Phone: At the tone, please...

00:02:50.358 --> 00:02:51.359
(Beep)

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:53.873
David Pogue: Unfortunately,
the carriers didn't adopt

00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:56.338
the same keystroke,
so it's different by carrier,

00:02:56.362 --> 00:02:59.403
so it devolves upon you
to learn the keystroke

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:01.285
for the person you're calling.

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:04.107
I didn't say these were going
to be perfect.

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:06.306
So most of you think of Google

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.582
as something that lets you
look up a web page,

00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:09.976
but it is also a dictionary.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.592
Type the word "define"
and the word you want to know.

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.441
You don't even have to click anything.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.521
There's the definition as you type.

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:18.576
It's also a complete FAA database.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.684
Type the name of the airline
and the flight.

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.407
It shows you where the flight is,
the gate, the terminal,

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:24.717
how long until it lands.

00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:26.152
You don't need an app.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:28.143
It's also unit and currency conversion.

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:30.790
Again, you don't have to click
one of the results.

00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:33.419
Just type it into the box,
and there's your answer.

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.134
While we're talking about text --

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.959
When you want to highlight --

00:03:38.712 --> 00:03:40.078
this is just an example --

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:41.966
(Laughter)

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.249
When you want to highlight a word,

00:03:44.273 --> 00:03:47.243
please don't waste your life
dragging across it

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:48.677
with the mouse like a newbie.

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.335
Double click the word.

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.020
Watch "200" -- I go double-click,

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:53.753
it neatly selects just that word.

00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:56.494
Also, don't delete
what you've highlighted.

00:03:56.518 --> 00:03:57.891
You can just type over it.

00:03:57.915 --> 00:03:59.445
This is in every program.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.460
Also, you can go double-click, drag,

00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:04.366
to highlight in one-word
increments as you drag.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.630
Much more precise.

00:04:05.654 --> 00:04:07.489
Again, don't bother deleting.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:08.819
Just type over it.

00:04:08.843 --> 00:04:12.551
(Laughter)

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:16.056
Shutter lag is the time
between your pressing the shutter button

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.414
and the moment the camera actually snaps.

00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:21.382
It's extremely frustrating
on any camera under $1,000.

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:23.016
(Camera click)

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.579
(Laughter)

00:04:26.383 --> 00:04:30.357
So, that's because the camera needs time
to calculate the focus and exposure,

00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:33.242
but if you pre-focus with a half-press,

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:35.032
leave your finger down --

00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:36.300
no shutter lag!

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.414
You get it every time.

00:04:39.438 --> 00:04:43.622
I've just turned your $50 camera
into a $1,000 camera with that trick.

00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:46.955
And finally, it often happens
that you're giving a talk,

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.011
and for some reason,
the audience is looking at the slide

00:04:50.035 --> 00:04:51.293
instead of at you!

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:53.691
(Laughter)

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:56.618
So when that happens --
this works in Keynote, PowerPoint,

00:04:56.642 --> 00:04:59.653
it works in every program
-- all you do is hit the letter B key,

00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:03.230
B for blackout, to black out the slide,
make everybody look at you,

00:05:03.254 --> 00:05:05.733
and then when you're ready
to go on, you hit B again,

00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:10.220
and if you're really on a roll,
you can hit the W key for "whiteout,"

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:11.955
and you white out the slide,

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.620
and then you can hit W again
to un-blank it.

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:16.254
So I know I went super fast.

00:05:16.278 --> 00:05:19.722
If you missed anything, I'll be happy
to send you the list of these tips.

00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:21.321
In the meantime, congratulations.

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:23.778
You all get your California
Technology License.

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:25.014
Have a great day.

00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:27.772
(Applause)
