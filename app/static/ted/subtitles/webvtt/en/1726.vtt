00:00:01.564 --> 00:00:03.335
What you're doing,

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:06.139
right now, at this very moment,

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.159
is killing you.

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:10.914
More than cars or the Internet

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:13.683
or even that little mobile device we keep talking about,

00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:16.574
the technology you're using the most almost every day

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:19.780
is this, your tush.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.909
Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day,

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.407
which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.

00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:28.272
Sitting is so incredibly prevalent,

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:30.249
we don't even question how much we're doing it,

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.191
and because everyone else is doing it,

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.965
it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.

00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:38.277
In that way, sitting has become

00:00:38.277 --> 00:00:42.181
the smoking of our generation.

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.609
Of course there's health consequences to this,

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.390
scary ones, besides the waist.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.042
Things like breast cancer and colon cancer

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:54.331
are directly tied to our lack of physical [activity],

00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:56.963
Ten percent in fact, on both of those.

00:00:56.963 --> 00:00:58.483
Six percent for heart disease,

00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:00.506
seven percent for type 2 diabetes,

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:03.286
which is what my father died of.

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:05.347
Now, any of those stats should convince each of us

00:01:05.347 --> 00:01:06.966
to get off our duff more,

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.736
but if you're anything like me, it won't.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.964
What did get me moving was a social interaction.

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:14.272
Someone invited me to a meeting,

00:01:14.272 --> 00:01:15.445
but couldn't manage to fit me in

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:18.283
to a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said,

00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:22.108
"I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:24.155
It seemed kind of odd to do,

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:26.265
and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking,

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:28.029
"I have to be the one to ask the next question,"

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:31.185
because I knew I was going to huff and puff

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:33.369
during this conversation.

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.499
And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.145
So instead of going to coffee meetings

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:40.373
or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings,

00:01:40.373 --> 00:01:43.403
I ask people to go on a walking meeting,

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:47.342
to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.

00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:49.771
It's changed my life.

00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:53.000
But before that, what actually happened was,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.982
I used to think about it as,

00:01:53.982 --> 00:01:55.678
you could take care of your health,

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:58.202
or you could take care of obligations,

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:02.007
and one always came at the cost of the other.

00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:05.139
So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later,

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:06.512
I've learned a few things.

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:08.386
First, there's this amazing thing

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:11.111
about actually getting out of the box

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:13.085
that leads to out-of-the-box thinking.

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:17.510
Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.530
And second, and probably the more reflective one,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.825
is just about how much each of us

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:25.289
can hold problems in opposition

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.264
when they're really not that way.

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:28.972
And if we're going to solve problems

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:30.570
and look at the world really differently,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.699
whether it's in governance or business

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.561
or environmental issues, job creation,

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.224
maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.426
as having both things be true.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.349
Because it was when that happened

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.804
with this walk-and-talk idea

00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:47.763
that things became doable and sustainable and viable.

00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:49.743
So I started this talk talking about the tush,

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:53.753
so I'll end with the bottom line, which is,

00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:55.384
walk and talk.

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:56.667
Walk the talk.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:00.335
You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking,

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:01.931
and in the way that you do,

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.459
you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.186
Thank you.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:11.402
(Applause)
