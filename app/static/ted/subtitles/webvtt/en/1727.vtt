00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:02.959
Well, I have a big announcement to make today,

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.132
and I'm really excited about this.

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:07.460
And this may be a little bit of a surprise

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.714
to many of you who know my research

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:12.869
and what I've done well.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.273
I've really tried to solve some big problems:

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:18.740
counterterrorism, nuclear terrorism,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.388
and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer,

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.852
but I started thinking about all these problems,

00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:29.412
and I realized that the really biggest problem we face,

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:31.660
what all these other problems come down to,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.302
is energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:38.421
And I decided that I was going to set out

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:41.803
to try to solve this problem.

00:00:41.803 --> 00:00:45.775
And this probably is not what you're expecting.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.427
You're probably expecting me to come up here

00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:49.006
and talk about fusion,

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:50.986
because that's what I've done most of my life.

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:54.252
But this is actually a talk about, okay --

00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:56.876
(Laughter) â€”

00:00:56.876 --> 00:00:59.843
but this is actually a talk about fission.

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:01.369
It's about perfecting something old,

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.019
and bringing something old into the 21st century.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.644
Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works.

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:10.388
In a nuclear power plant, you have

00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:13.036
a big pot of water that's under high pressure,

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:14.554
and you have some fuel rods,

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:16.923
and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium,

00:01:16.923 --> 00:01:19.793
and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel,

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:23.949
and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level,

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:27.100
and that reaction heats up water,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.925
the water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine,

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:31.855
and you produce electricity from it.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:34.635
This is the same way we've been producing electricity,

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:38.100
the steam turbine idea, for 100 years,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.121
and nuclear was a really big advancement

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:42.701
in a way to heat the water,

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:47.156
but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine.

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:50.972
And I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it?

00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:53.772
Is fission kind of played out,

00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:56.627
or is there something left to innovate here?

00:01:56.627 --> 00:01:59.212
And I realized that I had hit upon something

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:03.516
that I think has this huge potential to change the world.

00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:07.007
And this is what it is.

00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.612
This is a small modular reactor.

00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:14.316
So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here.

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:16.719
This is between 50 and 100 megawatts.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.340
But that's a ton of power.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.789
That's between, say at an average use,

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:26.930
that's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.508
Now the really interesting thing about these reactors

00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:31.633
is they're built in a factory.

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:33.596
So they're modular reactors that are built

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:35.941
essentially on an assembly line,

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:38.100
and they're trucked anywhere in the world,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.411
you plop them down, and they produce electricity.

00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.853
This region right here is the reactor.

00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:46.164
And this is buried below ground, which is really important.

00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:48.877
For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work,

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.573
I can't extol to you

00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:54.358
how great having something buried below the ground is

00:02:54.358 --> 00:02:58.397
for proliferation and security concerns.

00:02:58.397 --> 00:03:01.910
And inside this reactor is a molten salt,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.688
so anybody who's a fan of thorium,

00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:06.014
they're going to be really excited about this,

00:03:06.014 --> 00:03:11.096
because these reactors happen to be really good

00:03:11.096 --> 00:03:13.680
at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.731
uranium-233.

00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.301
But I'm not really concerned about the fuel.

00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:21.525
You can run these off -- they're really hungry,

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:24.957
they really like down-blended weapons pits,

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:27.821
so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium

00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:28.854
that's been down-blended.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:32.246
It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon,

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:35.397
but they love this stuff.

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.180
And we have a lot of it sitting around,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.822
because this is a big problem.

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:40.939
You know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.279
of nuclear weapons, and that was great,

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.734
and we don't need them anymore,

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:49.078
and what are we doing with all the waste, essentially?

00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:51.493
What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons?

00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:53.394
Well, we're securing them, and it would be great

00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:55.138
if we could burn them, eat them up,

00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:57.139
and this reactor loves this stuff.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.161
So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core,

00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:03.935
and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt,

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:08.005
the radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive.

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:10.652
It's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive.

00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:12.432
And then that's a heat exchanger

00:04:12.432 --> 00:04:15.725
to what makes this design really, really interesting,

00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:18.733
and that's a heat exchanger to a gas.

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:21.277
So going back to what I was saying before about all power

00:04:21.277 --> 00:04:24.270
being produced -- well, other than photovoltaic --

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.168
being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine,

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:30.688
that's actually not that efficient, and in fact,

00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:33.064
in a nuclear power plant like this,

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:37.872
it's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient.

00:04:37.872 --> 00:04:40.409
That's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.062
to how much electricity it's producing.

00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:44.987
And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors

00:04:44.987 --> 00:04:46.693
operate at pretty low temperature.

00:04:46.693 --> 00:04:48.448
They operate anywhere from, you know,

00:04:48.448 --> 00:04:52.141
maybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius.

00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:56.140
And these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.845
which means the higher the temperature you go to,

00:04:58.845 --> 00:05:01.741
thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies.

00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:05.415
And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas,

00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:07.893
so supercritical CO2 or helium,

00:05:07.893 --> 00:05:09.334
and that goes into a turbine,

00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:11.195
and this is called the Brayton cycle.

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.669
This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity,

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.099
and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient,

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.989
between 45 and 50 percent efficiency.

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:20.660
And I'm really excited about this,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.173
because it's a very compact core.

00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:27.309
Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature,

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:30.614
but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out

00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:33.359
for how much uranium you're fissioning,

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:35.438
not to mention the fact that these burn up.

00:05:35.438 --> 00:05:37.030
Their burn-up is much higher.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.008
So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor,

00:05:39.008 --> 00:05:41.364
a lot more of it's being used.

00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:44.549
And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this

00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:48.821
is, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium,

00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:51.550
and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.724
Well, uranium dioxide's a ceramic,

00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:56.940
and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.241
So you have what's called the xenon pit,

00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.345
and so some of these fission products love neutrons.

00:06:01.345 --> 00:06:02.592
They love the neutrons that are going on

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.992
and helping this reaction take place.

00:06:04.992 --> 00:06:07.968
And they eat them up, which means that, combined with

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.205
the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long,

00:06:10.205 --> 00:06:11.919
you can only run one of these reactors

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.447
for roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it.

00:06:16.447 --> 00:06:21.038
So these reactors run for 30 years without refueling,

00:06:21.038 --> 00:06:23.758
which is, in my opinion, very, very amazing,

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.711
because it means it's a sealed system.

00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:28.582
No refueling means you can seal them up

00:06:28.582 --> 00:06:31.495
and they're not going to be a proliferation risk,

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:33.766
and they're not going to have

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:36.270
either nuclear material or radiological material

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.582
proliferated from their cores.

00:06:38.582 --> 00:06:41.646
But let's go back to safety, because everybody

00:06:41.646 --> 00:06:45.424
after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear,

00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:47.974
and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:51.526
was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe,

00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:54.005
and I'm really excited about this reactor

00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:56.334
for essentially two reasons.

00:06:56.334 --> 00:06:59.278
One, it doesn't operate at high pressure.

00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:02.519
So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:04.951
or boiling water reactor, they're very, very hot water

00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:08.358
at very high pressures, and this means, essentially,

00:07:08.358 --> 00:07:11.222
in the event of an accident, if you had any kind of breach

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:14.263
of this stainless steel pressure vessel,

00:07:14.263 --> 00:07:16.535
the coolant would leave the core.

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:19.574
These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure,

00:07:19.574 --> 00:07:23.480
so there's no inclination for the fission products

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.052
to leave the reactor in the event of an accident.

00:07:26.052 --> 00:07:28.370
Also, they operate at high temperatures,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.249
and the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down,

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:35.827
but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances,

00:07:35.827 --> 00:07:38.137
or you lost off-site power in the case

00:07:38.137 --> 00:07:41.327
of something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:45.798
Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant,

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:48.169
you could actually just drain the core

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:50.350
into what's called a sub-critical setting,

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.304
basically a tank underneath the reactor

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:54.264
that has some neutrons absorbers.

00:07:54.264 --> 00:07:58.054
And this is really important, because the reaction stops.

00:07:58.054 --> 00:08:00.718
In this kind of reactor, you can't do that.

00:08:00.718 --> 00:08:04.199
The fuel, like I said, is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods,

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:07.190
and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors,

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.327
Fukushima and Three Mile Island --

00:08:09.327 --> 00:08:12.222
looking back at Three Mile Island, we didn't really see this for a while â€”

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:15.708
but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods,

00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:18.537
what happens is, when they see high pressure water,

00:08:18.537 --> 00:08:21.094
steam, in an oxidizing environment,

00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:23.166
they'll actually produce hydrogen,

00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:26.094
and that hydrogen has this explosive capability

00:08:26.094 --> 00:08:28.304
to release fission products.

00:08:28.304 --> 00:08:30.518
So the core of this reactor, since it's not under pressure

00:08:30.518 --> 00:08:32.782
and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity,

00:08:32.782 --> 00:08:36.256
means that there's no inclination for the fission products

00:08:36.256 --> 00:08:37.990
to leave this reactor.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.255
So even in the event of an accident,

00:08:40.255 --> 00:08:43.973
yeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know,

00:08:43.973 --> 00:08:45.632
sorry for the power company,

00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:47.732
but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land.

00:08:47.732 --> 00:08:51.744
So I really think that in the, say,

00:08:51.744 --> 00:08:53.872
20 years it's going to take us to get fusion

00:08:53.872 --> 00:08:56.092
and make fusion a reality,

00:08:56.092 --> 00:08:58.673
this could be the source of energy

00:08:58.673 --> 00:09:01.347
that provides carbon-free electricity.

00:09:01.347 --> 00:09:03.005
Carbon-free electricity.

00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:06.350
And it's an amazing technology because

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.180
not only does it combat climate change,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.684
but it's an innovation.

00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:13.751
It's a way to bring power to the developing world,

00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:16.230
because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.366
You can put them anywhere in the world you want to.

00:09:18.366 --> 00:09:21.622
And maybe something else.

00:09:21.622 --> 00:09:24.143
As a kid, I was obsessed with space.

00:09:24.143 --> 00:09:26.886
Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point,

00:09:26.886 --> 00:09:29.286
but before that I was obsessed with space,

00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:31.197
and I was really excited about, you know,

00:09:31.197 --> 00:09:33.071
being an astronaut and designing rockets,

00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:35.157
which was something that was always exciting to me.

00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:38.563
But I think I get to come back to this,

00:09:38.563 --> 00:09:41.864
because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket

00:09:41.864 --> 00:09:44.694
that produces 50 to 100 megawatts.

00:09:44.694 --> 00:09:47.971
That is the rocket designer's dream.

00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:51.702
That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream.

00:09:51.702 --> 00:09:53.706
Not only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts

00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:58.119
to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there,

00:09:58.119 --> 00:09:59.518
but you have power once you get there.

00:09:59.518 --> 00:10:03.039
You know, rocket designers who use solar panels

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:05.998
or fuel cells, I mean a few watts or kilowatts --

00:10:05.998 --> 00:10:07.591
wow, that's a lot of power.

00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:10.036
I mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts.

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:11.209
That's a ton of power.

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:13.496
That could power a Martian community.

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:15.093
That could power a rocket there.

00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:17.800
And so I hope that

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.921
maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore

00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:24.588
my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion.

00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:27.578
And people say, "Oh, well, you've launched this thing,

00:10:27.578 --> 00:10:30.142
and it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?"

00:10:30.142 --> 00:10:33.175
But we launch plutonium batteries all the time.

00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.294
Everybody was really excited about Curiosity,

00:10:35.294 --> 00:10:37.895
and that had this big plutonium battery on board

00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:40.014
that has plutonium-238,

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.414
which actually has a higher specific activity

00:10:42.414 --> 00:10:46.158
than the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors,

00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:49.661
which means that the effects would be negligible,

00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:51.113
because you launch it cold,

00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:54.824
and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor.

00:10:54.824 --> 00:10:56.132
So I'm really excited.

00:10:56.132 --> 00:10:58.669
I think that I've designed this reactor here

00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:02.574
that can be an innovative source of energy,

00:11:02.574 --> 00:11:06.255
provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications,

00:11:06.255 --> 00:11:08.783
and I'm really prepared to do this.

00:11:08.783 --> 00:11:11.550
I graduated high school in May, and --

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.698
(Laughter) (Applause) â€”

00:11:15.698 --> 00:11:17.749
I graduated high school in May,

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:20.589
and I decided that I was going to start up a company

00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:22.957
to commercialize these technologies that I've developed,

00:11:22.957 --> 00:11:25.814
these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers

00:11:25.814 --> 00:11:28.094
and these systems to produce medical isotopes,

00:11:28.094 --> 00:11:31.542
but I want to do this, and I've slowly been building up

00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:33.795
a team of some of the most incredible people

00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:35.982
I've ever had the chance to work with,

00:11:35.982 --> 00:11:38.744
and I'm really prepared to make this a reality.

00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:41.841
And I think, I think, that looking at the technology,

00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:47.191
this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas,

00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:48.991
and you don't have to refuel it for 30 years,

00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:51.718
which is an advantage for the developing world.

00:11:51.718 --> 00:11:54.840
And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.769
to end with, which is weird for a scientist.

00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:59.263
But I think there's something really poetic

00:11:59.263 --> 00:12:03.062
about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars,

00:12:03.062 --> 00:12:05.817
because the stars are giant fusion reactors.

00:12:05.817 --> 00:12:08.158
They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.

00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:11.555
The energy that I'm able to talk to you today,

00:12:11.555 --> 00:12:13.650
while it was converted to chemical energy in my food,

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.838
originally came from a nuclear reaction,

00:12:16.838 --> 00:12:19.614
and so there's something poetic about, in my opinion,

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.583
perfecting nuclear fission

00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:26.302
and using it as a future source of innovative energy.

00:12:26.302 --> 00:12:28.253
So thank you guys.

00:12:28.253 --> 00:12:33.238
(Applause)
