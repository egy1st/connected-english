00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:04.848
I have spent my entire life

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:09.173
either at the schoolhouse,
on the way to the schoolhouse,

00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:11.796
or talking about what happens
in the schoolhouse.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.919
(Laughter)

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:15.231
Both my parents were educators,

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.481
my maternal grandparents were educators,

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:21.600
and for the past 40 years,
I've done the same thing.

00:00:22.346 --> 00:00:24.688
And so, needless to say, over those years

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:28.204
I've had a chance
to look at education reform

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.035
from a lot of perspectives.

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:31.989
Some of those reforms have been good.

00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:34.258
Some of them have been not so good.

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:36.455
And we know why kids drop out.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:37.934
We know why kids don't learn.

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.851
It's either poverty, low attendance,

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.227
negative peer influences...

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.864
We know why.

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:47.211
But one of the things
that we never discuss

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:49.523
or we rarely discuss

00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:53.815
is the value and importance
of human connection.

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.042
Relationships.

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:59.650
James Comer says
that no significant learning

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:02.123
can occur without
a significant relationship.

00:01:02.873 --> 00:01:05.223
George Washington Carver says all learning

00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:09.330
is understanding relationships.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:13.874
Everyone in this room has been affected
by a teacher or an adult.

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:19.492
For years, I have watched people teach.

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:22.874
I have looked at the best
and I've looked at some of the worst.

00:01:22.898 --> 00:01:24.696
A colleague said to me one time,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.219
"They don't pay me to like the kids.

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:28.808
They pay me to teach a lesson.

00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:30.061
The kids should learn it.

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:31.991
I should teach it, they should learn it,

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:33.109
Case closed."

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.179
Well, I said to her,

00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:39.283
"You know, kids don't learn
from people they don't like."

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.602
(Laughter)

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:47.196
(Applause)

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.601
She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:51.648
And I said to her,

00:01:51.672 --> 00:01:56.062
"Well, your year is going to be
long and arduous, dear."

00:01:56.086 --> 00:01:57.553
Needless to say, it was.

00:01:57.577 --> 00:02:01.339
Some people think that you can either
have it in you to build a relationship,

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:02.600
or you don't.

00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:05.150
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.

00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:08.692
He said you ought to just
throw in a few simple things,

00:02:08.716 --> 00:02:10.997
like seeking first to understand,

00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:12.939
as opposed to being understood.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.342
Simple things, like apologizing.

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:17.700
You ever thought about that?

00:02:17.724 --> 00:02:19.880
Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.

00:02:19.904 --> 00:02:21.068
(Laughter)

00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:23.497
I taught a lesson once on ratios.

00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.522
I'm not real good with math,
but I was working on it.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:27.688
(Laughter)

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.494
And I got back and looked
at that teacher edition.

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:32.322
I'd taught the whole lesson wrong.

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:33.650
(Laughter)

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:35.968
So I came back to class
the next day and I said,

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:38.200
"Look, guys, I need to apologize.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:41.570
I taught the whole lesson wrong.
I'm so sorry."

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.899
They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.

00:02:43.923 --> 00:02:45.919
You were so excited, we just let you go."

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.394
I have had classes that were so low,

00:02:55.418 --> 00:02:58.156
so academically deficient, that I cried.

00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:01.783
I wondered, "How am I
going to take this group,

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.854
in nine months,

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:05.989
from where they are
to where they need to be?

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.108
And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.

00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:12.679
How do I raise the self-esteem of a child

00:03:12.703 --> 00:03:15.044
and his academic achievement
at the same time?

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:17.768
One year I came up with a bright idea.

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:19.613
I told all my students,

00:03:19.637 --> 00:03:23.254
"You were chosen to be in my class

00:03:23.278 --> 00:03:24.802
because I am the best teacher

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:26.348
and you are the best students,

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.793
they put us all together

00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:30.266
so we could show
everybody else how to do it."

00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:33.267
One of the students said, "Really?"

00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:35.551
(Laughter)

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:38.574
I said, "Really. We have
to show the other classes

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:41.034
how to do it, so when
we walk down the hall,

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:43.585
people will notice us,
so you can't make noise.

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.219
You just have to strut."

00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:46.436
(Laughter)

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.112
And I gave them a saying to say:

00:03:48.136 --> 00:03:49.404
"I am somebody.

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:50.769
I was somebody when I came.

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:52.693
I'll be a better somebody when I leave.

00:03:52.717 --> 00:03:54.686
I am powerful, and I am strong.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.376
I deserve the education that I get here.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.768
I have things to do, people to impress,

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:01.540
and places to go."

00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:02.784
And they said, "Yeah!"

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.312
(Laughter)

00:04:04.336 --> 00:04:05.732
You say it long enough,

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:08.544
it starts to be a part of you.

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:15.986
(Applause)

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.367
I gave a quiz, 20 questions.

00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:21.462
A student missed 18.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.927
I put a "+2" on his paper
and a big smiley face.

00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:27.504
(Laughter)

00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:30.647
He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:32.608
I said, "Yes."

00:04:32.632 --> 00:04:33.878
(Laughter)

00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:37.057
He said, "Then why'd you
put a smiley face?"

00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:39.305
I said, "Because you're on a roll.

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:42.190
You got two right.
You didn't miss them all."

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:43.377
(Laughter)

00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:46.796
I said, "And when we review this,
won't you do better?"

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.325
He said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better."

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.957
You see, "-18" sucks
all the life out of you.

00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:55.039
"+2" said, "I ain't all bad."

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:07.038
For years, I watched my mother
take the time at recess to review,

00:05:07.062 --> 00:05:09.870
go on home visits in the afternoon,

00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:12.629
buy combs and brushes
and peanut butter and crackers

00:05:12.653 --> 00:05:15.363
to put in her desk drawer
for kids that needed to eat,

00:05:15.387 --> 00:05:18.626
and a washcloth and some soap
for the kids who didn't smell so good.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.912
See, it's hard to teach kids who stink.

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:22.299
(Laughter)

00:05:22.323 --> 00:05:24.192
And kids can be cruel.

00:05:24.827 --> 00:05:27.379
And so she kept those things in her desk,

00:05:27.403 --> 00:05:30.904
and years later, after she retired,

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:33.521
I watched some of those
same kids come through

00:05:33.545 --> 00:05:35.505
and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.330
you made a difference in my life.

00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:39.256
You made it work for me.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.294
You made me feel like I was somebody,

00:05:41.318 --> 00:05:44.681
when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.

00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:46.808
And I want you to just
see what I've become."

00:05:46.832 --> 00:05:49.931
And when my mama died two years ago at 92,

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:53.135
there were so many former
students at her funeral,

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.849
it brought tears to my eyes,
not because she was gone,

00:05:55.873 --> 00:05:59.256
but because she left
a legacy of relationships

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.968
that could never disappear.

00:06:01.788 --> 00:06:05.511
Can we stand to have more relationships?

00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:06.690
Absolutely.

00:06:06.714 --> 00:06:09.824
Will you like all your children?
Of course not.

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:11.102
(Laughter)

00:06:11.126 --> 00:06:15.024
And you know your toughest
kids are never absent.

00:06:15.048 --> 00:06:17.017
(Laughter)

00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:18.657
Never.

00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.115
You won't like them all,

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.525
and the tough ones show up for a reason.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.705
It's the connection.
It's the relationships.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.997
So teachers become
great actors and great actresses,

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.260
and we come to work
when we don't feel like it,

00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:41.310
and we're listening to policy
that doesn't make sense,

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.647
and we teach anyway.

00:06:44.515 --> 00:06:48.555
We teach anyway,
because that's what we do.

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:51.221
Teaching and learning should bring joy.

00:06:51.818 --> 00:06:54.255
How powerful would our world be

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:58.005
if we had kids who were
not afraid to take risks,

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:59.410
who were not afraid to think,

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:00.766
and who had a champion?

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.231
Every child deserves a champion,

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.441
an adult who will never give up on them,

00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:08.433
who understands the power of connection,

00:07:08.457 --> 00:07:12.069
and insists that they become
the best that they can possibly be.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.594
Is this job tough? You betcha.

00:07:14.618 --> 00:07:16.837
Oh God, you betcha.

00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:20.071
But it is not impossible.

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:21.828
We can do this. We're educators.

00:07:21.852 --> 00:07:24.112
We're born to make a difference.

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:25.503
Thank you so much.

00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:30.820
(Applause)
