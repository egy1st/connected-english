WEBVTT

00:00:01.212 --> 00:00:03.342
I'm not sure that every person here

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:06.079
is familiar with my pictures.

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:10.162
I want to start to show just a few pictures to you,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.112
and after I'll speak.

00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:49.836
I must speak to you a little bit of my history,

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:51.783
because we'll be speaking on this

00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:54.764
during my speech here.

00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:57.900
I was born in 1944 in Brazil,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.655
in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:03.538
I was born on a farm,

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:08.040
a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest [still].

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.660
A marvelous place.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.972
I lived with incredible birds, incredible animals,

00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:18.213
I swam in our small rivers with our caimans.

00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:21.122
It was about 35 families that lived on this farm,

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:25.404
and everything that we produced on this farm, we consumed.

00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:27.511
Very few things went to the market.

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:30.221
Once a year, the only thing that went to the market

00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:31.941
was the cattle that we produced,

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:34.710
and we made trips of about 45 days

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.886
to reach the slaughterhouse,

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:39.180
bringing thousands of head of cattle,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.712
and about 20 days traveling back

00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:44.109
to reach our farm again.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.486
When I was 15 years old,

00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:49.991
it was necessary for me to leave this place

00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:53.454
and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger --

00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:56.885
where I did the second part of secondary school.

00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:59.653
There I learned different things.

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:02.278
Brazil was starting to urbanize, industrialize,

00:02:02.278 --> 00:02:06.693
and I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical,

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.535
I was a member of leftist parties,

00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:12.641
and I became an activist.

00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.733
I [went to] university to become an economist.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.413
I [did] a master's degree in economics.

00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:21.422
And the most important thing in my life

00:02:21.422 --> 00:02:23.081
also happened in this time.

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:25.770
I met an incredible girl

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.908
who became my lifelong best friend,

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:33.676
and my associate in everything that I have done till now,

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:36.940
my wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.844
Brazil radicalized very strongly.

00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:41.756
We fought very hard against the dictatorship,

00:02:41.756 --> 00:02:43.542
in a moment it was necessary to us:

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:47.126
Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand,

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:49.581
or leave Brazil. We were too young,

00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:54.782
and our organization thought it was better for us to go out,

00:02:54.782 --> 00:02:55.746
and we went to France,

00:02:55.746 --> 00:02:57.765
where I did a PhD in economics,

00:02:57.765 --> 00:02:59.761
Léila became an architect.

00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:02.844
I worked after for an investment bank.

00:03:02.844 --> 00:03:05.806
We made a lot of trips, financed development,

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:08.661
economic projects in Africa with the World Bank.

00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:12.129
And one day photography made a total invasion in my life.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.367
I became a photographer,

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.983
abandoned everything and became a photographer,

00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:18.808
and I started to do the photography

00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:21.804
that was important for me.

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:23.990
Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.566
that you are an anthropologist photographer,

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:29.327
that you are an activist photographer.

00:03:29.327 --> 00:03:32.327
But I did much more than that.

00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:35.009
I put photography as my life.

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.613
I lived totally inside photography

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:39.648
doing long term projects,

00:03:39.648 --> 00:03:42.158
and I want to show you just a few pictures

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:48.055
of -- again, you'll see inside the social projects,

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:50.217
that I went to, I published many books

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:53.423
on these photographs,

00:03:53.423 --> 00:03:57.178
but I'll just show you a few ones now.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.724
In the '90s, from 1994 to 2000,

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:49.965
I photographed a story called Migrations.

00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:51.842
It became a book. It became a show.

00:04:51.842 --> 00:04:54.600
But during the time that I was photographing this,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.337
I lived through a very hard moment in my life, mostly in Rwanda.

00:05:00.337 --> 00:05:04.648
I saw in Rwanda total brutality.

00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:07.813
I saw deaths by thousands per day.

00:05:07.813 --> 00:05:10.754
I lost my faith in our species.

00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:14.945
I didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer,

00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:20.492
and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus.

00:05:20.492 --> 00:05:23.476
I started to have infection everywhere.

00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:27.888
When I made love with my wife, I had no sperm that came out of me;

00:05:27.888 --> 00:05:30.715
I had blood.

00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:33.596
I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris,

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:36.362
told him that I was completely sick.

00:05:36.362 --> 00:05:39.216
He made a long examination, and told me, "Sebastian,

00:05:39.216 --> 00:05:42.353
you are not sick, your prostate is perfect.

00:05:42.353 --> 00:05:46.441
What happened is, you saw so many deaths that you are dying.

00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:49.360
You must stop. Stop.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.201
You must stop because on the contrary, you will be dead."

00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:57.847
And I made the decision to stop.

00:05:57.847 --> 00:06:00.140
I was really upset with photography,

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.161
with everything in the world,

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:06.001
and I made the decision to go back to where I was born.

00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:07.605
It was a big coincidence.

00:06:07.605 --> 00:06:11.016
It was the moment that my parents became very old.

00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:14.577
I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family,

00:06:14.577 --> 00:06:16.445
and they made together the decision

00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:19.145
to transfer this land to Léila and myself.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:24.761
When we received this land, this land was as dead as I was.

00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:28.065
When I was a kid, it was more than 50 percent rainforest.

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:29.587
When we received the land,

00:06:29.587 --> 00:06:33.362
it was less than half a percent rainforest,

00:06:33.362 --> 00:06:35.007
as in all my region.

00:06:35.007 --> 00:06:37.936
To build development, Brazilian development,

00:06:37.936 --> 00:06:40.723
we destroyed a lot of our forest.

00:06:40.723 --> 00:06:42.706
As you did here in the United States,

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:44.994
or you did in India, everywhere in this planet.

00:06:44.994 --> 00:06:46.672
To build our development,

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.755
we come to a huge contradiction

00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:52.490
that we destroy around us everything.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.155
This farm that had thousands of head of cattle

00:06:56.155 --> 00:06:58.322
had just a few hundreds,

00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:00.727
and we didn't know how to deal with these.

00:07:00.727 --> 00:07:04.627
And Léila came up with an incredible idea, a crazy idea.

00:07:04.627 --> 00:07:09.274
She said, why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before?

00:07:09.274 --> 00:07:10.780
You say that you were born in paradise.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.706
Let's build the paradise again.

00:07:13.706 --> 00:07:16.538
And I went to see a good friend

00:07:16.538 --> 00:07:18.071
that was engineering forests

00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:19.969
to prepare a project for us,

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:22.150
and we started. We started to plant, and this

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.407
first year we lost a lot of trees, second year less,

00:07:26.407 --> 00:07:31.468
and slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again.

00:07:31.468 --> 00:07:34.831
We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees,

00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:38.271
only local species, only native species,

00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:41.812
where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed,

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:46.120
and the life started to come back in an incredible way.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.919
It was necessary for us to transform our land

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:50.361
into a national park.

00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:53.019
We transformed. We gave this land back to nature.

00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:54.394
It became a national park.

00:07:54.394 --> 00:07:58.144
We created an institution called Instituto Terra,

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:03.123
and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere.

00:08:03.123 --> 00:08:06.908
Here in Los Angeles, in the Bay Area in San Francisco,

00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:09.059
it became tax deductible in the United States.

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:12.387
We raised money in Spain, in Italy, a lot in Brazil.

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:14.595
We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:16.843
that put money into this project, the government.

00:08:16.843 --> 00:08:21.027
And the life started to come, and I had a big wish

00:08:21.027 --> 00:08:24.443
to come back to photography, to photograph again.

00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:27.738
And this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore

00:08:27.738 --> 00:08:32.321
just one animal that I had photographed all my life: us.

00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:34.689
I wished to photograph the other animals,

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:36.681
to photograph the landscapes,

00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:40.127
to photograph us, but us from the beginning,

00:08:40.127 --> 00:08:42.657
the time we lived in equilibrium with nature.

00:08:42.657 --> 00:08:47.210
And I went. I started in the beginning of 2004,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.410
and I finished at the end of 2011.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.103
We created an incredible amount of pictures,

00:08:53.103 --> 00:08:56.673
and the result -- Lélia did the design of all my books,

00:08:56.673 --> 00:08:59.737
the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows.

00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:02.044
And what we want with these pictures

00:09:02.044 --> 00:09:08.456
is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:10.979
and what we must hold on this planet

00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:14.277
if we want to live, to have some equilibrium in our life.

00:09:14.277 --> 00:09:16.788
And I wanted to see us

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:22.655
when we used, yes, our instruments in stone.

00:09:22.655 --> 00:09:24.812
We exist yet. I was last week

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:27.708
at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation,

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:31.014
and only in the Amazon we have about 110 groups

00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:33.945
of Indians that are not contacted yet.

00:09:33.945 --> 00:09:36.478
We must protect the forest in this sense.

00:09:36.478 --> 00:09:41.313
And with these pictures, I hope that we can create

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:43.542
information, a system of information.

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:47.288
We tried to do a new presentation of the planet,

00:09:47.288 --> 00:09:49.214
and I want to show you now just a few pictures

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:52.483
of this project, please.

00:11:47.543 --> 00:11:49.975
Well, this — (Applause) —

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:54.538
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:11:57.142 --> 00:12:00.228
This is what we must fight hard

00:12:00.228 --> 00:12:02.119
to hold like it is now.

00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:06.230
But there is another part that we must together rebuild,

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.247
to build our societies, our modern family of societies,

00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:12.886
we are at a point where we cannot go back.

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:15.094
But we create an incredible contradiction.

00:12:15.094 --> 00:12:17.390
To build all this, we destroy a lot.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.600
Our forest in Brazil, that antique forest

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.486
that was the size of California,

00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:25.160
is destroyed today 93 percent.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.154
Here, on the West Coast, you've destroyed your forest.

00:12:28.154 --> 00:12:31.391
Around here, no? The redwood forests are gone.

00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:33.258
Gone very fast, disappeared.

00:12:33.258 --> 00:12:35.927
Coming the other day from Atlanta, here, two days ago,

00:12:35.927 --> 00:12:37.771
I was flying over deserts

00:12:37.771 --> 00:12:40.631
that we made, we provoked with our own hands.

00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:43.290
India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.799
And we must rebuild these forests.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:50.447
That is the essence of our life, these forests.

00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:54.689
We need to breathe. The only factory

00:12:54.689 --> 00:12:58.265
capable to transform CO2 into oxygen,

00:12:58.265 --> 00:13:00.009
are the forests.

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:04.363
The only machine capable to capture the carbon

00:13:04.363 --> 00:13:07.214
that we are producing, always,

00:13:07.214 --> 00:13:11.379
even if we reduce them, everything that we do, we produce CO2,

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:12.878
are the trees.

00:13:12.878 --> 00:13:17.244
I put the question -- three or four weeks ago,

00:13:17.244 --> 00:13:18.933
we saw in the newspapers

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:21.825
millions of fish that die in Norway.

00:13:21.825 --> 00:13:24.841
A lack of oxygen in the water.

00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:27.073
I put to myself the question, if for a moment,

00:13:27.073 --> 00:13:31.060
we will not lack oxygen for all animal species,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.498
ours included -- that would be very complicated for us.

00:13:34.498 --> 00:13:38.802
For the water system, the trees are essential.

00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:42.474
I'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily.

00:13:42.474 --> 00:13:46.400
You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head,

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.565
if you take a shower, it takes you

00:13:49.565 --> 00:13:53.089
two or three hours to dry your hair

00:13:53.089 --> 00:13:55.410
if you don't use a dryer machine.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:00.191
Me, one minute, it's dry. The same with the trees.

00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:02.893
The trees are the hair of our planet.

00:14:02.893 --> 00:14:06.682
When you have rain in a place that has no trees,

00:14:06.682 --> 00:14:10.110
in just a few minutes, the water arrives in the stream,

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.693
brings soil, destroying our water source,

00:14:12.693 --> 00:14:14.600
destroying the rivers,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.010
and no humidity to retain.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.301
When you have trees, the root system holds the water.

00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:23.029
All the branches of the trees, the leaves that come down

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:25.091
create a humid area,

00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:29.811
and they take months and months under the water, go to the rivers,

00:14:29.811 --> 00:14:33.011
and maintain our source, maintain our rivers.

00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:35.015
This is the most important thing,

00:14:35.015 --> 00:14:39.478
when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life.

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:41.666
I want to show you now, to finish,

00:14:41.666 --> 00:14:44.366
just a few pictures that for me

00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:47.305
are very important in that direction.

00:14:47.305 --> 00:14:49.455
You remember that I told you,

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:51.558
when I received the farm from my parents

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.358
that was my paradise, that was the farm.

00:14:54.358 --> 00:14:59.868
Land completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried.

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:02.424
But you can see in this picture,

00:15:02.424 --> 00:15:06.439
we were starting to construct an educational center

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:11.403
that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil.

00:15:11.403 --> 00:15:15.741
But you see a lot of small spots in this picture.

00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:19.318
In each point of those spots, we had planted a tree.

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:20.893
There are thousands of trees.

00:15:20.893 --> 00:15:24.101
Now I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point

00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:26.178
two months ago.

00:15:27.807 --> 00:15:35.154
(Applause)

00:15:36.857 --> 00:15:38.615
I told you in the beginning that it was necessary

00:15:38.615 --> 00:15:43.415
for us to plant about 2.5 million trees

00:15:43.415 --> 00:15:45.854
of about 200 different species

00:15:45.854 --> 00:15:49.094
in order to rebuild the ecosystem.

00:15:49.094 --> 00:15:51.629
And I'll show you the last picture.

00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:54.798
We are with two million trees in the ground now.

00:15:54.798 --> 00:15:56.447
We are doing the sequestration

00:15:56.447 --> 00:16:00.901
of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees.

00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:05.445
My friends, it's very easy to do. We did it, no?

00:16:05.445 --> 00:16:07.757
By an accident that happened to me,

00:16:07.757 --> 00:16:11.157
we went back, we built an ecosystem.

00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:13.824
We here inside the room,

00:16:13.824 --> 00:16:17.360
I believe that we have the same concern,

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.796
and the model that we created in Brazil,

00:16:19.796 --> 00:16:21.141
we can transplant it here.

00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:24.164
We can apply it everywhere around the world, no?

00:16:24.164 --> 00:16:27.112
And I believe that we can do it together.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.741
Thank you very much.

00:16:28.741 --> 00:16:33.388
(Applause)
