00:00:01.643 --> 00:00:02.782
All right, so let's take

00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:05.122
four subjects that obviously go together:

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:09.851
big data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks.

00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:10.681
Right?

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.100
Now, the issue about tattoos is that,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.305
without a word, tattoos really do shout.

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:22.365
[Beautiful]

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:24.263
[Intriguing]

00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:27.578
So you don't have to say a lot.

00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:31.245
[Allegiance]

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:35.648
[Very intimate]

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:38.273
[Serious mistakes]

00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:41.361
(Laughter)

00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:46.218
And tattoos tell you a lot of stories.

00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:47.963
If I can ask an indiscreet question,

00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:51.439
how many of you have tattoos?

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:52.946
A few, but not most.

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.733
What happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn,

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.631
cell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor,

00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:01.391
all these things you deal with every day

00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:03.751
turn out to be electronic tattoos?

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.373
And what if they provide as much information

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:10.350
about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would?

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.536
What's ended up happening over the past few decades

00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:15.642
is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.321
or as a great celebrity

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.042
is now being applied to you every day by all these people

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:24.029
who are Tweeting, blogging, following you,

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:28.349
watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself.

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:32.763
And electronic tattoos also shout.

00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:35.107
And as you're thinking of the consequences of that,

00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:38.043
it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things,

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.822
because it's not just the electronic tattoos,

00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:44.894
it's facial recognition that's getting really good.

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:48.692
So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names,

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:52.749
although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter)

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.758
But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this,

00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:59.766
take a picture, say, of this guy right here,

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:03.430
get the name, and download all the records

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.049
before you utter a word or speak to somebody,

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.425
because everybody turns out to be

00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:12.026
absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.

00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:14.518
And so there's companies like face.com that now have

00:02:14.518 --> 00:02:18.302
about 18 billion faces online.

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:19.891
Here's what happened to this company.

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:22.554
[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...]

00:02:22.554 --> 00:02:25.207
There are other companies that will place a camera

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:27.630
like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook —

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.942
they take your picture, they tie it to the social media,

00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:32.069
they figure out you really like to wear black dresses,

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.505
so maybe the person in the store comes up and says,

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.805
"Hey, we've got five black dresses

00:02:36.805 --> 00:02:40.038
that would just look great on you."

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:42.158
So what if Andy was wrong?

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:43.428
Here's Andy's theory.

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.272
[In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.]

00:02:45.272 --> 00:02:46.378
What if we flip this?

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:51.059
What if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes? (Laughter)

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.075
Well, then, because of electronic tattoos,

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:58.736
maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality,

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:00.314
because these tattoos will live

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:03.091
far longer than our bodies will.

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:04.982
And if that's true, then what we want to do

00:03:04.982 --> 00:03:08.391
is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks

00:03:08.391 --> 00:03:11.700
and one lesson from a Latin American.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.523
Why the Greeks?

00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:15.380
Well, the Greeks thought about what happens

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.338
when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time.

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:23.018
So lesson number one: Sisyphus.

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:26.044
Remember? He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time

00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:28.427
to roll this rock up, it would roll back down,

00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:30.400
roll back up, roll back down.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.803
It's a little like your reputation.

00:03:32.803 --> 00:03:34.238
Once you get that electronic tattoo,

00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:37.166
you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time,

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.474
so as you go through this stuff,

00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:42.559
just be careful what you post.

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.938
Myth number two: Orpheus, wonderful guy,

00:03:45.938 --> 00:03:49.666
charming to be around, great partier, great singer,

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.883
loses his beloved, charms his way into the underworld,

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:55.490
only person to charm his way into the underworld,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.835
charms the gods of the underworld,

00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.730
they release his beauty on the condition

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.842
he never look at her until they're out.

00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:05.681
So he's walking out and walking out and walking out

00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:09.939
and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.773
With all this data out here, it might be a good idea

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:18.521
not to look too far into the past of those you love.

00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.362
Lesson number three: Atalanta.

00:04:21.362 --> 00:04:25.811
Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody.

00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:28.221
If you won, she would marry you.

00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:31.146
If you lost, you died.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.490
How did Hippomenes beat her?

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.416
Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples,

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:38.034
and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:40.038
She'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:44.284
She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.514
Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples

00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:50.086
come and reach you and you want to post about them

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:53.922
or tweet about them or send a late-night message.

00:04:53.922 --> 00:04:57.170
And then, of course, there's Narcissus.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.717
Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.013
(Laughter)

00:05:03.013 --> 00:05:05.581
But as you're thinking about Narcissus,

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:09.661
just don't fall in love with your own reflection.

00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:11.452
Last lesson, from a Latin American:

00:05:11.452 --> 00:05:14.213
This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.402
When he was threatened by the thugs

00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:18.035
of the Argentine military junta,

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:20.288
he came back and said, "Oh, come on,

00:05:20.288 --> 00:05:23.733
how else can you threaten, other than with death?"

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:26.853
The interesting thing, the original thing,

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:30.045
would be to threaten somebody with immortality.

00:05:30.045 --> 00:05:31.505
And that, of course, is what we are all

00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:35.681
now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos.

00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:36.766
Thank you.

00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:40.497
(Applause)
