WEBVTT

00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.048
I teach chemistry.

00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:04.414
(Explosion)

00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:07.572
All right, all right.

00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:09.853
So more than just explosions,

00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:11.464
chemistry is everywhere.

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:14.104
Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:16.449
just doing this over and over?

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.654
Some people nodding yes.

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:20.982
Recently, I showed this to my students,

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:25.331
and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened.

00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:27.952
The questions and conversations that followed

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.603
were fascinating.

00:00:29.603 --> 00:00:31.417
Check out this video that Maddie

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:34.587
from my period three class sent me that evening.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:47.569
(Clang) (Laughs)

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.763
Now obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher,

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:53.869
I love that she went home and continued to geek out

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.487
about this kind of ridiculous demonstration

00:00:56.487 --> 00:00:57.909
that we did in class.

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.855
But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:02.549
took her to a new level.

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.682
If you look inside that beaker,

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.242
you might see a candle.

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:09.251
Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon

00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:12.028
to a new scenario.

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:15.266
You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.232
are magnets that draw us towards our teachers,

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:21.184
and they transcend all technology

00:01:21.184 --> 00:01:24.325
or buzzwords in education.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:28.426
But if we place these technologies before student inquiry,

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:30.549
we can be robbing ourselves

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.483
of our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions.

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:39.863
For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom

00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:41.640
to the screen of a mobile device

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.477
might save instructional time,

00:01:43.477 --> 00:01:46.376
but if it is the focus of our students' experience,

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.496
it's the same dehumanizing chatter

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:51.728
just wrapped up in fancy clothing.

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:54.003
But if instead we have the guts

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.873
to confuse our students, perplex them,

00:01:56.873 --> 00:01:59.149
and evoke real questions,

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.149
through those questions, we as teachers have information

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.177
that we can use to tailor robust

00:02:05.177 --> 00:02:08.868
and informed methods of blended instruction.

00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:14.040
So, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.244
the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now,

00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:20.718
and it took a life-threatening situation

00:02:20.718 --> 00:02:23.665
to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:27.280
and help me realize that student questions

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.401
are the seeds of real learning,

00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:32.515
not some scripted curriculum

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:35.811
that gave them tidbits of random information.

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:39.283
In May of 2010, at 35 years old,

00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:42.376
with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way,

00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:44.992
I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm

00:02:44.992 --> 00:02:47.512
at the base of my thoracic aorta.

00:02:47.512 --> 00:02:50.564
This led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:52.098
from my doctor right there.

00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:55.623
Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock --

00:02:55.623 --> 00:02:58.088
absolutely freaked out, okay?

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:02.307
But I found surprising moments of comfort

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:05.997
in the confidence that my surgeon embodied.

00:03:05.997 --> 00:03:09.441
Where did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it?

00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:13.033
So when I asked him, he told me three things.

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:16.415
He said first, his curiosity drove him

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:18.690
to ask hard questions about the procedure,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.875
about what worked and what didn't work.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:24.969
Second, he embraced, and didn't fear,

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.045
the messy process of trial and error,

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:29.554
the inevitable process of trial and error.

00:03:29.554 --> 00:03:32.530
And third, through intense reflection,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.206
he gathered the information that he needed

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:37.112
to design and revise the procedure,

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:40.633
and then, with a steady hand, he saved my life.

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:44.309
Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom,

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:46.289
and before I went back into the classroom that fall,

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.547
I wrote down three rules of my own

00:03:49.547 --> 00:03:52.327
that I bring to my lesson planning still today.

00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:56.369
Rule number one: Curiosity comes first.

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.468
Questions can be windows to great instruction,

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:02.158
but not the other way around.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:05.792
Rule number two: Embrace the mess.

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:08.463
We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly.

00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:11.334
And just because the scientific method is allocated

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.785
to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:18.240
of the one that we all skip, okay,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.442
trial and error can still be an informal part

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:23.359
of what we do every single day

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:26.691
at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206.

00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:30.713
And rule number three: Practice reflection.

00:04:30.713 --> 00:04:33.057
What we do is important. It deserves our care,

00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:36.289
but it also deserves our revision.

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.067
Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms?

00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:42.063
As if what we are doing one day will save lives.

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:43.614
Our students our worth it.

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:46.049
And each case is different.

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:47.144
(Explosion)

00:04:47.144 --> 00:04:49.091
All right. Sorry.

00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:50.999
The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.834
out of my system before we move on.

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.619
So these are my daughters.

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:59.291
On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family.

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.073
And, on the left, Riley.

00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:04.728
Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here.

00:05:04.728 --> 00:05:06.422
She's going to be four years old,

00:05:06.422 --> 00:05:08.672
and anyone who knows a four-year-old

00:05:08.672 --> 00:05:11.872
knows that they love to ask, "Why?"

00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:13.356
Yeah. Why.

00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:15.666
I could teach this kid anything

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:18.516
because she is curious about everything.

00:05:18.516 --> 00:05:20.999
We all were at that age.

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:24.474
But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers,

00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:27.296
the ones she has yet to meet.

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:29.788
How will they grow this curiosity?

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:35.270
You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.664
and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms --

00:05:38.664 --> 00:05:41.988
to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun

00:05:41.988 --> 00:05:47.006
or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom.

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:49.681
But if we as educators leave behind

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:52.263
this simple role as disseminators of content

00:05:52.263 --> 00:05:54.600
and embrace a new paradigm

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.644
as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry,

00:05:57.644 --> 00:05:59.869
we just might bring a little bit more meaning

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.584
to their school day, and spark their imagination.

00:06:02.584 --> 00:06:04.168
Thank you very much.

00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:09.861
(Applause)
