00:00:00.765 --> 00:00:04.274
I'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me,

00:00:04.274 --> 00:00:06.443
she said, "Geoff, you watch the TED Talks."

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:08.379
I said, "Yes, honey, I love TED Talks."

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.867
She said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- "

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:13.610
I said, "I know, I know." (Laughter)

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.402
She said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man."

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.355
(Laughter)

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:21.966
So I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey,

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.021
I'm gonna be good. I am."

00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:27.439
But I am angry. (Laughter)

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.145
And the last time I looked, I'm --

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:33.952
(Applause)

00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:39.380
So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.299
This year, there are going to be millions of our children

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.263
that we're going to needlessly lose,

00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:51.853
that we could -- right now, we could save them all.

00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:55.698
You saw the quality of the educators who were here.

00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:59.035
Do not tell me they could not reach those kids

00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:01.306
and save them. I know they could.

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:04.167
It is absolutely possible.

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:06.550
Why haven't we fixed this?

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.314
Those of us in education have held on to a business plan

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:15.169
that we don't care how many millions of young people fail,

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:18.264
we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work,

00:01:18.264 --> 00:01:23.207
and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? --

00:01:23.207 --> 00:01:25.352
enough to say, "Enough is enough."

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:29.736
So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense.

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:33.096
You know, I grew up in the inner city,

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:37.983
and there were kids who were failing

00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:44.517
in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:51.291
and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.275
And you know something about a lousy school?

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:55.891
It's not like a bottle of wine.

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:57.202
Right? (Laughter)

00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.980
Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right?

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.096
That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year,

00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:06.502
it's still the same approach, right?

00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:11.046
One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't,

00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.721
tough luck. Just tough luck.

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.666
Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen?

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:20.131
Do not tell me we can't do better than this.

00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:25.596
Look, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years,

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:28.060
and you say, "So what's the plan?"

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.164
And they say, "We'll, we're going to do

00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:33.180
what we did last year this year."

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.983
What kind of business model is that?

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:41.961
Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:47.074
They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.

00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:52.007
Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.

00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:55.395
They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:58.781
Who created that business model? Right?

00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:00.894
And it went on for decades.

00:03:00.894 --> 00:03:02.809
You know why? Because they didn't care.

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.793
It wasn't about the customers.

00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:10.311
It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.

00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:12.390
How could you go to the bank

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.799
when you were at work? It didn't matter.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.422
And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset

00:03:17.422 --> 00:03:20.011
he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank.

00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:23.449
They all operate the same way. Right?

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.312
Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.

00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:31.289
Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:34.416
They might like that. What about a Saturday?

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:37.384
What about introducing technology?

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.603
Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:41.944
to you all I'm a little old.

00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:44.897
So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,

00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:48.795
and when they first came out with those new contraptions,

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:52.465
these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money,

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:56.080
I was like, "There's no way that machine is going to count that money right.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.428
I am never using that, right?"

00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:04.363
So technology has changed. Things have changed.

00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:07.049
Yet not in education. Why?

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.009
Why is it that when we had rotary phones,

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:16.320
when we were having folks being crippled by polio,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.417
that we were teaching

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:21.672
the same way then that we're doing right now?

00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:26.080
And if you come up with a plan to change things,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.341
people consider you radical.

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:30.732
They will say the worst things about you.

00:04:30.732 --> 00:04:34.624
I said one day, well, look, if the science says --

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:38.283
this is science, not me -- that our poorest children

00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:41.593
lose ground in the summertime --

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:43.695
You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:46.372
You look at them in September, they've gone down.

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:50.588
You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75

00:04:50.588 --> 00:04:52.219
when I was at the Ed School at Harvard.

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.109
I said, "Oh, wow, this is an important study."

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:59.119
Because it suggests we should do something.

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:02.684
(Laughter)

00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:05.788
Every 10 years they reproduce the same study.

00:05:05.788 --> 00:05:07.411
It says exactly the same thing:

00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:09.677
Poor kids lose ground in the summertime.

00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:14.510
The system decides you can't run schools in the summer.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.736
You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:20.307
For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.

00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:21.415
I thought I knew something.

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:24.496
They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had —

00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:26.078
but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.

00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:29.360
I never got that. I never got that,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.512
because anyone knows if you farm,

00:05:31.512 --> 00:05:34.587
you don't plant crops in July and August.

00:05:34.587 --> 00:05:37.336
You plant them in the spring.

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:41.105
So who came up with this idea? Who owns it?

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:42.788
Why did we ever do it?

00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:45.086
Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,

00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:48.064
schools were open all year. They were open all year,

00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:51.088
because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.

00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:52.435
They didn't have any place for their kids to go.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.469
It was a perfect place to have schools.

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.360
So this is not something that is ordained

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.354
from the education gods.

00:06:00.354 --> 00:06:02.530
So why don't we? Why don't we?

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.480
Because our business has refused to use science.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.492
Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying,

00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:14.592
"Look, this works, right? We can do this."

00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:19.741
How many places in America are going to change? None.

00:06:19.741 --> 00:06:22.453
None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right?

00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:27.239
Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing.

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:31.784
As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear.

00:06:31.784 --> 00:06:34.079
Here's what we know.

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:40.054
We know that the problem begins immediately.

00:06:40.054 --> 00:06:43.963
Right? This idea, zero to three.

00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:46.449
My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.956
three grown ones and a 15-year-old.

00:06:49.956 --> 00:06:51.443
That's a longer story.

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:53.092
(Laughter)

00:06:53.092 --> 00:06:56.171
With our first kids, we did not know the science

00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:58.011
about brain development.

00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.625
We didn't know how critical those first three years were.

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:03.039
We didn't know what was happening in those young brains.

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.593
We didn't know the role that language,

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:08.484
a stimulus and response, call and response,

00:07:08.484 --> 00:07:11.113
how important that was in developing those children.

00:07:11.113 --> 00:07:15.978
We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.

00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:20.074
Wealthy people know. Educated people know.

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:21.744
And their kids have an advantage.

00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:23.331
Poor people don't know,

00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:26.335
and we're not doing anything to help them at all.

00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:27.680
But we know this is critical.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.410
Now, you take pre-kindergarten.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.480
We know it's important for kids.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.854
Poor kids need that experience.

00:07:36.854 --> 00:07:41.783
Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.

00:07:41.783 --> 00:07:44.331
We know health services matter.

00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.928
You know, we provide health services

00:07:45.928 --> 00:07:48.867
and people are always fussing at me about, you know,

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:52.782
because I'm all into accountability and data

00:07:52.782 --> 00:07:55.976
and all of that good stuff, but we do health services,

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.217
and I have to raise a lot of money.

00:07:57.217 --> 00:07:59.034
People used to say when they'd come fund us,

00:07:59.034 --> 00:08:01.813
"Geoff, why do you provide these health services?"

00:08:01.813 --> 00:08:03.922
I used to make stuff up. Right?

00:08:03.922 --> 00:08:06.473
I'd say, "Well, you know a child

00:08:06.473 --> 00:08:10.226
who has cavities is not going to, uh,

00:08:10.226 --> 00:08:12.286
be able to study as well."

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:16.291
And I had to because I had to raise the money.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:18.843
But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them?

00:08:18.843 --> 00:08:21.585
You know why I provide kids with those health benefits

00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:23.525
and the sports and the recreation and the arts?

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:27.019
Because I actually like kids.

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:32.380
I actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.555
But when they really get pushy, people really get pushy,

00:08:35.555 --> 00:08:38.651
I say, "I do it because you do it for your kid."

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:41.643
And you've never read a study from MIT that says

00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:44.619
giving your kid dance instruction

00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:47.536
is going to help them do algebra better,

00:08:47.536 --> 00:08:49.611
but you will give that kid dance instruction,

00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:53.124
and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction,

00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:56.445
and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids

00:08:56.445 --> 00:09:01.999
have the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children.

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:04.701
(Applause)

00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:07.673
So here's the other thing.

00:09:07.673 --> 00:09:11.540
I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.705
because you work at something, you think it's working,

00:09:13.705 --> 00:09:16.442
and you find out it's not working.

00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:18.308
I mean, you're educators. You work, you say,

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:21.353
you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it.

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.922
But here's the problem with testing.

00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:26.187
The testing that we do --

00:09:26.187 --> 00:09:28.906
we're going to have our test in New York next week —

00:09:28.906 --> 00:09:30.861
is in April.

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:33.787
You know when we're going to get the results back?

00:09:33.787 --> 00:09:36.954
Maybe July, maybe June.

00:09:36.954 --> 00:09:39.762
And the results have great data.

00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:42.839
They'll tell you Raheem really struggled,

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:46.217
couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data,

00:09:46.217 --> 00:09:48.746
but you're getting it back after school is over.

00:09:48.746 --> 00:09:51.229
And so, what do you do?

00:09:51.229 --> 00:09:54.431
You go on vacation. (Laughter)

00:09:54.431 --> 00:09:55.766
You come back from vacation.

00:09:55.766 --> 00:10:01.216
Now you've got all of this test data from last year.

00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:03.569
You don't look at it.

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.832
Why would you look at it?

00:10:05.832 --> 00:10:07.991
You're going to go and teach this year.

00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:11.243
So how much money did we just spend on all of that?

00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:14.246
Billions and billions of dollars

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:17.303
for data that it's too late to use.

00:10:17.303 --> 00:10:19.129
I need that data in September.

00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:20.900
I need that data in November.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.908
I need to know you're struggling, and I need to know

00:10:22.908 --> 00:10:25.293
whether or not what I did corrected that.

00:10:25.293 --> 00:10:27.274
I need to know that this week.

00:10:27.274 --> 00:10:30.853
I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late.

00:10:30.853 --> 00:10:36.043
Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.

00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:39.266
I can predict school scores.

00:10:39.266 --> 00:10:41.311
You take me to any school.

00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:44.369
I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling.

00:10:44.369 --> 00:10:48.184
And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids

00:10:48.184 --> 00:10:50.791
were on grade level.

00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.685
And I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we do

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:53.634
from last year to this year?"

00:10:53.634 --> 00:10:55.449
You say, "We're doing the same thing."

00:10:55.449 --> 00:10:58.204
I'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter)

00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:01.370
This year, somewhere between 44

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.265
and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level.

00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:07.840
And I will be right every single time.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.229
So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what?

00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:14.821
Teachers need real information right now

00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:16.410
about what's happening to their kids.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.803
The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it.

00:11:21.803 --> 00:11:26.637
So here's the other issue that I just think

00:11:26.637 --> 00:11:29.445
we've got to be concerned about.

00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:33.725
We can't stifle innovation in our business.

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:37.618
We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.

00:11:37.618 --> 00:11:39.605
They get angry if you do something different.

00:11:39.605 --> 00:11:41.382
If you try something new, people are always like,

00:11:41.382 --> 00:11:45.879
"Ooh, charter schools." Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:48.240
This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.311
Let's try something different. And here's the rub.

00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:53.403
Some of it's not going to work.

00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:56.141
You know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."

00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:59.609
A lot of them don't. They should be closed.

00:11:59.609 --> 00:12:01.515
I mean, I really believe they should be closed.

00:12:01.515 --> 00:12:05.824
But we can't confuse figuring out the science

00:12:05.824 --> 00:12:10.600
and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.502
Right? Because that's not the way the world works.

00:12:12.502 --> 00:12:14.008
If you think about technology,

00:12:14.008 --> 00:12:16.522
imagine if that's how we thought about technology.

00:12:16.522 --> 00:12:17.819
Every time something didn't work,

00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:20.365
we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.534
You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me --

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:28.059
the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:30.538
They told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot

00:12:30.538 --> 00:12:32.491
you'll never need another thing."

00:12:32.491 --> 00:12:36.932
That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.

00:12:36.932 --> 00:12:40.691
I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.

00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:46.608
Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.

00:12:46.608 --> 00:12:49.112
The folks went out there. They kept inventing.

00:12:49.112 --> 00:12:52.222
The fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you

00:12:52.222 --> 00:12:55.108
from pushing the science forward.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.280
Our job as educators,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.745
there's some stuff we know that we can do.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:03.724
And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier,

00:13:03.724 --> 00:13:06.648
we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.

00:13:06.648 --> 00:13:09.056
We've got to give them all of these opportunities.

00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:12.372
So that we have to do. But this innovation issue,

00:13:12.372 --> 00:13:16.164
this idea that we've got to keep innovating

00:13:16.164 --> 00:13:19.088
until we really nail this science down

00:13:19.088 --> 00:13:21.296
is something that is absolutely critical.

00:13:21.296 --> 00:13:23.520
And this is something, by the way,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.055
that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.

00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:32.334
America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.

00:13:32.334 --> 00:13:35.003
We have run out of time.

00:13:35.003 --> 00:13:38.091
I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff

00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:41.544
that we are walking over right this very second,

00:13:41.544 --> 00:13:45.984
and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness

00:13:45.984 --> 00:13:48.946
about saying we can't afford this —

00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:51.192
So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.

00:13:51.192 --> 00:13:53.752
What is five billion dollars to the United States?

00:13:53.752 --> 00:13:56.425
What did we spend in Afghanistan this year?

00:13:56.425 --> 00:14:00.392
How many trillions? (Applause)

00:14:00.392 --> 00:14:03.416
When the country cares about something,

00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:07.065
we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye.

00:14:07.065 --> 00:14:10.009
When the safety of America is threatened,

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:12.880
we will spend any amount of money.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.936
The real safety of our nation

00:14:15.936 --> 00:14:18.313
is preparing this next generation

00:14:18.313 --> 00:14:20.552
so that they can take our place

00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:24.739
and be the leaders of the world

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:27.936
when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy

00:14:27.936 --> 00:14:30.313
and all that stuff we care about.

00:14:30.313 --> 00:14:34.858
I dare say it's a pittance,

00:14:34.858 --> 00:14:38.543
what it would require for us to really

00:14:38.543 --> 00:14:40.791
begin to solve some of these problems.

00:14:40.791 --> 00:14:46.180
So once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter)

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.975
So, you guys, help me get there.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.304
Thank you all very much. Thank you.

00:14:54.304 --> 00:15:03.627
(Applause)

00:15:03.627 --> 00:15:07.835
John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone?

00:15:07.835 --> 00:15:09.302
Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John,

00:15:09.302 --> 00:15:11.625
100 percent of our kids graduated high school

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:12.776
last year in my school.

00:15:12.776 --> 00:15:14.244
A hundred percent of them went to college.

00:15:14.244 --> 00:15:17.634
This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school.

00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:20.696
Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college.

00:15:20.696 --> 00:15:23.310
We'd better get that other seven percent.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:30.005
So that's just how this goes. (Applause)

00:15:30.005 --> 00:15:32.598
JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school?

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:35.187
GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems

00:15:35.187 --> 00:15:37.629
we have in this country is these kids, the same kids,

00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:39.558
these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,

00:15:39.558 --> 00:15:40.900
they drop out in record numbers.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.565
And so we've figured out that you've got to really design

00:15:44.565 --> 00:15:47.989
a network of support for these kids that in many ways

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:50.454
mimics what a good parent does.

00:15:50.454 --> 00:15:53.551
They harass you, right? They call you, they say,

00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:55.662
"I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?

00:15:55.662 --> 00:15:58.625
What are you talking about that you want to leave school?

00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.915
And you're not coming back here."

00:15:59.915 --> 00:16:02.170
So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.501
because Geoff is looking for you.

00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:06.804
They're like, "I really can't come back." No. You'd better stay in school.

00:16:06.804 --> 00:16:09.630
But I'm not kidding about some of this,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.426
and it gets a little bit to the grit issue.

00:16:11.426 --> 00:16:15.620
When kids know that you refuse to let them fail,

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.524
it puts a different pressure on them,

00:16:17.524 --> 00:16:19.212
and they don't give up as easy.

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:21.654
So sometimes they don't have it inside,

00:16:21.654 --> 00:16:23.700
and they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.053
but I know my mother's going to be mad."

00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:29.782
Well, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through.

00:16:29.782 --> 00:16:33.591
We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring

00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:37.526
and help and support, but also a set of encouragements

00:16:37.526 --> 00:16:40.136
that say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard,

00:16:40.136 --> 00:16:42.194
but we refuse to let you fail."

00:16:42.194 --> 00:16:43.774
JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada.

00:16:43.774 --> 00:16:45.438
Please give it up for him one more time.

00:16:45.438 --> 00:16:50.439
(Applause)
