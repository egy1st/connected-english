00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.930
When I was 27 years old,

00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:06.277
I left a very demanding job
in management consulting

00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.058
for a job that was even more
demanding: teaching.

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:13.778
I went to teach seventh graders math

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.702
in the New York City public schools.

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:19.083
And like any teacher,
I made quizzes and tests.

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:21.083
I gave out homework assignments.

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:23.829
When the work came back,
I calculated grades.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:29.310
What struck me was that IQ
was not the only difference

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:32.470
between my best and my worst students.

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:37.784
Some of my strongest performers
did not have stratospheric IQ scores.

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:41.583
Some of my smartest kids
weren't doing so well.

00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:43.694
And that got me thinking.

00:00:44.432 --> 00:00:47.392
The kinds of things you need
to learn in seventh grade math,

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:52.318
sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals,
the area of a parallelogram.

00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:55.344
But these concepts are not impossible,

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:59.478
and I was firmly convinced
that every one of my students

00:00:59.502 --> 00:01:02.082
could learn the material

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:04.169
if they worked hard and long enough.

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.304
After several more years of teaching,

00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:11.062
I came to the conclusion
that what we need in education

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:14.546
is a much better understanding
of students and learning

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.887
from a motivational perspective,

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.117
from a psychological perspective.

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:25.308
In education, the one thing
we know how to measure best is IQ.

00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:30.024
But what if doing
well in school and in life

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.142
depends on much more

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.546
than your ability to learn
quickly and easily?

00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:38.297
So I left the classroom,

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:41.312
and I went to graduate school
to become a psychologist.

00:01:41.877 --> 00:01:44.027
I started studying kids and adults

00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:46.884
in all kinds of super
challenging settings,

00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:49.336
and in every study my question was,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.606
who is successful here and why?

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:55.977
My research team and I went
to West Point Military Academy.

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:58.136
We tried to predict which cadets

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.668
would stay in military training
and which would drop out.

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:04.645
We went to the National Spelling Bee

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:09.208
and tried to predict which children
would advance farthest in competition.

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:13.923
We studied rookie teachers
working in really tough neighborhoods,

00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:17.364
asking which teachers are still
going to be here in teaching

00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:19.382
by the end of the school year,

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:22.417
and of those, who will be
the most effective

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:25.125
at improving learning
outcomes for their students?

00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:27.822
We partnered with private
companies, asking,

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:30.541
which of these salespeople
is going to keep their jobs?

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:32.431
And who's going to earn the most money?

00:02:32.797 --> 00:02:35.455
In all those very different contexts,

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.980
one characteristic emerged
as a significant predictor of success.

00:02:40.464 --> 00:02:42.242
And it wasn't social intelligence.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:45.647
It wasn't good looks, physical health,

00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:46.989
and it wasn't IQ.

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:48.874
It was grit.

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:54.529
Grit is passion and perseverance
for very long-term goals.

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.660
Grit is having stamina.

00:02:57.232 --> 00:03:01.438
Grit is sticking with your future,
day in, day out,

00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:04.827
not just for the week,
not just for the month,

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.383
but for years,

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:10.128
and working really hard
to make that future a reality.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.238
Grit is living life
like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:17.587
A few years ago,

00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:20.625
I started studying grit
in the Chicago public schools.

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:23.429
I asked thousands of high school juniors

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.281
to take grit questionnaires,

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.257
and then waited around more than a year

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.637
to see who would graduate.

00:03:29.518 --> 00:03:31.740
Turns out that grittier kids

00:03:31.764 --> 00:03:34.944
were significantly more
likely to graduate,

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:38.730
even when I matched them
on every characteristic I could measure,

00:03:38.754 --> 00:03:41.004
things like family income,

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:43.750
standardized achievement test scores,

00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:46.798
even how safe kids felt
when they were at school.

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:50.314
So it's not just at West Point
or the National Spelling Bee

00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:51.452
that grit matters.

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:53.417
It's also in school,

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.822
especially for kids
at risk for dropping out.

00:03:57.116 --> 00:04:00.074
To me, the most shocking thing about grit

00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:02.057
is how little we know,

00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.583
how little science knows,
about building it.

00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:07.254
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,

00:04:07.278 --> 00:04:09.478
"How do I build grit in kids?

00:04:09.502 --> 00:04:12.419
What do I do to teach kids
a solid work ethic?

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:15.241
How do I keep them motivated
for the long run?"

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.835
The honest answer is,

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:18.936
I don't know.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.435
(Laughter)

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.498
What I do know is that talent
doesn't make you gritty.

00:04:23.522 --> 00:04:25.853
Our data show very clearly

00:04:25.877 --> 00:04:28.290
that there are many talented individuals

00:04:28.314 --> 00:04:31.433
who simply do not follow through
on their commitments.

00:04:31.814 --> 00:04:36.028
In fact, in our data,
grit is usually unrelated

00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:39.173
or even inversely related
to measures of talent.

00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:44.560
So far, the best idea I've heard
about building grit in kids

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.806
is something called "growth mindset."

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.119
This is an idea developed
at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,

00:04:51.143 --> 00:04:56.241
and it is the belief that the ability
to learn is not fixed,

00:04:56.265 --> 00:04:58.732
that it can change with your effort.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.759
Dr. Dweck has shown

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:03.918
that when kids read
and learn about the brain

00:05:03.942 --> 00:05:07.416
and how it changes and grows
in response to challenge,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.437
they're much more likely
to persevere when they fail,

00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:16.070
because they don't believe that failure
is a permanent condition.

00:05:17.052 --> 00:05:20.182
So growth mindset
is a great idea for building grit.

00:05:20.724 --> 00:05:22.261
But we need more.

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:24.921
And that's where I'm going
to end my remarks,

00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:26.291
because that's where we are.

00:05:26.315 --> 00:05:28.480
That's the work that stands before us.

00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:32.384
We need to take our best ideas,
our strongest intuitions,

00:05:32.408 --> 00:05:34.043
and we need to test them.

00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:37.223
We need to measure
whether we've been successful,

00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:40.953
and we have to be willing
to fail, to be wrong,

00:05:40.977 --> 00:05:43.615
to start over again with lessons learned.

00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:47.280
In other words, we need to be gritty

00:05:47.304 --> 00:05:49.773
about getting our kids grittier.

00:05:50.177 --> 00:05:51.209
Thank you.

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:54.068
(Applause)
