00:00:01.615 --> 00:00:04.115
So I grew up in East Los Angeles,

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:06.286
not even realizing I was poor.

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:10.403
My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.

00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:11.702
Everyone knew who I was,

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:15.152
so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected,

00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:17.721
and even though my dad spent most of my life

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:19.070
in and out of jail,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.571
I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.

00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:25.080
She worked at the local high school

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.635
as a secretary in the dean's office,

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:30.325
so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class,

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:33.163
for whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.

00:00:33.163 --> 00:00:36.954
Man, her office was packed.

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:40.751
So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with

00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:42.309
outside of school,

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.226
and sometimes we're just not ready to focus.

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:47.556
But that doesn't mean that we can't.

00:00:47.556 --> 00:00:49.743
It just takes a little bit more.

00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:52.848
Like, I remember one day I found my dad

00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:55.192
convulsing, foaming at the mouth,

00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:57.406
OD-ing on the bathroom floor.

00:00:57.406 --> 00:00:59.879
Really, do you think that doing my homework that night

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.391
was at the top of my priority list?

00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:03.858
Not so much.

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:06.991
But I really needed a support network,

00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:09.316
a group of people who were going to help me

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:11.536
make sure that I wasn't going to be

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:14.191
a victim of my own circumstance,

00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:15.805
that they were going to push me

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:18.370
beyond what I even thought I could do.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.839
I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day,

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:25.584
who were going to say, "You can move beyond that."

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:28.862
And unfortunately, the local junior high

00:01:28.862 --> 00:01:30.971
was not going to offer that.

00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:34.805
It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate.

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:37.978
So my mom said, "You're going on a bus

00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:43.191
an hour and a half away from where we live every day."

00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:45.553
So for the next two years, that's what I did.

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:50.040
I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.965
And eventually, I ended up at a school

00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:54.529
where there was a mixture.

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:57.207
There were some people who were really gang-affiliated,

00:01:57.207 --> 00:01:58.672
and then there were those of us

00:01:58.672 --> 00:02:00.666
really trying to make it to high school.

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:04.169
Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:05.883
You had to survive.

00:02:05.883 --> 00:02:08.536
You just had to do things sometimes.

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.889
So there were a lot of teachers who were like,

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.315
"She's never going to make it.

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:13.906
She has an issue with authority.

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:15.549
She's not going to go anywhere."

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.642
Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:22.809
But then, they were very surprised

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.000
when I graduated from high school.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.862
I was accepted to Pepperdine University,

00:02:28.862 --> 00:02:31.985
and I came back to the same school that I attended

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.896
to be a special ed assistant.

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:38.449
And then I told them, "I want to be a teacher."

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.673
And boy, they were like, "What? Why?

00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:43.193
Why would you want to do that?"

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:45.479
So I began my teaching career

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.007
at the exact same middle school that I attended,

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:52.438
and I really wanted to try to save more kids

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.515
who were just like me.

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:57.715
And so every year, I share my background with my kids,

00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:00.772
because they need to know that everyone has a story,

00:03:00.772 --> 00:03:03.139
everyone has a struggle,

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.893
and everyone needs help along the way.

00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:11.021
And I am going to be their help along the way.

00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:17.089
So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:19.735
I had a kid one day come into my class

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:22.943
having been stabbed the night before.

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:25.439
I was like, "You need to go to a hospital,

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.714
the school nurse, something."

00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:30.875
He's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.643
I need to be in class because I need to graduate."

00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:37.035
So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim

00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:38.812
of his circumstance,

00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:42.850
but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.740
And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.856
and getting to know exactly what they're going through,

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:54.112
getting to know their families -- I wanted that,

00:03:54.112 --> 00:03:59.592
but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids,

00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:03.066
and teachers turning over year after year after year.

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:07.118
How do you get to build those relationships?

00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:10.705
So we created a new school.

00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:12.184
And we created

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:15.722
the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:19.194
And we made sure that we were still attached

00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:23.232
to our school district for funding, for support.

00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:26.349
But with that, we were going to gain freedom:

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.602
freedom to hire the teachers

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:31.924
that we knew were going to be effective;

00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:34.664
freedom to control the curriculum

00:04:34.664 --> 00:04:40.302
so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no;

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:43.022
and freedom to control a budget,

00:04:43.022 --> 00:04:45.606
to spend money where it matters,

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:49.847
not how a district or a state says you have to do it.

00:04:49.847 --> 00:04:52.150
We wanted those freedoms.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.726
But now, shifting an entire paradigm,

00:04:54.726 --> 00:04:58.871
it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:01.221
But we had to do it.

00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:05.342
Our community deserved a new way of doing things.

00:05:05.342 --> 00:05:08.868
And as the very first pilot middle school

00:05:08.868 --> 00:05:12.093
in all of Los Angeles Unified School District,

00:05:12.093 --> 00:05:15.069
you better believe there was some opposition.

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.192
And it was out of fear --

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.415
fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?

00:05:20.415 --> 00:05:22.600
Yeah, what if we get it wrong?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.854
But what if we get it right?

00:05:24.854 --> 00:05:26.929
And we did.

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:29.540
So even though teachers were against it

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.121
because we employ one-year contracts --

00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:36.190
you can't teach, or you don't want to teach,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.250
you don't get to be at my school with my kids.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:46.014
(Applause)

00:05:46.014 --> 00:05:49.686
So in our third year, how did we do it?

00:05:49.686 --> 00:05:53.117
Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.

00:05:53.117 --> 00:05:55.878
We make our kids feel like they matter to us.

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:59.766
We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them,

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:02.351
and they use all the technology that they're used to.

00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:05.278
Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it, they have it.

00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:09.196
Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:13.009
And because we connect it to what they're doing â€”

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.211
For example, they made public service announcements

00:06:16.211 --> 00:06:17.837
for the Cancer Society.

00:06:17.837 --> 00:06:20.661
These were played in the local trolley system.

00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.668
Teaching elements of persuasion,

00:06:22.668 --> 00:06:25.588
it doesn't get any more real than that.

00:06:25.588 --> 00:06:27.749
Our state test scores have gone up

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:30.738
more than 80 points since we've become our own school.

00:06:30.738 --> 00:06:33.833
But it's taken all stakeholders, working together --

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:37.016
teachers and principals on one-year contracts,

00:06:37.017 --> 00:06:40.841
working over and above and beyond their contract hours

00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:43.877
without compensation.

00:06:43.877 --> 00:06:46.096
And it takes a school board member

00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:48.048
who is going to lobby for you and say,

00:06:48.048 --> 00:06:50.476
"Know, the district is trying to impose this,

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:53.509
but you have the freedom to do otherwise."

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.073
And it takes an active parent center

00:06:56.073 --> 00:07:00.153
who is not only there, showing a presence every day,

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:03.020
but who is part of our governance,

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.024
making decisions for their kids, our kids.

00:07:08.024 --> 00:07:10.629
Because why should our students have to go

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:13.608
so far away from where they live?

00:07:13.608 --> 00:07:17.332
They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood,

00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:20.505
a school that they can be proud to say they attend,

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:24.173
and a school that the community can be proud of as well,

00:07:24.173 --> 00:07:28.371
and they need teachers to fight for them every day

00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:33.704
and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.

00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:36.420
Because it's time that kids like me

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.142
stop being the exception, and we become the norm.

00:07:41.142 --> 00:07:42.451
Thank you.

00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:46.790
(Applause)
