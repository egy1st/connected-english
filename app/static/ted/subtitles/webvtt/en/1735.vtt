WEBVTT

00:00:01.286 --> 00:00:05.774
In this talk today, I want to present a different idea

00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:09.995
for why investing in early childhood education

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:12.694
makes sense as a public investment.

00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.932
It's a different idea, because usually,

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:16.305
when people talk about early childhood programs,

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:19.646
they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants

00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:22.928
in terms of former participants, in preschool,

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:25.193
they have better K-12 test scores,

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:27.308
better adult earnings.

00:00:27.308 --> 00:00:29.423
Now that's all very important,

00:00:29.423 --> 00:00:33.519
but what I want to talk about is what preschool does

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.341
for state economies

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.638
and for promoting state economic development.

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.931
And that's actually crucial

00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.255
because if we're going to get increased investment

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:47.598
in early childhood programs,

00:00:47.598 --> 00:00:51.121
we need to interest state governments in this.

00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:53.347
The federal government has a lot on its plate,

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:55.845
and state governments are going to have to step up.

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:58.028
So we have to appeal to them,

00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:00.581
the legislators in the state government,

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.571
and turn to something they understand,

00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:04.869
that they have to promote the economic development

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.556
of their state economy.

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:08.372
Now, by promoting economic development,

00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:10.086
I don't mean anything magical.

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:13.549
All I mean is, is that early childhood education

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.452
can bring more and better jobs to a state

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:20.630
and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.580
for the state's residents.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.573
Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:28.577
state and local economic development,

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:32.359
they don't generally think first about what they're doing

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.914
about childcare and early childhood programs.

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:38.817
I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:40.440
I've talked to a lot of directors

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.768
of state economic development agencies about these issues,

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:45.310
a lot of legislators about these issues.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.369
When legislators and others think about economic development,

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.625
what they first of all think about are business tax incentives,

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:54.503
property tax abatements, job creation tax credits,

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:57.190
you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.796
So for example, states compete very vigorously

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:03.461
to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.

00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.601
They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.799
Now, those programs can make sense

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.801
if they in fact induce new location decisions,

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:12.186
and the way they can make sense is,

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:14.499
by creating more and better jobs,

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:18.082
they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.

00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:20.152
So there is a benefit to state residents

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:22.301
that corresponds to the costs that they're paying

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:24.574
by paying for these business tax breaks.

00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:28.382
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:32.107
can do exactly the same thing,

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:36.016
create more and better jobs, but in a different way.

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:38.434
It's a somewhat more indirect way.

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:42.080
These programs can promote more and better jobs by,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.955
you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool,

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:48.773
it develops the skills of your local workforce

00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:52.516
if enough of them stick around, and, in turn,

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:54.669
that higher-quality local workforce

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:59.361
will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:01.869
higher earnings per capita in the local community.

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.833
Now, let me turn to some numbers on this.

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:09.416
Okay. If you look at the research evidence --

00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:14.079
that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.676
affect the educational attainment, wages and skills

00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:22.185
of former participants in preschool as adults,

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.821
you take those known effects,

00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.509
you take how many of those folks will be expected

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:31.210
to stick around the state or local economy and not move out,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.030
and you take research on how much skills

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.201
drive job creation, you will conclude,

00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.244
from these three separate lines of research,

00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:44.323
that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs,

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:47.776
the per capita earnings of state residents

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:50.542
go up by two dollars and 78 cents,

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:52.409
so that's a three-to-one return.

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.442
Now you can get much higher returns,

00:03:55.442 --> 00:03:59.516
of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits,

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:04.230
if you include benefits to former preschool participants

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.414
who move to some other state,

00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:09.425
but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:11.512
because this is salient and important

00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:13.802
to state legislators and state policy makers,

00:04:13.802 --> 00:04:15.946
and it's the states that are going to have to act.

00:04:15.946 --> 00:04:19.245
So there is this key benefit that is relevant

00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:22.494
to state policy makers in terms of economic development.

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:25.912
Now, one objection you often hear,

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:30.809
or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is,

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:35.272
why should I pay more taxes

00:04:35.272 --> 00:04:39.550
to invest in other people's children?

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.044
What's in it for me?

00:04:42.044 --> 00:04:44.323
And the trouble with that objection,

00:04:44.323 --> 00:04:48.325
it reflects a total misunderstanding

00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:51.342
of how much local economies

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:54.848
involve everyone being interdependent.

00:04:54.848 --> 00:04:58.765
Specifically, the interdependency here is, is that

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:02.298
there are huge spillovers of skills --

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:07.618
that when other people's children get more skills,

00:05:07.618 --> 00:05:11.387
that actually increases the prosperity of everyone,

00:05:11.387 --> 00:05:14.741
including people whose skills don't change.

00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.145
So for example, numerous research studies have shown

00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:19.724
if you look at what really drives

00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:22.188
the growth rate of metropolitan areas,

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:27.858
it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages;

00:05:27.858 --> 00:05:31.481
it's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills

00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:35.016
that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.

00:05:35.016 --> 00:05:38.095
So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas

00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:41.608
such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul,

00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:46.944
Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically

00:05:46.944 --> 00:05:49.253
because they're low-cost.

00:05:49.253 --> 00:05:51.178
I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.

00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:53.995
It's not exactly a low-cost proposition.

00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:59.940
They are growing because they have high levels of skills.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.095
So when we invest in other people's children,

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:07.280
and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.801
of a metro area.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:12.689
As another example, if we look

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.924
at what determines an individual's wages,

00:06:15.924 --> 00:06:20.149
and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages,

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:24.672
we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part,

00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:27.103
on that individual's education,

00:06:27.103 --> 00:06:30.096
for example whether or not they have a college degree.

00:06:30.096 --> 00:06:33.434
One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition,

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:37.481
we find that even once we hold constant, statistically,

00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:40.385
the effect of your own education,

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:43.585
the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:45.557
also affects your wages.

00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:49.761
So specifically, if you hold constant your education,

00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:53.864
you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area,

00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:57.824
you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages

00:06:57.824 --> 00:07:01.294
without changing your education at all.

00:07:01.294 --> 00:07:04.445
In fact, this effect is so strong

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:08.258
that when someone gets a college degree,

00:07:08.258 --> 00:07:10.699
the spillover effects of this on the wages

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:12.592
of others in the metropolitan area

00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:15.694
are actually greater than the direct effects.

00:07:15.694 --> 00:07:19.147
So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:22.462
go up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.

00:07:22.462 --> 00:07:24.977
There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:28.840
of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.256
and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person,

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:35.688
but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area,

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:39.314
you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else

00:07:39.314 --> 00:07:42.227
in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.

00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:44.305
That's actually greater than the direct benefits

00:07:44.305 --> 00:07:47.359
of the person choosing to get education.

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:48.718
Now, what's going on here?

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.641
What can explain these huge spillover effects of education?

00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:54.115
Well, let's think about it this way.

00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:57.438
I can be the most skilled person in the world,

00:07:57.438 --> 00:08:01.239
but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills,

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:04.208
my employer is going to find it more difficult

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:08.264
to introduce new technology, new production techniques.

00:08:08.264 --> 00:08:11.866
So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:15.467
They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.

00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:19.148
Even if everyone at my firm has good skills,

00:08:19.148 --> 00:08:22.656
if the workers at the suppliers to my firm

00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:24.626
do not have good skills,

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:27.023
my firm is going to be less competitive

00:08:27.023 --> 00:08:29.408
competing in national and international markets.

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:32.502
And again, the firm that's less competitive

00:08:32.502 --> 00:08:35.191
will not be able to pay as good wages,

00:08:35.191 --> 00:08:39.324
and then, particularly in high-tech businesses,

00:08:39.324 --> 00:08:42.585
they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:45.805
So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley

00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:49.600
has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.019
but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:57.553
So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children

00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:59.955
through preschool and other early childhood programs

00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:03.611
that are high-quality, we not only help those children,

00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:07.232
we help everyone in the metropolitan area

00:09:07.232 --> 00:09:10.903
gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area

00:09:10.903 --> 00:09:12.925
gain in job growth.

00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:15.456
Another objection used sometimes here

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:17.684
to invest in early childhood programs

00:09:17.684 --> 00:09:21.405
is concern about people moving out.

00:09:21.405 --> 00:09:25.640
So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.884
in more preschool education

00:09:27.884 --> 00:09:31.694
for children in Columbus, Ohio,

00:09:31.694 --> 00:09:33.953
but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will,

00:09:33.953 --> 00:09:36.870
for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.387
and become Wolverines.

00:09:38.387 --> 00:09:41.681
And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:44.122
in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried

00:09:44.122 --> 00:09:47.357
these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.

00:09:47.357 --> 00:09:51.349
And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.

00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:54.290
Well, the reality is, if you look at the data,

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.503
Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.

00:09:58.503 --> 00:10:03.623
The data is that over 60 percent of Americans

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:06.061
spend most of their working careers

00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:09.831
in the state they were born in, over 60 percent.

00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:13.926
That percentage does not vary much from state to state.

00:10:13.926 --> 00:10:17.030
It doesn't vary much with the state's economy,

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.828
whether it's depressed or booming,

00:10:18.828 --> 00:10:21.149
it doesn't vary much over time.

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:26.962
So the reality is, if you invest in kids,

00:10:26.962 --> 00:10:29.461
they will stay.

00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.499
Or at least, enough of them will stay

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:35.920
that it will pay off for your state economy.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.844
Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence

00:10:39.844 --> 00:10:42.998
that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way,

00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:45.854
pay off in higher adult skills.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.421
There's a lot of research evidence

00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:51.045
that those folks will stick around the state economy,

00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:54.362
and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.452
with higher skills in your local economy

00:10:56.452 --> 00:11:00.131
pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy,

00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:03.574
and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar,

00:11:03.574 --> 00:11:06.303
we get about three dollars back

00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:08.478
in benefits for the state economy.

00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:12.090
So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.914
and the logic of this is compelling.

00:11:14.914 --> 00:11:18.604
So what are the barriers to getting it done?

00:11:18.604 --> 00:11:21.868
Well, one obvious barrier is cost.

00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:26.198
So if you look at what it would cost

00:11:26.198 --> 00:11:29.025
if every state government invested

00:11:29.025 --> 00:11:33.230
in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.645
the total annual national cost would be roughly

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:38.950
30 billion dollars.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.375
So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:45.120
On the other hand, if you reflect on

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.980
that the U.S.'s population is over 300 million,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.663
we're talking about an amount of money

00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:54.283
that amounts to 100 dollars per capita.

00:11:54.283 --> 00:11:57.261
Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person,

00:11:57.261 --> 00:12:01.266
is something that any state government can afford to do.

00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:06.015
It's just a simple matter of political will to do it.

00:12:06.015 --> 00:12:07.895
And, of course, as I mentioned,

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:10.049
this cost has corresponding benefits.

00:12:10.049 --> 00:12:12.225
I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three,

00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:14.325
2.78, for the state economy,

00:12:14.325 --> 00:12:17.354
in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.

00:12:17.354 --> 00:12:20.378
And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars

00:12:20.378 --> 00:12:22.271
to something that might mean something,

00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:25.859
what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid,

00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:28.976
that would increase earnings by about 10 percent

00:12:28.976 --> 00:12:32.175
over their whole career, just doing the preschool,

00:12:32.175 --> 00:12:34.690
not improving K-12 or anything else after that,

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.238
not doing anything with college tuition or access,

00:12:37.238 --> 00:12:39.934
just directly improving preschool,

00:12:39.934 --> 00:12:42.233
and we would get five percent higher earnings

00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:43.629
for middle-class kids.

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.694
So this is an investment

00:12:45.694 --> 00:12:48.602
that pays off in very concrete terms

00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:53.022
for a broad range of income groups in the state's population

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:57.532
and produces large and tangible benefits.

00:12:57.532 --> 00:13:00.086
Now, that's one barrier.

00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:03.508
I actually think the more profound barrier

00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:07.938
is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.

00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:10.784
So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing

00:13:10.784 --> 00:13:12.539
the quality of our local workforce,

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:15.205
and thereby increasing economic development.

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:18.585
Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds,

00:13:18.585 --> 00:13:20.953
we're not sending these kids out at age five

00:13:20.953 --> 00:13:24.468
to work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.

00:13:24.468 --> 00:13:27.880
So we're talking about an investment

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.350
that in terms of impacts on the state economy

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.311
is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years,

00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:37.169
and of course America is notorious for being

00:13:37.169 --> 00:13:40.176
a short term-oriented society.

00:13:40.176 --> 00:13:41.836
Now one response you can make to this,

00:13:41.836 --> 00:13:43.361
and I sometimes have done this in talks,

00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:46.438
is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs

00:13:46.438 --> 00:13:50.085
in reducing special ed and remedial education costs,

00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:52.391
there are benefits, parents care about preschool,

00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:54.641
maybe we'll get some migration effects

00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:56.959
from parents seeking good preschool,

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.606
and I think those are true,

00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.768
but in some sense they're missing the point.

00:14:00.768 --> 00:14:03.339
Ultimately, this is something

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:07.264
we're investing in now for the future.

00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:11.213
And so what I want to leave you with is

00:14:11.213 --> 00:14:13.519
what I think is the ultimate question.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.353
I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately

00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:21.898
not an economic question, it's a moral question:

00:14:21.898 --> 00:14:26.105
Are we willing, as Americans,

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:29.555
are we as a society still capable

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:34.339
of making the political choice to sacrifice now

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:36.988
by paying more taxes

00:14:36.988 --> 00:14:42.193
in order to improve the long-term future

00:14:42.193 --> 00:14:45.610
of not only our kids, but our community?

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:50.057
Are we still capable of that as a country?

00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:52.498
And that's something that each and every citizen

00:14:52.498 --> 00:14:55.041
and voter needs to ask themselves.

00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:57.986
Is that something that you are still invested in,

00:14:57.986 --> 00:15:00.720
that you still believe in the notion of investment?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.119
That is the notion of investment.

00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:04.693
You sacrifice now for a return later.

00:15:04.693 --> 00:15:08.331
So I think the research evidence

00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:10.969
on the benefits of early childhood programs

00:15:10.969 --> 00:15:14.576
for the local economy is extremely strong.

00:15:14.576 --> 00:15:18.858
However, the moral and political choice

00:15:18.858 --> 00:15:23.962
is still up to us, as citizens and as voters.

00:15:23.962 --> 00:15:27.985
Thank you very much. (Applause)
