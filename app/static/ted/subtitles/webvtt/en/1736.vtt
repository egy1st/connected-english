00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:02.810
Growing up in Taiwan

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.422
as the daughter of a calligrapher,

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:06.790
one of my most treasured memories

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.883
was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:12.516
and the form of Chinese characters.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:15.023
Ever since then, I was fascinated

00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:17.685
by this incredible language.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.420
But to an outsider, it seems to be

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.929
as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.304
Over the past few years, I've been wondering

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:28.356
if I can break down this wall,

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.950
so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.858
the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.

00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:39.170
I started thinking about how a new, fast method

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.018
of learning Chinese might be useful.

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:46.004
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.009
every single stroke for each character

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:51.553
in the correct sequence.

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:53.610
I learned new characters every day

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.337
during the course of the next 15 years.

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:58.457
Since we only have five minutes,

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:02.092
it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.

00:01:02.092 --> 00:01:05.617
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.

00:01:05.617 --> 00:01:10.729
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.745
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:17.641
40 percent of basic literature --

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:20.517
enough to read road signs, restaurant menus,

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:23.521
to understand the basic idea of the web pages

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.460
or the newspapers.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.659
Today I'm going to start with eight

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.551
to show you how the method works.

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:31.472
You are ready?

00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:34.155
Open your mouth as wide as possible

00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:36.201
until it's square.

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.883
You get a mouth.

00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:41.971
This is a person going for a walk.

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:45.102
Person.

00:01:45.102 --> 00:01:47.811
If the shape of the fire is a person

00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:50.081
with two arms on both sides,

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:52.251
as if she was yelling frantically,

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:55.804
"Help! I'm on fire!" --

00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:59.971
This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,

00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:03.784
but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.

00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:06.043
This is a tree.

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.141
Tree.

00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:12.566
This is a mountain.

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:15.167
The sun.

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:22.112
The moon.

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:24.087
The symbol of the door

00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:29.793
looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.

00:02:29.793 --> 00:02:33.531
I call these eight characters radicals.

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.297
They are the building blocks

00:02:35.297 --> 00:02:39.427
for you to create lots more characters.

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:41.165
A person.

00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:45.433
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow."

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:47.561
As the old saying goes,

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:51.287
two is company, three is a crowd.

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:54.202
If a person stretched their arms wide,

00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:58.849
this person is saying, "It was this big."

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.697
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.

00:03:02.697 --> 00:03:08.543
He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.

00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:12.037
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.

00:03:12.037 --> 00:03:15.593
Three trees together, we create the forest.

00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:19.665
Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:23.800
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter)

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.881
Easy to remember,

00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:30.823
since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.

00:03:30.823 --> 00:03:32.865
Remember fire?

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:35.526
Two fires together, I get really hot.

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:38.385
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:42.986
Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:46.078
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.

00:03:46.078 --> 00:03:48.257
Two suns together, prosperous.

00:03:48.257 --> 00:03:50.615
Three together, that's sparkles.

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:52.636
Put the sun and the moon shining together,

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:53.944
it's brightness.

00:03:53.944 --> 00:03:58.169
It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.652
The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:05.755
A door. Put a plank inside the door,

00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:07.812
it's a door bolt.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:10.776
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:14.107
Knock knock. Is anyone home?

00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:16.995
This person is sneaking out of a door,

00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:19.827
escaping, evading.

00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:21.980
On the left, we have a woman.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.142
Two women together, they have an argument.

00:04:24.142 --> 00:04:26.275
(Laughter)

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:32.793
Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.

00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:36.302
So we have gone through almost 30 characters.

00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:39.639
By using this method, the first eight radicals

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.640
will allow you to build 32.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.403
The next group of eight characters

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:45.595
will build an extra 32.

00:04:45.595 --> 00:04:47.897
So with very little effort,

00:04:47.897 --> 00:04:50.163
you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,

00:04:50.163 --> 00:04:52.715
which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.

00:04:52.715 --> 00:04:56.262
So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:58.959
For example, the mountain and the fire together,

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.887
we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.

00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:05.207
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.

00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:08.625
This is a sun placed with the origin,

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:11.752
because Japan lies to the east of China.

00:05:11.752 --> 00:05:15.642
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:18.600
A person behind Japan, what do we get?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.702
A Japanese person.

00:05:21.702 --> 00:05:24.503
The character on the left is two mountains

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:26.610
stacked on top of each other.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.827
In ancient China, that means in exile,

00:05:29.827 --> 00:05:32.265
because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.636
in exile beyond mountains.

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:39.647
Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.

00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:42.218
A mouth which tells you where to get out

00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:44.146
is an exit.

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:47.787
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking

00:05:47.787 --> 00:05:49.670
and get off of the stage. Thank you.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.639
(Applause)
