00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.607
At 7:45 a.m., I open the doors to a building

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:12.515
dedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:16.725
I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.922
by regular janitors,

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:24.094
but I never have the decency to honor their names.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:27.262
Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:29.813
when teenage girls wear clothes that covers

00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:34.652
their insecurities but exposes everything else.

00:00:34.652 --> 00:00:38.470
Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.312
camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:43.671
but need hugs.

00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:46.939
Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:50.605
Oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:52.874
but never learn to swim,

00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:55.016
part like the Red Sea when the bell rings.

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:57.794
This is a training ground.

00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:00.101
My high school is Chicago,

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.362
diverse and segregated on purpose.

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:06.875
Social lines are barbed wire.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:12.131
Labels like "Regulars" and "Honors" resonate.

00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:16.515
I am an Honors but go home with Regular students

00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:19.883
who are soldiers in territory that owns them.

00:01:19.883 --> 00:01:23.537
This is a training ground to sort out the Regulars

00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:25.795
from the Honors, a reoccurring cycle

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:29.581
built to recycle the trash of this system.

00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:32.575
Trained at a young age to capitalize,

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:35.579
letters taught now that capitalism raises you

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.428
but you have to step on someone else to get there.

00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:41.621
This is a training ground where one group

00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:44.528
is taught to lead and the other is made to follow.

00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:47.163
No wonder so many of my people spit bars,

00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:50.027
because the truth is hard to swallow.

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:54.296
The need for degrees has left so many people frozen.

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:56.436
Homework is stressful,

00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:59.036
but when you go home every day and your home is work,

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.013
you don't want to pick up any assignments.

00:02:01.013 --> 00:02:02.987
Reading textbooks is stressful,

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:05.243
but reading does not matter when you feel

00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:07.299
your story is already written,

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.375
either dead or getting booked.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:12.200
Taking tests is stressful,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.788
but bubbling in a Scantron does not stop

00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:16.979
bullets from bursting.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.564
I hear education systems are failing,

00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:24.106
but I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do --

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:26.244
to train you, to keep you on track,

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:29.550
to track down an American dream that has failed

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.484
so many of us all.

00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:40.770
(Applause)
