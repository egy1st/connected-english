WEBVTT

00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:03.802
Thank you very much.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:09.506
I moved to America 12 years ago
with my wife Terry and our two kids.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.316
Actually, truthfully, we moved
to Los Angeles --

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.764
(Laughter)

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:18.122
thinking we were moving
to America, but anyway --

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:20.081
(Laughter)

00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:25.085
It's a short plane ride
from Los Angeles to America.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.751
(Laughter)

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:29.035
I got here 12 years ago,

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.845
and when I got here,
I was told various things,

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:35.916
like, "Americans don't get irony."

00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:38.768
(Laughter)

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.014
Have you come across this idea?

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:42.197
It's not true.

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:44.983
I've traveled the whole length
and breadth of this country.

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.633
I have found no evidence
that Americans don't get irony.

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:50.234
It's one of those cultural myths,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.146
like, "The British are reserved."

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.369
(Laughter)

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.099
I don't know why people think this.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.942
We've invaded every country
we've encountered.

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.250
(Laughter)

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:05.102
But it's not true Americans
don't get irony,

00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:07.598
but I just want you to know
that that's what people

00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:09.432
are saying about you behind your back.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:12.392
You know, so when you leave
living rooms in Europe,

00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:15.623
people say, thankfully,
nobody was ironic in your presence.

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:17.034
(Laughter)

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:19.595
But I knew that Americans get irony

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.344
when I came across that legislation,
"No Child Left Behind."

00:01:23.368 --> 00:01:25.150
(Laughter)

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:28.775
Because whoever thought
of that title gets irony.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.537
(Laughter)

00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:32.019
Don't they?

00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:37.842
(Applause)

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.838
Because it's leaving
millions of children behind.

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:44.725
Now I can see that's not a very attractive
name for legislation:

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.471
"Millions of Children Left Behind."

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:48.240
I can see that.

00:01:48.264 --> 00:01:49.461
What's the plan?

00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:52.249
We propose to leave
millions of children behind,

00:01:52.273 --> 00:01:54.011
and here's how it's going to work.

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:55.421
And it's working beautifully.

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:56.452
(Laughter)

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:57.857
In some parts of the country,

00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.838
60 percent of kids drop out
of high school.

00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:03.344
In the Native American communities,

00:02:03.368 --> 00:02:05.753
it's 80 percent of kids.

00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:08.344
If we halved that number,

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:14.026
one estimate is it would create
a net gain to the U.S. economy

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.087
over 10 years,
of nearly a trillion dollars.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.833
From an economic point of view,

00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:23.765
this is good math, isn't it,
that we should do this?

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.114
It actually costs an enormous amount

00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:29.821
to mop up the damage
from the dropout crisis.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.005
But the dropout crisis
is just the tip of an iceberg.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.696
What it doesn't count
are all the kids who are in school

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.258
but being disengaged
from it, who don't enjoy it,

00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:42.826
who don't get any real benefit from it.

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:46.590
And the reason is not
that we're not spending enough money.

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:50.079
America spends more money on education
than most other countries.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:53.345
Class sizes are smaller
than in many countries.

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.943
And there are hundreds
of initiatives every year

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.603
to try and improve education.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.595
The trouble is, it's all going
in the wrong direction.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:07.340
There are three principles
on which human life flourishes,

00:03:07.364 --> 00:03:11.351
and they are contradicted
by the culture of education

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:13.628
under which most teachers have to labor

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:16.204
and most students have to endure.

00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:23.479
The first is this, that human beings
are naturally different and diverse.

00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:27.502
Can I ask you, how many of you
have got children of your own?

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:30.835
Okay. Or grandchildren.

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:34.807
How about two children or more? Right.

00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:37.741
And the rest of you
have seen such children.

00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:40.501
(Laughter)

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:42.015
Small people wandering about.

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.761
(Laughter)

00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:45.612
I will make you a bet,

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:47.684
and I am confident
that I will win the bet.

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:49.527
If you've got two children or more,

00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:53.356
I bet you they are completely
different from each other.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.801
Aren't they?

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:57.727
(Applause)

00:03:57.751 --> 00:04:00.330
You would never confuse them, would you?

00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:02.394
Like, "Which one are you? Remind me."

00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:04.196
(Laughter)

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:07.665
"Your mother and I need
some color-coding system

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.069
so we don't get confused."

00:04:10.052 --> 00:04:12.971
Education under "No Child Left Behind"

00:04:12.995 --> 00:04:16.574
is based on not diversity but conformity.

00:04:17.818 --> 00:04:20.352
What schools are encouraged
to do is to find out

00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:24.324
what kids can do across
a very narrow spectrum of achievement.

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:27.404
One of the effects
of "No Child Left Behind"

00:04:27.428 --> 00:04:31.177
has been to narrow the focus
onto the so-called STEM disciplines.

00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:32.811
They're very important.

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:35.074
I'm not here to argue
against science and math.

00:04:35.098 --> 00:04:38.813
On the contrary, they're necessary
but they're not sufficient.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:41.353
A real education has to give equal weight

00:04:41.377 --> 00:04:45.090
to the arts, the humanities,
to physical education.

00:04:45.114 --> 00:04:47.538
An awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you --

00:04:47.562 --> 00:04:52.664
(Applause)

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:56.551
One estimate in America currently
is that something like 10 percent of kids,

00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:58.066
getting on that way,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.156
are being diagnosed
with various conditions

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.157
under the broad title
of attention deficit disorder.

00:05:06.502 --> 00:05:07.702
ADHD.

00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:10.017
I'm not saying there's no such thing.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.130
I just don't believe
it's an epidemic like this.

00:05:13.154 --> 00:05:15.946
If you sit kids down, hour after hour,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.925
doing low-grade clerical work,

00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:22.411
don't be surprised if they start
to fidget, you know?

00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:23.863
(Laughter)

00:05:23.887 --> 00:05:30.065
(Applause)

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.224
Children are not, for the most part,
suffering from a psychological condition.

00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:36.237
They're suffering from childhood.

00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:40.355
(Laughter)

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.287
And I know this because
I spent my early life as a child.

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:45.406
I went through the whole thing.

00:05:46.705 --> 00:05:51.699
Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum
that celebrates their various talents,

00:05:51.723 --> 00:05:53.336
not just a small range of them.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.559
And by the way, the arts
aren't just important

00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:57.193
because they improve math scores.

00:05:57.217 --> 00:06:00.334
They're important because they speak
to parts of children's being

00:06:00.358 --> 00:06:01.787
which are otherwise untouched.

00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:04.120
The second, thank you --

00:06:04.144 --> 00:06:08.205
(Applause)

00:06:08.562 --> 00:06:12.701
The second principle
that drives human life flourishing

00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:14.209
is curiosity.

00:06:14.512 --> 00:06:17.876
If you can light the spark
of curiosity in a child,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.068
they will learn without any further
assistance, very often.

00:06:21.563 --> 00:06:23.524
Children are natural learners.

00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:27.840
It's a real achievement
to put that particular ability out,

00:06:27.864 --> 00:06:29.241
or to stifle it.

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:33.868
Curiosity is the engine of achievement.

00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:35.745
Now the reason I say this

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:39.944
is because one of the effects
of the current culture here,

00:06:39.968 --> 00:06:41.170
if I can say so,

00:06:41.194 --> 00:06:44.077
has been to de-professionalize teachers.

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:50.188
There is no system in the world
or any school in the country

00:06:50.212 --> 00:06:52.476
that is better than its teachers.

00:06:53.028 --> 00:06:57.334
Teachers are the lifeblood
of the success of schools.

00:06:57.723 --> 00:07:00.350
But teaching is a creative profession.

00:07:00.814 --> 00:07:03.701
Teaching, properly conceived,
is not a delivery system.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.222
You know, you're not there just
to pass on received information.

00:07:07.246 --> 00:07:09.474
Great teachers do that,

00:07:09.498 --> 00:07:12.543
but what great teachers also do is mentor,

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:15.595
stimulate, provoke, engage.

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.230
You see, in the end,
education is about learning.

00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:21.971
If there's no learning going on,
there's no education going on.

00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:23.968
And people can spend an awful lot of time

00:07:23.992 --> 00:07:26.565
discussing education
without ever discussing learning.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.162
The whole point of education
is to get people to learn.

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:32.952
An old friend of mine --
actually very old, he's dead.

00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:35.648
(Laughter)

00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:38.149
That's as old as it gets, I'm afraid.

00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:40.129
(Laughter)

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.713
But a wonderful guy he was,
wonderful philosopher.

00:07:46.737 --> 00:07:49.012
He used to talk about the difference

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:52.927
between the task
and achievement senses of verbs.

00:07:53.818 --> 00:07:56.141
You can be engaged
in the activity of something,

00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:58.580
but not really be
achieving it, like dieting.

00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:00.087
(Laughter)

00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:01.841
It's a very good example.

00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:03.212
There he is. He's dieting.

00:08:03.236 --> 00:08:05.105
Is he losing any weight? Not really.

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:06.721
(Laughter)

00:08:06.745 --> 00:08:08.212
Teaching is a word like that.

00:08:08.236 --> 00:08:11.424
You can say, "There's Deborah,
she's in room 34, she's teaching."

00:08:11.902 --> 00:08:13.751
But if nobody's learning anything,

00:08:13.775 --> 00:08:17.590
she may be engaged in the task of teaching
but not actually fulfilling it.

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:21.384
The role of a teacher
is to facilitate learning.

00:08:21.408 --> 00:08:22.655
That's it.

00:08:22.679 --> 00:08:24.555
And part of the problem is, I think,

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:28.011
that the dominant culture
of education has come to focus

00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:31.124
on not teaching and learning, but testing.

00:08:31.884 --> 00:08:33.461
Now, testing is important.

00:08:33.485 --> 00:08:35.200
Standardized tests have a place.

00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:38.691
But they should not be
the dominant culture of education.

00:08:38.715 --> 00:08:40.811
They should be diagnostic.
They should help.

00:08:40.835 --> 00:08:47.835
(Applause)

00:08:48.247 --> 00:08:52.769
If I go for a medical examination,
I want some standardized tests.

00:08:53.162 --> 00:08:54.363
I do.

00:08:54.387 --> 00:08:56.474
I want to know
what my cholesterol level is

00:08:56.498 --> 00:08:58.855
compared to everybody else's
on a standard scale.

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:02.121
I don't want to be told on some scale
my doctor invented in the car.

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:03.533
(Laughter)

00:09:04.246 --> 00:09:06.469
"Your cholesterol
is what I call Level Orange."

00:09:06.493 --> 00:09:07.676
"Really?"

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.477
(Laughter)

00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:11.144
"Is that good?" "We don't know."

00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:12.722
(Laughter)

00:09:12.746 --> 00:09:15.312
But all that should support learning.

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:18.844
It shouldn't obstruct it,
which of course it often does.

00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:23.362
So in place of curiosity,
what we have is a culture of compliance.

00:09:23.975 --> 00:09:29.475
Our children and teachers are encouraged
to follow routine algorithms

00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:34.036
rather than to excite that power
of imagination and curiosity.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.692
And the third principle is this:
that human life is inherently creative.

00:09:38.065 --> 00:09:40.429
It's why we all have different résumés.

00:09:40.453 --> 00:09:42.070
We create our lives,

00:09:42.094 --> 00:09:44.673
and we can recreate them
as we go through them.

00:09:44.697 --> 00:09:47.278
It's the common currency
of being a human being.

00:09:47.302 --> 00:09:51.445
It's why human culture
is so interesting and diverse and dynamic.

00:09:51.469 --> 00:09:55.306
I mean, other animals may well have
imaginations and creativity,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.038
but it's not so much
in evidence, is it, as ours?

00:09:58.062 --> 00:09:59.566
I mean, you may have a dog.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.174
And your dog may get depressed.

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:06.216
You know, but it doesn't listen
to Radiohead, does it?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.995
(Laughter)

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:12.924
And sit staring out the window
with a bottle of Jack Daniels.

00:10:12.948 --> 00:10:17.121
(Laughter)

00:10:17.145 --> 00:10:18.947
"Would you like to come for a walk?"

00:10:18.971 --> 00:10:20.172
"No, I'm fine."

00:10:20.196 --> 00:10:21.930
(Laughter)

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:25.771
"You go. I'll wait. But take pictures."

00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:27.636
(Laughter)

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.409
We all create our own lives
through this restless process

00:10:30.433 --> 00:10:32.529
of imagining alternatives
and possibilities,

00:10:32.553 --> 00:10:34.995
and one of the roles of education

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:38.693
is to awaken and develop
these powers of creativity.

00:10:38.717 --> 00:10:41.755
Instead, what we have
is a culture of standardization.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.639
Now, it doesn't have to be that way.

00:10:44.663 --> 00:10:46.248
It really doesn't.

00:10:46.637 --> 00:10:51.317
Finland regularly comes out on top
in math, science and reading.

00:10:51.341 --> 00:10:53.611
Now, we only know
that's what they do well at,

00:10:53.635 --> 00:10:55.767
because that's all that's being tested.

00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:57.649
That's one of the problems of the test.

00:10:57.673 --> 00:11:00.411
They don't look for other things
that matter just as much.

00:11:00.752 --> 00:11:04.078
The thing about work in Finland is this:

00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:06.450
they don't obsess about those disciplines.

00:11:06.474 --> 00:11:08.570
They have a very broad
approach to education,

00:11:08.594 --> 00:11:11.964
which includes humanities,
physical education, the arts.

00:11:13.064 --> 00:11:17.817
Second, there is no standardized
testing in Finland.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.128
I mean, there's a bit,

00:11:20.152 --> 00:11:22.438
but it's not what gets
people up in the morning,

00:11:22.462 --> 00:11:24.009
what keeps them at their desks.

00:11:24.342 --> 00:11:26.698
The third thing --
and I was at a meeting recently

00:11:26.722 --> 00:11:29.263
with some people from Finland,
actual Finnish people,

00:11:29.287 --> 00:11:34.159
and somebody from the American system
was saying to the people in Finland,

00:11:34.183 --> 00:11:37.132
"What do you do
about the drop-out rate in Finland?"

00:11:37.782 --> 00:11:40.188
And they all looked a bit
bemused, and said,

00:11:40.212 --> 00:11:41.514
"Well, we don't have one.

00:11:42.522 --> 00:11:43.885
Why would you drop out?

00:11:44.591 --> 00:11:47.141
If people are in trouble,
we get to them quite quickly

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.633
and we help and support them."

00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:50.224
Now people always say,

00:11:50.248 --> 00:11:53.006
"Well, you know, you can't compare
Finland to America."

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.847
No. I think there's a population
of around five million in Finland.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.185
But you can compare it
to a state in America.

00:12:00.815 --> 00:12:04.225
Many states in America
have fewer people in them than that.

00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:06.767
I mean, I've been
to some states in America

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.348
and I was the only person there.

00:12:08.372 --> 00:12:10.175
(Laughter)

00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:12.800
Really. Really.

00:12:12.824 --> 00:12:14.778
I was asked to lock up when I left.

00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:18.048
(Laughter)

00:12:18.897 --> 00:12:22.806
But what all the high-performing
systems in the world do

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.694
is currently what is not evident, sadly,

00:12:26.718 --> 00:12:28.959
across the systems in America --

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:30.250
I mean, as a whole.

00:12:30.703 --> 00:12:32.012
One is this:

00:12:32.036 --> 00:12:35.053
they individualize teaching and learning.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:39.430
They recognize that it's students
who are learning

00:12:39.454 --> 00:12:41.586
and the system has to engage them,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.996
their curiosity, their individuality,
and their creativity.

00:12:45.305 --> 00:12:46.931
That's how you get them to learn.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.760
The second is that they attribute
a very high status

00:12:51.784 --> 00:12:53.627
to the teaching profession.

00:12:54.353 --> 00:12:56.985
They recognize
that you can't improve education

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.978
if you don't pick great people to teach
and keep giving them

00:13:00.002 --> 00:13:02.199
constant support
and professional development.

00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:05.195
Investing in professional
development is not a cost.

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:06.808
It's an investment,

00:13:06.832 --> 00:13:09.577
and every other country
that's succeeding well knows that,

00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:12.031
whether it's Australia, Canada,

00:13:12.055 --> 00:13:16.482
South Korea, Singapore,
Hong Kong or Shanghai.

00:13:16.506 --> 00:13:18.171
They know that to be the case.

00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:19.561
And the third is,

00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:23.315
they devolve responsibility
to the school level

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:24.592
for getting the job done.

00:13:25.243 --> 00:13:27.348
You see, there's a big difference here

00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:31.361
between going into a mode of command
and control in education --

00:13:31.385 --> 00:13:33.113
That's what happens in some systems.

00:13:33.137 --> 00:13:35.736
Central or state governments decide,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.418
they know best and they're going
to tell you what to do.

00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:42.294
The trouble is that education
doesn't go on

00:13:42.318 --> 00:13:45.226
in the committee rooms
of our legislative buildings.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.260
It happens in classrooms and schools,

00:13:48.284 --> 00:13:51.333
and the people who do it
are the teachers and the students,

00:13:51.357 --> 00:13:54.606
and if you remove their discretion,
it stops working.

00:13:55.117 --> 00:13:57.791
You have to put it back to the people.

00:13:57.815 --> 00:14:02.967
(Applause)

00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:05.332
There is wonderful work
happening in this country.

00:14:05.918 --> 00:14:07.475
But I have to say it's happening

00:14:07.499 --> 00:14:10.041
in spite of the dominant
culture of education,

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:11.442
not because of it.

00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:14.713
It's like people are sailing
into a headwind all the time.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.708
And the reason I think is this:

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.740
that many of the current policies

00:14:19.764 --> 00:14:23.885
are based on mechanistic
conceptions of education.

00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:27.653
It's like education
is an industrial process

00:14:27.677 --> 00:14:30.660
that can be improved
just by having better data,

00:14:30.684 --> 00:14:33.600
and somewhere in the back of the mind
of some policy makers

00:14:33.624 --> 00:14:37.734
is this idea that if we fine-tune it
well enough, if we just get it right,

00:14:37.758 --> 00:14:40.019
it will all hum along perfectly
into the future.

00:14:40.576 --> 00:14:42.291
It won't, and it never did.

00:14:43.805 --> 00:14:47.732
The point is that education
is not a mechanical system.

00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:49.555
It's a human system.

00:14:49.927 --> 00:14:51.856
It's about people,

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.684
people who either do want
to learn or don't want to learn.

00:14:54.708 --> 00:14:59.499
Every student who drops
out of school has a reason for it

00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:01.820
which is rooted in their own biography.

00:15:01.844 --> 00:15:03.422
They may find it boring.

00:15:03.446 --> 00:15:05.142
They may find it irrelevant.

00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:09.980
They may find that it's at odds with
the life they're living outside of school.

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:13.454
There are trends,
but the stories are always unique.

00:15:14.087 --> 00:15:16.741
I was at a meeting recently
in Los Angeles of --

00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:19.200
they're called alternative
education programs.

00:15:19.224 --> 00:15:22.528
These are programs designed
to get kids back into education.

00:15:22.552 --> 00:15:24.333
They have certain common features.

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:25.889
They're very personalized.

00:15:26.548 --> 00:15:29.960
They have strong support for the teachers,

00:15:29.984 --> 00:15:33.527
close links with the community
and a broad and diverse curriculum,

00:15:33.551 --> 00:15:38.447
and often programs which involve students
outside school as well as inside school.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.004
And they work.

00:15:40.674 --> 00:15:44.347
What's interesting to me is,
these are called "alternative education."

00:15:44.371 --> 00:15:45.419
(Laughter)

00:15:45.443 --> 00:15:46.647
You know?

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:49.909
And all the evidence
from around the world is,

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:52.865
if we all did that, there'd be
no need for the alternative.

00:15:53.406 --> 00:15:56.262
(Applause)

00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:02.136
(Applause ends)

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.640
So I think we have to embrace
a different metaphor.

00:16:04.664 --> 00:16:07.173
We have to recognize
that it's a human system,

00:16:07.197 --> 00:16:11.053
and there are conditions
under which people thrive,

00:16:11.077 --> 00:16:13.674
and conditions under which they don't.

00:16:13.698 --> 00:16:16.945
We are after all organic creatures,

00:16:16.969 --> 00:16:21.245
and the culture of the school
is absolutely essential.

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:23.344
Culture is an organic term, isn't it?

00:16:23.937 --> 00:16:26.972
Not far from where I live
is a place called Death Valley.

00:16:27.627 --> 00:16:33.267
Death Valley is the hottest,
driest place in America,

00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:35.110
and nothing grows there.

00:16:36.219 --> 00:16:38.306
Nothing grows there
because it doesn't rain.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.280
Hence, Death Valley.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:47.670
In the winter of 2004,
it rained in Death Valley.

00:16:48.064 --> 00:16:51.201
Seven inches of rain fell
over a very short period.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:56.705
And in the spring of 2005,
there was a phenomenon.

00:16:57.038 --> 00:17:02.660
The whole floor of Death Valley
was carpeted in flowers for a while.

00:17:03.664 --> 00:17:05.426
What it proved is this:

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.084
that Death Valley isn't dead.

00:17:09.424 --> 00:17:10.693
It's dormant.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.027
Right beneath the surface
are these seeds of possibility

00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:18.589
waiting for the right conditions
to come about,

00:17:18.613 --> 00:17:22.075
and with organic systems,
if the conditions are right,

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:23.974
life is inevitable.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.661
It happens all the time.

00:17:25.685 --> 00:17:28.246
You take an area, a school, a district,

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.674
you change the conditions, give people
a different sense of possibility,

00:17:31.698 --> 00:17:34.816
a different set of expectations,
a broader range of opportunities,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.126
you cherish and value the relationships
between teachers and learners,

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.341
you offer people
the discretion to be creative

00:17:40.365 --> 00:17:42.184
and to innovate in what they do,

00:17:42.208 --> 00:17:45.645
and schools that were once
bereft spring to life.

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:47.154
Great leaders know that.

00:17:47.662 --> 00:17:49.763
The real role of leadership
in education --

00:17:49.787 --> 00:17:51.884
and I think it's true
at the national level,

00:17:51.908 --> 00:17:53.878
the state level, at the school level --

00:17:53.902 --> 00:17:57.376
is not and should not be
command and control.

00:17:58.302 --> 00:18:02.525
The real role of leadership
is climate control,

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:04.828
creating a climate of possibility.

00:18:04.852 --> 00:18:07.282
And if you do that, people will rise to it

00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:10.515
and achieve things
that you completely did not anticipate

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:12.482
and couldn't have expected.

00:18:12.506 --> 00:18:14.859
There's a wonderful quote
from Benjamin Franklin.

00:18:14.883 --> 00:18:17.462
"There are three sorts
of people in the world:

00:18:17.486 --> 00:18:20.002
Those who are immovable,

00:18:20.026 --> 00:18:21.249
people who don't get it,

00:18:21.273 --> 00:18:23.144
or don't want to do anything about it;

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:24.880
there are people who are movable,

00:18:24.904 --> 00:18:26.524
people who see the need for change

00:18:26.548 --> 00:18:28.848
and are prepared to listen to it;

00:18:28.872 --> 00:18:30.699
and there are people who move,

00:18:30.723 --> 00:18:32.479
people who make things happen."

00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:36.718
And if we can encourage more people,
that will be a movement.

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:39.502
And if the movement is strong enough,

00:18:39.526 --> 00:18:42.251
that's, in the best sense
of the word, a revolution.

00:18:42.866 --> 00:18:44.423
And that's what we need.

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:45.656
Thank you very much.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.545
(Applause)

00:18:49.569 --> 00:18:50.795
Thank you very much.

00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:53.396
(Applause)
