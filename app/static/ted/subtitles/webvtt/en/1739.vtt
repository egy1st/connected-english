00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.612
Everyone needs a coach.

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:06.713
It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player,

00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:09.991
a tennis player, a gymnast

00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:12.212
or a bridge player.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.701
(Laughter)

00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.160
My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.415
says there are more pictures of the back of her head

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:22.932
than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter)

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:26.594
Sorry, Sharon. Here you go.

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:30.185
We all need people who will give us feedback.

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:32.422
That's how we improve.

00:00:32.422 --> 00:00:35.402
Unfortunately, there's one group of people

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.208
who get almost no systematic feedback

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:40.393
to help them do their jobs better,

00:00:40.393 --> 00:00:41.792
and these people

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.942
have one of the most important jobs in the world.

00:00:44.942 --> 00:00:47.171
I'm talking about teachers.

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:49.110
When Melinda and I learned

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.322
how little useful feedback most teachers get,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.276
we were blown away.

00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:58.400
Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.053
just got one word of feedback:

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:03.773
Satisfactory.

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:06.266
If all my bridge coach ever told me

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.651
was that I was "satisfactory,"

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:11.428
I would have no hope of ever getting better.

00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:14.726
How would I know who was the best?

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:18.326
How would I know what I was doing differently?

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:20.710
Today, districts are revamping

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.994
the way they evaluate teachers,

00:01:22.994 --> 00:01:26.303
but we still give them almost no feedback

00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:29.476
that actually helps them improve their practice.

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:32.808
Our teachers deserve better.

00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:36.036
The system we have today isn't fair to them.

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:37.857
It's not fair to students,

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:42.887
and it's putting America's global leadership at risk.

00:01:42.887 --> 00:01:46.346
So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:50.604
get the tools for improvement they want and deserve.

00:01:50.604 --> 00:01:54.470
Let's start by asking who's doing well.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.938
Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables

00:01:57.938 --> 00:01:59.864
for teacher feedback systems.

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:01.654
So I looked at the countries

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:04.759
whose students perform well academically,

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.064
and looked at what they're doing

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:10.103
to help their teachers improve.

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:13.336
Consider the rankings for reading proficiency.

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:15.826
The U.S. isn't number one.

00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:17.881
We're not even in the top 10.

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:22.819
We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.045
Now, out of all the places

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:27.635
that do better than the U.S. in reading,

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:30.174
how many of them have a formal system

00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:33.165
for helping teachers improve?

00:02:33.165 --> 00:02:36.000
Eleven out of 14.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.565
The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading,

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:43.166
but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math.

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:46.250
So there's really only one area where we're near the top,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.422
and that's in failing to give our teachers

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:52.043
the help they need to develop their skills.

00:02:52.043 --> 00:02:55.600
Let's look at the best academic performer:

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.765
the province of Shanghai, China.

00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:02.098
Now, they rank number one across the board,

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:05.017
in reading, math and science,

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:08.388
and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:12.022
is the way they help teachers keep improving.

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:14.351
They made sure that younger teachers

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.018
get a chance to watch master teachers at work.

00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:20.292
They have weekly study groups,

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:23.126
where teachers get together and talk about what's working.

00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:26.481
They even require each teacher to observe

00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:29.619
and give feedback to their colleagues.

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:33.318
You might ask, why is a system like this so important?

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:36.176
It's because there's so much variation

00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:38.257
in the teaching profession.

00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:42.414
Some teachers are far more effective than others.

00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:45.103
In fact, there are teachers throughout the country

00:03:45.103 --> 00:03:48.656
who are helping their students make extraordinary gains.

00:03:48.656 --> 00:03:50.899
If today's average teacher

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.495
could become as good as those teachers,

00:03:53.495 --> 00:03:57.671
our students would be blowing away the rest of the world.

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.578
So we need a system that helps all our teachers

00:04:00.578 --> 00:04:02.590
be as good as the best.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.187
What would that system look like?

00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:07.212
Well, to find out, our foundation

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:09.663
has been working with 3,000 teachers

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:11.847
in districts across the country

00:04:11.847 --> 00:04:16.066
on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching.

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:18.417
We had observers watch videos

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:20.163
of teachers in the classroom

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:23.751
and rate how they did on a range of practices.

00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:25.589
For example, did they ask their students

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:27.680
challenging questions?

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.997
Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea?

00:04:31.997 --> 00:04:36.497
We also had students fill out surveys with questions like,

00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:38.210
"Does your teacher know

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.767
when the class understands a lesson?"

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:43.923
"Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"

00:04:43.923 --> 00:04:46.752
And what we found is very exciting.

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:50.871
First, the teachers who did well on these observations

00:04:50.871 --> 00:04:53.322
had far better student outcomes.

00:04:53.322 --> 00:04:56.580
So it tells us we're asking the right questions.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.393
And second, teachers in the program told us

00:04:59.393 --> 00:05:02.943
that these videos and these surveys from the students

00:05:02.943 --> 00:05:05.626
were very helpful diagnostic tools,

00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:08.255
because they pointed to specific places

00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:10.283
where they can improve.

00:05:10.283 --> 00:05:14.326
I want to show you what this video component of MET

00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:16.910
looks like in action.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.857
(Music)

00:05:19.857 --> 00:05:21.538
(Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody.

00:05:21.538 --> 00:05:23.706
Let's talk about what's going on today.

00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:27.055
To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay?

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:29.510
A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.393
is for you to be able to determine

00:05:31.393 --> 00:05:34.347
whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays.

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:35.816
My name is Sarah Brown Wessling.

00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:37.501
I am a high school English teacher

00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:39.564
at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa.

00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:41.311
Turn to somebody next to you.

00:05:41.311 --> 00:05:44.110
Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about --

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.771
I think that there is a difference for teachers

00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:50.244
between the abstract of how we see our practice

00:05:50.244 --> 00:05:51.887
and then the concrete reality of it.

00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:55.437
Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers.

00:05:55.437 --> 00:05:58.080
I think what video offers for us

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.394
is a certain degree of reality.

00:06:00.394 --> 00:06:03.030
You can't really dispute what you see on the video,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.989
and there is a lot to be learned from that,

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:07.918
and there are a lot of ways that we can grow

00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:10.849
as a profession when we actually get to see this.

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.842
I just have a flip camera and a little tripod

00:06:13.842 --> 00:06:17.252
and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.760
At the beginning of class, I just perch it

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.185
in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot.

00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:24.923
It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.

00:06:24.923 --> 00:06:28.203
But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot.

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:30.252
And I'm able to learn a lot from it.

00:06:30.252 --> 00:06:33.137
So it really has been a simple

00:06:33.137 --> 00:06:35.983
but powerful tool in my own reflection.

00:06:35.983 --> 00:06:39.032
All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay?

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:41.800
Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.436
and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it.

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:46.548
If I don't write things down, I don't remember them.

00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:50.203
So having the notes is a part of my thinking process,

00:06:50.203 --> 00:06:54.290
and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.319
I really have used it for my own personal growth

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.245
and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy

00:06:59.245 --> 00:07:02.514
and methodology and classroom management,

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:06.020
and just all of those different facets of the classroom.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.694
I'm glad that we've actually done the process before

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:11.219
so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't.

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.544
I think that video exposes

00:07:14.544 --> 00:07:18.028
so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers

00:07:18.028 --> 00:07:21.185
in ways that help us learn and help us understand,

00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:23.792
and then help our broader communities understand

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:27.628
what this complex work is really all about.

00:07:27.628 --> 00:07:31.760
I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.675
things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan,

00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:36.828
things you cannot convey in a standard,

00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:39.057
things that you cannot even sometimes convey

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:41.867
in a book of pedagogy.

00:07:41.867 --> 00:07:44.233
Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend.

00:07:44.233 --> 00:07:45.469
I'll see you later.

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:47.756
[Every classroom could look like that]

00:07:47.756 --> 00:07:53.183
(Applause)

00:07:53.183 --> 00:07:56.155
Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America

00:07:56.155 --> 00:07:58.839
to look something like that.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:01.460
But we still have more work to do.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.180
Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.767
is only half the battle.

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:09.152
We also have to give them the tools they need

00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:11.650
to act on the diagnosis.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.565
If you learn that you need to improve

00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:15.306
the way you teach fractions,

00:08:15.306 --> 00:08:17.814
you should be able to watch a video

00:08:17.814 --> 00:08:21.526
of the best person in the world teaching fractions.

00:08:21.526 --> 00:08:24.268
So building this complete teacher feedback

00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:27.378
and improvement system won't be easy.

00:08:27.378 --> 00:08:29.388
For example, I know some teachers

00:08:29.388 --> 00:08:31.856
aren't immediately comfortable with the idea

00:08:31.856 --> 00:08:34.656
of a camera in the classroom.

00:08:34.656 --> 00:08:37.972
That's understandable, but our experience with MET

00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:41.417
suggests that if teachers manage the process,

00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:43.902
if they collect video in their own classrooms,

00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:46.878
and they pick the lessons they want to submit,

00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:50.639
a lot of them will be eager to participate.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:53.592
Building this system will also require

00:08:53.592 --> 00:08:56.615
a considerable investment.

00:08:56.615 --> 00:08:59.972
Our foundation estimates that it could cost

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.127
up to five billion dollars.

00:09:02.127 --> 00:09:06.481
Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective,

00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:08.474
it's less than two percent

00:09:08.474 --> 00:09:12.769
of what we spend every year on teacher salaries.

00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:16.081
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal.

00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.038
We would finally have a way to give them feedback,

00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:22.735
as well as the means to act on it.

00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:23.920
But this system would have

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.710
an even more important benefit for our country.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.883
It would put us on a path to making sure

00:09:30.883 --> 00:09:34.082
all our students get a great education,

00:09:34.082 --> 00:09:36.773
find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding,

00:09:36.773 --> 00:09:40.012
and have a chance to live out their dreams.

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:44.366
This wouldn't just make us a more successful country.

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:49.870
It would also make us a more fair and just one, too.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.605
I'm excited about the opportunity

00:09:52.605 --> 00:09:57.354
to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve.

00:09:57.354 --> 00:09:59.081
I hope you are too.

00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:00.852
Thank you.

00:10:00.852 --> 00:10:09.160
