00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
As an architect you design for the present,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with an awareness of the past,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for a future which is essentially unknown.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and issue of the day.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I'd like to share some experience

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and to explore and to touch on some observations

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
about the nature of sustainability.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
How far you can anticipate, what follows from it,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
what are the threats, what are the possibilities,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the challenges, the opportunities?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that really, green is cool.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in a way celebrating the places and the spaces

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which determine the quality of life.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I rarely actually quote anything,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
[in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
He said,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"I think the most important thing to happen in 2006

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We reached a tipping point this year

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
came to be understood by a critical mass

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and competitive thing they could do.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And I asked myself, in a way, looking back,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000
"When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And I think it was July 20, 1969,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
in Space City and other places in Russia.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And interestingly, as I think back,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
they were the first true environmentalists.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
fired about the problems of the Aral Sea.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And at that period it was --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in a way, a number of things were happening.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
again, a word that had not been coined.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It's another subject. It's another conversation.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It was at that time, with an awareness

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And it's a number of projects.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
for one of the Canary Islands.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And this probably coincided with the time

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and you had the hippie movement.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which seeks to sum up the recommendations.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And all the components are there which are now

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
in common parlance, in our vocabulary,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
you know, 30-odd years later:

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And in parallel at that time, there was

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
a very kind of exclusive design club.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
People who were really design conscious

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and the objects that he would create

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
for the company called Braun.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
This is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And despite Bucky's prophecies

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that everything would be miniaturized

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and technology would make an incredible style --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
access to comfort, to amenities --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
it was very, very difficult to imagine

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that everything that we see in this image,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
would be very, very stylishly packaged.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And I think that that digital revolution

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
now is coming to the point

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
finally connects with the physical world,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
there is the reality that that has become humanized,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
so that digital world has all the friendliness,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Probably summed up in a way

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
by the stylish or alternative available here,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
as we generously had gifted at lunchtime,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
the [unclear], which is a further kind of development --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
A very, very beautiful object.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
has now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And the reference to the iPod as iconic,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and in a way evocative of performance, delivery --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
as architects, or anybody involved with the design process --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Buildings are important, but

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
they're only a component of a much bigger picture.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
if you could achieve the impossible,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the equivalent of perpetual motion,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
you could design a carbon-free house, for example.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
That would be the answer.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Unfortunately, it's not the answer.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It's only the beginning of the problem.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
You cannot separate the buildings out

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
from the infrastructure of cites

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and the mobility of transit.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and we look at planet Earth,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
then the energy consumed would be split

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But again, that only shows part of the picture.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
then 70 percent of the energy consumption

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So the problems of sustainability

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
cannot be separated from the nature of the cities,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
of which the buildings are a part.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
between a recent kind of city,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The city goes out in annular rings,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
consuming more and more green space,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and more and more roads, and more and more energy

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
in the transport of people between the city center --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and Munich is not a bad example of that,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
with the greater dependence on walking and cycling --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
then a city which is really only twice as dense,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is only using one-tenth of the energy.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
In other words, you take these comparable examples

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and the energy leap is enormous.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that as the density increases along the bottom there,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Of course you can't separate this out from issues like

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
social diversity, mass transit,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the quality of civic spaces.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
is not dense compared with the really dense cities.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
which were occurring in the developing world.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And now, out of typically 46 cities,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
for example, China or India.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
If you take China, and you just take Beijing,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
you can see on that traffic system,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
1,000 new cars every day --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world --

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So, if we think of the transition in our society

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
then that same process is happening in 20 years.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
over that period where the urbanization has trebled.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
If I pull back from that global picture,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and I look at the implication over a similar period of time

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
is a tool for designers,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and I cite our own experience as a company,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
then how do you measure that change of technology?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
How does it affect the design of buildings?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And particularly, how can it lead

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
to the creation of buildings which consume less energy,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
create less pollution and are more socially responsible?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
for a company called Willis and Faber,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000
in a small market town in the northeast of England,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
commuting distance with London.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And here, the first thing you can see

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
overcoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
which is also about the celebration of public space.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
you have a connection with nature.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Now this was 1973.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
In 2001, this building received an award.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And the award was about a celebration for a building

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
which had been in use over a long period of time.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And the people who'd created it came back:

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
the project managers, the company chairmen then.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And they were saying, you know,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
"The architects, Norman was always going on about

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
designing for the future, and you know,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
it didn't seem to cost us any more.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So we humored him, we kept him happy."

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The image at the top,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
really what it is saying is you can wire this building.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
This building was wired for change.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
had to build new buildings for the new technology.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We were fortunate,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
because in a way our building was future-proofed.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Round about that design period leading up to this building,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and we really don't have the immediate expertise

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
at a technical level."

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
In other words, we didn't have the technology

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
to do what would be really interesting on that building.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble --

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Notwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
is very much a pioneering building.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
is that the technology is now available and celebratory.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
The library of the Free University, which opened last year,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
is an example of that.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And again, the transition from one of the many thousands

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
of sketches and computer images to the reality.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And a combination of devices here,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
which enables the building to be ventilated,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
to consume dramatically less energy,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and where it's really working with the forces of nature.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
by the people who use it.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I think it's a great -- it's a celebration.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And you can measure the performance,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
in terms of energy consumption, of that building

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
against a typical library.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
If I show another aspect of that technology

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
then, in a completely different context --

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
but that material -- because of the technology, the computing ability,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
the ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.000
the ability to plot points in the sky

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and to transmit, to transfer that information

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
now, directly into the factory.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So if you cross the border -- just across the border --

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
and those points in space are communicated.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And on the left are the cutting machines,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
which then, in the factory,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
enable those individual pieces to be fabricated

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and plus or minus very, very few millimeters,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
to be slotted together on site.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And then interestingly, that building to then be clad

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And again, the way in which that works as a building,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
for those of us who can enjoy the spaces,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
to live and visit there.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
If I made the leap into these new technologies,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
then how did we -- what happened before that?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
the things that you take for granted?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Well, obviously the building still happened.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
deep into the heart of this space here.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000
So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
For wind tunnels, we would literally put them

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
in a wind tunnel and blast air,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
and the many kilometers of cable and so on.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And the turning point was probably, in our terms,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
when we had the first computer.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And that was at the time that we sought

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
to redesign, reinvent the airport.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal --

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
big, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And Stansted, the green alternative,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
which uses natural light, is a friendly place:

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
you know where you are, you can relate to the outside.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light --

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
electric light, which in turn creates more heat,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
which creates more cooling loads and so on.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And at that particular point in time,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
this was one of the few solitary computers.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Not going back very far in time, 1990,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
that's our office.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And if you looked very closely, you'd see

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
that people were drawing with pencils,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I mean, major transformation.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000
and in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
which record our archival information

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
on past, current and future projects.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
But meanwhile, as you know,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
wonderful protagonists like Al Gore

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
are noting the inexorable rise in temperature,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
set in the context of that,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
and very, very relevant to this place.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Our Reichstag project,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
which has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
as a public place where we sought to, in a way,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
through a process of advocacy,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
public space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto --

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
something that would be free, completely free

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
of fuel as we know it.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
So it would be totally renewable.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
but this very, very much a part of the ecology.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
But here, not having to model it for real.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Obviously the wind tunnel had a place,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
but the ability now with the computer

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
to explore, to plan, to see how that would work

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
in terms of the forces of nature:

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
and to look at biomass.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.000
A combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil --

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
a process that, quite interestingly, was developed

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
in Eastern Germany, at the time of its

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
dependence on the Soviet Bloc.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
So really, retranslating that technology and developing something

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
which was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
You can measure it again.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
in tons of carbon dioxide per year --

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons --

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
what it would have been with natural gas

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
We can see the same processes at work

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
in terms of the Commerce Bank --

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
its dependence on natural ventilation,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
the way that you can model those gardens,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
the way they spiral around.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality --

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And again, we can measure the reduction

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
in terms of energy consumption.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
There is an evolution here between the projects,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further --

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
the project in the city in London.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
What are the other ways of putting

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
the same amount of space on the site?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
If, for example, you seek to do a building

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
which goes right to the edge of the pavement,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
it's the same amount of space.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
The grooves become the kind of green lungs

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
which give views, which give light, ventilation,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
make the building fresher.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And you enclose that with something that also

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
is central to its appearance,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
which is a mesh of triangulated structures --

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
again, in a long connection evocative of

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
some of those works of Buckminster Fuller,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
and the way in which triangulation can increase performance

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
and also give that building its sense of identity.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And here, if we look at a detail of the way

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
that the building opens up and breathes into those atria,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
we can see the high pressure, the low pressure,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
So it also has the ability, all the time,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
regardless of the direction of the wind,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
And unlike conventional buildings,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
the top of the building is celebratory.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And the base of the building is again about public space.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Comparing it with a typical building,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
what happens if we seek to use such design strategies

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
in terms of really large-scale thinking?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And I'm just going to give two images

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
out of a kind of company research project.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
than the oceans and seas around it.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
by creating a pipeline, a pipe,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
into the Dead Sea.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
And our translation of that,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
what if that, instead of being just a pipe,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
what if it is a lifeline?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
of the Grand Canal,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
In other words, water is the lifeblood.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
And if you just go back to the previous image,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
and you look at this area of volatility and hostility,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
in a united cause, in terms of something that would be

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
genuinely green and productive in the widest sense.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Infrastructure at that large scale is also

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
inseparable from communication.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And whether that communication is the virtual world

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
or it is the physical world,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
then it's absolutely central to society.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
And how do we make more legible in this growing world,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
especially in some of the places that I'm talking about --

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
China, for example, which in the next ten years

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
will create 400 new airports.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Now what form do they take?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
How do you make them more friendly at that scale?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
because you always have a point of reference.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
into the Chinese society?

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
perhaps the ultimate mega-building.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
And the challenge here is a building that will be green,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
that is compact despite its size

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
and is about the human experience of travel,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
is very, very much about the lifestyle.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
As Hubert was talking over lunch,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
as we sort of engaged in conversation,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
talked about this, talked about cities.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
And in a way, one aspect of this conversation

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
was triggered on New Year's Eve,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.000
when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And I was voicing the thought that --

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 --

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
that maybe, you know, the future was

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
the most powerful, innovative sort of nation.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
"We put a man on the moon."

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
You know, who is going to say

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And that's a concerted platform.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
I thought that the inspiration was more likely

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
to come from those other, larger countries out there --

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
the Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Thank you very much.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
(Applause)
