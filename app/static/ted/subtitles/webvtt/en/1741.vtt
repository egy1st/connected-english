00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:02.460
When I was in my 20s,

00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:05.928
I saw my very first psychotherapy client.

00:00:06.484 --> 00:00:09.884
I was a Ph.D. student
in clinical psychology at Berkeley.

00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:13.474
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.

00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:18.929
Now Alex walked into her first session
wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:21.040
and she dropped
onto the couch in my office

00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:22.733
and kicked off her flats

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:25.985
and told me she was there
to talk about guy problems.

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:30.548
Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:34.092
My classmate got an arsonist
for her first client.

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:35.962
(Laughter)

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:40.083
And I got a twentysomething
who wanted to talk about boys.

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:42.621
This I thought I could handle.

00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:44.693
But I didn't handle it.

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:48.203
With the funny stories
that Alex would bring to session,

00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:50.202
it was easy for me just to nod my head

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:52.392
while we kicked the can down the road.

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.672
"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:57.258
and as far as I could tell, she was right.

00:00:57.726 --> 00:00:59.952
Work happened later,
marriage happened later,

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.418
kids happened later,
even death happened later.

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:07.700
Twentysomethings like Alex and I
had nothing but time.

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:14.390
But before long, my supervisor pushed me
to push Alex about her love life.

00:01:14.414 --> 00:01:15.559
I pushed back.

00:01:16.186 --> 00:01:18.677
I said, "Sure, she's dating down,

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.012
she's sleeping with a knucklehead,

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:23.646
but it's not like she's going
to marry the guy."

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.251
And then my supervisor said,

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:30.101
"Not yet, but she might marry
the next one.

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:34.483
Besides, the best time
to work on Alex's marriage

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:37.241
is before she has one."

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.250
That's what psychologists
call an "Aha!" moment.

00:01:41.274 --> 00:01:44.384
That was the moment I realized,
30 is not the new 20.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.175
Yes, people settle down later
than they used to,

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:51.574
but that didn't make Alex's 20s
a developmental downtime.

00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:55.086
That made Alex's 20s
a developmental sweet spot,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.714
and we were sitting there, blowing it.

00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:02.168
That was when I realized
that this sort of benign neglect

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:06.165
was a real problem,
and it had real consequences,

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.579
not just for Alex and her love life

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:11.730
but for the careers
and the families and the futures

00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:13.818
of twentysomethings everywhere.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.469
There are 50 million twentysomethings
in the United States right now.

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:23.706
We're talking about 15 percent
of the population,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.998
or 100 percent if you consider

00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:30.565
that no one's getting through adulthood
without going through their 20s first.

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:31.688
(Laughter)

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:33.758
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.

00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:36.068
I really want to see
some twentysomethings here.

00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:37.597
Oh, yay! You are all awesome.

00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:41.542
If you work with twentysomethings,
you love a twentysomething,

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:44.410
you're losing sleep
over twentysomethings, I want to see —

00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:48.284
Okay. Awesome,
twentysomethings really matter.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.589
So, I specialize in twentysomethings
because I believe

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:56.487
that every single one of those
50 million twentysomethings

00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:59.716
deserves to know what psychologists,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.436
sociologists, neurologists
and fertility specialists

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.254
already know:

00:03:05.278 --> 00:03:08.444
that claiming your 20s
is one of the simplest,

00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:11.223
yet most transformative, things you can do

00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:13.918
for work, for love, for your happiness,

00:03:13.942 --> 00:03:15.707
maybe even for the world.

00:03:16.618 --> 00:03:18.453
This is not my opinion.

00:03:18.477 --> 00:03:20.047
These are the facts.

00:03:21.262 --> 00:03:24.416
We know that 80 percent
of life's most defining moments

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.821
take place by age 35.

00:03:27.813 --> 00:03:30.015
That means that eight out of 10

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.334
of the decisions and experiences
and "Aha!" moments

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.478
that make your life what it is

00:03:35.502 --> 00:03:37.792
will have happened by your mid-30s.

00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:40.705
People who are over 40, don't panic.

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.990
This crowd is going to be fine, I think.

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.140
We know that the first
10 years of a career

00:03:46.164 --> 00:03:50.772
has an exponential impact
on how much money you're going to earn.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.908
We know that more than half of Americans

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:57.078
are married or are living with or dating
their future partner by 30.

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:59.722
We know that the brain caps off

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:02.746
its second and last
growth spurt in your 20s

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.616
as it rewires itself for adulthood,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.693
which means that whatever it is you want
to change about yourself,

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:11.724
now is the time to change it.

00:04:12.536 --> 00:04:15.758
We know that personality
changes more during your 20s

00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:18.464
than at any other time in life,

00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:22.330
and we know that female fertility
peaks at age 28,

00:04:22.354 --> 00:04:25.526
and things get tricky after age 35.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.838
So your 20s are the time
to educate yourself

00:04:28.862 --> 00:04:31.853
about your body and your options.

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.702
So when we think about child development,

00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:38.667
we all know that the first
five years are a critical period

00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:41.514
for language and attachment in the brain.

00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:45.203
It's a time when your ordinary,
day-to-day life

00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:48.890
has an inordinate impact
on who you will become.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.771
But what we hear less about
is that there's such a thing

00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:53.952
as adult development,

00:04:53.976 --> 00:04:58.290
and our 20s are that critical period
of adult development.

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:02.314
But this isn't what
twentysomethings are hearing.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:06.592
Newspapers talk about the changing
timetable of adulthood.

00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:10.321
Researchers call the 20s
an extended adolescence.

00:05:10.923 --> 00:05:13.549
Journalists coin silly nicknames
for twentysomethings

00:05:13.573 --> 00:05:15.558
like "twixters" and "kidults."

00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:18.781
(Laughing) It's true!

00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:21.250
As a culture, we have trivialized

00:05:21.274 --> 00:05:25.786
what is actually
the defining decade of adulthood.

00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:30.091
Leonard Bernstein said
that to achieve great things,

00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:33.227
you need a plan and not quite enough time.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.303
(Laughing) Isn't that true?

00:05:36.327 --> 00:05:37.909
So what do you think happens

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:40.553
when you pat a twentysomething
on the head and you say,

00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:42.834
"You have 10 extra years
to start your life"?

00:05:44.013 --> 00:05:45.633
Nothing happens.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.655
You have robbed that person
of his urgency and ambition,

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:51.903
and absolutely nothing happens.

00:05:52.657 --> 00:05:56.245
And then every day, smart,
interesting twentysomethings

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:59.503
like you or like your sons and daughters

00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:02.869
come into my office
and say things like this:

00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:06.266
"I know my boyfriend's no good for me,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.540
but this relationship doesn't count.
I'm just killing time."

00:06:10.854 --> 00:06:13.735
Or they say, "Everybody says
as long as I get started

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.187
on a career by the time
I'm 30, I'll be fine."

00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:19.633
But then it starts to sound like this:

00:06:20.697 --> 00:06:24.093
"My 20s are almost over,
and I have nothing to show for myself.

00:06:24.578 --> 00:06:28.157
I had a better résumé the day
after I graduated from college."

00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:31.448
And then it starts to sound like this:

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.952
"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.

00:06:34.976 --> 00:06:37.821
Everybody was running around
and having fun,

00:06:37.845 --> 00:06:40.701
but then sometime around 30
it was like the music turned off

00:06:40.725 --> 00:06:42.608
and everybody started sitting down.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:45.584
I didn't want to be
the only one left standing up,

00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:47.625
so sometimes I think I married my husband

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.147
because he was the closest
chair to me at 30."

00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:53.174
Where are the twentysomethings here?

00:06:53.198 --> 00:06:55.277
Do not do that.

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:57.279
(Laughter)

00:06:57.418 --> 00:07:00.518
Okay, now that sounds a little flip,
but make no mistake,

00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:02.526
the stakes are very high.

00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:05.161
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,

00:07:05.185 --> 00:07:07.488
there is enormous thirtysomething pressure

00:07:07.512 --> 00:07:11.258
to jump-start a career,
pick a city, partner up,

00:07:11.282 --> 00:07:14.800
and have two or three kids
in a much shorter period of time.

00:07:15.658 --> 00:07:17.866
Many of these things are incompatible,

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.439
and as research is just starting to show,

00:07:20.463 --> 00:07:25.066
simply harder and more stressful to do
all at once in our 30s.

00:07:26.828 --> 00:07:30.672
The post-millennial midlife crisis
isn't buying a red sports car.

00:07:31.608 --> 00:07:35.640
It's realizing you can't have
that career you now want.

00:07:36.482 --> 00:07:39.649
It's realizing you can't have
that child you now want,

00:07:39.673 --> 00:07:41.863
or you can't give your child a sibling.

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:45.594
Too many thirtysomethings
and fortysomethings

00:07:45.618 --> 00:07:49.620
look at themselves, and at me,
sitting across the room,

00:07:49.644 --> 00:07:51.714
and say about their 20s,

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:55.364
"What was I doing? What was I thinking?"

00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:00.785
I want to change what twentysomethings
are doing and thinking.

00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:03.326
Here's a story about how that can go.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.105
It's a story about a woman named Emma.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.874
At 25, Emma came to my office

00:08:09.898 --> 00:08:14.350
because she was, in her words,
having an identity crisis.

00:08:15.192 --> 00:08:18.582
She said she thought she might
like to work in art or entertainment,

00:08:18.606 --> 00:08:20.167
but she hadn't decided yet,

00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:23.935
so she'd spent the last few years
waiting tables instead.

00:08:25.118 --> 00:08:27.475
Because it was cheaper,
she lived with a boyfriend

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:30.631
who displayed his temper
more than his ambition.

00:08:31.537 --> 00:08:33.280
And as hard as her 20s were,

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.386
her early life had been even harder.

00:08:36.346 --> 00:08:38.212
She often cried in our sessions,

00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:40.437
but then would collect herself by saying,

00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:43.605
"You can't pick your family,
but you can pick your friends."

00:08:45.145 --> 00:08:48.390
Well one day, Emma comes in
and she hangs her head in her lap,

00:08:48.414 --> 00:08:51.532
and she sobbed for most of the hour.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.257
She'd just bought a new address book,

00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:57.957
and she'd spent the morning
filling in her many contacts,

00:08:57.981 --> 00:09:00.591
but then she'd been left
staring at that empty blank

00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:02.305
that comes after the words

00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:05.059
"In case of emergency, please call ..."

00:09:06.808 --> 00:09:09.540
She was nearly hysterical
when she looked at me and said,

00:09:09.564 --> 00:09:12.840
"Who's going to be there for me
if I get in a car wreck?

00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:15.741
Who's going to take care of me
if I have cancer?"

00:09:17.118 --> 00:09:19.623
Now in that moment,
it took everything I had

00:09:19.647 --> 00:09:21.301
not to say, "I will."

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.995
But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist
who really, really cared.

00:09:26.372 --> 00:09:30.293
Emma needed a better life,
and I knew this was her chance.

00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:34.633
I had learned too much
since I first worked with Alex

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:38.243
to just sit there
while Emma's defining decade

00:09:38.267 --> 00:09:39.740
went parading by.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.103
So over the next weeks and months,

00:09:43.127 --> 00:09:45.650
I told Emma three things

00:09:45.674 --> 00:09:48.809
that every twentysomething,
male or female,

00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:50.481
deserves to hear.

00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:55.982
First, I told Emma to forget
about having an identity crisis

00:09:56.006 --> 00:09:58.353
and get some identity capital.

00:09:59.273 --> 00:10:00.923
By "get identity capital,"

00:10:00.947 --> 00:10:04.567
I mean do something
that adds value to who you are.

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:07.080
Do something that's an investment

00:10:07.104 --> 00:10:09.420
in who you might want to be next.

00:10:10.555 --> 00:10:12.906
I didn't know the future of Emma's career,

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.167
and no one knows the future of work,

00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:16.860
but I do know this:

00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:20.110
Identity capital begets identity capital.

00:10:20.632 --> 00:10:23.390
So now is the time
for that cross-country job,

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:26.162
that internship, that startup
you want to try.

00:10:26.924 --> 00:10:30.353
I'm not discounting
twentysomething exploration here,

00:10:30.377 --> 00:10:35.327
but I am discounting exploration
that's not supposed to count,

00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:37.962
which, by the way, is not exploration.

00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:39.930
That's procrastination.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.238
I told Emma to explore
work and make it count.

00:10:46.676 --> 00:10:50.832
Second, I told Emma
that the urban tribe is overrated.

00:10:51.915 --> 00:10:54.866
Best friends are great
for giving rides to the airport,

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.644
but twentysomethings who huddle together
with like-minded peers

00:10:58.668 --> 00:11:00.149
limit who they know,

00:11:00.173 --> 00:11:02.547
what they know, how they think,

00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:04.971
how they speak, and where they work.

00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:08.749
That new piece of capital,
that new person to date

00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:12.452
almost always comes
from outside the inner circle.

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:15.974
New things come
from what are called our weak ties,

00:11:15.998 --> 00:11:18.215
our friends of friends of friends.

00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:23.009
So yes, half of twentysomethings
are un- or under-employed.

00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:25.047
But half aren't,

00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:28.030
and weak ties are how
you get yourself into that group.

00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:31.400
Half of new jobs are never posted,

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:35.929
so reaching out to your neighbor's boss
is how you get that unposted job.

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:40.367
It's not cheating. It's the science
of how information spreads.

00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:43.425
Last but not least, Emma believed

00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:46.623
that you can't pick your family,
but you can pick your friends.

00:11:47.338 --> 00:11:49.184
Now this was true for her growing up,

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:52.472
but as a twentysomething,
soon Emma would pick her family

00:11:52.496 --> 00:11:56.256
when she partnered with someone
and created a family of her own.

00:11:57.335 --> 00:12:01.023
I told Emma the time
to start picking your family is now.

00:12:02.404 --> 00:12:06.546
Now you may be thinking that 30
is actually a better time to settle down

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.697
than 20, or even 25,

00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:11.047
and I agree with you.

00:12:11.674 --> 00:12:14.603
But grabbing whoever you're living
with or sleeping with

00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:17.714
when everyone on Facebook
starts walking down the aisle

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:19.696
is not progress.

00:12:20.994 --> 00:12:24.484
The best time to work on your marriage
is before you have one,

00:12:24.508 --> 00:12:27.291
and that means being
as intentional with love

00:12:27.315 --> 00:12:28.923
as you are with work.

00:12:29.825 --> 00:12:32.352
Picking your family
is about consciously choosing

00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:34.626
who and what you want

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.202
rather than just making it work
or killing time

00:12:38.226 --> 00:12:40.739
with whoever happens to be choosing you.

00:12:41.963 --> 00:12:43.630
So what happened to Emma?

00:12:44.035 --> 00:12:46.225
Well, we went through that address book,

00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:48.142
and she found an old roommate's cousin

00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:50.903
who worked at an art museum
in another state.

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:54.346
That weak tie helped her get a job there.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.288
That job offer gave her the reason
to leave that live-in boyfriend.

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:02.998
Now, five years later, she's a special
events planner for museums.

00:13:03.022 --> 00:13:06.375
She's married to a man
she mindfully chose.

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:09.451
She loves her new career,
she loves her new family,

00:13:09.475 --> 00:13:11.598
and she sent me a card that said,

00:13:11.622 --> 00:13:13.610
"Now the emergency contact blanks

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:15.473
don't seem big enough."

00:13:17.407 --> 00:13:19.678
Now Emma's story made that sound easy,

00:13:19.702 --> 00:13:22.512
but that's what I love about working
with twentysomethings.

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:24.161
They are so easy to help.

00:13:24.923 --> 00:13:28.549
Twentysomethings are like airplanes
just leaving LAX,

00:13:28.573 --> 00:13:30.536
bound for somewhere west.

00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:34.213
Right after takeoff,
a slight change in course

00:13:34.237 --> 00:13:38.293
is the difference between landing
in Alaska or Fiji.

00:13:39.678 --> 00:13:44.871
Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,

00:13:44.895 --> 00:13:47.673
one good conversation, one good break,

00:13:47.697 --> 00:13:50.980
one good TED Talk,
can have an enormous effect

00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:54.373
across years and even generations to come.

00:13:55.762 --> 00:13:57.588
So here's an idea worth spreading

00:13:57.612 --> 00:13:59.753
to every twentysomething you know.

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:03.038
It's as simple as what I learned
to say to Alex.

00:14:03.062 --> 00:14:05.279
It's what I now have the privilege

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:09.132
of saying to twentysomethings
like Emma every single day:

00:14:10.456 --> 00:14:14.118
Thirty is not the new 20,
so claim your adulthood,

00:14:14.142 --> 00:14:17.715
get some identity capital,
use your weak ties,

00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:19.364
pick your family.

00:14:20.106 --> 00:14:22.509
Don't be defined by what you didn't know

00:14:22.533 --> 00:14:23.601
or didn't do.

00:14:24.102 --> 00:14:26.684
You're deciding your life right now.

00:14:27.308 --> 00:14:28.318
Thank you.

00:14:28.342 --> 00:14:31.764
(Applause)
