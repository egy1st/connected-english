00:00:00.892 --> 00:00:04.180
"Don't talk to strangers."

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.219
You have heard that phrase uttered

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:10.532
by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.

00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:13.444
It's a norm. It's a social norm.

00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:15.802
But it's a special kind of social norm,

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.332
because it's a social norm that wants to tell us

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:22.796
who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:25.300
"Don't talk to strangers" says,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.476
"Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.891
Stick with the people you know.

00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.865
Stick with people like you."

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:37.217
How appealing is that?

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:40.442
It's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:43.226
When we're at our best, we reach out to people

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:44.844
who are not like us,

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.711
because when we do that, we learn from people

00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:49.980
who are not like us.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.081
My phrase for this value of being with "not like us"

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.953
is "strangeness,"

00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:59.853
and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world,

00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:03.219
strangers are quite frankly not the point.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.402
The point that we should be worried about is,

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.289
how much strangeness are we getting?

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.295
Why strangeness? Because our social relations

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:14.089
are increasingly mediated by data,

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:18.646
and data turns our social relations into digital relations,

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:20.995
and that means that our digital relations

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:24.797
now depend extraordinarily on technology

00:01:24.797 --> 00:01:27.715
to bring to them a sense of robustness,

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:29.302
a sense of discovery,

00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:32.572
a sense of surprise and unpredictability.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.339
Why not strangers?

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:36.633
Because strangers are part of a world

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:38.898
of really rigid boundaries.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.850
They belong to a world of people I know

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.364
versus people I don't know,

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:46.843
and in the context of my digital relations,

00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:50.864
I'm already doing things with people I don't know.

00:01:50.864 --> 00:01:54.082
The question isn't whether or not I know you.

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:56.586
The question is, what can I do with you?

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:59.195
What can I learn with you?

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:03.496
What can we do together that benefits us both?

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:05.858
I spend a lot of time thinking about

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:08.618
how the social landscape is changing,

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:11.090
how new technologies create new constraints

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.880
and new opportunities for people.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.531
The most important changes facing us today

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:19.337
have to do with data and what data is doing

00:02:19.337 --> 00:02:21.442
to shape the kinds of digital relations

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.906
that will be possible for us in the future.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:26.139
The economies of the future depend on that.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.058
Our social lives in the future depend on that.

00:02:29.058 --> 00:02:32.090
The threat to worry about isn't strangers.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.202
The threat to worry about is whether or not

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:37.194
we're getting our fair share of strangeness.

00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:39.786
Now, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists

00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:41.939
were thinking about strangers,

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.676
but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations,

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:46.045
and they were thinking about strangers

00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:48.999
in the context of influencing practices.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.747
Stanley Milgram from the '60s and '70s,

00:02:51.747 --> 00:02:53.733
the creator of the small-world experiments,

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:56.687
which became later popularized as six degrees of separation,

00:02:56.687 --> 00:03:00.199
made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.921
were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:06.951
His point was that strangers are out there.

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:08.523
We can reach them. There are paths

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:11.209
that enable us to reach them.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.978
Mark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973

00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:17.776
in his seminal essay "The Strength of Weak Ties,"

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:20.602
made the point that these weak ties

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:23.089
that are a part of our networks, these strangers,

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.081
are actually more effective at diffusing information to us

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.617
than are our strong ties, the people closest to us.

00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:34.114
He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.743
when he says that these people who are so close to us,

00:03:36.743 --> 00:03:38.676
these strong ties in our lives,

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:42.103
actually have a homogenizing effect on us.

00:03:42.103 --> 00:03:44.938
They produce sameness.

00:03:44.938 --> 00:03:47.777
My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years

00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:50.393
looking at the ways in which digital platforms

00:03:50.393 --> 00:03:52.264
are reshaping our everyday lives,

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:54.881
what kinds of new routines are possible.

00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:56.177
We've been looking specifically at the kinds

00:03:56.177 --> 00:03:58.888
of digital platforms that have enabled us

00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:02.023
to take our possessions, those things that used to be

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:05.145
very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses,

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.967
and to make them available to people we don't know.

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:11.690
Whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.313
whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music,

00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:17.306
we are able to take our possessions now

00:04:17.306 --> 00:04:20.737
and make them available to people we've never met.

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:23.548
And we concluded a very important insight,

00:04:23.548 --> 00:04:25.336
which was that as people's relationships

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:27.877
to the things in their lives change,

00:04:27.877 --> 00:04:31.321
so do their relations with other people.

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:32.729
And yet recommendation system

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.004
after recommendation system continues to miss the boat.

00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:39.553
It continues to try to predict what I need

00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:42.793
based on some past characterization of who I am,

00:04:42.793 --> 00:04:45.089
of what I've already done.

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:47.593
Security technology after security technology

00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:49.769
continues to design data protection

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:52.174
in terms of threats and attacks,

00:04:52.174 --> 00:04:55.769
keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:58.265
Categories like "friends" and "family"

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.742
and "contacts" and "colleagues"

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:04.529
don't tell me anything about my actual relations.

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.773
A more effective way to think about my relations

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:09.465
might be in terms of closeness and distance,

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:13.285
where at any given point in time, with any single person,

00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:16.776
I am both close and distant from that individual,

00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:21.284
all as a function of what I need to do right now.

00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:23.922
People aren't close or distant.

00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:26.983
People are always a combination of the two,

00:05:26.983 --> 00:05:30.703
and that combination is constantly changing.

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:33.143
What if technologies could intervene

00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:37.120
to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.081
What if technologies could intervene

00:05:39.081 --> 00:05:43.492
to help me find the person that I need right now?

00:05:43.492 --> 00:05:45.916
Strangeness is that calibration

00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:48.135
of closeness and distance

00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:52.038
that enables me to find the people that I need right now,

00:05:52.038 --> 00:05:55.028
that enables me to find the sources of intimacy,

00:05:55.028 --> 00:05:59.676
of discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.

00:05:59.676 --> 00:06:01.985
Strangeness is not about meeting strangers.

00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:04.180
It simply makes the point that we need

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.462
to disrupt our zones of familiarity.

00:06:07.462 --> 00:06:11.119
So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness,

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:13.823
and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today,

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:16.053
but also by organizations,

00:06:16.053 --> 00:06:20.576
organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.

00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:22.682
Whether you're a political party

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:25.550
insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.938
of who belongs and who does not,

00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:29.431
whether you're the government

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:32.129
protecting social institutions like marriage

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.022
and restricting access of those institutions to the few,

00:06:36.022 --> 00:06:38.430
whether you're a teenager in her bedroom

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.618
who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents,

00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:44.780
strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.254
to new kinds of relations.

00:06:47.254 --> 00:06:50.612
We have to change the norms.

00:06:50.612 --> 00:06:53.642
We have to change the norms in order to enable

00:06:53.642 --> 00:06:55.580
new kinds of technologies

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.369
as a basis for new kinds of businesses.

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:02.102
What interesting questions lie ahead for us

00:07:02.102 --> 00:07:04.773
in this world of no strangers?

00:07:04.773 --> 00:07:08.579
How might we think differently about our relations with people?

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:11.700
How might we think differently about our relations

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.792
with distributed groups of people?

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:18.233
How might we think differently about our relations with technologies,

00:07:18.233 --> 00:07:21.239
things that effectively become social participants

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:23.313
in their own right?

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:27.126
The range of digital relations is extraordinary.

00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:31.683
In the context of this broad range of digital relations,

00:07:31.683 --> 00:07:34.657
safely seeking strangeness might very well be

00:07:34.657 --> 00:07:36.928
a new basis for that innovation.

00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:38.398
Thank you.

00:07:38.398 --> 00:07:43.291
(Applause)
