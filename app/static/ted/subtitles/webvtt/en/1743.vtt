00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:02.041
Hey guys.

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.811
It's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver,

00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:05.751
because that was, like, I loved it,

00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:11.071
and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill

00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.792
and I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden."

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:17.943
And -- (Drilling noise) (Laughter)

00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:20.875
And it worked really well there.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.696
And you know, it had a profound effect on me.

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:26.924
It sounds silly, but I thought, okay,

00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:29.796
the way the world works can be changed,

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.947
and it can be changed by me in these small ways.

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:33.661
And my relationship to

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:35.153
especially human-made objects

00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:37.038
which someone else said they work like this,

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:40.188
well, I can say they work a different way, a little bit.

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.686
And so, about 20 years later,

00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:44.194
I didn't realize the full effect of this,

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:45.971
but I went to Costa Rica

00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:48.138
and I stayed with these Guaymí natives there,

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:51.640
and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.809
and they could make beds out of trees,

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.043
and they could -- I watched this woman for three days.

00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:00.290
I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.427
these little threads off of it, and she'd roll the threads together

00:01:03.427 --> 00:01:06.145
and make little thicker threads, like strings,

00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:08.966
and she would weave the strings together,

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.446
and as the materiality of this exact very bag

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:15.334
formed before my eyes over those three days,

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:18.641
the materiality of the way the world works,

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.115
of reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind,

00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:24.463
because I realized that this bag and these clothes

00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:26.847
and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener,

00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:30.980
everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.324
or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to,

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:37.235
maybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way.

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:39.427
And so I had to start studying,

00:01:39.427 --> 00:01:41.137
who is it that's making these decisions?

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:42.946
Who's making these things? How did they make them?

00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:44.440
What stops us from making them?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.345
Because this is how reality is created.

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:49.932
So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab,

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:52.481
and I was studying the maker movement

00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:54.031
and makers and creativity.

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.158
And I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:59.203
doing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers.

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.548
So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,

00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:05.800
where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.287
and willing to try anything.

00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:09.580
So I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.609
and just put stuff together, you know, make something,

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.196
I don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you.

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:15.845
We won't bring anything with us.

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:18.364
And, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults

00:02:18.364 --> 00:02:19.452
and teens to do.

00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:22.587
Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream,

00:02:22.587 --> 00:02:25.171
and the shape of an oak leaf being made

00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.365
by other small oak leaves being put together.

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:31.102
A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.

00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:33.798
The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:37.170
being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.735
And after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects

00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:43.962
like leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:45.806
and put in a circle like a wreath.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:48.422
And the creator of this, he said,

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:50.092
"This is fire. I call this fire."

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:52.319
And someone asked him, "How do you get those sticks

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080
to stay on that tree?"

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.190
And he's like, "I don't know, but I can show you."

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.822
And I'm like, "Wow, that's really amazing.

00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:00.205
He doesn't know, but he can show you."

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:02.785
So his hands know and his intuition knows,

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:05.641
but sometimes what we know gets in the way

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:07.678
of what could be, especially

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.605
when it comes to the human-made, human-built world.

00:03:10.605 --> 00:03:12.902
We think we already know how something works,

00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:15.045
so we can't imagine how it could work.

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:16.391
We know how it's supposed to work,

00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:19.798
so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible.

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:23.645
So kids don't have as hard of a time with this,

00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:26.930
and I saw in my own son, I gave him this book.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.138
I'm a good hippie dad, so I'm like,

00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:31.315
"Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon.

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:33.648
I'm going to give you some building blocks

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:36.798
and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks,

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:38.612
so it's totally legit."

00:03:38.612 --> 00:03:40.886
But he doesn't really know what to do with these.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.458
I didn't show him.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:43.966
And so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this."

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:47.869
This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest.

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.341
Just going to try to put them in shapes

00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:52.117
and push on them and stuff.

00:03:52.117 --> 00:03:54.781
And before long, he's kind of got this mechanism

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:58.451
where you can almost launch and catapult objects around,

00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:00.716
and he enlists us in helping him.

00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:02.651
And at this point, I'm starting to wonder,

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.452
what kind of tools can we give people,

00:04:05.452 --> 00:04:08.406
especially adults, who know too much,

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:10.697
so that they can see the world as malleable,

00:04:10.697 --> 00:04:12.174
so they see themselves as agents of change

00:04:12.174 --> 00:04:13.636
in their everyday lives.

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:16.122
Because the most advanced scientists are really

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.854
just kind of pushing the way the world itself works,

00:04:18.854 --> 00:04:20.031
pushing what matter can do,

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.812
the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium,

00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:24.758
and any sufficiently complicated task,

00:04:24.758 --> 00:04:27.683
whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child --

00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:29.369
anything that's complicated --

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.896
comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it,

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.222
and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say,

00:04:35.222 --> 00:04:37.350
"Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.029
I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing.

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.214
I'm going to use them a different way."

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:47.013
So let me show you a little demo.

00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:51.575
This is a little piano circuit right in here,

00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:53.666
and this is an ordinary paintbrush

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:56.661
that I smashed it together with. (Beeping)

00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:58.524
And so, with some ketchup,

00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:01.998
— (musical notes) —

00:05:01.998 --> 00:05:03.287
and then I can kind of

00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:09.782
— (musical notes) —

00:05:09.782 --> 00:05:11.741
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.464
And that's awesome, right?

00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:15.774
But this is not what's awesome.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.336
What's awesome is what happens

00:05:17.336 --> 00:05:20.755
when you give the piano circuit to people.

00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:22.138
A pencil is not just a pencil.

00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:23.806
Look what it has in the middle of it.

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:26.558
That's a wire running down the middle,

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:27.999
and not only is it a wire,

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.359
if you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:32.298
into the middle of a pencil,

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:35.218
and you can lay out wire on the page, too,

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:37.639
and get electrical current to run through it.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.521
And so you can kind of hack a pencil,

00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:45.042
just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:46.982
And the electricity runs through your body too.

00:05:46.982 --> 00:05:50.328
And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil.

00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:53.782
You can make one of these brushes just on the fly.

00:05:53.782 --> 00:05:55.589
All you do is connect to the bristles,

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.581
and the bristles are wet, so they conduct,

00:05:57.581 --> 00:06:00.150
and the person's body conducts,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.149
and leather is great to paint on,

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:04.854
and then you can start hooking to everything,

00:06:04.854 --> 00:06:05.849
even the kitchen sink.

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.768
The metal in the sink is conductive.

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:11.321
Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin.

00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:16.303
(Musical notes)

00:06:16.303 --> 00:06:17.557
And you can even hook to the trees.

00:06:17.557 --> 00:06:20.953
Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive,

00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:22.727
and you can use those together.

00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:24.183
So — (Laughter) —

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:27.338
I took this to those same teens, because those teens are

00:06:27.338 --> 00:06:29.795
really awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try.

00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:32.778
I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.

00:06:32.778 --> 00:06:36.799
And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper,

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:39.212
and as the hula hoop traveled around her body,

00:06:39.212 --> 00:06:41.983
she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.

00:06:41.983 --> 00:06:44.024
You can see her pointing to it in the picture.

00:06:44.024 --> 00:06:46.440
And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.623
it would connect two little pieces of copper tape,

00:06:48.623 --> 00:06:50.359
and it would make a sound, and the next sound,

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:52.895
and it would loop the same sounds over and over again.

00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:54.824
I ran these workshops everywhere.

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:57.834
In Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.496
made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:03.280
and some electrical tape and hot glue.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.361
And professional designers were making artifacts

00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:07.140
with this thing strapped onto it.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.354
And big companies like Intel

00:07:09.354 --> 00:07:13.007
or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump,

00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:14.559
were inviting me to give workshops,

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.954
just to practice this idea of smashing electronics

00:07:16.954 --> 00:07:18.786
and everyday objects together.

00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:21.447
And then we came up with this idea

00:07:21.447 --> 00:07:23.235
to not just use electronics,

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:26.207
but let's just smash computers with everyday objects

00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:28.767
and see how that goes over.

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:32.366
And so I just want to do a quick demo.

00:07:32.366 --> 00:07:34.991
So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit,

00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:37.890
and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.923
So I'll just plug it in, and now it's on by USB.

00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:44.560
And I'll just hook up the forward arrow.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.001
You guys are facing that way, so I'll hook it to this one.

00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:51.647
And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it.

00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:54.171
And now, if I touch this piece of pizza,

00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:57.235
the slides that I showed you before should go forward.

00:07:57.235 --> 00:08:00.667
And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.939
to the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up,

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:06.960
now I have a left arrow and a right arrow,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.160
so I should be able to go forwards and backwards

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.264
and forwards and backwards. Awesome.

00:08:12.264 --> 00:08:14.808
And so we're like, "We gotta put a video out about this."

00:08:14.808 --> 00:08:17.376
Because no one really believed that this was important

00:08:17.376 --> 00:08:20.355
or meaningful except me and, like, one other guy.

00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:22.040
So we made a video to prove that

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.580
there's lots of stuff you can do.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.612
You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh

00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:29.546
and just Google for game controllers.

00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:32.233
Just ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special.

00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:33.934
And you can literally draw joysticks

00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:41.057
and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up. (Video game noises)

00:08:41.057 --> 00:08:44.560
And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.768
Well, if you take those out, they hold water great,

00:08:46.768 --> 00:08:48.904
but you can totally cut your toes,

00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:51.592
so yeah, just be careful.

00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:54.464
You know the Happiness Project, where the experts

00:08:54.464 --> 00:08:57.222
are setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is?

00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:58.432
Well, I think it's cool,

00:08:58.432 --> 00:09:00.775
but we should be doing that stuff ourselves.

00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:03.858
It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works.

00:09:03.858 --> 00:09:05.833
We should all be participating

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:07.753
in changing the way the world works together.

00:09:07.753 --> 00:09:09.940
Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.124
Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS.

00:09:13.124 --> 00:09:15.184
Hover the mouse over the "take a photo" button,

00:09:15.184 --> 00:09:16.759
and you've got a little cat photo booth.

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:19.448
And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this.

00:09:19.448 --> 00:09:22.536
If hundreds of people didn't buy this, we couldn't put it on the market.

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:25.437
And so we put it up on Kickstarter,

00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:28.432
and hundreds of people bought it in the first day.

00:09:28.432 --> 00:09:29.458
And then 30 days later,

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:32.725
11,000 people had backed the project.

00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:34.840
And then what the best part is, we started getting

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.912
a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.574
So this is "The Star-Spangled Banner" by eating lunch,

00:09:41.574 --> 00:09:43.648
including drinking Listerine.

00:09:43.648 --> 00:09:45.114
And we actually sent this guy materials.

00:09:45.114 --> 00:09:46.595
We're like, "We're sponsoring you, man.

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:48.705
You're, like, a pro maker."

00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:52.320
Okay, just wait for this one. This is good.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.139
(Laughter)

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:57.624
(Applause)

00:09:57.624 --> 00:09:59.501
And these guys at the exploratorium are

00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:02.466
playing house plants as if they were drums.

00:10:04.723 --> 00:10:08.297
And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways.

00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:10.649
And then this brother -- look at this diagram.

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:11.937
See where it says "sister"?

00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:14.393
I love when people put humans on the diagram.

00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:16.861
I always add humans to any technical --

00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:18.993
if you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:23.463
And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister

00:10:23.463 --> 00:10:25.536
so that on her birthday, she could be the star of the show,

00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:28.281
jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides.

00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:31.289
And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.579
And this is fun,

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:39.466
and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun?

00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:41.986
But it's also very serious because

00:10:41.986 --> 00:10:44.154
all this accessibility stuff started coming up,

00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:47.110
where people can't use computers, necessarily.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.802
Like this dad who wrote us, his son has cerebral palsy

00:10:49.802 --> 00:10:51.674
and he can't use a normal keyboard.

00:10:51.674 --> 00:10:55.245
And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford

00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:57.087
to buy all these custom controllers.

00:10:57.087 --> 00:10:58.713
And so, with the MaKey MaKey, he planned to make

00:10:58.713 --> 00:11:01.607
these gloves to allow him to navigate the web.

00:11:01.607 --> 00:11:03.767
And a huge eruption of discussion

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:06.722
around accessibility came, and we're really excited about that.

00:11:06.722 --> 00:11:08.623
We didn't plan for that at all.

00:11:08.623 --> 00:11:11.431
And then all these professional musicians started using it,

00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:13.559
like at Coachella, just this weekend

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:16.711
Jurassic 5 was using this onstage,

00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:20.412
and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here,

00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:22.423
and he put this up last month.

00:11:22.423 --> 00:11:24.527
And I love the carrot on the turntable.

00:11:24.527 --> 00:11:31.355
(Music: Massive Attack — "Teardrop")

00:11:31.355 --> 00:11:34.101
Most people cannot play them that way. (Laughter)

00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:35.523
And when this started to get serious,

00:11:35.523 --> 00:11:38.950
I thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in,

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.652
because otherwise people are going to be getting this

00:11:40.652 --> 00:11:42.891
and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change,

00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:44.183
and governments will be crumbling,

00:11:44.183 --> 00:11:46.542
and I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.

00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:48.871
And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid

00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:51.731
of the box, it says, "The world is a construction kit."

00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:53.578
And as you start to mess around this way,

00:11:53.578 --> 00:11:56.677
I think that, in some small ways, you do start to see

00:11:56.677 --> 00:11:58.729
the landscape of your everyday life

00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:01.622
a little bit more like something you could express yourself with,

00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:03.861
and a little bit more like you could participate

00:12:03.861 --> 00:12:06.325
in designing the future of the way the world works.

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:10.113
And so next time you're on an escalator

00:12:10.113 --> 00:12:11.789
and you drop an M&amp;M by accident,

00:12:11.789 --> 00:12:14.949
you know, maybe that's an M&amp;M surfboard, not an escalator,

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:16.156
so don't pick it up right away.

00:12:16.156 --> 00:12:18.344
Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets

00:12:18.344 --> 00:12:21.653
and throw it down, and maybe some chapstick, whatever.

00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:26.615
I used to want to design a utopian society

00:12:26.615 --> 00:12:28.987
or a perfect world or something like that.

00:12:28.987 --> 00:12:30.441
But as I'm kind of getting older

00:12:30.441 --> 00:12:32.017
and kind of messing with all this stuff,

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:34.785
I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world

00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:36.801
really can't be designed by one person

00:12:36.801 --> 00:12:38.357
or even by a million experts.

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:41.525
It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands,

00:12:41.525 --> 00:12:43.933
each following their own passions,

00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:46.121
and each kind of like a mosaic coming up

00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:47.622
and creating this world in their backyards

00:12:47.622 --> 00:12:49.130
and in their kitchens.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.696
And that's the world I really want to live in.

00:12:51.696 --> 00:12:53.080
Thank you.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.611
(Applause)
