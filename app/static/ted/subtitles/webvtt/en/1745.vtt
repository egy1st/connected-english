00:00:00.972 --> 00:00:03.115
Okay, it's great to be back at TED.

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:05.699
Why don't I just start by firing away with the video?

00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:10.442
(Music)

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:15.573
(Video) Man: Okay, Glass, record a video.

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:19.464
Woman: This is it. We're on in two minutes.

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:23.284
Man 2: Okay Glass, hang out with The Flying Club.

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:28.033
Man 3: Google "photos of tiger heads." Hmm.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.437
Man 4: You ready? You ready? (Barking)

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:36.981
Woman 2: Right there. Okay, Glass, take a picture.

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:39.524
(Child shouting)

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:50.149
Man 5: Go!

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:54.735
Man 6: Holy [beep]! That is awesome.

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:57.370
Child: Whoa! Look at that snake!

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.502
Woman 3: Okay, Glass, record a video!

00:01:06.678 --> 00:01:10.530
Man 7: After this bridge, first exit.

00:01:33.813 --> 00:01:37.164
Man 8: Okay, A12, right there!

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:40.405
(Applause)

00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:45.653
(Children singing)

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.228
Man 9: Google, say "delicious" in Thai.

00:01:50.228 --> 00:01:53.441
Google Glass: อร่อยMan 9: Mmm, อร่อย.

00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:57.473
Woman 4: Google "jellyfish."

00:01:57.473 --> 00:02:01.813
(Music)

00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:11.730
Man 10: It's beautiful.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.473
(Applause)

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:25.377
Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:30.028
He needs help getting 10 million dollars.

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:31.278
I like to pay attention to these

00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:33.946
because that's how we originally funded the company,

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:38.067
and it's gone pretty well.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:39.793
Though in all seriousness,

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.985
this position that you just saw me in,

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:45.417
looking down at my phone,

00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:49.609
that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.191
Because we ultimately questioned

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.707
whether this is the ultimate future

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.697
of how you want to connect to other people in your life,

00:02:57.697 --> 00:03:00.051
how you want to connect to information.

00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:03.745
Should it be by just walking around looking down?

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.633
But that was the vision behind Glass,

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:13.262
and that's why we've created this form factor.

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:21.955
Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot,

00:03:21.955 --> 00:03:23.323
but I want to tell you a little bit more

00:03:23.323 --> 00:03:27.021
about the motivation behind what led to it.

00:03:27.021 --> 00:03:31.282
In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself

00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:33.839
when you're out and about looking at your phone,

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:38.697
it's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:40.330
You're standing around there

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.698
and you're just rubbing

00:03:41.698 --> 00:03:43.531
this featureless piece of glass.

00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:46.255
You're just kind of moving around.

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:49.724
So when we developed Glass, we thought really about,

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:52.921
can we make something that frees your hands?

00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:54.404
You saw all of the things people are doing

00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:55.947
in the video back there.

00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:57.032
They were all wearing Glass,

00:03:57.032 --> 00:04:00.087
and that's how we got that footage.

00:04:00.087 --> 00:04:03.186
And also you want something that frees your eyes.

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:05.908
That's why we put the display up high,

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:07.357
out of your line of sight,

00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.084
so it wouldn't be where you're looking

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:11.184
and it wouldn't be where you're making

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.305
eye contact with people.

00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:16.183
And also we wanted to free up the ears,

00:04:16.183 --> 00:04:20.189
so the sound actually goes through,

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.686
conducts straight to the bones in your cranium,

00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:27.230
which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.693
And ironically, if you want to hear it better,

00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:32.334
you actually just cover your ear,

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:37.446
which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works.

00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:40.487
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago

00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:41.804
was that eventually you wouldn't

00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:45.277
have to have a search query at all.

00:04:45.277 --> 00:04:48.567
You'd just have information come to you as you needed it.

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:50.965
And this is now, 15 years later,

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.405
sort of the first form factor

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:55.070
that I think can deliver that vision

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.745
when you're out and about on the street

00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:00.501
talking to people and so forth.

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:04.047
This project has lasted now, been just over two years.

00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:06.557
We've learned an amazing amount.

00:05:06.557 --> 00:05:09.573
It's been really important to make it comfortable.

00:05:09.573 --> 00:05:13.652
So our first prototypes we built were huge.

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:15.861
It was like cell phones strapped to your head.

00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:18.920
It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.121
We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.925
until she actually accepted the job,

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:27.209
and then she almost ran away screaming.

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.781
But we've come a long way.

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.869
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.366
Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all,

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:38.531
but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments

00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:41.093
spent with my family, my kids.

00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:43.726
I just never would have dug out a camera

00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:46.285
or a phone or something else to take that moment.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:51.334
And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device,

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:55.399
that I also kind of have a nervous tic.

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.443
The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that,

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:01.940
but it's also kind of a nervous habit.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.887
Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.

00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:07.305
I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:10.726
You know, I'd be like --

00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:12.801
But in this case, you know, I whip this out

00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.829
and I sit there and look as if I have something

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:17.642
very important to do or attend to.

00:06:17.642 --> 00:06:20.866
But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:25.271
I spent just secluding away,

00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:28.483
be it email or social posts or whatnot,

00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:29.930
even though it wasn't really --

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.911
there's nothing really that important or that pressing.

00:06:32.911 --> 00:06:35.614
And with this, I know I will get certain messages

00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:37.116
if I really need them,

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:41.211
but I don't have to be checking them all the time.

00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:44.191
Yeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more,

00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:48.912
doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video.

00:06:48.912 --> 00:06:50.940
Thank you all very much.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.971
(Applause)
