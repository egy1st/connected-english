00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:02.665
So, when I was in art school,

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:04.084
I developed a shake in my hand,

00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:07.116
and this was the straightest line I could draw.

00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:09.767
Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.956
like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:15.654
but at the time this was really doomsday.

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:19.271
This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:21.641
The shake developed out of, really,

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:23.548
a single-minded pursuit of pointillism,

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:26.102
just years of making tiny, tiny dots.

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:29.996
And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:33.684
to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:35.929
So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter,

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.244
and this progressively made the shake worse,

00:00:38.244 --> 00:00:40.516
so I'd hold the pen tighter still.

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:42.732
And this became a vicious cycle that ended up

00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:44.956
causing so much pain and joint issues,

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:47.172
I had trouble holding anything.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:50.557
And after spending all my life wanting to do art,

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:55.168
I left art school, and then I left art completely.

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:57.628
But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art,

00:00:57.628 --> 00:00:59.920
and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.780
and discovered I had permanent nerve damage.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.509
And he actually took one look at my squiggly line,

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.932
and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?"

00:01:08.932 --> 00:01:11.542
So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil,

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.450
and I just started letting my hand shake and shake.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.544
I was making all these scribble pictures.

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:17.374
And even though it wasn't the kind of art

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:21.030
that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.509
And more importantly, once I embraced the shake,

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.884
I realized I could still make art.

00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:27.154
I just had to find a different approach

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.507
to making the art that I wanted.

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:32.347
Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism,

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:34.176
seeing these little tiny dots come together

00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:36.157
to make this unified whole.

00:01:36.157 --> 00:01:39.108
So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images

00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:41.286
where the shake wouldn't affect the work,

00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:45.763
like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas,

00:01:45.763 --> 00:01:49.461
or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours,

00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:54.924
creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.

00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:58.268
I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials,

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:00.676
my hand really wouldn't hurt,

00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:04.276
and after having gone from a single approach to art,

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:06.527
I ended up having an approach to creativity

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:10.228
that completely changed my artistic horizons.

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:12.148
This was the first time I'd encountered this idea

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:17.620
that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.036
At the time, I was finishing up school,

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:23.644
and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:27.405
I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:29.515
I could do so much more with the supplies

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:32.047
I thought an artist was supposed to have.

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:34.252
I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.

00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:36.764
I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair

00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:39.012
from the office that I worked at.

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:41.944
So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck,

00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:43.598
I got myself to the art store,

00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:46.712
and I just went nuts buying supplies.

00:02:46.712 --> 00:02:48.340
And then when I got home, I sat down

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.448
and I set myself to task to really try to create something

00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:54.212
just completely outside of the box.

00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:58.636
But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.183
The same thing the next day, and then the next,

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:04.872
quickly slipping into a creative slump.

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:09.120
And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.694
And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able

00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:16.068
to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:18.280
But as I searched around in the darkness,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.808
I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices

00:03:21.808 --> 00:03:24.376
that I never had before.

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:28.099
And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.816
Embrace the shake.

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:33.492
And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back,

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:37.256
I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:39.972
and get back into it.

00:03:39.972 --> 00:03:42.058
I wondered, could you become more creative, then,

00:03:42.058 --> 00:03:44.956
by looking for limitations?

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:50.137
What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?

00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:52.410
At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in --

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.183
well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks —

00:03:55.183 --> 00:03:58.391
but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one,

00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:00.784
so I decided to ask for 50.

00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:02.567
Surprisingly, they just handed them right over,

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:04.555
and then with some pencils I already had,

00:04:04.555 --> 00:04:07.735
I made this project for only 80 cents.

00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:10.271
It really became a moment of clarification for me

00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:13.151
that we need to first be limited

00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:16.199
in order to become limitless.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.207
I took this approach of thinking inside the box

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:20.110
to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.439
painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.023
So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time,

00:04:26.023 --> 00:04:27.223
one on top of another,

00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:31.723
with each picture representing an influence in my life.

00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:34.375
Or what if, instead of painting with a brush,

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:37.127
I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter)

00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:38.603
So I'd dip my hands in paint,

00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:40.023
and I just attacked the canvas,

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:42.732
and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:45.664
and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.

00:04:45.664 --> 00:04:49.027
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:49.027 --> 00:04:53.232
Or, what if instead of relying on myself,

00:04:53.232 --> 00:04:55.165
I had to rely on other people

00:04:55.165 --> 00:04:57.817
to create the content for the art?

00:04:57.817 --> 00:05:00.608
So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.

00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:03.248
I slept on the floor and I ate takeout,

00:05:03.248 --> 00:05:05.553
and I asked people to call me and share a story with me

00:05:05.553 --> 00:05:08.236
about a life-changing moment.

00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:10.688
Their stories became the art

00:05:10.688 --> 00:05:14.200
as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.665
(Applause)

00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:23.161
Or what if instead of making art to display,

00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:25.424
I had to destroy it?

00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:27.696
This seemed like the ultimate limitation,

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:30.188
being an artist without art.

00:05:30.188 --> 00:05:32.736
This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:34.089
that I called Goodbye Art,

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:38.785
where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:40.276
In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on

00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:43.003
forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix,

00:05:43.003 --> 00:05:45.808
made with over 7,000 matches.

00:05:45.808 --> 00:05:46.974
(Laughter)

00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:50.163
Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.

00:05:50.163 --> 00:05:52.776
I looked for temporary materials,

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:54.950
like spitting out food --

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.012
(Laughter) —

00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:02.225
sidewalk chalk

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:06.761
and even frozen wine.

00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:08.822
The last iteration of destruction

00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:12.865
was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:16.208
So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out,

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:19.848
then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles,

00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:23.761
then assembled the videos into the larger image.

00:06:23.761 --> 00:06:28.280
So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.122
It was destroyed before it ever existed.

00:06:32.122 --> 00:06:34.608
In the course of this Goodbye Art series,

00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:37.440
I created 23 different pieces

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.752
with nothing left to physically display.

00:06:40.752 --> 00:06:43.176
What I thought would be the ultimate limitation

00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:46.104
actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation,

00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:48.307
as each time I created,

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:50.319
the destruction brought me back to a neutral place

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.604
where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.

00:06:54.604 --> 00:06:56.960
It did not happen overnight.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.011
There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground,

00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:01.800
or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.312
the end image was kind of embarrassing.

00:07:04.312 --> 00:07:07.032
But having committed to the process, I continued on,

00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:09.043
and something really surprising came out of this.

00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:12.009
As I destroyed each project,

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.841
I was learning to let go,

00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:18.352
let go of outcomes, let go of failures,

00:07:18.352 --> 00:07:20.875
and let go of imperfections.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:23.304
And in return, I found a process of creating art

00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:27.529
that's perpetual and unencumbered by results.

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:29.558
I found myself in a state of constant creation,

00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:32.056
thinking only of what's next

00:07:32.056 --> 00:07:34.952
and coming up with more ideas than ever.

00:07:34.952 --> 00:07:37.437
When I think back to my three years away from art,

00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:40.688
away from my dream, just going through the motions,

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:44.440
instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.640
I just quit, I gave up.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.256
And what if I didn't embrace the shake?

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:52.453
Because embracing the shake for me

00:07:52.453 --> 00:07:55.093
wasn't just about art and having art skills.

00:07:55.093 --> 00:07:59.528
It turned out to be about life, and having life skills.

00:07:59.528 --> 00:08:02.039
Because ultimately, most of what we do

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:07.611
takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.

00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:11.280
Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.359
is the best hope we have to transform ourselves

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:19.224
and, collectively, transform our world.

00:08:19.224 --> 00:08:23.392
Looking at limitations as a source of creativity

00:08:23.392 --> 00:08:26.248
changed the course of my life.

00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:27.939
Now, when I run into a barrier

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:31.048
or I find myself creatively stumped,

00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:32.602
I sometimes still struggle,

00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:34.696
but I continue to show up for the process

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:38.193
and try to remind myself of the possibilities,

00:08:38.193 --> 00:08:42.788
like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image,

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:47.175
using a pushpin to tattoo a banana,

00:08:47.175 --> 00:08:53.198
or painting a picture with hamburger grease.

00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:55.052
(Laughter)

00:08:55.052 --> 00:08:56.659
One of my most recent endeavors

00:08:56.659 --> 00:09:00.103
is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned

00:09:00.103 --> 00:09:03.287
into something others can replicate.

00:09:03.287 --> 00:09:07.144
Limitations may be the most unlikely of places

00:09:07.144 --> 00:09:10.538
to harness creativity, but perhaps

00:09:10.538 --> 00:09:14.208
one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts,

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:18.111
rethink categories and challenge accepted norms.

00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:21.970
And instead of telling each other to seize the day,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.933
maybe we can remind ourselves every day

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:28.447
to seize the limitation.

00:09:28.447 --> 00:09:29.914
Thank you.

00:09:29.914 --> 00:09:35.191
(Applause)
