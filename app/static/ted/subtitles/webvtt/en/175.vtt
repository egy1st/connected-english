00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have a tough job to do.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with their connotations and design, in all its forms,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and with so much and so many people working

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I wanted to build an argument for primary education

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in a very specific context.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
it's like four pieces of a puzzle.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And if I succeed in doing that,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
maybe you would go back with the thought

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the quality of education.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that as you go further and further away

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
What happens to education?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The second, or a different kind of remoteness

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which are socially and economically remote

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What happens to education in that context?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
do not have good enough teachers.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
They do not have good enough infrastructure.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And if they had some infrastructure,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
they have difficulty maintaining it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we hired a car, looked up on Google,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
found a route into northern India from New Delhi

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which, you know, which did not cross any big cities

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But it was quite obvious, quite clear,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that for this particular route that I had taken,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
That seemed a little damning,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
To my surprise, it did not correlate.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because, you know, those are relatively better off areas --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and that sort of thing. It appears that way.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
you know, things like websites, collaborative environments --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
you've been listening to all that in the morning --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and, according to me, biases the result.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So the principal looks at it and says,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that will be a completely different thing.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
but we seem to be doing it the other way about.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the underprivileged first, not the other way about.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the teacher's first reaction is,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and he said something which completely solves this problem.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
then you don't need an alternative education.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I'm going to talk about children and self-organization,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
of what might an alternative education be like.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And what we did over there was pretty much simple.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
They cut a hole inside that wall --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And this is what we saw.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
About eight hours later, we found this kid.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
To the right is this eight-year-old child who --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Is this real? Does the language matter,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
because he's not supposed to know English?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
-- and did anyone teach them?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
The last question is what everybody said, but you know,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and asked the people in your office,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
(Laughter)

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
something moves on the screen --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
where you can do something."

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
to figure out that he was doing things to the television.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
like, children would come and see what's happening over here.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So eight minutes and an embedded computer

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
seemed to be all that we needed there.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So we thought that this is what was happening:

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that children in groups can self-instruct themselves

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
into some Indian language? That's not possible.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So, it has to be the other way about.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I took the experiment out to northeastern India,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to a village called Madantusi,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
where, for some reason, there was no English teacher,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
so the children had not learned English at all.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and came back three months later.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So when I came back there, I found these two kids,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And as soon as they saw me they said,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
"We need a faster processor and a better mouse."

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
(Laughter)

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I was real surprised.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You know, how on earth did they know all this?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
which talks only in English, so we had to learn English."

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
-- mispronounced, but correct usage --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
if they really wanted to.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
India is a good place to do such an experiment in,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and also all the socio-economic diversities.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that would cover practically the whole world.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I also had to check or invent an engineering design

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
so I needed different climates, for which India is also great,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:48.000
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages --

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
the first thing that these children did was to find a website

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to teach themselves the English alphabet.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Then to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
So we had to solve all the problems we had

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
without air conditioning and with very poor power,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
put at the right places to keep the machines running.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
telling his eldest sister what to do.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And this happens very often with these computers,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
in a connected environment,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
irrespective of anything that we could measure.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
because all of you are talking about groups.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So here was the power of what a group of children can do,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
if you lift the adult intervention.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Just a quick idea of the measurements.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
But we got a clean learning curve,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I'll leave it at that,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
What could they learn to do?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
games and educational material, music downloads, playing video.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
In short, what all of us do.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And over 300 children will become computer literate

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So, how do they do that?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
If you calculated the actual time of access,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
it would work out to minutes per day,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
so that's not how it's happening.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And surrounding him are usually three other children,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
who are advising him on what they should do.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
who are also advising, usually wrongly,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
about everything that's going on on the computer.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
where most of the time they are told, don't do this,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So what does the eight-year-old do?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And if you tested him,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
he would answer every question correctly on that topic.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
It was that primary education can happen on its own,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
or parts of it can happen on its own.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
the second bit that I wanted to tell you,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes --

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
These were areas where the children were clearly confused,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
because half said yes and half said no.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
perhaps none of us do.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
So I leave you with this third question.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Can technology alter the acquisition of values?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Finally, self-organizing systems,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
about which, again, I won't say too much

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
because you've been hearing all about it.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Natural systems are all self-organizing:

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies --

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
except for the debate about an intelligent designer.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
But at this point in time, as far as science goes,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
it's self-organization.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So here are my four sentences then.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Remoteness affects the quality of education.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and other areas later.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed --

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
the two opposing mechanisms.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me --

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And such a set of specs should produce the technology

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
to address remoteness, values and violence.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination."

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
So I want to leave that as a thought with you.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Thank you.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
(Applause)
