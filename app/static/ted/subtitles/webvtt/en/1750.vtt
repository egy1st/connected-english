00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:19.407
(Music)

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:38.719
(Applause)

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.834
Thank you.

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:44.525
Hi, everybody.

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:46.644
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.

00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:49.478
I'd like to share with you a little bit of me

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:51.590
playing my life.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.279
I might look successful and happy

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.377
being in front of you today,

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:59.463
but I once suffered from severe depression

00:02:59.463 --> 00:03:01.828
and was in total despair.

00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:04.933
The violin, which meant everything to me,

00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:07.510
became a grave burden on me.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.236
Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me,

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:15.161
their words sounded like meaningless noise.

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.523
When I was just about to give everything up

00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:20.886
after years of suffering,

00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:26.427
I started to rediscover the true power of music.

00:03:26.427 --> 00:03:41.316
(Music)

00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:50.776
In the midst of hardship,

00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:56.266
it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:58.035
The comfort the music gave me

00:04:58.035 --> 00:04:59.745
was just indescribable,

00:04:59.745 --> 00:05:03.909
and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too,

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.213
and it totally changed my perspective on life

00:05:07.213 --> 00:05:09.869
and set me free from the pressure

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:14.807
of becoming a successful violinist.

00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:17.946
Do you feel like you are all alone?

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:21.505
I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart,

00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:24.016
as it did for me.

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:29.981
(Music)

00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:48.758
(Applause)

00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:50.503
Thank you.

00:06:50.503 --> 00:06:54.440
Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.119
and have found there are no boundaries.

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.678
My audience is anyone who is here to listen,

00:07:00.678 --> 00:07:04.926
even those who are not familiar with classical music.

00:07:04.926 --> 00:07:09.775
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls

00:07:09.775 --> 00:07:11.710
like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center,

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.501
but also hospitals, churches, prisons,

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:19.721
and restricted facilities for leprosy patients,

00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:21.687
just to mention a few.

00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:26.297
Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you

00:07:26.297 --> 00:07:29.978
that classical music can be so much fun, exciting,

00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:32.782
and that it can rock you.

00:07:32.782 --> 00:07:36.210
Let me introduce you to my brand new project,

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.715
"Baroque in Rock,"

00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:41.407
which became a golden disc most recently.

00:07:41.407 --> 00:07:43.904
It's such an honor for me.

00:07:43.904 --> 00:07:48.145
I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician,

00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:52.778
I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.

00:07:52.778 --> 00:07:56.345
But it's now your turn.

00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:57.816
Changing your perspectives

00:07:57.816 --> 00:08:01.764
will not only transform you but also the whole world.

00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:04.247
Just play your life with all you have,

00:08:04.247 --> 00:08:06.581
and share it with the world.

00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:08.406
I really look forward to witnessing

00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:12.351
a transforming world by you, TEDsters.

00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:17.394
Play your life, and stay tuned.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:25.522
(Music)

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:11.179
(Applause)
