00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:02.654
When I was a young boy,

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:05.262
I used to gaze through the microscope of my father

00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:08.620
at the insects in amber that he kept in the house.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.177
And they were remarkably well preserved,

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.422
morphologically just phenomenal.

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:15.616
And we used to imagine that someday,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.225
they would actually come to life

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.222
and they would crawl out of the resin,

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:21.966
and, if they could, they would fly away.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.342
If you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:27.540
we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.015
I would have told you, it's unlikely.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:31.910
If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.062
to revive an extinct species,

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:35.721
I would have said, pipe dream.

00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:38.246
But I'm actually standing here today, amazingly,

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.253
to tell you that not only is the sequencing

00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:44.443
of extinct genomes a possibility, actually a modern-day reality,

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:48.736
but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach,

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.575
maybe not from the insects in amber --

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:52.535
in fact, this mosquito was actually used

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.887
for the inspiration for "Jurassic Park" â€”

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:57.447
but from woolly mammoths, the well preserved remains

00:00:57.447 --> 00:00:59.654
of woolly mammoths in the permafrost.

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:01.727
Woollies are a particularly interesting,

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:04.273
quintessential image of the Ice Age.

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.098
They were large. They were hairy.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:08.082
They had large tusks, and we seem to have

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:10.982
a very deep connection with them, like we do with elephants.

00:01:10.982 --> 00:01:13.497
Maybe it's because elephants share

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:15.319
many things in common with us.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.047
They bury their dead. They educate the next of kin.

00:01:18.047 --> 00:01:21.067
They have social knits that are very close.

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:23.937
Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time,

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:27.275
because elephants, like us, share their origins in Africa

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:29.398
some seven million years ago,

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:32.192
and as habitats changed and environments changed,

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:35.802
we actually, like the elephants, migrated out

00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:38.022
into Europe and Asia.

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:40.725
So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:44.131
is meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall

00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.963
weighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:50.925
and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia,

00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:53.175
across the Bering land bridge

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:55.485
and into parts of North America.

00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:58.173
And then, again, as climate changed as it always does,

00:01:58.173 --> 00:01:59.683
and new habitats opened up,

00:01:59.683 --> 00:02:02.159
we had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.407
called trogontherii in Central Asia

00:02:04.407 --> 00:02:07.157
pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.

00:02:07.157 --> 00:02:09.552
And the open grassland savannas of North America

00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:11.712
opened up, leading to the Columbian mammoth,

00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:14.252
a large, hairless species in North America.

00:02:14.252 --> 00:02:17.163
And it was really only about 500,000 years later

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:19.868
that we had the arrival of the woolly,

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:21.896
the one that we all know and love so much,

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:25.206
spreading from an East Beringian point of origin

00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:28.092
across Central Asia, again pushing the trogontherii

00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:29.743
out through Central Europe,

00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:31.809
and over hundreds of thousands of years

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.893
migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge

00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:36.920
during times of glacial peaks

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.716
and coming into direct contact

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:41.520
with the Columbian relatives living in the south,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.808
and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years

00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:46.985
during traumatic climatic shifts.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:51.201
So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:54.049
in temperature and environment, and doing very, very well.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.040
And there they survive on the mainland until about 10,000 years ago,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.193
and actually, surprisingly, on the small islands off of Siberia

00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:03.667
and Alaska until about 3,000 years ago.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.356
So Egyptians are building pyramids

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:08.122
and woollies are still living on islands.

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:09.671
And then they disappear.

00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.925
Like 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived,

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:15.188
they go extinct, likely due to a warming climate

00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:17.286
and fast-encroaching dense forests

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:18.787
that are migrating north,

00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:21.760
and also, as the late, great Paul Martin once put it,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.511
probably Pleistocene overkill,

00:03:23.511 --> 00:03:26.084
so the large game hunters that took them down.

00:03:26.084 --> 00:03:28.346
Fortunately, we find millions of their remains

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:31.023
strewn across the permafrost buried deep

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:34.148
in Siberia and Alaska, and we can actually go up there

00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:36.058
and actually take them out.

00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:37.582
And the preservation is, again,

00:03:37.582 --> 00:03:40.152
like those insects in [amber], phenomenal.

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:43.672
So you have teeth, bones with blood

00:03:43.672 --> 00:03:45.712
which look like blood, you have hair,

00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:47.239
and you have intact carcasses or heads

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.182
which still have brains in them.

00:03:50.182 --> 00:03:52.553
So the preservation and the survival of DNA

00:03:52.553 --> 00:03:54.625
depends on many factors, and I have to admit,

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.953
most of which we still don't quite understand,

00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:59.025
but depending upon when an organism dies

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:03.514
and how quickly he's buried, the depth of that burial,

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:06.816
the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment,

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:09.384
will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:12.245
over geologically meaningful time frames.

00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:13.889
And it's probably surprising to many of you

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.029
sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters,

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.656
it's not the length of preservation,

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:22.638
it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most.

00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:25.457
So if we were to go deep now within the bones

00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:28.432
and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process,

00:04:28.432 --> 00:04:31.824
the DNA which was once intact, tightly wrapped

00:04:31.824 --> 00:04:34.192
around histone proteins, is now under attack

00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:37.158
by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth

00:04:37.158 --> 00:04:38.968
for years during its lifetime.

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:42.169
So those bacteria, along with the environmental bacteria,

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.872
free water and oxygen, actually break apart the DNA

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:48.417
into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments,

00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:50.738
until all you have are fragments that range

00:04:50.738 --> 00:04:53.419
from 10 base pairs to, in the best case scenarios,

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.792
a few hundred base pairs in length.

00:04:55.792 --> 00:04:58.103
So most fossils out there in the fossil record

00:04:58.103 --> 00:05:00.816
are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:03.249
But a few of them actually have DNA fragments

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.123
that survive for thousands,

00:05:05.123 --> 00:05:08.872
even a few millions of years in time.

00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:11.060
And using state-of-the-art clean room technology,

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.724
we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:16.228
away from all the rest of the gunk in there,

00:05:16.228 --> 00:05:18.427
and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room

00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:20.548
that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth

00:05:20.548 --> 00:05:23.547
and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA,

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:27.358
but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth,

00:05:27.358 --> 00:05:29.605
and, more complicated, I'll get all the DNA

00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:31.789
that survived in that environment with it,

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.963
so the bacteria, the fungi, and so on and so forth.

00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:37.368
Not surprising then again that a mammoth

00:05:37.368 --> 00:05:39.040
preserved in the permafrost will have something

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.908
on the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth,

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.931
whereas something like the Columbian mammoth,

00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:46.548
living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment

00:05:46.548 --> 00:05:50.365
over its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous.

00:05:50.365 --> 00:05:52.808
But we've come up with very clever ways

00:05:52.808 --> 00:05:55.914
that we can actually discriminate, capture and discriminate,

00:05:55.914 --> 00:05:57.889
the mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA,

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.439
and with the advances in high-throughput sequencing,

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.276
we can actually pull out and bioinformatically

00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:06.245
re-jig all these small mammoth fragments

00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:08.542
and place them onto a backbone

00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:11.101
of an Asian or African elephant chromosome.

00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:13.677
And so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points

00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:16.502
that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant,

00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:19.541
and what do we know, then, about a mammoth?

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:22.694
Well, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion,

00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:26.235
and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth.

00:06:26.235 --> 00:06:29.420
So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.997
but an elephant and mammoth genome

00:06:30.997 --> 00:06:33.653
is about two billion base pairs larger, and most of that

00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:36.277
is composed of small, repetitive DNAs

00:06:36.277 --> 00:06:40.910
that make it very difficult to actually re-jig the entire structure of the genome.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.271
So having this information allows us to answer

00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:45.406
one of the interesting relationship questions

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:47.578
between mammoths and their living relatives,

00:06:47.578 --> 00:06:49.622
the African and the Asian elephant,

00:06:49.622 --> 00:06:52.789
all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago,

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.878
but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share

00:06:54.878 --> 00:06:57.658
a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants

00:06:57.658 --> 00:06:59.074
about six million years ago,

00:06:59.074 --> 00:07:01.547
so slightly closer to the Asian elephant.

00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:04.271
With advances in ancient DNA technology,

00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:06.224
we can actually now start to begin to sequence

00:07:06.224 --> 00:07:09.535
the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned,

00:07:09.535 --> 00:07:11.422
and I just wanted to talk about two of them,

00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:13.476
the woolly and the Columbian mammoth,

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.894
both of which were living very close to each other

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:18.519
during glacial peaks,

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:20.682
so when the glaciers were massive in North America,

00:07:20.682 --> 00:07:23.277
the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones,

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:26.488
and came into contact with the relatives living to the south,

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.500
and there they shared refugia,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.884
and a little bit more than the refugia, it turns out.

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:33.384
It looks like they were interbreeding.

00:07:33.384 --> 00:07:35.017
And that this is not an uncommon feature

00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:36.655
in Proboscideans, because it turns out

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:39.568
that large savanna male elephants will outcompete

00:07:39.568 --> 00:07:42.936
the smaller forest elephants for their females.

00:07:42.936 --> 00:07:45.248
So large, hairless Columbians

00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:47.051
outcompeting the smaller male woollies.

00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:49.669
It reminds me a bit of high school, unfortunately.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.008
(Laughter)

00:07:52.008 --> 00:07:54.702
So this is not trivial, given the idea that we want

00:07:54.702 --> 00:07:56.907
to revive extinct species, because it turns out

00:07:56.907 --> 00:07:58.727
that an African and an Asian elephant

00:07:58.727 --> 00:08:00.822
can actually interbreed and have live young,

00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:02.963
and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo

00:08:02.963 --> 00:08:06.005
in Chester, U.K., in 1978.

00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:09.151
So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes,

00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:11.309
modify them into all those positions we've actually now

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:13.693
been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome,

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:16.474
we can put that into an enucleated cell,

00:08:16.474 --> 00:08:18.733
differentiate that into a stem cell,

00:08:18.733 --> 00:08:21.053
subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm,

00:08:21.053 --> 00:08:23.677
artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg,

00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:26.784
and over a long and arduous procedure,

00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:30.293
actually bring back something that looks like this.

00:08:30.293 --> 00:08:31.983
Now, this wouldn't be an exact replica,

00:08:31.983 --> 00:08:34.465
because the short DNA fragments that I told you about

00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:36.946
will prevent us from building the exact structure,

00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:38.482
but it would make something that looked and felt

00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:41.589
very much like a woolly mammoth did.

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:44.333
Now, when I bring up this with my friends,

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:46.941
we often talk about, well, where would you put it?

00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:48.629
Where are you going to house a mammoth?

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:50.669
There's no climates or habitats suitable.

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:52.009
Well, that's not actually the case.

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:54.902
It turns out that there are swaths of habitat

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:57.237
in the north of Siberia and Yukon

00:08:57.237 --> 00:08:58.443
that actually could house a mammoth.

00:08:58.443 --> 00:09:00.688
Remember, this was a highly plastic animal

00:09:00.688 --> 00:09:03.349
that lived over tremendous climate variation.

00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:06.231
So this landscape would be easily able to house it,

00:09:06.231 --> 00:09:09.891
and I have to admit that there [is] a part of the child in me,

00:09:09.891 --> 00:09:11.176
the boy in me, that would love to see

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.022
these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost

00:09:14.022 --> 00:09:16.477
of the north once again, but I do have to admit

00:09:16.477 --> 00:09:18.621
that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders

00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:21.026
whether or not we should.

00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:22.711
Thank you very much.

00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:27.909
(Applause)

00:09:27.909 --> 00:09:29.426
Ryan Phelan: Don't go away.

00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:31.158
You've left us with a question.

00:09:31.158 --> 00:09:34.682
I'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say, "Should we?"

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:37.291
it feels like you're reticent there,

00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:40.269
and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible.

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:41.595
What's your reticence?

00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:42.901
Hendrik Poinar: I don't think it's reticence.

00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:46.699
I think it's just that we have to think very deeply

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:49.250
about the implications, ramifications of our actions,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.450
and so as long as we have good, deep discussion

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.466
like we're having now, I think

00:09:53.466 --> 00:09:56.172
we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it.

00:09:56.172 --> 00:09:57.809
But I just want to make sure that we spend time

00:09:57.809 --> 00:09:59.658
thinking about why we're doing it first.

00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:02.439
RP: Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much, Hendrik.

00:10:02.439 --> 00:10:04.903
HP: Thank you. (Applause)
