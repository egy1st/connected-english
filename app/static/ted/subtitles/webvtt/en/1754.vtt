00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:03.133
How many of you have checked your email today?

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.029
Come on, raise your hands.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.160
How many of you are checking it right now?

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.718
(Laughter)

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:11.218
And how about finances? Anybody check that today?

00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:13.706
Credit card, investment account?

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:17.659
How about this week?

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.776
Now, how about your household energy use?

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:22.714
Anybody check that today?

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:26.866
This week? Last week?

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.994
A few energy geeks spread out across the room.

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:32.563
It's good to see you guys.

00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:35.798
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people

00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:38.780
who are passionate about the future of this planet,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.611
and even we aren't paying attention

00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:43.571
to the energy use that's driving climate change.

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:46.226
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet.

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.763
We met her on our first family vacation.

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:51.125
Harriet's paying attention to her energy use,

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.985
and she is decidedly not an energy geek.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:59.224
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention.

00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:01.253
This is coal,

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:04.610
the most common source of electricity on the planet,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.834
and there's enough energy in this coal

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:11.786
to light this bulb for more than a year.

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:13.857
But unfortunately, between here and here,

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:15.289
most of that energy is lost to things

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.174
like transmission leakage and heat.

00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:21.753
In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.

00:01:21.753 --> 00:01:25.761
So this coal will last a little bit more than a month.

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:28.370
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.408
you'd need this much coal.

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:36.452
The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use,

00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:38.525
we waste nine.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:40.156
That means there's good news,

00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:42.739
because for every unit of energy we save,

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.004
we save the other nine.

00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:51.285
So the question is, how can we get the people in this room

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.266
and across the globe to start paying attention

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.352
to the energy we're using,

00:01:56.352 --> 00:01:59.328
and start wasting less of it?

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:01.715
The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:05.096
that was run one hot summer, 10 years ago,

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:07.232
and only 90 miles from here,

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:10.608
in San Marcos, California.

00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:13.289
Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood,

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.110
asking people to turn off their air conditioning

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.320
and turn on their fans.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.608
One quarter of the homes received a message that said,

00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:22.926
did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:24.744
Turn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.578
Another group got an environmental message.

00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:28.667
And still a third group got a message about

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:31.347
being good citizens, preventing blackouts.

00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:35.064
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.

00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:37.677
In fact, none of these messages worked.

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:40.533
They had zero impact on energy consumption.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:44.654
It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all.

00:02:44.654 --> 00:02:46.474
But there was a fourth message,

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:48.597
and this message simply said,

00:02:48.597 --> 00:02:52.507
"When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors

00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:54.997
said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.

00:02:54.997 --> 00:02:56.802
Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.063
and turn on your fans."

00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:00.760
And wouldn't you know it, they did.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.714
The people who received this message

00:03:02.714 --> 00:03:05.236
showed a marked decrease in energy consumption

00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:08.647
simply by being told what their neighbors were doing.

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:10.347
So what does this tell us?

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:12.564
Well, if something is inconvenient,

00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:14.553
even if we believe in it,

00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:18.431
moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us --

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:22.101
but social pressure, that's powerful stuff.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.719
And harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.884
In fact, it already is.

00:03:27.884 --> 00:03:30.516
Inspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:32.692
started a company called Opower.

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:35.161
We built software and partnered with utility companies

00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:37.964
who wanted to help their customers save energy.

00:03:37.964 --> 00:03:41.030
We deliver personalized home energy reports

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.748
that show people how their consumption

00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:45.620
compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.860
Just like those effective door hangers,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.324
we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors,

00:03:50.324 --> 00:03:52.840
and then we give everyone targeted recommendations

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.490
to help them save.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.796
We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application,

00:03:56.796 --> 00:03:59.725
web, and now even a controllable thermostat,

00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:01.742
and for the last five years we've been running

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:06.145
the largest behavioral science experiment in the world.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.809
And it's working.

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:09.906
Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:13.046
more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills,

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:14.559
and we're just getting started.

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:17.819
This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.073
in six countries, we're going to generate

00:04:20.073 --> 00:04:23.225
another two terawatt hours of electricity savings.

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:25.266
Now, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours,

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:27.305
but for the rest of us, two terawatt hours

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:30.644
is more than enough energy to power every home

00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:33.938
in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined

00:04:33.938 --> 00:04:35.506
for more than a year.

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:37.472
Two terawatt hours, it's roughly half

00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:40.058
what the U.S. solar industry produced last year.

00:04:40.058 --> 00:04:43.649
And two terawatt hours? In terms of coal,

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.806
we'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:50.802
every minute around the clock every day for an entire year

00:04:50.802 --> 00:04:52.906
to get two terawatt hours of electricity.

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:54.223
And we're not burning anything.

00:04:54.223 --> 00:04:55.951
We're just motivating people to pay attention

00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:58.964
and change their behavior.

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.254
But we're just one company, and this is just

00:05:01.254 --> 00:05:03.391
scratching the surface.

00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:06.956
Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted,

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:08.960
and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.313
inefficient lightbulbs. They may.

00:05:12.313 --> 00:05:15.457
I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms,

00:05:15.457 --> 00:05:18.487
and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.

00:05:18.487 --> 00:05:21.571
That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.820
on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.467
but does contribute to climate change.

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:29.587
That's 40 billion -- with a B --

00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:31.870
every year in the U.S. alone.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.235
That's half our coal usage right there.

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:38.007
Now thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists

00:05:38.007 --> 00:05:41.513
are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources

00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:42.651
like these,

00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:46.149
and this is both fantastic and essential.

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.187
But the most overlooked resource to get us

00:05:48.187 --> 00:05:51.733
to a sustainable energy future, it isn't on this slide.

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:56.389
It's in this room. It's you, and it's me.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.073
And we can harness this resource

00:05:59.073 --> 00:06:00.910
with no new material science

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.102
simply by applying behavioral science.

00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:06.186
We can do it today, we know it works,

00:06:06.186 --> 00:06:09.914
and it will save us money right away.

00:06:09.914 --> 00:06:12.665
So what are we waiting for?

00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:15.392
Well, in most places, utility regulation

00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:19.708
hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.

00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:22.638
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers

00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:24.202
waste energy.

00:06:24.202 --> 00:06:28.005
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.

00:06:28.005 --> 00:06:31.411
But this story is much more than about household energy use.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:33.473
Take a look at the Prius.

00:06:33.473 --> 00:06:36.495
It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:38.970
but because they invested in behavioral science.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.110
The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.074
they're saving in real time

00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:44.589
makes former speed demons

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:47.342
drive more like cautious grandmothers.

00:06:47.342 --> 00:06:49.906
Which brings us back to Harriet.

00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:52.094
We met her on our first family vacation.

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:54.281
She came over to meet my young daughter,

00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.452
and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name

00:06:56.452 --> 00:06:58.506
is also Harriet.

00:06:58.506 --> 00:06:59.931
She asked me what I did for a living,

00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:01.476
and I told her, I work with utilities

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:03.352
to help people save energy.

00:07:03.352 --> 00:07:05.578
It was then that her eyes lit up.

00:07:05.578 --> 00:07:07.510
She looked at me, and she said,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.738
"You're exactly the person I need to talk to.

00:07:09.738 --> 00:07:11.921
You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter

00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:14.241
in the mail from our utility.

00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:17.439
It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors."

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.869
(Laughter)

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:23.689
"And for the last two weeks, all we can think about,

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:25.977
talk about, and even argue about,

00:07:25.977 --> 00:07:27.697
is what we should be doing to save energy.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.562
We did everything that letter told us to do,

00:07:30.562 --> 00:07:33.364
and still I know there must be more.

00:07:33.364 --> 00:07:35.042
Now I'm here with a genuine expert.

00:07:35.042 --> 00:07:39.801
Tell me. What should I do to save energy?"

00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:43.853
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.

00:07:43.853 --> 00:07:45.915
My goal is to make sure

00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:48.213
we are all asking it.

00:07:48.213 --> 00:07:49.571
Thank you.

00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:54.174
(Applause)
