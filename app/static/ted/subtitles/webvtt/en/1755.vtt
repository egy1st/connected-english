00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:03.319
So I was trained to become a gymnast

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.975
for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.520
When I was in the first grade, the government

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.127
wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:14.175
all expenses paid.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.823
But my tiger mother said, "No."

00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:18.959
My parents wanted me to become

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:21.063
an engineer like them.

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.150
After surviving the Cultural Revolution,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.959
they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.892
a safe and well-paid job.

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:32.687
It is not important if I like the job or not.

00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:37.967
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.615
That is me playing my imaginary piano.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:43.799
An opera singer must start training young

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:45.383
to learn acrobatics,

00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:48.327
so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:50.594
I even wrote to the school principal

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:53.355
and the host of a radio show.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:57.161
But no adults liked the idea.

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.884
No adults believed I was serious.

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:03.128
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:05.884
just as powerless as I was.

00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:11.649
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.616
My dream would never come true.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.924
I was afraid that for the rest of my life

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:19.961
some second-class happiness

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:22.498
would be the best I could hope for.

00:01:22.498 --> 00:01:24.926
But that's so unfair.

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:28.728
So I was determined to find another calling.

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:31.465
Nobody around to teach me? Fine.

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.697
I turned to books.

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:37.339
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:42.216
from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"]

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:45.289
I found my role model of an independent woman

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.133
when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"]

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:52.830
And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.795
And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:58.866
["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:02.057
I came to the U.S. in 1995,

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:04.938
so which books did I read here first?

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:08.463
Books banned in China, of course.

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:12.133
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:16.235
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:19.960
The Bible is interesting, but strange.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.445
(Laughter)

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:25.916
That's a topic for a different day.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:29.211
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.190
"You shall honor your father and mother."

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.140
"Honor," I said. "That's so different,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.879
and better, than obey."

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.383
So it becomes my tool to climb out

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:41.499
of this Confucian guilt trap

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.771
and to restart my relationship with my parents.

00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:48.793
Encountering a new culture also started my habit

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.565
of comparative reading.

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:52.420
It offers many insights.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.200
For example, I found this map out of place at first

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.085
because this is what Chinese students grew up with.

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:03.586
It had never occurred to me,

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.721
China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:10.974
A map actually carries somebody's view.

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:13.382
Comparative reading actually is nothing new.

00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:16.686
It's a standard practice in the academic world.

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:18.154
There are even research fields

00:03:18.154 --> 00:03:22.099
such as comparative religion and comparative literature.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.334
Compare and contrast gives scholars

00:03:24.334 --> 00:03:27.340
a more complete understanding of a topic.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.093
So I thought, well, if comparative reading

00:03:29.093 --> 00:03:32.929
works for research, why not do it in daily life too?

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:36.304
So I started reading books in pairs.

00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:37.518
So they can be about people --

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:38.401
["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:40.909
who are involved in the same event,

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.588
or friends with shared experiences.

00:03:43.588 --> 00:03:44.988
["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder]

00:03:44.988 --> 00:03:49.386
I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter)

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:51.498
[Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] --

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.635
or similar stories from different cultures,

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:57.516
as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell]

00:03:57.516 --> 00:04:00.909
For example, both the Christ and the Buddha

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.342
went through three temptations.

00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:05.144
For the Christ, the temptations

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:09.119
are economic, political and spiritual.

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:13.445
For the Buddha, they are all psychological:

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:20.763
lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.

00:04:20.763 --> 00:04:23.802
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun

00:04:23.802 --> 00:04:25.699
to read your favorite books in two languages.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:26.951
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]

00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:30.511
Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.

00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:34.735
For example, it's through translation that I realized

00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:40.708
"happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:45.997
"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.

00:04:45.997 --> 00:04:49.258
(Laughter)

00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:54.645
Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people

00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:57.290
of the past and the present.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.525
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.

00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:04.202
Having a dream shattered really is nothing

00:05:04.202 --> 00:05:07.138
compared to what many others have suffered.

00:05:07.138 --> 00:05:09.866
I have come to believe that coming true

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:13.146
is not the only purpose of a dream.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:17.047
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch

00:05:17.047 --> 00:05:19.162
with where dreams come from,

00:05:19.162 --> 00:05:22.066
where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:26.288
Even a shattered dream can do that for you.

00:05:26.288 --> 00:05:28.542
So because of books, I'm here today,

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:32.202
happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,

00:05:32.202 --> 00:05:33.952
most of the time.

00:05:33.952 --> 00:05:37.513
So may books be always with you.

00:05:37.513 --> 00:05:38.991
Thank you.

00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:40.839
(Applause)

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.484
Thank you. (Applause)

00:05:44.484 --> 00:05:49.577
Thank you. (Applause)
