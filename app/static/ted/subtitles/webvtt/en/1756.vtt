00:00:00.976 --> 00:00:05.206
"Even in purely nonreligious terms,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.446
homosexuality represents
a misuse of the sexual faculty.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.691
It is a pathetic little second-rate
substitute for reality --

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.661
a pitiable flight from life.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:21.913
As such, it deserves no compassion,

00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:27.119
it deserves no treatment
as minority martyrdom,

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:33.083
and it deserves not to be deemed
anything but a pernicious sickness."

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:38.713
That's from "Time" magazine in 1966,
when I was three years old.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:42.719
And last year, the president
of the United States

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:45.406
came out in favor of gay marriage.

00:00:45.992 --> 00:00:52.956
(Applause)

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:55.045
And my question is:

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:58.625
How did we get from there to here?

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.711
How did an illness become an identity?

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:06.564
When I was perhaps six years old,

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.128
I went to a shoe store
with my mother and my brother.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.723
And at the end of buying our shoes,

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:15.193
the salesman said to us that we could
each have a balloon to take home.

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:17.727
My brother wanted a red balloon,

00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:20.291
and I wanted a pink balloon.

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:25.694
My mother said that she thought
I'd really rather have a blue balloon.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:26.749
(Laughter)

00:01:26.773 --> 00:01:29.111
But I said that I definitely
wanted the pink one.

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:34.239
And she reminded me
that my favorite color was blue.

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:39.119
The fact that my favorite color
now is blue, but I'm still gay --

00:01:39.143 --> 00:01:42.372
(Laughter)

00:01:42.396 --> 00:01:45.247
is evidence of both my mother's influence

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.425
and its limits.

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:48.666
(Laughter)

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.109
(Applause)

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:58.374
When I was little, my mother used to say,

00:01:58.398 --> 00:02:02.985
"The love you have for your children
is like no other feeling in the world.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.185
And until you have children,
you don't know what it's like."

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.659
And when I was little, I took it
as the greatest compliment in the world

00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:12.445
that she would say that
about parenting my brother and me.

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.787
And when I was an adolescent,
I thought, "But I'm gay,

00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:18.143
and so I probably can't have a family."

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:20.532
And when she said it, it made me anxious.

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:22.253
And after I came out of the closet,

00:02:22.277 --> 00:02:25.180
when she continued to say it,
it made me furious.

00:02:25.204 --> 00:02:29.498
I said, "I'm gay. That's not
the direction that I'm headed in.

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:31.558
And I want you to stop saying that."

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.099
About 20 years ago,

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:40.174
I was asked by my editors
at the "New York Times Magazine"

00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:42.894
to write a piece about Deaf culture.

00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:44.324
And I was rather taken aback.

00:02:44.348 --> 00:02:46.652
I had thought of deafness
entirely as an illness:

00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:48.636
those poor people, they couldn't hear,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.280
they lacked hearing,
and what could we do for them?

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.798
And then I went out into the Deaf world.

00:02:53.822 --> 00:02:55.703
I went to Deaf clubs.

00:02:55.727 --> 00:03:00.105
I saw performances of Deaf theater
and of Deaf poetry.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.835
I even went to the Miss Deaf America
contest in Nashville, Tennessee,

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.502
where people complained
about that slurry Southern signing.

00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:13.575
(Laughter)

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:18.148
And as I plunged deeper and deeper
into the Deaf world,

00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:21.146
I became convinced
that Deafness was a culture

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.392
and that the people
in the Deaf world who said,

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:26.887
"We don't lack hearing;
we have membership in a culture,"

00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:29.173
were saying something that was viable.

00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:30.625
It wasn't my culture,

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.578
and I didn't particularly
want to rush off and join it,

00:03:33.602 --> 00:03:36.112
but I appreciated that it was a culture

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:38.503
and that for the people
who were members of it,

00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:44.857
it felt as valuable as Latino culture
or gay culture or Jewish culture.

00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:48.913
It felt as valid, perhaps,
even as American culture.

00:03:49.898 --> 00:03:53.190
Then a friend of a friend of mine
had a daughter who was a dwarf.

00:03:53.214 --> 00:03:54.713
And when her daughter was born,

00:03:54.737 --> 00:03:57.086
she suddenly found herself
confronting questions

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.743
that now began to seem
quite resonant to me.

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:03.353
She was facing the question
of what to do with this child.

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:07.131
Should she say, "You're just like
everyone else but a little bit shorter?"

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:10.372
Or should she try to construct
some kind of dwarf identity,

00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:12.767
get involved in
the Little People of America,

00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.368
become aware of what was
happening for dwarfs?

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:17.187
And I suddenly thought,

00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.716
"Most deaf children are born
to hearing parents.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.189
Those hearing parents
tend to try to cure them.

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:26.342
Those deaf people discover community
somehow in adolescence.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.502
Most gay people
are born to straight parents.

00:04:28.526 --> 00:04:31.097
Those straight parents
often want them to function

00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.349
in what they think of
as the mainstream world,

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:36.824
and those gay people
have to discover identity later on.

00:04:36.848 --> 00:04:38.486
And here was this friend of mine,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.030
looking at these questions of identity
with her dwarf daughter.

00:04:42.054 --> 00:04:43.768
And I thought, "There it is again:

00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:46.287
a family that perceives
itself to be normal

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:48.932
with a child who seems
to be extraordinary."

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.993
And I hatched the idea that there are
really two kinds of identity.

00:04:53.518 --> 00:04:54.987
There are vertical identities,

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:58.182
which are passed down generationally
from parent to child.

00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:00.330
Those are things like ethnicity,

00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:03.679
frequently nationality,
language, often religion.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:08.183
Those are things you have in common
with your parents and with your children.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.635
And while some of them can be difficult,

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:12.603
there's no attempt to cure them.

00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:15.859
You can argue that it's harder
in the United States --

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:18.002
our current presidency notwithstanding --

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.666
to be a person of color.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.406
And yet, we have nobody
who is trying to ensure

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.476
that the next generation of children
born to African-Americans and Asians

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.352
come out with creamy skin and yellow hair.

00:05:30.027 --> 00:05:34.117
There are these other identities
which you have to learn from a peer group,

00:05:34.141 --> 00:05:36.217
and I call them "horizontal identities,"

00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:39.346
because the peer group
is the horizontal experience.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.947
These are identities
that are alien to your parents

00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:46.165
and that you have to discover
when you get to see them in peers.

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.250
And those identities,
those horizontal identities,

00:05:49.274 --> 00:05:53.007
people have almost always tried to cure.

00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:55.366
And I wanted to look
at what the process is

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.945
through which people
who have those identities

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.438
come to a good relationship with them.

00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:04.609
And it seemed to me that there were
three levels of acceptance

00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:06.271
that needed to take place.

00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:11.646
There's self-acceptance, there's family
acceptance, and there's social acceptance.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.892
And they don't always coincide.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:17.730
And a lot of the time, people who have
these conditions are very angry,

00:06:17.754 --> 00:06:21.236
because they feel as though
their parents don't love them,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.988
when what actually has happened
is that their parents don't accept them.

00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:28.186
Love is something that,
ideally, is there unconditionally

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.479
throughout the relationship
between a parent and a child.

00:06:31.503 --> 00:06:34.637
But acceptance
is something that takes time.

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:36.405
It always takes time.

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.287
One of the dwarfs I got to know
was a guy named Clinton Brown.

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:45.093
When he was born, he was diagnosed
with diastrophic dwarfism,

00:06:45.117 --> 00:06:46.767
a very disabling condition,

00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.188
and his parents were told
that he would never walk,

00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:50.386
he would never talk,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.433
he would have no intellectual capacity,

00:06:52.457 --> 00:06:54.897
and he would probably
not even recognize them.

00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.451
And it was suggested to them
that they leave him at the hospital

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.515
so that he could die there quietly.

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.699
His mother said she wasn't going to do it,

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.430
and she took her son home.

00:07:04.454 --> 00:07:08.231
And even though she didn't have a lot
of educational or financial advantages,

00:07:08.255 --> 00:07:12.279
she found the best doctor in the country
for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,

00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:14.445
and she got Clinton enrolled with him.

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:16.639
And in the course of his childhood,

00:07:16.663 --> 00:07:19.471
he had 30 major surgical procedures.

00:07:19.495 --> 00:07:21.761
And he spent all this time
stuck in the hospital

00:07:21.785 --> 00:07:23.578
while he was having those procedures,

00:07:23.602 --> 00:07:25.681
as a result of which, he now can walk.

00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:30.165
While he was there, they sent tutors
around to help him with his schoolwork,

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:33.166
and he worked very hard,
because there was nothing else to do.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.741
He ended up achieving at a level

00:07:34.765 --> 00:07:38.152
that had never before been contemplated
by any member of his family.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:41.653
He was the first one in his family,
in fact, to go to college,

00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:44.817
where he lived on campus
and drove a specially fitted car

00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:47.788
that accommodated his unusual body.

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:50.917
And his mother told me the story
of coming home one day --

00:07:50.941 --> 00:07:52.612
and he went to college nearby --

00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:55.628
and she said, "I saw that car,
which you can always recognize,

00:07:55.652 --> 00:07:58.779
in the parking lot of a bar," she said.

00:07:58.803 --> 00:08:00.176
(Laughter)

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.938
"And I thought to myself,

00:08:01.962 --> 00:08:04.599
'They're six feet tall,
he's three feet tall.

00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:07.032
Two beers for them
is four beers for him.'"

00:08:07.056 --> 00:08:09.866
She said, "I knew I couldn't
go in there and interrupt him,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.268
but I went home, and I left him
eight messages on his cell phone."

00:08:13.933 --> 00:08:15.388
She said, "And then I thought,

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.510
if someone had said to me,
when he was born,

00:08:17.534 --> 00:08:21.240
that my future worry would be
that he'd go drinking and driving

00:08:21.264 --> 00:08:22.757
with his college buddies ..."

00:08:22.781 --> 00:08:24.352
(Laughter)

00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:31.353
(Applause)

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:33.026
And I said to her,

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.522
"What do you think you did
that helped him to emerge

00:08:35.546 --> 00:08:38.395
as this charming, accomplished,
wonderful person?"

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.064
And she said, "What did I do?

00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:43.146
I loved him, that's all.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.564
Clinton just always had that light in him.

00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:51.554
And his father and I were lucky enough
to be the first to see it there."

00:08:52.887 --> 00:08:55.410
I'm going to quote
from another magazine of the '60s.

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:58.070
This one is from 1968 --

00:08:58.094 --> 00:09:01.501
"The Atlantic Monthly,"
voice of liberal America --

00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:03.915
written by an important bioethicist.

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:07.836
He said, "There is no
reason to feel guilty

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.415
about putting a Down's
syndrome child away,

00:09:11.439 --> 00:09:16.404
whether it is 'put away' in the sense
of hidden in a sanitarium

00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:19.406
or in a more responsible, lethal sense.

00:09:20.189 --> 00:09:23.169
It is sad, yes. Dreadful.

00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:25.058
But it carries no guilt.

00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:29.213
True guilt arises only
from an offense against a person,

00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:32.598
and a Down's is not a person."

00:09:33.838 --> 00:09:37.617
There's been a lot of ink given
to the enormous progress that we've made

00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:39.665
in the treatment of gay people.

00:09:39.689 --> 00:09:43.918
The fact that our attitude has changed
is in the headlines every day.

00:09:43.942 --> 00:09:48.318
But we forget how we used to see people
who had other differences,

00:09:48.342 --> 00:09:50.641
how we used to see people
who were disabled,

00:09:50.665 --> 00:09:53.522
how inhuman we held people to be.

00:09:53.546 --> 00:09:55.753
And the change that's been
accomplished there,

00:09:55.777 --> 00:09:57.337
which is almost equally radical,

00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:00.382
is one that we pay
not very much attention to.

00:10:00.406 --> 00:10:04.104
One of the families I interviewed,
Tom and Karen Robards,

00:10:04.128 --> 00:10:07.660
were taken aback when,
as young and successful New Yorkers,

00:10:07.684 --> 00:10:10.635
their first child was diagnosed
with Down syndrome.

00:10:11.316 --> 00:10:15.466
They thought the educational opportunities
for him were not what they should be,

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.319
and so they decided
they would build a little center --

00:10:19.343 --> 00:10:22.920
two classrooms that they started
with a few other parents --

00:10:22.944 --> 00:10:25.262
to educate kids with DS.

00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:29.346
And over the years, that center grew
into something called the Cooke Center,

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.068
where there are now thousands
upon thousands of children

00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:33.741
with intellectual disabilities

00:10:33.765 --> 00:10:35.280
who are being taught.

00:10:35.304 --> 00:10:38.548
In the time since that "Atlantic
Monthly" story ran,

00:10:38.572 --> 00:10:43.095
the life expectancy for people
with Down syndrome has tripled.

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:47.664
The experience of Down syndrome
people includes those who are actors,

00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:52.690
those who are writers, some who are able
to live fully independently in adulthood.

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:55.419
The Robards had a lot to do with that.

00:10:55.443 --> 00:10:56.896
And I said, "Do you regret it?

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.415
Do you wish your child
didn't have Down syndrome?

00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:01.264
Do you wish you'd never heard of it?"

00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:03.942
And interestingly, his father said,

00:11:03.966 --> 00:11:06.106
"Well, for David, our son, I regret it,

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.598
because for David,
it's a difficult way to be in the world,

00:11:09.622 --> 00:11:12.427
and I'd like to give David an easier life.

00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:15.258
But I think if we lost
everyone with Down syndrome,

00:11:15.282 --> 00:11:17.643
it would be a catastrophic loss."

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:20.932
And Karen Robards
said to me, "I'm with Tom.

00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:24.818
For David, I would cure it in an instant,
to give him an easier life.

00:11:24.842 --> 00:11:26.753
But speaking for myself --

00:11:26.777 --> 00:11:30.254
well, I would never have believed
23 years ago when he was born

00:11:30.278 --> 00:11:32.356
that I could come to such a point.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.691
Speaking for myself, it's made me
so much better and so much kinder

00:11:36.715 --> 00:11:41.621
and so much more purposeful in my whole
life that, speaking for myself,

00:11:41.645 --> 00:11:45.121
I wouldn't give it up
for anything in the world."

00:11:46.422 --> 00:11:50.440
We live at a point when social acceptance
for these and many other conditions

00:11:50.464 --> 00:11:52.087
is on the up and up.

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.172
And yet we also live at the moment

00:11:54.196 --> 00:11:56.827
when our ability to eliminate
those conditions

00:11:56.851 --> 00:11:59.676
has reached a height
we never imagined before.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.548
Most deaf infants
born in the United States now

00:12:02.572 --> 00:12:04.548
will receive cochlear implants,

00:12:04.572 --> 00:12:09.280
which are put into the brain
and connected to a receiver,

00:12:09.304 --> 00:12:12.288
and which allow them to acquire
a facsimile of hearing

00:12:12.312 --> 00:12:14.435
and to use oral speech.

00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:18.700
A compound that has been tested
in mice, BMN-111,

00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:23.297
is useful in preventing
the action of the achondroplasia gene.

00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.276
Achondroplasia is the most common
form of dwarfism,

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.388
and mice who have been given
that substance

00:12:28.412 --> 00:12:30.256
and who have the achondroplasia gene

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.993
grow to full size.

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:34.937
Testing in humans is around the corner.

00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:37.414
There are blood tests
which are making progress

00:12:37.438 --> 00:12:41.494
that would pick up Down syndrome
more clearly and earlier in pregnancies

00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:42.673
than ever before,

00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:47.587
making it easier and easier for people
to eliminate those pregnancies,

00:12:47.611 --> 00:12:48.934
or to terminate them.

00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:53.913
So we have both social progress
and medical progress.

00:12:53.937 --> 00:12:55.519
And I believe in both of them.

00:12:55.543 --> 00:12:59.834
I believe the social progress is fantastic
and meaningful and wonderful,

00:12:59.858 --> 00:13:02.816
and I think the same thing
about the medical progress.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.179
But I think it's a tragedy
when one of them doesn't see the other.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.251
And when I see the way
they're intersecting

00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:11.651
in conditions like the three
I've just described,

00:13:11.675 --> 00:13:15.296
I sometimes think it's like
those moments in grand opera

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.877
when the hero realizes
he loves the heroine

00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:22.165
at the exact moment
that she lies expiring on a divan.

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:24.564
(Laughter)

00:13:25.401 --> 00:13:28.876
We have to think about how we feel
about cures altogether.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.712
And a lot of the time
the question of parenthood is:

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:33.487
What do we validate in our children,

00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:35.316
and what do we cure in them?

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.487
Jim Sinclair, a prominent
autism activist, said,

00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:44.088
"When parents say, 'I wish
my child did not have autism,'

00:13:44.112 --> 00:13:48.923
what they're really saying is,
'I wish the child I have did not exist

00:13:48.947 --> 00:13:52.299
and I had a different,
nonautistic child instead.'

00:13:52.858 --> 00:13:57.964
Read that again. This is what we hear
when you mourn over our existence.

00:13:57.988 --> 00:14:01.013
This is what we hear
when you pray for a cure:

00:14:01.037 --> 00:14:05.439
that your fondest wish for us
is that someday we will cease to be,

00:14:05.463 --> 00:14:10.082
and strangers you can love
will move in behind our faces."

00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:13.710
It's a very extreme point of view,

00:14:13.734 --> 00:14:18.047
but it points to the reality
that people engage with the life they have

00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:22.612
and they don't want to be cured
or changed or eliminated.

00:14:22.636 --> 00:14:25.698
They want to be whoever it is
that they've come to be.

00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:29.856
One of the families
I interviewed for this project

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.607
was the family of Dylan Klebold,

00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:35.016
who was one of the perpetrators
of the Columbine massacre.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.681
It took a long time
to persuade them to talk to me,

00:14:37.705 --> 00:14:40.329
and once they agreed,
they were so full of their story

00:14:40.353 --> 00:14:42.049
that they couldn't stop telling it,

00:14:42.073 --> 00:14:44.872
and the first weekend I spent
with them, the first of many,

00:14:44.896 --> 00:14:47.882
I recorded more than 20 hours
of conversation.

00:14:47.906 --> 00:14:49.928
And on Sunday night,
we were all exhausted.

00:14:49.952 --> 00:14:53.192
We were sitting in the kitchen.
Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.

00:14:53.216 --> 00:14:55.866
And I said, "If Dylan were here now,

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.537
do you have a sense
of what you'd want to ask him?"

00:14:58.561 --> 00:15:00.765
And his father said, "I sure do.

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:03.634
I'd want to ask him what the hell
he thought he was doing."

00:15:04.068 --> 00:15:07.326
And Sue looked at the floor,
and she thought for a minute.

00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:10.631
And then she looked back up and said,

00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:14.288
"I would ask him to forgive me
for being his mother

00:15:14.312 --> 00:15:17.393
and never knowing
what was going on inside his head."

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:21.531
When I had dinner with her
a couple of years later --

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:23.768
one of many dinners
that we had together --

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:26.648
she said, "You know,
when it first happened,

00:15:26.672 --> 00:15:30.731
I used to wish that I had never married,
that I had never had children.

00:15:30.755 --> 00:15:34.182
If I hadn't gone to Ohio State
and crossed paths with Tom,

00:15:34.206 --> 00:15:35.903
this child wouldn't have existed,

00:15:35.927 --> 00:15:38.135
and this terrible thing
wouldn't have happened.

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:42.188
But I've come to feel that I love
the children I had so much

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:44.919
that I don't want to imagine
a life without them.

00:15:45.563 --> 00:15:48.410
I recognize the pain
they caused to others,

00:15:48.434 --> 00:15:50.548
for which there can be no forgiveness,

00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:54.131
but the pain they caused
to me, there is," she said.

00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:57.743
"So while I recognize that
it would have been better for the world

00:15:57.767 --> 00:16:00.313
if Dylan had never been born,

00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:04.532
I've decided that it would not
have been better for me."

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.938
I thought it was surprising

00:16:07.962 --> 00:16:10.614
how all of these families
had all of these children

00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:12.104
with all of these problems,

00:16:12.128 --> 00:16:15.180
problems that they mostly
would have done anything to avoid,

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:19.094
and that they had all found so much
meaning in that experience of parenting.

00:16:19.118 --> 00:16:22.241
And then I thought,
all of us who have children

00:16:22.265 --> 00:16:25.176
love the children we have,
with their flaws.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.129
If some glorious angel suddenly descended
through my living-room ceiling

00:16:29.153 --> 00:16:31.355
and offered to take away
the children I have

00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:33.708
and give me other, better children --

00:16:33.732 --> 00:16:37.178
more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter --

00:16:37.202 --> 00:16:38.411
(Laughter)

00:16:38.435 --> 00:16:43.029
I would cling to the children I have
and pray away that atrocious spectacle.

00:16:43.053 --> 00:16:44.422
And ultimately,

00:16:44.446 --> 00:16:48.931
I feel that in the same way that we test
flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno

00:16:48.955 --> 00:16:53.140
to ensure they won't catch fire
when our child reaches across the stove,

00:16:53.164 --> 00:16:57.177
so these stories of families
negotiating these extreme differences

00:16:57.201 --> 00:16:59.864
reflect on the universal
experience of parenting,

00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:04.408
which is always that sometimes,
you look at your child, and you think,

00:17:04.432 --> 00:17:06.368
"Where did you come from?"

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:08.916
(Laughter)

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.653
It turns out that while each of these
individual differences is siloed --

00:17:13.677 --> 00:17:16.462
there are only so many families
dealing with schizophrenia,

00:17:16.486 --> 00:17:19.084
only so many families
of children who are transgender,

00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:20.970
only so many families of prodigies --

00:17:20.994 --> 00:17:23.483
who also face similar
challenges in many ways --

00:17:23.507 --> 00:17:26.354
there are only so many families
in each of those categories.

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:27.613
But if you start to think

00:17:27.637 --> 00:17:31.145
that the experience of negotiating
difference within your family

00:17:31.169 --> 00:17:33.248
is what people are addressing,

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:36.593
then you discover that it's a nearly
universal phenomenon.

00:17:36.617 --> 00:17:38.247
Ironically, it turns out,

00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:41.679
that it's our differences
and our negotiation of difference

00:17:41.703 --> 00:17:42.957
that unite us.

00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:48.832
I decided to have children
while I was working on this project.

00:17:49.292 --> 00:17:52.490
And many people were astonished and said,

00:17:52.514 --> 00:17:54.513
"But how can you decide to have children

00:17:54.537 --> 00:17:57.518
in the midst of studying
everything that can go wrong?"

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.656
And I said, "I'm not studying
everything that can go wrong.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.792
What I'm studying is how much
love there can be,

00:18:04.816 --> 00:18:08.856
even when everything appears
to be going wrong."

00:18:09.499 --> 00:18:15.040
I thought a lot about the mother
of one disabled child I had seen,

00:18:15.064 --> 00:18:18.650
a severely disabled child
who died through caregiver neglect.

00:18:18.674 --> 00:18:21.698
And when his ashes
were interred, his mother said,

00:18:22.745 --> 00:18:29.656
"I pray here for forgiveness
for having been twice robbed:

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.392
once of the child I wanted,

00:18:32.416 --> 00:18:35.020
and once of the son I loved."

00:18:35.577 --> 00:18:40.107
And I figured it was possible,
then, for anyone to love any child,

00:18:40.131 --> 00:18:42.469
if they had the effective will to do so.

00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:47.966
So, my husband is the biological
father of two children

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.095
with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.

00:18:51.293 --> 00:18:54.802
I had a close friend from college
who'd gone through a divorce

00:18:54.826 --> 00:18:56.490
and wanted to have children.

00:18:56.514 --> 00:18:58.227
And so she and I have a daughter,

00:18:58.251 --> 00:19:00.466
and mother and daughter live in Texas.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.838
And my husband and I have a son
who lives with us all the time,

00:19:03.862 --> 00:19:06.222
of whom I am the biological father,

00:19:06.246 --> 00:19:09.970
and our surrogate
for the pregnancy was Laura,

00:19:09.994 --> 00:19:12.771
the lesbian mother
of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis.

00:19:12.795 --> 00:19:14.222
(Laughter)

00:19:14.246 --> 00:19:15.405
So --

00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:22.131
(Applause)

00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:26.530
The shorthand is: five parents
of four children in three states.

00:19:26.554 --> 00:19:27.648
(Laughter)

00:19:27.672 --> 00:19:30.680
And there are people who think
that the existence of my family

00:19:30.704 --> 00:19:35.193
somehow undermines or weakens
or damages their family.

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:38.747
And there are people who think
that families like mine

00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:40.425
shouldn't be allowed to exist.

00:19:40.449 --> 00:19:44.349
And I don't accept
subtractive models of love,

00:19:44.373 --> 00:19:45.752
only additive ones.

00:19:46.137 --> 00:19:49.640
And I believe that in the same way
that we need species diversity

00:19:49.664 --> 00:19:52.089
to ensure that the planet can go on,

00:19:52.113 --> 00:19:56.390
so we need this diversity
of affection and diversity of family

00:19:56.414 --> 00:19:59.693
in order to strengthen
the ecosphere of kindness.

00:20:01.082 --> 00:20:03.480
The day after our son was born,

00:20:03.504 --> 00:20:05.943
the pediatrician came
into the hospital room

00:20:05.967 --> 00:20:07.858
and said she was concerned.

00:20:07.882 --> 00:20:11.000
He wasn't extending
his legs appropriately.

00:20:11.024 --> 00:20:13.561
She said that might mean
that he had brain damage.

00:20:13.585 --> 00:20:17.316
Insofar as he was extending them,
he was doing so asymmetrically,

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.054
which she thought could mean that
there was a tumor of some kind in action.

00:20:21.078 --> 00:20:22.742
And he had a very large head,

00:20:22.766 --> 00:20:25.701
which she thought
might indicate hydrocephalus.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.613
And as she told me all of these things,

00:20:27.637 --> 00:20:31.458
I felt the very center of my being
pouring out onto the floor.

00:20:31.482 --> 00:20:33.930
And I thought, "Here I had been
working for years

00:20:33.954 --> 00:20:36.479
on a book about how much
meaning people had found

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:40.136
in the experience of parenting
children who were disabled,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.638
and I didn't want to join their number

00:20:43.662 --> 00:20:46.436
because what I was encountering
was an idea of illness."

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.202
And like all parents
since the dawn of time,

00:20:49.226 --> 00:20:52.203
I wanted to protect my child from illness.

00:20:52.227 --> 00:20:55.470
And I wanted, also,
to protect myself from illness.

00:20:55.494 --> 00:20:58.241
And yet, I knew from the work I had done

00:20:58.265 --> 00:21:02.081
that if he had any of the things
we were about to start testing for,

00:21:02.105 --> 00:21:05.068
that those would ultimately
be his identity,

00:21:05.092 --> 00:21:09.131
and if they were his identity,
they would become my identity,

00:21:09.155 --> 00:21:13.423
that that illness was going to take
a very different shape as it unfolded.

00:21:13.447 --> 00:21:16.576
We took him to the MRI machine,
we took him to the CAT scanner,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.384
we took this day-old child and gave him
over for an arterial blood draw.

00:21:20.408 --> 00:21:21.669
We felt helpless.

00:21:21.693 --> 00:21:23.350
And at the end of five hours,

00:21:23.374 --> 00:21:25.586
they said that his brain
was completely clear

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.388
and that he was by then
extending his legs correctly.

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:31.412
And when I asked the pediatrician
what had been going on,

00:21:31.436 --> 00:21:35.596
she said she thought in the morning,
he had probably had a cramp.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.071
(Laughter)

00:21:39.095 --> 00:21:40.357
But I thought --

00:21:40.381 --> 00:21:44.306
(Laughter)

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.929
I thought how my mother was right.

00:21:46.953 --> 00:21:50.425
I thought, "The love you have
for your children

00:21:50.449 --> 00:21:53.811
is unlike any other feeling in the world.

00:21:53.835 --> 00:21:58.508
And until you have children,
you don't know what it feels like.

00:22:00.158 --> 00:22:02.294
I think children had ensnared me

00:22:02.318 --> 00:22:05.320
the moment I connected
fatherhood with loss.

00:22:06.138 --> 00:22:08.172
But I'm not sure I would have noticed that

00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:12.540
if I hadn't been so in the thick
of this research project of mine.

00:22:13.462 --> 00:22:16.578
I'd encountered so much strange love,

00:22:16.602 --> 00:22:20.323
and I fell very naturally
into its bewitching patterns.

00:22:20.347 --> 00:22:26.220
And I saw how splendor can illuminate
even the most abject vulnerabilities.

00:22:27.206 --> 00:22:30.988
During these 10 years,
I had witnessed and learned

00:22:31.012 --> 00:22:34.564
the terrifying joy
of unbearable responsibility,

00:22:34.588 --> 00:22:37.676
and I had come to see
how it conquers everything else.

00:22:38.264 --> 00:22:42.313
And while I had sometimes thought
the parents I was interviewing were fools,

00:22:42.337 --> 00:22:47.334
enslaving themselves to a lifetime's
journey with their thankless children

00:22:47.358 --> 00:22:50.516
and trying to breed
identity out of misery,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.163
I realized that day that my research
had built me a plank

00:22:55.187 --> 00:22:57.701
and that I was ready
to join them on their ship.

00:22:58.581 --> 00:22:59.789
Thank you.

00:22:59.813 --> 00:23:06.792
(Applause and cheers)

00:23:08.096 --> 00:23:09.246
Thank you.
