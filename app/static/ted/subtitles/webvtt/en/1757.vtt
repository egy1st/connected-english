00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:05.119
I am sorry I cannot show you my face,

00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:10.205
because if I do, the bad guys will come for me.

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:14.293
My journey started 14 years ago.

00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:18.705
I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:21.407
Then I got a scoop.

00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:24.826
The scoop was quite a very simple story.

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:27.430
Police officers were taking bribes

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.966
from hawkers who were hawking on the streets.

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.768
As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:37.937
in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact,

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.825
since everybody knew that it was happening,

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:43.394
and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.629
So I decided to go there

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.594
and act as a seller.

00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:52.847
As part of selling, I was able to document

00:00:52.847 --> 00:00:55.639
the hard core evidence.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.161
The impact was great.

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.722
It was fantastic.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:04.452
This was what many call immersion journalism,

00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:07.021
or undercover journalism.

00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:11.269
I am an undercover journalist.

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:15.990
My journalism is hinged on three basic principles:

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.790
naming, shaming and jailing.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.660
Journalism is about results.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.399
It's about affecting your community or your society

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.036
in the most progressive way.

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:33.594
I have worked on this for over 14 years,

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:36.826
and I can tell you, the results are very good.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:39.057
One story that comes to mind

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.201
in my undercover pieces

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.412
is "Spirit Child."

00:01:43.412 --> 00:01:47.488
It was about children who were born with deformities,

00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:50.233
and their parents felt that once they were born

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:51.922
with those deformities,

00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:54.045
they were not good enough to live in the society,

00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:57.153
so they were given some concoction to take

00:01:57.153 --> 00:01:59.730
and as a result they died.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.547
So I built a prosthetic baby,

00:02:02.547 --> 00:02:04.697
and I went into the village,

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:08.845
pretended as though this baby had been born

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.932
with a deformity, and here was the guys who do the killing.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.507
They got themselves ready.

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:19.093
In their bids to kill, I got the police on standby,

00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:21.633
and they came that fateful morning

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.469
to come and kill the child.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.488
I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction.

00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:31.408
They put it on fire. It was boiling hot,

00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:33.880
getting ready to give to the kids.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.855
Whilst this was going on, the police I had alerted,

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.528
they were on standby,

00:02:38.528 --> 00:02:41.764
and just as the concoction was ready,

00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:44.864
and they were about to give it to the kids,

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.813
I phoned the police,

00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:50.982
and fortunately they came and busted them.

00:02:50.982 --> 00:02:53.934
As I speak now, they are before the courts.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.748
Don't forget the key principles:

00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:58.574
naming, shaming and jailing.

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:00.587
The court process is taking place,

00:03:00.587 --> 00:03:02.670
and I'm very sure at the end of the day

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.119
we will find them, and we will put them

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:07.862
where they belong too.

00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:10.550
Another key story that comes to mind,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.897
which relates to this spirit child phenomenon,

00:03:14.897 --> 00:03:20.373
is "The Spell of the Albinos."

00:03:20.373 --> 00:03:23.864
I'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania,

00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:26.240
children who are born with albinism

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.293
are sometimes considered as being unfit

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.992
to live in society.

00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:36.880
Their bodies are chopped up with machetes

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.208
and are supposed to be used for some concoctions

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:43.090
or some potions for people to get money --

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.885
or so many, many stories people would tell about it.

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:49.441
It was time to go undercover again.

00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:52.890
So I went undercover as a man who was interested

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.023
in this particular business, of course.

00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:57.593
Again, a prosthetic arm was built.

00:03:57.593 --> 00:04:01.172
For the first time, I filmed on hidden camera

00:04:01.172 --> 00:04:05.916
the guys who do this, and they were ready to buy the arm

00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:08.066
and they were ready to use it to prepare

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:11.730
those potions for people.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.306
I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action,

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:18.448
but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government

00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:22.637
could only take action because the evidence was available.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:26.532
My journalism is about hard core evidence.

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:28.931
If I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence

00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:30.434
that you have stolen.

00:04:30.434 --> 00:04:32.751
I show you how you stole it

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:34.471
and when, or what you used

00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:36.739
what you had stolen to do.

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:41.309
What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society?

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:43.753
My kind of journalism is a product

00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:47.170
of my society.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.348
I know that sometimes

00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:54.020
people have their own criticisms

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.508
about undercover journalism.

00:04:57.508 --> 00:05:01.686
(Video) Official: He brought out some money from his pockets

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:04.640
and put it on the table,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.955
so that we should not be afraid.

00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:13.738
He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire.

00:05:13.738 --> 00:05:17.426
So with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.

00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:19.816
I didn't utter a word.

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:21.674
But my colleagues didn't know.

00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:24.895
So after collecting the money,

00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:28.023
when he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods.

00:05:28.023 --> 00:05:31.458
Immediately after he left, I told my colleagues that

00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:32.975
since I was the leader of the group,

00:05:32.975 --> 00:05:35.972
I told my colleagues that if they come,

00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:37.273
we will arrest them.

00:05:37.273 --> 00:05:41.500
Second official: I don't even know the place called [unclear].

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.084
I've never stepped there before.

00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:44.051
So I'm surprised.

00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:49.865
You see a hand counting money just in front of me.

00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:53.209
The next moment, you see the money in my hands,

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:56.530
counting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.095
I have not done any business with anybody.

00:05:59.095 --> 00:06:01.435

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:06.490
he just smiled and gave this video extract

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.245
he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen.

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:13.594

they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled.

Anas Aremeyaw Anas: This was another story on anticorruption.

00:06:23.858 --> 00:06:25.750
And here was him, denying.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.711
But you see, when you have the hard core evidence,

00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:31.071
you are able to affect society.

00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:33.378
Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come. (Music)

John Evans Atta Mills: What Anas says

00:07:19.298 --> 00:07:23.204
is not something which is unknown to many of us,

00:07:23.204 --> 00:07:27.308
but please, those of you who are agents,

00:07:27.308 --> 00:07:31.891
and who are leading the customs officers into temptation,

00:07:31.891 --> 00:07:36.244
I'm telling you, Ghana is not going to say

00:07:36.244 --> 00:07:38.843
any good things to you about this.

00:07:38.843 --> 00:07:41.186
AAA: That was my president.

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:43.546
I thought that I couldn't come here

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.026
without giving you something special.

00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:49.517
I have a piece, and I'm excited that

00:07:49.517 --> 00:07:53.599
I'm sharing it for the first time with you here.

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:57.705
I have been undercover in the prisons.

00:07:57.705 --> 00:08:01.891
I have been there for a long time.

00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:06.920
And I can tell you, what I saw is not nice.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.821
But again, I can only affect society

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:13.397
and affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence.

00:08:13.397 --> 00:08:16.769
Many times, the prison authorities have denied

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:19.317
ever having issues of drug abuse,

00:08:19.317 --> 00:08:23.297
issues of sodomy, so many issues they would deny

00:08:23.297 --> 00:08:24.747
that it ever happens.

00:08:24.747 --> 00:08:28.111
How can you obtain the hard core evidence?

00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:32.011
So I was in the prison. ["Nsawan Prison"]

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:36.197
Now, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.

00:08:36.197 --> 00:08:39.267
Now, I happen to have followed one of my inmates,

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:43.823
one of my friends, from his sick bed till death,

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:47.464
and I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all.

00:08:47.464 --> 00:08:50.546
There were issues of bad food being served

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:55.456
as I recall that some of the food I ate

00:08:55.456 --> 00:08:59.717
is just not good for a human being.

00:08:59.717 --> 00:09:03.868
Toilet facilities: very bad.

00:09:03.868 --> 00:09:08.261
I mean, you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend --

00:09:08.292 --> 00:09:11.008
and that's what I call proper,

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:14.417
when four of us are on a manhole.

00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:18.157
It is something that if you narrate it to somebody,

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.991
the person wouldn't believe it.

00:09:19.991 --> 00:09:22.197
The only way that you can let the person believe

00:09:22.197 --> 00:09:24.309
is when you show hard core evidence.

00:09:24.309 --> 00:09:27.437
Of course, drugs were abundant.

00:09:27.437 --> 00:09:30.182
It was easier to get cannabis, heroin and cocaine,

00:09:30.182 --> 00:09:33.885
faster even, in the prison than outside the prison.

00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:38.596
Evil in the society is an extreme disease.

00:09:38.596 --> 00:09:40.518
If you have extreme diseases,

00:09:40.518 --> 00:09:43.445
you need to get extreme remedies.

00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:46.179
My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents

00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:47.861
or other countries,

00:09:47.861 --> 00:09:51.309
but I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent

00:09:51.309 --> 00:09:53.517
of Africa, because usually, when people talk

00:09:53.517 --> 00:09:56.242
about corruption, they ask, "Where is the evidence?

00:09:56.242 --> 00:09:57.423
Show me the evidence."

00:09:57.423 --> 00:09:59.328
I say, "This is the evidence."

00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:04.209
And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars.

00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:07.729
You see, we on the continent are able

00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:10.313
to tell the story better because we face the conditions

00:10:10.313 --> 00:10:12.713
and we see the conditions.

00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:14.500
That is why I was particularly excited

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.880
when we launched our "Africa Investigates" series

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.081
where we investigated a lot of African countries.

00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:23.732
As a result of the success of the "Africa Investigates" series,

00:10:23.732 --> 00:10:26.270
we are moving on to World Investigates.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.913
By the end of it, a lot more bad guys

00:10:28.913 --> 00:10:32.543
on our continent will be put behind bars.

00:10:32.543 --> 00:10:34.170
This will not stop.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.097
I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism,

00:10:37.097 --> 00:10:40.525
because I know that when evil men destroy,

00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:42.513
good men must build and bind.

00:10:42.513 --> 00:10:43.786
Thank you very much.

00:10:43.786 --> 00:10:52.694
(Applause)

00:10:53.323 --> 00:10:55.021
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.269
I have some questions for you.

00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:01.499
How did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah?

00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:03.714
AAA: Sure. You know, undercover is all about

00:11:03.714 --> 00:11:06.580
setting the priorities right, so we got people

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.418
to take me to court.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.634
So I went through the very legal process,

00:11:10.634 --> 00:11:12.858
because at the end of the day, the prison authorities

00:11:12.858 --> 00:11:15.474
want to check whether indeed you have been there or not,

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:17.488
and that's how I got in there.

00:11:17.488 --> 00:11:19.266
CA: So someone sued you in court,

00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:22.073
and they took you there, and you were in remand custody

00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:24.514
for part of it, and you did that deliberately.

00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:26.205
AAA: Yes, yes.

00:11:26.205 --> 00:11:29.368
CA: Talk to me just about fear

00:11:29.368 --> 00:11:31.177
and how you manage that,

00:11:31.177 --> 00:11:33.810
because you're regularly putting your life at risk.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.373
How do you do that?

00:11:35.373 --> 00:11:38.563
AAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort.

00:11:38.563 --> 00:11:40.777
Before we go undercover, we follow the rules.

00:11:40.777 --> 00:11:43.847
And I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear

00:11:43.847 --> 00:11:46.327
whenever I am sure that all the steps

00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:49.520
have been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team

00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:52.900
who help ensure that the safety and all the systems

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.845
are put in place, but you've got to take

00:11:54.845 --> 00:11:57.596
very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening.

00:11:57.596 --> 00:12:00.212
If you don't, you will end up losing your life.

00:12:00.212 --> 00:12:02.716
So yes, when the backup systems are put in place,

00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:04.804
I'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes,

00:12:04.804 --> 00:12:07.460
but it's a hazard of a profession.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.013
I mean, everybody has their hazard.

00:12:09.013 --> 00:12:10.946
And once you say that is yours,

00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:13.254
you've got to take it, as and when it comes.

00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:15.945
CA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work

00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:17.215
and you've taught us a story

00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:20.462
like no story I think any of us have heard before.

00:12:20.462 --> 00:12:24.306
And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much, Anas.

00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:25.430
AAA: Thank you.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.702
CA: Thank you. Stay safe. (Applause)
