WEBVTT

00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.844
Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet

00:00:02.844 --> 00:00:05.087
a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with

00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:08.554
in the wild for the last 28 years.

00:00:08.554 --> 00:00:11.749
Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.863
and what they might be doing with all that brainpower

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:15.338
in the wild.

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:17.610
And we know they use some of that brainpower

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.774
for just living complicated lives,

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:22.634
but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:24.338
Well, we know a few things.

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:26.527
We know that their brain-to-body ratio,

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.497
which is a physical measure of intelligence,

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:30.993
is second only to humans.

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:32.551
Cognitively, they can understand

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:34.980
artificially-created languages.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.121
And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.225
And in some parts of the world, they use tools,

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:42.540
like sponges to hunt fish.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.191
But there's one big question left:

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:47.058
do they have a language, and if so,

00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:49.462
what are they talking about?

00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:52.905
So decades ago, not years ago,

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:55.068
I set out to find a place in the world

00:00:55.068 --> 00:00:56.866
where I could observe dolphins underwater

00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:00.109
to try to crack the code of their communication system.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.723
Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky,

00:01:02.723 --> 00:01:05.962
so it's very hard to observe animals underwater,

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:07.721
but I found a community of dolphins that live

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:10.747
in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas

00:01:10.747 --> 00:01:12.989
which are just east of Florida.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.400
And they spend their daytime resting and socializing

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.270
in the safety of the shallows, but at night,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.069
they go off the edge and hunt in deep water.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.893
Now, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.

00:01:24.893 --> 00:01:27.069
So we go out for about five months every summer

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.271
in a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:33.349
at sea for weeks at a time.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.989
My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone,

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:37.939
which is an underwater microphone, and this is so

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.033
I can correlate sound and behavior.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.679
And most of our work's pretty non-invasive.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.501
We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water,

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.629
since we're actually observing them physically in the water.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:50.769
Now, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:52.733
to work with for a couple of reasons.

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:55.664
They're born without spots, and they get spots with age,

00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:58.698
and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases,

00:01:58.698 --> 00:02:00.640
so that's fun to track their behavior.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.093
And by about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white.

00:02:04.093 --> 00:02:06.516
Now the mother you see here is Mugsy.

00:02:06.516 --> 00:02:08.501
She's 35 years old in this shot,

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:11.691
but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.

00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:14.994
And like all the dolphins in our community,

00:02:14.994 --> 00:02:17.765
we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:19.507
and nicks in her dorsal fin,

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.710
and also the unique spot patterns

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.053
as she matured over time.

00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:26.712
Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up,

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.787
and they use their teenage years to practice social skills,

00:02:29.787 --> 00:02:32.140
and at about the age of nine, the females

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.810
become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.781
and the males mature quite a bit later,

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.896
at around 15 years of age.

00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:40.636
And dolphins are very promiscuous,

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:43.498
and so we have to determine who the fathers are,

00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:45.952
so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material

00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:48.816
out of the water and extracting DNA.

00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:51.280
So what that means is, after 28 years,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.688
we are tracking three generations,

00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:56.032
including grandmothers and grandfathers.

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:58.648
Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.

00:02:58.648 --> 00:03:00.932
They make sounds 10 times as high

00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:03.120
and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.715
But they have other communication signals they use.

00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:09.056
They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.256
They have taste, not smell.

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:13.296
And they have touch.

00:03:13.296 --> 00:03:15.492
And sound can actually be felt in the water,

00:03:15.492 --> 00:03:18.523
because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.

00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:22.153
So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.

00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:24.693
Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used

00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:26.102
with certain behaviors.

00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:28.201
Now, the signature whistle is a whistle

00:03:28.201 --> 00:03:32.900
that's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name. (Dolphin whistling noises)

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.076
And this is the best-studied sound,

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:36.705
because it's easy to measure, really,

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:38.662
and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:40.799
are reuniting, for example.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.857
Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks.

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.103
This is the dolphin's sonar. (Dolphin echolocation noises)

00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:50.420
And they use these clicks to hunt and feed.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.808
But they can also tightly pack these clicks together

00:03:52.808 --> 00:03:54.943
into buzzes and use them socially.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.921
For example, males will stimulate a female

00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.425
during a courtship chase.

00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:01.752
You know, I've been buzzed in the water.

00:04:01.752 --> 00:04:03.684
(Laughter)

00:04:03.684 --> 00:04:06.065
Don't tell anyone. It's a secret.

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:08.361
And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.

00:04:08.361 --> 00:04:12.093
(Laughter)

00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:14.618
So dolphins are also political animals,

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:16.929
so they have to resolve conflicts.

00:04:16.929 --> 00:04:18.572
(Dolphin noises)

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:20.945
And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:23.353
their head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting.

00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:25.425
And these are very unstudied sounds

00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:27.563
because they're hard to measure.

00:04:27.563 --> 00:04:30.282
Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.

00:04:30.282 --> 00:04:32.303
(Dolphin noises)

00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:34.393
So you're going to see two groups,

00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:36.601
and you're going to see the head-to-head posturing,

00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:39.945
some open mouths,

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:42.101
lots of squawking.

00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:45.686
There's a bubble.

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:48.269
And basically, one of these groups will kind of back off

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:49.923
and everything will resolve fine,

00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:53.583
and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much.

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.887
Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose

00:04:55.887 --> 00:04:58.831
that interact socially with the spotted dolphins.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.542
For example, they babysit each other's calves.

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:03.719
The males have dominance displays that they use

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.119
when they're chasing each other's females.

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:08.541
And the two species actually form temporary alliances

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.919
when they're chasing sharks away.

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.830
And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.830
their coordination is synchrony.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.941
They synchronize their sounds and their body postures

00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.075
to look bigger and sound stronger.

00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:22.551
(Dolphins noises)

00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:25.143
Now, these are bottlenose dolphins,

00:05:25.143 --> 00:05:26.914
and you'll see them starting to synchronize

00:05:26.914 --> 00:05:28.815
their behavior and their sounds.

00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:33.183
(Dolphin noises)

00:05:33.183 --> 00:05:35.429
You see, they're synchronizing with their partner

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:39.401
as well as the other dyad.

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:41.915
I wish I was that coordinated.

00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:47.805
Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:49.700
the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.863
and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds,

00:05:51.863 --> 00:05:53.421
and we use special equipment in the water

00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:55.158
to collect these sounds.

00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:57.723
Now, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity

00:05:57.723 --> 00:05:59.786
using information theory,

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:03.677
and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.

00:06:03.677 --> 00:06:07.529
But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery.

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.616
Now, these are three spectragrams.

00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:13.291
Two are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:17.163
So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.743
Now, it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look

00:06:21.743 --> 00:06:24.247
a bit like human phonemes.

00:06:24.247 --> 00:06:25.513
Now, one way to crack the code

00:06:25.513 --> 00:06:28.058
is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean,

00:06:28.058 --> 00:06:32.056
but it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet.

00:06:32.056 --> 00:06:34.178
But a second way to crack the code

00:06:34.178 --> 00:06:36.143
is to develop some technology,

00:06:36.143 --> 00:06:38.323
an interface to do two-way communication,

00:06:38.323 --> 00:06:40.687
and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas

00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:43.127
and in real time.

00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:45.783
Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces

00:06:45.783 --> 00:06:47.847
to try to bridge the gap with species

00:06:47.847 --> 00:06:49.935
including chimpanzees and dolphins.

00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:52.960
This underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.702
at the Epcot Center, was actually

00:06:54.702 --> 00:06:57.519
the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:00.383
for humans and dolphins to work together under the water

00:07:00.383 --> 00:07:02.310
and exchange information.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.930
So we wanted to develop an interface like this

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.300
in the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.467
And one of the reasons we thought we could do this

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:11.489
is because the dolphins were starting to show us

00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:13.093
a lot of mutual curiosity.

00:07:13.093 --> 00:07:16.004
They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations

00:07:16.004 --> 00:07:18.324
and our postures, and they were also inviting us

00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:20.957
into dolphin games.

00:07:20.957 --> 00:07:23.604
Now, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play,

00:07:23.604 --> 00:07:26.924
and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed,

00:07:26.924 --> 00:07:30.036
or sargassum in this case, around.

00:07:30.036 --> 00:07:32.172
And they're very adept. They like to drag it

00:07:32.172 --> 00:07:36.492
and drop it from appendage to appendage.

00:07:36.492 --> 00:07:39.188
Now in this footage, the adult is Caroh.

00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:43.060
She's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.744
and he's just learning how to play this game.

00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:47.470
(Dolphin noises)

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.940
She's kind of teasing him and taunting him.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.369
He really wants that sargassum.

00:07:56.369 --> 00:07:59.280
Now, when dolphins solicit humans for this game,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.331
they'll often sink vertically in the water,

00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:04.760
and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.379
and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:08.913
on the bottom and let us go get it,

00:08:08.913 --> 00:08:11.129
and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game.

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:12.965
But when we don't dive down and get it,

00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:14.938
they'll bring it to the surface

00:08:14.938 --> 00:08:18.112
and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail

00:08:18.112 --> 00:08:20.198
and drop it for us like they do their calves,

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:22.400
and then we'll pick it up and have a game.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.750
And so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.568
to build some technology that would allow the dolphins

00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:30.843
to request these things in real time, their favorite toys?

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.213
So the original vision was to have a keyboard

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:35.386
hanging from the boat attached to a computer,

00:08:35.386 --> 00:08:37.901
and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys

00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:40.791
on the keypad and happily exchange information

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:42.949
and request toys from each other.

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:44.743
But we quickly found out that dolphins simply

00:08:44.743 --> 00:08:47.869
were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.

00:08:47.869 --> 00:08:50.005
They've got better things to do in the wild.

00:08:50.005 --> 00:08:52.269
They might do it in captivity, but in the wild --

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:54.994
So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water,

00:08:54.994 --> 00:08:57.734
and we labeled four objects they like to play with,

00:08:57.734 --> 00:09:00.675
the scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride,

00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:02.786
which is a fun activity for a dolphin. (Whistle)

00:09:02.786 --> 00:09:04.629
And that's the scarf whistle,

00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:07.547
which is also associated with a visual symbol.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.841
And these are artificially created whistles.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.469
They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire,

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.889
but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins.

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:19.068
And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour,

00:09:19.068 --> 00:09:21.289
working out in the field with this keyboard

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:23.933
using it with each other to do requests for toys

00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:25.592
while the dolphins were watching.

00:09:25.592 --> 00:09:26.959
And the dolphins could get in on the game.

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.894
They could point at the visual object,

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:31.368
or they could mimic the whistle.

00:09:31.368 --> 00:09:34.736
Now this is video of a session.

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:36.937
The diver here has a rope toy,

00:09:36.937 --> 00:09:39.185
and I'm on the keyboard on the left,

00:09:39.185 --> 00:09:41.833
and I've just played the rope key,

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:45.044
and that's the request for the toy from the human.

00:09:45.044 --> 00:09:48.247
So I've got the rope, I'm diving down,

00:09:48.247 --> 00:09:50.881
and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention,

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:51.949
because they're kind of like little kids.

00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:54.506
You have to keep their attention.

00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:59.193
I'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.

00:09:59.193 --> 00:10:01.697
Here they come,

00:10:01.697 --> 00:10:03.006
and then they're going to pick up the rope

00:10:03.006 --> 00:10:04.612
and drag it around as a toy.

00:10:04.612 --> 00:10:06.397
Now, I'm at the keyboard on the left,

00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:08.707
and this is actually the first time that we tried this.

00:10:08.707 --> 00:10:11.573
I'm going to try to request this toy, the rope toy,

00:10:11.573 --> 00:10:14.141
from the dolphins using the rope sound.

00:10:14.141 --> 00:10:18.452
Let's see if they might actually understand what that means.

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:20.978
(Whistle)

00:10:20.978 --> 00:10:23.678
That's the rope whistle.

00:10:23.678 --> 00:10:24.975
Up come the dolphins,

00:10:24.975 --> 00:10:28.580
and drop off the rope, yay. Wow.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.564
(Applause)

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.324
So this is only once.

00:10:33.324 --> 00:10:36.132
We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.

00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:38.600
Okay, so here's a second toy in the water.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.389
This is a scarf toy, and I'm trying to lead the dolphin

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.726
over to the keyboard to show her

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.916
the visual and the acoustic signal.

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:48.983
Now this dolphin, we call her "the scarf thief,"

00:10:48.983 --> 00:10:52.476
because over the years she's absconded

00:10:52.476 --> 00:10:55.054
with about 12 scarves.

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:58.828
In fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.

00:10:58.828 --> 00:11:02.522
So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side.

00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:04.286
And we try to not touch the animals too much,

00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:06.422
we really don't want to over-habituate them.

00:11:06.422 --> 00:11:08.537
And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard.

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:12.483
And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound

00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:14.294
to request the scarf.

00:11:14.294 --> 00:11:17.043
So I try to give her the scarf.

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:20.018
Whoop. Almost lost it.

00:11:20.018 --> 00:11:22.934
But this is the moment where everything becomes possible.

00:11:22.934 --> 00:11:24.679
The dolphin's at the keyboard.

00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:26.237
You've got full attention.

00:11:26.237 --> 00:11:28.493
And this sometimes went on for hours.

00:11:28.493 --> 00:11:29.948
And I wanted to share this video with you

00:11:29.948 --> 00:11:31.733
not to show you any big breakthroughs,

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:32.853
because they haven't happened yet,

00:11:32.853 --> 00:11:35.479
but to show you the level of intention and focus

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:38.126
that these dolphins have, and interest in the system.

00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:40.147
And because of this, we really decided we needed

00:11:40.147 --> 00:11:42.241
some more sophisticated technology.

00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:44.441
So we joined forces with Georgia Tech,

00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:47.117
with Thad Starner's wearable computing group,

00:11:47.117 --> 00:11:49.079
to build us an underwater wearable computer

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:50.945
that we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry]

00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:52.981
Now, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water,

00:11:52.981 --> 00:11:56.599
the diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only,

00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:59.607
so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad

00:11:59.607 --> 00:12:00.786
on the forearm,

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.974
the sounds go out through an underwater speaker,

00:12:02.974 --> 00:12:04.384
if a dolphin mimics the whistle

00:12:04.384 --> 00:12:06.893
or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.469
and are localized by two hydrophones.

00:12:09.469 --> 00:12:12.816
The computer can localize who requested the toy

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.853
if there's a word match.

00:12:14.853 --> 00:12:17.417
And the real power of the system is in the real-time

00:12:17.417 --> 00:12:19.334
sound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins

00:12:19.334 --> 00:12:21.461
quickly and accurately.

00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.645
And we're at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:28.923
So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer

00:12:28.923 --> 00:12:31.517
and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle,

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:33.997
the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water,

00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:36.429
but also as a word through bone conduction.

00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:38.678
So Diver A plays the scarf whistle

00:12:38.678 --> 00:12:40.574
or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle

00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:42.990
to request a toy from whoever has it.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.199
What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle,

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:49.369
and if Diver A has the sargassum, if that's the sound

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:52.114
that was played and requested,

00:12:52.114 --> 00:12:55.962
then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin

00:12:55.962 --> 00:12:57.778
and they'll swim away happily into the sunset

00:12:57.778 --> 00:13:00.895
playing sargassum for forever.

00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:04.275
Now, how far can this kind of communication go?

00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:08.164
Well, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins

00:13:08.164 --> 00:13:09.746
to request things from us.

00:13:09.746 --> 00:13:12.139
It's designed to really be two-way.

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:15.418
Now, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?

00:13:15.418 --> 00:13:17.299
We hope so and we think so.

00:13:17.299 --> 00:13:19.443
But as we decode their natural sounds,

00:13:19.443 --> 00:13:23.031
we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system.

00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:26.531
For example, right now we can put their own signature whistles

00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:30.626
in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.

00:13:30.626 --> 00:13:34.356
Likewise, we can create our own whistles,

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:36.675
our own whistle names, and let the dolphins

00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:39.443
request specific divers to interact with.

00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:42.364
Now it may be that all our mobile technology

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:45.500
will actually be the same technology that helps us

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.731
communicate with another species down the road.

00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:52.363
In the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that,

00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:55.746
well, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways

00:13:55.746 --> 00:13:58.289
and we might not be able to admit that right now,

00:13:58.289 --> 00:14:00.113
but they live in quite a different environment,

00:14:00.113 --> 00:14:04.613
and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems.

00:14:04.613 --> 00:14:06.297
I mean, imagine what it would be like

00:14:06.297 --> 00:14:07.906
to really understand the mind

00:14:07.906 --> 00:14:11.691
of another intelligent species on the planet.

00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:13.039
Thank you.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:17.963
(Applause)
