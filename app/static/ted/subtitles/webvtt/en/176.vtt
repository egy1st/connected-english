00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I am known best for human-powered flight,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but that was just one thing that got me going

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in the sort of things that I'm working in now.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
indoor models, outdoor models, everything,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which I just thought was a lot of fun,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And then, navy pilot training, and, after college,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but got tangled up with some great professor types,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who convinced me and everybody else in the field

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that this was a good way to get into really deep science.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
While this was all going on, I was in the field of weather modification,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The weather modification subject was getting started,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and as a graduate student,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I could go around to the various talks that were being given,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and so on. And everybody would talk to me,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but all the professionals in the field hated each other,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I got the absolutely unique background in that field,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and started a company, which did more research

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in weather modification than anybody,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
then one or two, three,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We had AirDynamisis,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
on some big, many year project,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The thing that is exciting was, in 1976,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
or I guaranteed the money at the bank.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
He needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
which had then been around for -- (Laughter) --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Laughter) --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and did not -- the way I approached it, first,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
thinking about ways to make the planes,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
just for the fun of it,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and immediately, figure out its speed,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and the turning radius, and so on,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
which I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(Laughter) --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
with my three sons, young sons, helping me,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
but ridiculing the whole thing very much.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But that began thinking about how birds went around,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and then other planes,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but three times the span, three times the cord.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and we won the prize a year later.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We didn't -- a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
(Laughter)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that was a one-mile flight -- put up a new prize

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
for flying the English Channel, 21 miles.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
the power to fly would be decreased a little bit,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and if you decrease the power required a little,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
the pilot can fly a much longer period of time.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It turned out that giving the planes to the museum

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
was worth much more than the debt,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So, there were good economic reasons for the project, but --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
(Laughter) --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
(Laughter) --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
because the prizes are all over.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
(Laughter)

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
But that sure started me thinking about various things,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
because we felt solar power was going to be so important

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
for the country and the world,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which is what the government was trying to do with it.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and maybe help that field.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And that project continued, did succeed,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and we then got into other projects in aviation

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and mechanical things and ground devices.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But while this was going on,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
their annual prize --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and I had to prepare a paper on it,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
which collected all my varied thoughts

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and varied interests over the years.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and what was important. And to my surprise,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I realized the importance of environmental issues,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I thought back about if I was a space traveler,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the little differences in the Earth.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But this last time, just coming round, right now,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
in the concentration of people,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I wanted to show the slide --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.000
this slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
(Laughter)

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
(Applause) --

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And so, the year 2000, you see there.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000
the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Humans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
of vertebrates on land and air.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And you don't know what the future will hold,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
but it's not going to get a lower percentage.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
were not even one tenth of one percent

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Now they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and ask them, after they've asked me questions,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
What's the population of the Earth?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What's the population of the Earth going to be

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
when you're the age of your parents?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought about

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
but, now, they think about it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And then, what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And they form little groups, all fighting with each other,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and when I leave, two hours later,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
most of them are saying about 2 billion people,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000
nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Rachel Carson was thinking of these, and came out with "Silent Spring," way back.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
"Solar Manifesto" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
claims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000
from solar energy and water, and so on.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and we can do things much more efficiently.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Let's have the next slide.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
complex and probable, wonderful and fragile.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Suddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
have grown in population, technology and intelligence

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to a position of terrible power. We, now, wield the paintbrush."

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We're in charge. It's frightening.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And I do a painting every 20 or 25 years. This is the last one.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
(Laughter)

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on;

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TV

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and traffic jams and so on.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I have no idea of what comes next,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
as a little warning.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And two weeks after this drawing was done,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
we actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
(Laughter)

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
(Paper rustling)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Well, that'll be all the slides.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We focused more on the really serious energy problems

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
of the future, and we produced products for the company.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And we developed the impact car that General Motors made,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
the EV1, out of --

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I have a Helios. We have the first video.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
(Video) Narrator: With a wingspan of 247 feet, this makes her larger than a Boeing 747.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:18.000
(Music)

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Her designers' attention to detail and her construction

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
gives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
This enables her to easily ride through the air currents

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Paul MacCready: The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
(Laughter)

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Narrator: And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
to maximize the power from her solar array.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
(Music)

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
has gone by without notice,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and their associated sensors.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
at 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
This is more than 10,000 feet higher

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
(Applause)

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Eventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
for six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
but only ten miles above the Earth.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
(Video) Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
if the operator is remote from the vehicle.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
It is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
With on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
PM: Okay, and let's have the next.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
(Applause)

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
That plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Let's have the next video.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:03.000
(Video) (Music)

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
(Music)

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
We're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
by meeting his son, Tyler, who, with his two brothers,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
helped build the Gossamer Condor, 25 years ago.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Tyler MacCready: You can chase it, like this, for hours.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
AA: When they got bored with their father's project,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
TM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
AA: They called it their Walkalong Glider.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
(Music)

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I've never seen anything like that.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
How old were you when you invented that?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
TM: Oh, 10, 11. (AA: Oh my God.)

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
TM: 12, something like that. (AA: That's amazing.)

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
PM: And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
(Applause)

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
TM: All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and one of the first things,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
the production version seemed to dive a little bit,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
before you try flying it.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I'll give you a demonstration of how it works.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
as you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
and you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
(Laughter)

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And then also, like it said in the video,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
you can turn it left or right

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
just by putting the lift under one wing or another.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
So I can do it -- oops, that was going to be a right turn.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
(Laughter)

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Okay, this one will be a left turn.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Here, but --

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
(Applause) --

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
anyway.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
(Applause)

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
so you have real collector's items.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
(Laughter)

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And this, we just wanted to show you --

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
if we can get the video running on this, yeah --

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
just an example of a little video surveillance.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
(Laughter)

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
This was flying around in the party last night, and --

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
(Laughter) --

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
you can see how it just can fly around,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and you can spy on anybody you want.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
(Laughter)

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
And that's it. I was going to bring an airplane,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
but I was worried about hitting people in here,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:00.000
(Applause)

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
All right.
