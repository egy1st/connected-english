00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.952
I made a film that was impossible to make,

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.603
but I didn't know it was impossible,

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:10.395
and that's how I was able to do it.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.855
"Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:17.053
It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.

00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:19.255
No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.937
because it's expensive, it's set in the future,

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:24.597
and it's got tons of visual effects,

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:27.028
and it's shot on green screen.

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.179
Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.164
ever since I was a kid, really,

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:33.273
back when I was reading some comic books

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:36.869
and dreaming about what the future might be.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.505
When American producers see my film,

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.789
they think that I had a big budget to do it,

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.908
like 23 million.

00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:48.894
But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget.

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:51.443
I did "Mars et Avril" for only 2.3 million.

00:00:51.443 --> 00:00:52.539
So you might wonder, what's the deal here?

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.092
How did I do this?

00:00:55.092 --> 00:00:58.329
Well, it's two things. First, it's time.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.110
When you don't have money, you must take time,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.002
and it took me seven years to do "Mars et Avril."

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:08.332
The second aspect is love.

00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:11.870
I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.040
And it seems like every department had nothing,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.068
so they had to rely on our creativity

00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:19.642
and turn every problem into an opportunity.

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:21.668
And that brings me to the point of my talk, actually,

00:01:21.668 --> 00:01:25.808
how constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity.

00:01:25.808 --> 00:01:29.216
But let me go back in time a bit.

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:32.373
In my early 20s, I did some graphic novels,

00:01:32.373 --> 00:01:34.407
but they weren't your usual graphic novels.

00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:36.900
They were books telling a science fiction story

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.605
through images and text,

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:43.188
and most of the actors who are now starring

00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:45.246
in the movie adaptation, they were already involved

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:48.840
in these books portraying characters

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.387
into a sort of experimental, theatrical, simplistic way.

00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:58.090
And one of these actors is the great stage director

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.534
and actor Robert Lepage.

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:01.055
And I just love this guy.

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:04.500
I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.303
His career I admire a lot.

00:02:07.303 --> 00:02:10.236
And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project,

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:14.396
and he was kind enough to lend his image

00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:16.059
to the character of Eugène Spaak,

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:20.681
who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:26.151
in between time, space, love, music and women.

00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:29.706
And he was a perfect fit for the part,

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:32.890
and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.226
He was the one who believed in me

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:38.803
and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books

00:02:38.803 --> 00:02:41.758
into a film, and to write, direct,

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:43.810
and produce the film myself.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.620
And Robert is actually the very first example

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.504
of how constraints can boost creativity.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.171
Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet.

00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:57.294
I mean, his agenda is booked until 2042,

00:02:57.294 --> 00:03:01.134
and he's really hard to get,

00:03:01.134 --> 00:03:04.017
and I wanted him to be in the movie,

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.922
to reprise his role in the movie.

00:03:05.922 --> 00:03:08.918
But the thing is, had I waited

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:11.470
for him until 2042, my film wouldn't be

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.266
a futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right?

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:16.950
But that's kind of a big problem.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.243
How do you get somebody who is too busy

00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:22.369
to star in a movie?

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:26.271
Well, I said as a joke in a production meeting --

00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:28.016
and this is a true story, by the way —

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:30.928
I said, "Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram?

00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:33.091
Because, you know, he is everywhere

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:34.957
and nowhere on the planet at the same time,

00:03:34.957 --> 00:03:37.528
and he's an illuminated being in my mind,

00:03:37.528 --> 00:03:41.782
and he's in between reality and virtual reality,

00:03:41.782 --> 00:03:43.756
so it would make perfect sense

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.006
to turn this guy into a hologram."

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:48.326
Everybody around the table laughed,

00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:50.862
but the joke was kind of a good solution,

00:03:50.862 --> 00:03:53.318
so that's what we ended up doing.

00:03:53.318 --> 00:03:57.021
Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras.

00:03:57.021 --> 00:03:59.463
He was dressed in green and he was like

00:03:59.463 --> 00:04:01.207
in a green aquarium.

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:03.985
Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head,

00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:06.598
so that in post-production we could use

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:08.490
pretty much any angle we needed,

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.902
and we shot only his head.

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:13.408
Six months later there was a guy on set,

00:04:13.408 --> 00:04:15.238
a mime portraying the body,

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:17.678
the vehicle for the head.

00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:20.929
And he was wearing a green hood

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:24.111
so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction

00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:26.398
and replace it with Robert Lepage's head.

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:28.406
So he became like a renaissance man,

00:04:28.406 --> 00:04:30.456
and here's what it looks like in the movie.

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:42.776
(Music)

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.944
(Video) Robert Lepage: [As usual, Arthur's drawing

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:47.138
didn't account for the technical challenges.

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:51.081
I welded the breech, but the valve is still gaping.

00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:55.364
I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box,

00:04:55.364 --> 00:04:59.296
but I might have hit a heartstring.

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:01.678
It still sounds too low.]

00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:02.609
Jacques Languirand: [That's normal.

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:05.771
The instrument always ends up resembling its model.]

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:11.301
(Music)

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:29.684
Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments

00:05:29.684 --> 00:05:31.828
that you see in this excerpt,

00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:34.335
they're my second example of how

00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.727
constraints can boost creativity,

00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:39.947
because I desperately needed these objects in my movie.

00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:41.648
They are objects of desire.

00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:44.043
They are imaginary musical instruments.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:46.123
And they carry a nice story with them.

00:05:46.123 --> 00:05:50.777
Actually, I knew what these things would look like

00:05:50.777 --> 00:05:52.607
in my mind for many, many years.

00:05:52.607 --> 00:05:56.820
But my problem was, I didn't have the money

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.601
to pay for them. I couldn't afford them.

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.032
So that's kind of a big problem too.

00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:05.633
How do you get something that you can't afford?

00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:09.593
And, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea.

00:06:09.593 --> 00:06:13.756
I said, "What if I have somebody else pay for them?"

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:16.617
(Laughter)

00:06:16.617 --> 00:06:20.345
But who on Earth would be interested

00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:23.561
by seven not-yet-built musical instruments

00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:25.261
inspired by women's bodies?

00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:28.175
And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal,

00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:31.533
because who better to understand the kind of

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:34.212
crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen?

00:06:34.212 --> 00:06:37.386
So I found my way to Guy Laliberté, Cirque du Soleil's CEO,

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:40.154
and I presented my crazy idea to him

00:06:40.154 --> 00:06:43.388
with sketches like this and visual references,

00:06:43.388 --> 00:06:46.115
and something pretty amazing happened.

00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:48.466
Guy was interested by this idea

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:51.771
not because I was asking for his money,

00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:55.197
but because I came to him with a good idea

00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:56.919
in which everybody was happy.

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.028
It was kind of a perfect triangle

00:06:59.028 --> 00:07:02.515
in which the art buyer was happy

00:07:02.515 --> 00:07:05.455
because he got the instruments at a cheaper price,

00:07:05.455 --> 00:07:07.328
because they weren't even made.

00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:08.937
He took a leap of faith.

00:07:08.937 --> 00:07:12.794
And the artist, Dominique Engel, brilliant guy,

00:07:12.794 --> 00:07:15.623
he was happy too because he had a dream project

00:07:15.623 --> 00:07:17.104
to work on for a year.

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:20.918
And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments

00:07:20.918 --> 00:07:25.726
in my film for free, which was kind of what I tried to do.

00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:27.444
So here they are.

00:07:27.444 --> 00:07:30.918
And my last example of how constraints

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:32.427
can boost creativity

00:07:32.427 --> 00:07:36.037
comes from the green,

00:07:36.037 --> 00:07:39.880
because this is a weird color, a crazy color,

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.942
and you need to replace the green screens eventually

00:07:42.942 --> 00:07:45.763
and you must figure that out sooner rather than later.

00:07:45.763 --> 00:07:49.936
And I had, again, pretty much, ideas in my mind

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.952
as to what the world would be,

00:07:51.952 --> 00:07:57.030
but then again I turned to my childhood imagination

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.593
and went to the work of Belgian comic book master

00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:03.241
François Schuiten in Belgium.

00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:06.561
And this guy is another guy I admire a lot,

00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:09.033
and I wanted him to be involved in the movie

00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:11.281
as a production designer.

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:13.618
But people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible,

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.305
the guy is too busy and he will say no.

00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:20.159
Well, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style,

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:22.158
I might as well call the real guy and ask him,

00:08:22.158 --> 00:08:24.834
and I sent him my books,

00:08:24.834 --> 00:08:26.857
and he answered that he was interested

00:08:26.857 --> 00:08:28.678
in working on the film with me

00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:32.862
because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium.

00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:36.756
In other words, there was space for him to dream with me.

00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:39.590
So here I was with one of my childhood heroes,

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.535
drawing every single frame that's in the film

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:45.749
to turn that into Montreal in the future.

00:08:45.749 --> 00:08:47.873
And it was an amazing collaboration

00:08:47.873 --> 00:08:50.526
to work with this great artist whom I admire.

00:08:50.526 --> 00:08:54.214
But then, you know, eventually you have to turn

00:08:54.214 --> 00:08:56.238
all these drawings into reality.

00:08:56.238 --> 00:08:59.367
So, again, my solution was to aim

00:08:59.367 --> 00:09:02.474
for the best possible artist that I could think of.

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:05.875
And there's this guy in Montreal, another Quebecois

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:09.857
called Carlos Monzon, and he's a very good VFX artist.

00:09:09.857 --> 00:09:13.339
This guy had been lead compositor on such films

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:16.286
as "Avatar" and "Star Trek" and "Transformers,"

00:09:16.286 --> 00:09:18.519
and other unknown projects like this,

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:21.433
and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job,

00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:22.976
and I had to convince him,

00:09:22.976 --> 00:09:26.407
and, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie,

00:09:26.407 --> 00:09:28.463
he accepted to work on mine.

00:09:28.463 --> 00:09:32.250
Why? Because I offered him a space to dream.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.664
So if you don't have money to offer to people,

00:09:35.664 --> 00:09:38.879
you must strike their imagination with something

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.391
as nice as you can think of.

00:09:41.391 --> 00:09:43.767
So this is what happened on this movie,

00:09:43.767 --> 00:09:45.108
and that's how it got made,

00:09:45.108 --> 00:09:48.239
and we went to this very nice postproduction company

00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:50.311
in Montreal called Vision Globale,

00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:54.948
and they lent their 60 artists to work full time

00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:57.894
for six months to do this crazy film.

00:09:57.894 --> 00:10:02.683
So I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideas

00:10:02.683 --> 00:10:04.356
in your mind, and that people tell you

00:10:04.356 --> 00:10:05.843
that it's impossible to make,

00:10:05.843 --> 00:10:08.438
well, that's an even better reason to want to do it,

00:10:08.438 --> 00:10:10.538
because people have a tendency

00:10:10.538 --> 00:10:13.869
to see the problems rather than the final result,

00:10:13.869 --> 00:10:16.651
whereas if you start to deal with problems

00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:19.453
as being your allies rather than your opponents,

00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:21.964
life will start to dance with you

00:10:21.964 --> 00:10:23.520
in the most amazing way.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.208
I have experienced it.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:28.267
And you might end up doing some crazy projects,

00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:31.206
and who knows, you might even end up

00:10:31.206 --> 00:10:33.470
going to Mars.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.171
Thank you.

00:10:35.171 --> 00:10:38.386
(Applause)
