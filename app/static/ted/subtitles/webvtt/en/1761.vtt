WEBVTT

00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:02.827
I'd like to talk to you today

00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:07.013
about a whole new way to think
about sexual activity

00:00:07.037 --> 00:00:11.086
and sexuality education, by comparison.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.752
If you talk to someone today in America

00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:15.576
about sexual activity,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.224
you'll find pretty soon
you're not just talking

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:20.882
about sexual activity.

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.928
You're also talking about baseball.

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:28.162
Because baseball is the dominant
cultural metaphor

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:30.680
that Americans use to think about

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:33.529
and talk about sexual activity,

00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:35.077
and we know that because there's

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.661
all this language in English

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:40.606
that seems to be talking about baseball

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.465
but that's really talking
about sexual activity.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.664
So, for example, you can
be a pitcher or a catcher,

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:49.591
and that corresponds to whether you

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:53.359
perform a sexual act
or receive a sexual act.

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:54.365
Of course, there are the bases,

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:57.583
which refer to specific sexual activities

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:00.798
that happen in a very specific order,

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:03.576
ultimately resulting in scoring a run

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.580
or hitting a home run,

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:06.888
which is usually having
vaginal intercourse

00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:08.600
to the point of orgasm,

00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:10.993
at least for the guy.

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:12.922
(Laughter)

00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:14.423
You can strike out, which means

00:01:14.447 --> 00:01:16.908
you don't get to have any sexual activity.

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:18.266
And if you're a benchwarmer,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.681
you might be a virgin or somebody who for

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.930
whatever reason isn't in the game,

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:26.095
maybe because of your age
or because of your ability

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.141
or because of your skillset.

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:30.759
A bat's a penis,

00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:34.828
and a nappy dugout
is a vulva, or a vagina.

00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:37.936
A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.853
A switch-hitter is a bisexual person,

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:44.545
and we gay and lesbian folks
play for the other team.

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.144
And then there's this one:

00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:51.168
"if there's grass
on the field, play ball."

00:01:51.192 --> 00:01:53.572
And that usually refers to

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.929
if a young person, specifically
often a young woman,

00:01:56.953 --> 00:01:58.661
is old enough to have pubic hair,

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.386
she's old enough to have sex with.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.369
This baseball model
is incredibly problematic.

00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:06.720
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:09.096
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.879
And it can't result in healthy sexuality

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:14.927
developing in young people or in adults.

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:16.649
So we need a new model.

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:19.208
I'm here today to offer
you that new model.

00:02:19.232 --> 00:02:20.983
And it's based on

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.809
pizza.

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:26.256
Now pizza is something
that is universally understood

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.153
and that most people associate
with a positive experience.

00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:30.133
So let's do this.

00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:33.102
Let's take baseball
and pizza and compare it

00:02:33.126 --> 00:02:36.546
when talking about three aspects
of sexual activity:

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.199
the trigger for sexual activity,

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:40.417
what happens during sexual activity,

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:43.569
and the expected outcome
of sexual activity.

00:02:43.593 --> 00:02:46.377
So when do you play baseball?

00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:48.817
You play baseball when
it's baseball season

00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:51.099
and when there's a game on the schedule.

00:02:51.123 --> 00:02:53.409
It's not exactly your choice.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:56.305
So if it's prom night or a wedding night

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.375
or at a party or if our parents
aren't home,

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.107
hey, it's just batter up.

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:03.893
Can you imagine saying to your coach,

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.394
"Uh, I'm not really feeling it today,

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.461
I think I'll sit this game out."

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:10.553
That's just not the way it happens.

00:03:10.577 --> 00:03:12.625
And when you get together
to play baseball,

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.076
immediately you're
with two opposing teams,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.406
one playing offense, one playing defense,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.201
somebody's trying to move
deeper into the field.

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:22.134
That's usually a sign to the boy.

00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:25.170
Somebody's trying to defend
people moving into the field.

00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:27.399
That's often given to the girl.

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:28.434
It's competitive.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.223
We're not playing with each other.

00:03:30.247 --> 00:03:31.630
We're playing against each other.

00:03:31.654 --> 00:03:33.562
And when you show up to play baseball,

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:36.106
nobody needs to talk
about what we're going to do

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.647
or how this baseball game
might be good for us.

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:39.910
Everybody knows the rules.

00:03:39.934 --> 00:03:44.289
You just take your position
and play the game.

00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:46.649
But when do you have pizza?

00:03:46.673 --> 00:03:50.891
Well, you have pizza when
you're hungry for pizza.

00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:54.985
It starts with an internal sense,
an internal desire, or a need.

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.657
"Huh. I could go for some pizza."

00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:00.914
(Laughter)

00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:03.891
And because it's an internal desire,

00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:06.249
we actually have some sense
of control over that.

00:04:06.273 --> 00:04:07.803
I could decide that I'm hungry

00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:11.334
but know that it's not
a great time to eat.

00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:13.996
And then when we get together
with someone for pizza,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.846
we're not competing with them,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.346
we're looking for an experience

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.632
that both of us will share

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:21.606
that's satisfying for both of us,

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.611
and when you get together
for pizza with somebody,

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:26.159
what's the first thing you do?

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:28.081
You talk about it.

00:04:28.105 --> 00:04:29.612
You talk about what you want.

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:31.105
You talk about what you like.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.661
You may even negotiate it.

00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:35.430
"How do you feel
about pepperoni?" (Laughter)

00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:38.057
"Not so much, I'm kind
of a mushroom guy myself."

00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.123
"Well, maybe we can go half and half."

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:42.147
And even if you've had pizza with somebody

00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:45.182
for a very long time,

00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:47.244
don't you still say things like,

00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:49.237
"Should we get the usual?"

00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:50.400
(Laughter)

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:54.157
"Or maybe something
a little more adventurous?"

00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:55.991
Okay, so when you're playing baseball,

00:04:56.015 --> 00:04:58.109
so if we talk
about during sexual activity,

00:04:58.133 --> 00:04:59.514
when you're playing baseball,

00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:02.042
you're just supposed to round the bases

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:04.522
in the proper order one at a time.

00:05:04.546 --> 00:05:06.737
You can't hit the ball
and run to right field.

00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:07.959
That doesn't work.

00:05:07.983 --> 00:05:10.277
And you also can't get
to second base and say,

00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:14.677
"I like it here. I'm going to stay here."

00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:16.098
No.

00:05:16.122 --> 00:05:18.503
And also, of course,
with baseball, there's, like,

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:21.003
the specific equipment
and a specific skill set.

00:05:21.027 --> 00:05:24.630
Not everybody can play baseball.
It's pretty exclusive.

00:05:24.654 --> 00:05:26.288
Okay, but what about pizza?

00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:28.884
When we're trying to figure
out what's good for pizza,

00:05:28.908 --> 00:05:31.569
isn't it all about what's our pleasure?

00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:33.301
There are a million different
kinds of pizza.

00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:35.087
There's a million different toppings.

00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:37.389
There's a million different
ways to eat pizza.

00:05:37.413 --> 00:05:40.338
And none of them are wrong.
They're different.

00:05:40.362 --> 00:05:42.786
And in this case, difference is good,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.858
because that's going
to increase the chance

00:05:44.882 --> 00:05:47.442
that we're having a satisfying experience.

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:50.402
And lastly, what's the expected
outcome of baseball?

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:54.100
Well, in baseball, you play to win.

00:05:54.124 --> 00:05:56.633
You score as many runs as you can.

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:58.621
There's always a winner in baseball,

00:05:58.645 --> 00:06:02.042
and that means there's always
a loser in baseball.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:03.698
But what about pizza?

00:06:03.722 --> 00:06:05.909
Well, in pizza, we're not really --

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:09.576
there's no winning. How do you win pizza?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.831
You don't. But you do look for,

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:14.552
"Are we satisfied?"

00:06:14.576 --> 00:06:16.624
And sometimes that can
be different amounts

00:06:16.648 --> 00:06:18.791
over different times
or with different people

00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:20.708
or on different days.

00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:23.838
And we get to decide
when we feel satisfied.

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:26.676
If we're still hungry,
we might have some more.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.214
If you eat too much, though,

00:06:28.238 --> 00:06:30.119
you just feel gross.

00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:32.528
(Laughter)

00:06:32.552 --> 00:06:35.214
So what if we could take this pizza model

00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:38.586
and overlay it on top
of sexuality education?

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.125
A lot of sexuality education
that happens today

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:44.551
is so influenced by the baseball model,

00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:48.344
and it sets up education that can't help

00:06:48.368 --> 00:06:52.077
but produce unhealthy
sexuality in young people.

00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.340
And those young people
become older people.

00:06:54.364 --> 00:06:57.799
But if we could create sexuality education

00:06:57.823 --> 00:07:00.148
that was more like pizza,

00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:03.596
we could create education
that invites people

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.891
to think about their own desires,

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:09.143
to make deliberate decisions
about what they want,

00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:11.775
to talk about it with their partners,

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:13.448
and to ultimately look for

00:07:13.472 --> 00:07:16.592
not some external outcome

00:07:16.616 --> 00:07:19.749
but for what feels satisfying,

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:22.268
and we get to decide that.

00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:23.029
You may have noticed

00:07:23.053 --> 00:07:25.908
in the baseball and pizza comparison,

00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:28.748
under the baseball, it's all commands.

00:07:28.772 --> 00:07:30.845
They're all exclamation points.

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:33.914
But under the pizza
model, they're questions.

00:07:33.938 --> 00:07:35.796
And who gets to answer those questions?

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.456
You do. I do.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.356
So remember, when we're thinking about

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.102
sexuality education and sexual activity,

00:07:44.126 --> 00:07:46.292
baseball, you're out.

00:07:46.316 --> 00:07:49.524
Pizza is the way to think about healthy,

00:07:49.548 --> 00:07:51.964
satisfying sexual activity,

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:54.904
and good, comprehensive
sexuality education.

00:07:54.928 --> 00:07:57.134
Thank you very much for your time.

00:07:57.158 --> 00:08:01.820
(Applause)
