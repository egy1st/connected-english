00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:04.012
Everything is interconnected.

00:00:04.012 --> 00:00:07.538
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:09.561
We are a small fishing tribe

00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:12.745
situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:15.910
near the town of Southampton in New York.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.380
When I was a little girl,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.728
my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.

00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:27.282
There were no clouds in the sky.

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:30.453
And after a while I began to perspire.

00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:33.979
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said,

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:36.827
"Look, do you see that?

00:00:36.827 --> 00:00:38.946
That's part of you up there.

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:41.861
That's your water that helps to make the cloud

00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:46.134
that becomes the rain that feeds the plants

00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:49.920
that feeds the animals."

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.912
In my continued exploration of subjects in nature

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:57.328
that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life,

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:00.029
I started storm chasing in 2008

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:03.897
after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:10.108
And so three days later, driving very fast,

00:01:10.108 --> 00:01:17.368
I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell,

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:21.819
capable of producing grapefruit-size hail

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.812
and spectacular tornadoes,

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:30.118
although only two percent actually do.

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:35.262
These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:39.328
and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:41.702
They can grow so big, blocking all daylight,

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:46.826
making it very dark and ominous standing under them.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:49.728
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.

00:01:49.728 --> 00:01:53.995
There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back

00:01:53.995 --> 00:02:00.697
and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.

00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:04.094
And then there are the colors in the clouds

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:09.284
of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:12.562
I've learned to respect the lightning.

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:14.696
My hair used to be straight.

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:16.120
(Laughter)

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.744
I'm just kidding.

00:02:17.744 --> 00:02:19.886
(Laughter)

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:23.062
What really excites me about these storms

00:02:23.062 --> 00:02:27.279
is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate,

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.297
with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.

00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:34.029
They become lovely monsters.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.562
When I'm photographing them,

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:40.295
I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:42.287
As I stand under them,

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.494
I see not just a cloud,

00:02:44.494 --> 00:02:47.377
but understand that what I have the privilege to witness

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:51.827
is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version

00:02:51.827 --> 00:02:58.145
that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:02.703
and even this very planet.

00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:05.160
All my relations. Thank you.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.537
(Applause)
