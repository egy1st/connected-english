00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.067
So what does it mean
for a machine to be athletic?

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.884
We will demonstrate the concept
of machine athleticism

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:19.604
and the research to achieve it

00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:22.486
with the help of these flying machines
called quadrocopters,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.557
or quads, for short.

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:28.184
Quads have been around for a long time.

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.778
They're so popular these days
because they're mechanically simple.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.644
By controlling
the speeds of these four propellers,

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:37.413
these machines can roll, pitch, yaw,

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.608
and accelerate
along their common orientation.

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.377
On board are also a battery, a computer,

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.354
various sensors and wireless radios.

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:50.607
Quads are extremely agile,
but this agility comes at a cost.

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.850
They are inherently unstable,

00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:56.445
and they need some form
of automatic feedback control

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.842
in order to be able to fly.

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.512
So, how did it just do that?

00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:09.291
Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:11.745
serve as an indoor
global positioning system.

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.340
It's used to locate objects in the space

00:01:14.364 --> 00:01:16.452
that have these reflective
markers on them.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.514
This data is then sent to another laptop

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:20.896
that is running estimation
and control algorithms,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.874
which in turn sends commands to the quad,

00:01:22.898 --> 00:01:25.531
which is also running estimation
and control algorithms.

00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:32.106
The bulk of our research is algorithms.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.706
It's the magic that brings
these machines to life.

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:40.324
So how does one design the algorithms
that create a machine athlete?

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:43.379
We use something broadly
called model-based design.

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:45.205
We first capture the physics

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.212
with a mathematical model
of how the machines behave.

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:52.586
We then use a branch of mathematics
called control theory

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.267
to analyze these models

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:57.061
and also to synthesize
algorithms for controlling them.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.844
For example, that's how we can
make the quad hover.

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:04.158
We first captured the dynamics
with a set of differential equations.

00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:07.634
We then manipulate these equations
with the help of control theory

00:02:07.658 --> 00:02:10.595
to create algorithms
that stabilize the quad.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.423
Let me demonstrate
the strength of this approach.

00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:19.831
Suppose that we want
this quad to not only hover

00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:21.514
but to also balance this pole.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.294
With a little bit of practice,

00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:27.001
it's pretty straightforward
for a human being to do this,

00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:30.216
although we do have the advantage
of having two feet on the ground

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.299
and the use of our very versatile hands.

00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:35.542
It becomes a little bit more difficult

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:37.545
when I only have one foot on the ground

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.171
and when I don't use my hands.

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:43.295
Notice how this pole has
a reflective marker on top,

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.980
which means that it can
be located in the space.

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:53.343
(Audience) Oh!

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:54.626
(Applause)

00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:59.363
(Applause ends)

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:02.028
You can notice that this quad
is making fine adjustments

00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:03.426
to keep the pole balanced.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.489
How did we design
the algorithms to do this?

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:09.108
We added the mathematical
model of the pole

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:10.579
to that of the quad.

00:03:10.603 --> 00:03:13.581
Once we have a model
of the combined quad-pole system,

00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:16.924
we can use control theory to create
algorithms for controlling it.

00:03:18.538 --> 00:03:20.102
Here, you see that it's stable,

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:22.795
and even if I give it little nudges,

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:23.985
it goes back --

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.358
to the nice, balanced position.

00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:29.477
We can also augment the model

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.872
to include where we want
the quad to be in space.

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:35.371
Using this pointer,
made out of reflective markers,

00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:37.824
I can point to where I want
the quad to be in space

00:03:37.848 --> 00:03:39.445
a fixed distance away from me.

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:49.665
(Laughter)

00:03:55.763 --> 00:03:58.889
The key to these acrobatic
maneuvers is algorithms,

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:01.206
designed with the help
of mathematical models

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.415
and control theory.

00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:05.231
Let's tell the quad to come back here

00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:06.919
and let the pole drop,

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:09.074
and I will next demonstrate the importance

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:11.087
of understanding physical models

00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:13.156
and the workings of the physical world.

00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:29.290
Notice how the quad lost altitude
when I put this glass of water on it.

00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:30.717
Unlike the balancing pole,

00:04:30.741 --> 00:04:33.756
I did not include the mathematical
model of the glass

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.087
in the system.

00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.124
In fact, the system doesn't even know
that the glass is there.

00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:40.886
Like before, I could use
the pointer to tell the quad

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.481
where I want it to be in space.

00:04:45.684 --> 00:04:47.483
(Applause)

00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:53.071
(Applause ends)

00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:55.254
Okay, you should be asking yourself,

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:57.340
why doesn't the water
fall out of the glass?

00:04:57.888 --> 00:04:58.918
Two facts.

00:04:58.942 --> 00:05:02.575
The first is that gravity acts
on all objects in the same way.

00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:04.830
The second is that the propellers

00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:07.927
are all pointing in the same direction
of the glass, pointing up.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.289
You put these two things together,

00:05:10.313 --> 00:05:13.868
the net result is that all side forces
on the glass are small

00:05:13.892 --> 00:05:16.169
and are mainly dominated
by aerodynamic effects,

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:18.154
which at these speeds are negligible.

00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:25.670
And that's why you don't need
to model the glass.

00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:28.435
It naturally doesn't spill,
no matter what the quad does.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.063
(Audience) Oh!

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.198
(Applause)

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.414
(Applause ends)

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.054
The lesson here

00:05:47.078 --> 00:05:51.091
is that some high-performance tasks
are easier than others,

00:05:51.115 --> 00:05:53.452
and that understanding
the physics of the problem

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:56.170
tells you which ones are easy
and which ones are hard.

00:05:56.194 --> 00:05:58.704
In this instance, carrying
a glass of water is easy.

00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:00.358
Balancing a pole is hard.

00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:06.442
We've all heard stories of athletes
performing feats while physically injured.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:09.651
Can a machine also perform
with extreme physical damage?

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:12.121
Conventional wisdom says

00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:16.028
that you need at least four fixed motor
propeller pairs in order to fly,

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:18.576
because there are four degrees
of freedom to control:

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.565
roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.

00:06:21.192 --> 00:06:24.413
Hexacopters and octocopters,
with six and eight propellers,

00:06:24.437 --> 00:06:25.896
can provide redundancy,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.885
but quadrocopters are much more popular

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.595
because they have the minimum number
of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.

00:06:32.168 --> 00:06:33.184
Or do they?

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:41.827
(Audience) Oh!

00:06:42.407 --> 00:06:43.407
(Laughter)

00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:52.052
If we analyze the mathematical
model of this machine

00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:54.228
with only two working propellers,

00:06:54.252 --> 00:06:56.992
we discover that there's
an unconventional way to fly it.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.662
We relinquish control of yaw,

00:07:09.686 --> 00:07:12.732
but roll, pitch and acceleration
can still be controlled

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:16.102
with algorithms that exploit
this new configuration.

00:07:21.668 --> 00:07:25.957
Mathematical models tell us
exactly when and why this is possible.

00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:28.759
In this instance, this knowledge
allows us to design

00:07:28.783 --> 00:07:31.256
novel machine architectures

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.948
or to design clever algorithms
that gracefully handle damage,

00:07:34.972 --> 00:07:36.672
just like human athletes do,

00:07:36.696 --> 00:07:38.960
instead of building
machines with redundancy.

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:42.345
We can't help but hold our breath

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:45.044
when we watch a diver
somersaulting into the water,

00:07:45.068 --> 00:07:47.021
or when a vaulter is twisting in the air,

00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:48.552
the ground fast approaching.

00:07:48.576 --> 00:07:51.120
Will the diver be able
to pull off a rip entry?

00:07:51.144 --> 00:07:52.951
Will the vaulter stick the landing?

00:07:53.292 --> 00:07:56.472
Suppose we want this quad here
to perform a triple flip

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:59.322
and finish off at the exact same
spot that it started.

00:07:59.736 --> 00:08:01.855
This maneuver is going
to happen so quickly

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:05.724
that we can't use position feedback
to correct the motion during execution.

00:08:05.748 --> 00:08:07.345
There simply isn't enough time.

00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:11.452
Instead, what the quad can do
is perform the maneuver blindly,

00:08:11.476 --> 00:08:13.684
observe how it finishes the maneuver,

00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:16.185
and then use that information
to modify its behavior

00:08:16.209 --> 00:08:17.847
so that the next flip is better.

00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:20.209
Similar to the diver and the vaulter,

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.128
it is only through repeated practice

00:08:22.152 --> 00:08:24.295
that the maneuver can
be learned and executed

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:25.561
to the highest standard.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.369
(Laughter)

00:08:34.393 --> 00:08:38.178
(Applause)

00:08:39.164 --> 00:08:42.612
Striking a moving ball
is a necessary skill in many sports.

00:08:43.127 --> 00:08:44.619
How do we make a machine do

00:08:44.643 --> 00:08:47.231
what an athlete does
seemingly without effort?

00:08:57.547 --> 00:08:59.054
(Laughter)

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:06.000
(Applause)

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.798
(Applause ends)

00:09:10.542 --> 00:09:13.168
This quad has a racket
strapped onto its head

00:09:13.192 --> 00:09:16.655
with a sweet spot roughly the size
of an apple, so not too large.

00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:19.822
The following calculations
are made every 20 milliseconds,

00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:21.163
or 50 times per second.

00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:23.877
We first figure out where
the ball is going.

00:09:24.414 --> 00:09:27.035
We then next calculate
how the quad should hit the ball

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:29.544
so that it flies
to where it was thrown from.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.382
Third, a trajectory is planned
that carries the quad

00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:37.406
from its current state
to the impact point with the ball.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.009
Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds'
worth of that strategy.

00:09:41.366 --> 00:09:44.159
Twenty milliseconds later,
the whole process is repeated

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.950
until the quad strikes the ball.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.694
(Applause)

00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:01.554
Machines can not only perform
dynamic maneuvers on their own,

00:10:01.578 --> 00:10:03.417
they can do it collectively.

00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:07.028
These three quads are cooperatively
carrying a sky net.

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:17.268
(Applause)

00:10:20.372 --> 00:10:21.961
(Applause ends)

00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:26.326
They perform an extremely dynamic
and collective maneuver

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.018
to launch the ball back to me.

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:31.188
Notice that, at full extension,
these quads are vertical.

00:10:36.486 --> 00:10:38.234
(Applause)

00:10:38.258 --> 00:10:40.401
In fact, when fully extended,

00:10:40.425 --> 00:10:43.688
this is roughly five times greater
than what a bungee jumper feels

00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:45.682
at the end of their launch.

00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:53.662
The algorithms to do this are very similar

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:56.601
to what the single quad used
to hit the ball back to me.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.910
Mathematical models are used
to continuously re-plan

00:10:59.934 --> 00:11:02.765
a cooperative strategy
50 times per second.

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:08.765
Everything we have seen so far has been
about the machines and their capabilities.

00:11:08.789 --> 00:11:11.781
What happens when we couple
this machine athleticism

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:13.288
with that of a human being?

00:11:13.765 --> 00:11:17.361
What I have in front of me
is a commercial gesture sensor

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.670
mainly used in gaming.

00:11:18.694 --> 00:11:20.742
It can recognize
what my various body parts

00:11:20.766 --> 00:11:22.083
are doing in real time.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.789
Similar to the pointer
that I used earlier,

00:11:24.813 --> 00:11:27.035
we can use this as inputs to the system.

00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:29.826
We now have a natural way of interacting

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.111
with the raw athleticism
of these quads with my gestures.

00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:14.572
(Applause)

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:26.370
Interaction doesn't have to be virtual.

00:12:26.394 --> 00:12:27.584
It can be physical.

00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:29.504
Take this quad, for example.

00:12:29.893 --> 00:12:32.116
It's trying to stay
at a fixed point in space.

00:12:32.933 --> 00:12:36.622
If I try to move it
out of the way, it fights me,

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:38.520
and moves back to where it wants to be.

00:12:40.254 --> 00:12:42.341
We can change this behavior, however.

00:12:43.373 --> 00:12:45.048
We can use mathematical models

00:12:45.072 --> 00:12:47.736
to estimate the force
that I'm applying to the quad.

00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:51.419
Once we know this force,
we can also change the laws of physics,

00:12:51.443 --> 00:12:53.530
as far as the quad
is concerned, of course.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.251
Here, the quad is behaving
as if it were in a viscous fluid.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.289
We now have an intimate way
of interacting with a machine.

00:13:06.593 --> 00:13:09.075
I will use this new capability to position

00:13:09.099 --> 00:13:11.652
this camera-carrying quad
to the appropriate location

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:14.104
for filming the remainder
of this demonstration.

00:13:24.583 --> 00:13:26.966
So we can physically interact
with these quads

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.950
and we can change the laws of physics.

00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:31.370
Let's have a little bit of fun with this.

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:32.908
For what you will see next,

00:13:32.932 --> 00:13:36.226
these quads will initially behave
as if they were on Pluto.

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:39.194
As time goes on, gravity will be increased

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:41.243
until we're all back on planet Earth,

00:13:41.267 --> 00:13:43.033
but I assure you we won't get there.

00:13:43.462 --> 00:13:44.486
Okay, here goes.

00:13:52.897 --> 00:13:54.448
(Laughter)

00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:25.738
(Laughter)

00:14:25.858 --> 00:14:29.619
(Applause)

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.826
Whew!

00:14:35.045 --> 00:14:36.272
You're all thinking now,

00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:38.247
these guys are having way too much fun,

00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:40.326
and you're probably also asking yourself,

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.151
why exactly are they building
machine athletes?

00:14:44.286 --> 00:14:47.096
Some conjecture that the role
of play in the animal kingdom

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.257
is to hone skills
and develop capabilities.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.905
Others think that it has
more of a social role,

00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:53.579
that it's used to bind the group.

00:14:53.603 --> 00:14:56.939
Similarly, we use the analogy
of sports and athleticism

00:14:56.963 --> 00:14:59.018
to create new algorithms for machines

00:14:59.042 --> 00:15:00.485
to push them to their limits.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.398
What impact will the speed
of machines have on our way of life?

00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:07.231
Like all our past creations
and innovations,

00:15:07.255 --> 00:15:10.058
they may be used to improve
the human condition

00:15:10.082 --> 00:15:12.056
or they may be misused and abused.

00:15:12.595 --> 00:15:14.897
This is not a technical choice
we are faced with;

00:15:14.921 --> 00:15:15.936
it's a social one.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.683
Let's make the right choice,

00:15:17.707 --> 00:15:20.619
the choice that brings out the best
in the future of machines,

00:15:20.643 --> 00:15:23.508
just like athleticism in sports
can bring out the best in us.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.455
Let me introduce you to the wizards
behind the green curtain.

00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:30.813
They're the current members
of the Flying Machine Arena research team.

00:15:30.837 --> 00:15:35.054
(Applause)

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.545
Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini,

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:40.994
Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin,
Mark Muller and Robin Ritz.

00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:43.542
Look out for them.
They're destined for great things.

00:15:43.566 --> 00:15:44.620
Thank you.

00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:48.100
(Applause)
