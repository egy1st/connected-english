WEBVTT

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.516
This will not be a speech

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:05.807
like any one I have ever given.

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:09.297
I will talk to you today about

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:14.187
the failure of leadership in global politics

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:17.185
and in our globalizing economy.

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:24.138
And I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions.

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:26.672
But I will in the end urge you

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:32.115
to rethink, actually take risks, and get involved

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.520
in what I see as a global evolution

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.330
of democracy.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.585
Failure of leadership.

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:43.346
What is the failure of leadership today?

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:46.813
And why is our democracy not working?

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.444
Well, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact

00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:53.997
that we have taken you out of the process.

00:00:53.997 --> 00:00:56.513
So let me, from my personal experiences,

00:00:56.513 --> 00:01:00.742
give you an insight, so that you can step back

00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:04.414
and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:06.489
with the challenges of today and why politics

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:10.133
is going down a blind alley.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.630
Let's start from the beginning.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.426
Let's start from democracy.

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:18.451
Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks,

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.640
it was a revelation, a discovery,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.157
that we had the potential, together,

00:01:26.157 --> 00:01:29.878
to be masters of our own fate,

00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:32.750
to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.083
and then to design a better life.

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:41.269
And democracy was the political innovation

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:43.771
which protected this freedom,

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:49.086
because we were liberated from fear

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:50.739
so that our minds in fact,

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.461
whether they be despots or dogmas,

00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:57.864
could be the protagonists.

00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:00.853
Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:04.241
to limit the power, whether it was of tyrants

00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:06.988
or of high priests,

00:02:06.988 --> 00:02:11.826
their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth.

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:13.436
Well, I first began to understand this

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:15.558
when I was 14 years old.

00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:17.668
I used to, to try to avoid homework,

00:02:17.668 --> 00:02:22.844
sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:24.544
and their friends debate heatedly.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.922
You see, then Greece was

00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:31.159
under control of a very powerful establishment

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.906
which was strangling the country,

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:35.599
and my father was heading a promising movement

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.419
to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.862
where freedom reigned and where, maybe,

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:44.573
the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country.

00:02:44.573 --> 00:02:46.869
I used to join him in many of the campaigns,

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.808
and you can see me here next to him.

00:02:48.808 --> 00:02:51.276
I'm the younger one there, to the side.

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:54.384
You may not recognize me because

00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:56.612
I used to part my hair differently there.

00:02:56.612 --> 00:02:58.489
(Laughter)

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.636
So in 1967, elections were coming,

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:04.480
things were going well in the campaign,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.491
the house was electric.

00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.779
We really could sense that there was going to be

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.776
a major progressive change in Greece.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:17.728
Then one night, military trucks drive up to our house.

00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:20.106
Soldiers storm the door.

00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:24.276
They find me up on the top terrace.

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:26.231
A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun,

00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.190
puts it to my head, and says,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.542
"Tell me where your father is or I will kill you."

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:36.724
My father, hiding nearby, reveals himself,

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:40.889
and was summarily taken to prison.

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.625
Well, we survived, but democracy did not.

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.137
Seven brutal years of dictatorship

00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:50.929
which we spent in exile.

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:53.153
Now, today, our democracies are again

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:55.432
facing a moment of truth.

00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:57.259
Let me tell you a story.

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.543
Sunday evening,

00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:02.662
Brussels, April 2010.

00:04:02.662 --> 00:04:06.215
I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union.

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:09.698
I had just been elected prime minister,

00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:13.291
but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth

00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.712
that our deficit was not 6 percent,

00:04:16.712 --> 00:04:20.258
as had been officially reported only a few days earlier

00:04:20.258 --> 00:04:23.227
before the elections by the previous government,

00:04:23.227 --> 00:04:28.115
but actually 15.6 percent.

00:04:28.115 --> 00:04:30.547
But the deficit was only the symptom

00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:32.863
of much deeper problems that Greece was facing,

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:36.794
and I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually,

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:38.039
to tackle these problems,

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.773
whether it was lack of transparency

00:04:40.773 --> 00:04:43.074
and accountability in governance,

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.740
or whether it was a clientelistic state

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.293
offering favors to the powerful -- tax avoidance

00:04:50.293 --> 00:04:55.020
abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.452
politics and media captured by special interests.

00:04:58.452 --> 00:05:01.452
But despite our electoral mandate,

00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:04.667
the markets mistrusted us.

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:07.433
Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing,

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:10.340
and we were facing possible default.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.620
So I went to Brussels on a mission

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.634
to make the case for a united European response,

00:05:17.634 --> 00:05:20.934
one that would calm the markets and give us the time

00:05:20.934 --> 00:05:23.940
to make the necessary reforms.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.844
But time we didn't get.

00:05:26.844 --> 00:05:29.980
Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.871
Negotiations are difficult, the tensions are high,

00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:35.748
progress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2,

00:05:35.748 --> 00:05:37.320
a prime minister shouts out,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.840
"We have to finish in 10 minutes."

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.473
I said, "Why? These are important decisions.

00:05:42.473 --> 00:05:44.628
Let's deliberate a little bit longer."

00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:47.711
Another prime minister comes in and says,

00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:51.043
"No, we have to have an agreement now,

00:05:51.043 --> 00:05:53.395
because in 10 minutes,

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.960
the markets are opening up in Japan,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.409
and there will be havoc in the global economy."

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.822
We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes.

00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:07.098
This time it was not the military,

00:06:07.098 --> 00:06:13.586
but the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads.

00:06:13.586 --> 00:06:17.769
What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life,

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:21.996
painful to me, painful to my countrymen,

00:06:21.996 --> 00:06:25.018
imposing cuts, austerity,

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:28.244
often on those not to blame for the crisis.

00:06:28.244 --> 00:06:31.371
With these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy

00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:34.523
and the eurozone avoided a collapse.

00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:37.171
Greece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis,

00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:40.289
and some people blame me for pulling the trigger.

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.336
But I think today that most would agree

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.702
that Greece was only a symptom

00:06:45.702 --> 00:06:49.379
of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone,

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:53.571
vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system,

00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:56.217
vulnerabilities of our democracies.

00:06:56.217 --> 00:07:00.554
Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail,

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:03.923
or, more accurately, too big to control.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.252
Our democracies are weakened in the global economy

00:07:06.252 --> 00:07:09.723
with players that can evade laws, evade taxes,

00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:13.044
evade environmental or labor standards.

00:07:13.044 --> 00:07:15.926
Our democracies are undermined

00:07:15.926 --> 00:07:18.084
by the growing inequality

00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:21.864
and the growing concentration of power and wealth,

00:07:21.864 --> 00:07:25.518
lobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets

00:07:25.518 --> 00:07:30.357
or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster,

00:07:30.357 --> 00:07:33.077
have constrained our democracies,

00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:35.965
and they have constrained our capacity

00:07:35.965 --> 00:07:39.963
to imagine and actually use the potential, your potential,

00:07:39.963 --> 00:07:42.478
in finding solutions.

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:44.933
Greece, you see, was only a preview

00:07:44.933 --> 00:07:47.310
of what is in store for us all.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.000
I, overly optimistically, had hoped

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.791
that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe,

00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:57.266
for the world, to make radical democratic transformations

00:07:57.266 --> 00:07:59.143
in our institutions.

00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:03.040
Instead, I had a very humbling experience.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.521
In Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.430
to find common solutions,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.103
I realized that not one, not one of us,

00:08:13.103 --> 00:08:16.574
had ever dealt with a similar crisis.

00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:20.570
But worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.038
We were led by our fears.

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:28.591
And our fears led to a blind faith

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.756
in the orthodoxy of austerity.

00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:35.559
Instead of reaching out to the common

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.939
or the collective wisdom in our societies,

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:42.251
investing in it to find more creative solutions,

00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:44.811
we reverted to political posturing.

00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:46.417
And then we were surprised when every

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:49.715
ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis,

00:08:49.715 --> 00:08:52.644
and of course that made it very easy

00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:54.491
to look for a whipping boy

00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.289
for our collective European failure,

00:08:56.289 --> 00:08:59.643
and of course that was Greece.

00:08:59.643 --> 00:09:04.815
Those profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks,

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:07.880
they are the problem. Punish them!

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.090
Well, a convenient but unfounded stereotype

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.823
that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself.

00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:19.135
But let me warn you, this is not just about Greece.

00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:22.087
This could be the pattern

00:09:22.087 --> 00:09:24.593
that leaders follow again and again

00:09:24.593 --> 00:09:28.255
when we deal with these complex, cross-border problems,

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:31.975
whether it's climate change, whether it's migration,

00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:35.039
whether it's the financial system.

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:37.625
That is, abandoning our collective power

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.504
to imagine our potential,

00:09:39.504 --> 00:09:43.683
falling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas,

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.943
taking our citizens out of the process

00:09:45.943 --> 00:09:50.115
rather than building the process around our citizens.

00:09:50.115 --> 00:09:52.587
And doing so will only test the faith

00:09:52.587 --> 00:09:54.995
of our citizens, of our peoples, even more

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:57.557
in the democratic process.

00:09:57.557 --> 00:09:59.255
It's no wonder that many political leaders,

00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:01.773
and I don't exclude myself,

00:10:01.773 --> 00:10:04.851
have lost the trust of our people.

00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:08.414
When riot police have to protect parliaments,

00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:12.611
a scene which is increasingly common around the world,

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:17.361
then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies.

00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:21.266
That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people

00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:25.502
own and decide on the terms of the rescue package.

00:10:25.502 --> 00:10:27.405
My European counterparts, some of them, at least,

00:10:27.405 --> 00:10:29.390
said, "You can't do this.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.938
There will be havoc in the markets again."

00:10:33.938 --> 00:10:38.194
I said, "We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets,

00:10:38.194 --> 00:10:43.782
we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people."

00:10:43.782 --> 00:10:46.550
Since leaving office, I have had time to reflect.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.670
We have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe,

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.243
but we remain challenged.

00:10:54.243 --> 00:10:57.702
If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential,

00:10:57.702 --> 00:11:01.846
well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece,

00:11:01.846 --> 00:11:04.816
and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination

00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:07.282
if not a lack of compassion.

00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:09.823
So far, we've thrown economics at the problem,

00:11:09.823 --> 00:11:12.134
actually mostly austerity,

00:11:12.134 --> 00:11:15.364
and certainly we could have designed alternatives,

00:11:15.364 --> 00:11:18.686
a different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs,

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:22.138
or mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would

00:11:22.138 --> 00:11:25.262
support countries in need from market pressures,

00:11:25.262 --> 00:11:28.134
these would have been much more viable alternatives.

00:11:28.134 --> 00:11:30.800
Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.759
one of economics as it is one of democracy.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:36.347
So let's try something else.

00:11:36.347 --> 00:11:39.243
Let's see how we can bring people back to the process.

00:11:39.243 --> 00:11:42.346
Let's throw democracy at the problem.

00:11:42.346 --> 00:11:45.331
Again, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings,

00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:48.375
believed in the wisdom of the crowd

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:51.266
at their best moments. In people we trust.

00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:54.609
Democracy could not work without the citizens

00:11:54.609 --> 00:11:58.982
deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities

00:11:58.982 --> 00:12:00.916
for public affairs.

00:12:00.916 --> 00:12:03.650
Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.877
to decide on critical matters of the day.

00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:10.954
Science, theater, research, philosophy,

00:12:10.954 --> 00:12:13.037
games of the mind and the body,

00:12:13.037 --> 00:12:14.765
they were daily exercises.

00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:18.917
Actually they were an education for participation,

00:12:18.917 --> 00:12:22.457
for the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens.

00:12:22.457 --> 00:12:26.993
And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots.

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:30.237
You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens,

00:12:30.237 --> 00:12:32.508
that term originated there.

00:12:32.508 --> 00:12:37.301
"Idiot" comes from the root "idio," oneself.

00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:40.544
A person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded,

00:12:40.544 --> 00:12:45.259
someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs.

00:12:45.259 --> 00:12:48.991
And participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings,

00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:55.368
both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation.

00:12:55.368 --> 00:12:59.424
You see, markets and politics then were one, unified,

00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:02.630
accessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.593
They serve the demos, democracy.

00:13:07.593 --> 00:13:10.217
Above government, above markets

00:13:10.217 --> 00:13:12.746
was the direct rule of the people.

00:13:12.746 --> 00:13:15.730
Today we have globalized the markets

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:20.193
but we have not globalized our democratic institutions.

00:13:20.193 --> 00:13:24.626
So our politicians are limited to local politics,

00:13:24.626 --> 00:13:28.386
while our citizens, even though they see a great potential,

00:13:28.386 --> 00:13:32.866
are prey to forces beyond their control.

00:13:32.866 --> 00:13:35.697
So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora?

00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:37.937
How do we democratize globalization?

00:13:37.937 --> 00:13:40.506
And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms

00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:43.160
of the United Nations or the G20.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.641
I'm talking about, how do we secure the space,

00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:48.142
the demos, the platform of values,

00:13:48.142 --> 00:13:53.702
so that we can tap into all of your potential?

00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:57.577
Well, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in.

00:13:57.577 --> 00:13:59.977
Europe, despite its recent failures,

00:13:59.977 --> 00:14:04.545
is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment.

00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:07.792
So let's see if it can't be an experiment

00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:11.972
in global democracy, a new kind of democracy.

00:14:11.972 --> 00:14:15.082
Let's see if we can't design a European agora,

00:14:15.082 --> 00:14:17.614
not simply for products and services,

00:14:17.614 --> 00:14:20.857
but for our citizens, where they can work together,

00:14:20.857 --> 00:14:22.620
deliberate, learn from each other,

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.836
exchange between art and cultures,

00:14:25.836 --> 00:14:29.535
where they can come up with creative solutions.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.705
Let's imagine that European citizens

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.999
actually have the power to vote directly

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.999
for a European president,

00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:41.483
or citizen juries chosen by lottery

00:14:41.483 --> 00:14:45.709
which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues,

00:14:45.709 --> 00:14:48.877
a European-wide referendum where our citizens,

00:14:48.877 --> 00:14:53.279
as the lawmakers, vote on future treaties.

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:55.759
And here's an idea:

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:58.683
Why not have the first truly European citizens

00:14:58.683 --> 00:15:00.703
by giving our immigrants,

00:15:00.703 --> 00:15:04.815
not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship,

00:15:04.815 --> 00:15:08.438
but a European citizenship?

00:15:08.438 --> 00:15:11.325
And make sure we actually empower

00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:14.104
the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship

00:15:14.104 --> 00:15:17.573
where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe.

00:15:17.573 --> 00:15:22.054
Where our common identity is democracy,

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:27.018
where our education is through participation,

00:15:27.018 --> 00:15:30.491
and where participation builds trust

00:15:30.491 --> 00:15:34.462
and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia.

00:15:34.462 --> 00:15:36.124
Europe of and by the people,

00:15:36.124 --> 00:15:40.222
a Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening

00:15:40.222 --> 00:15:43.238
democracy beyond borders.

00:15:43.238 --> 00:15:47.076
Now, some might accuse me of being naive,

00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:51.947
putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people.

00:15:51.947 --> 00:15:56.716
Well, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist.

00:15:56.716 --> 00:15:59.272
Believe me, I have been,

00:15:59.272 --> 00:16:02.932
I am, part of today's political system,

00:16:02.932 --> 00:16:07.569
and I know things must change.

00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:11.857
We must revive politics as the power to imagine,

00:16:11.857 --> 00:16:17.080
reimagine, and redesign for a better world.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.894
But I also know that this disruptive force of change

00:16:19.894 --> 00:16:22.958
won't be driven by the politics of today.

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.254
The revival of democratic politics

00:16:25.254 --> 00:16:29.674
will come from you, and I mean all of you.

00:16:29.674 --> 00:16:33.660
Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas,

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.709
whether it's here in this room

00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:36.922
or just outside this room

00:16:36.922 --> 00:16:40.756
or online or locally, where everybody lives,

00:16:40.756 --> 00:16:44.076
everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality,

00:16:44.076 --> 00:16:46.796
everybody who stands up to those who preach

00:16:46.796 --> 00:16:49.060
racism rather than empathy,

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.876
dogma rather than critical thinking,

00:16:51.876 --> 00:16:54.192
technocracy rather than democracy,

00:16:54.192 --> 00:16:57.167
everyone who stands up to the unchecked power,

00:16:57.167 --> 00:16:59.288
whether it's authoritarian leaders,

00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:02.724
plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens,

00:17:02.724 --> 00:17:06.644
or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few.

00:17:06.644 --> 00:17:12.077
It is in their interest that all of us are idiots.

00:17:12.077 --> 00:17:13.563
Let's not be.

00:17:13.563 --> 00:17:14.803
Thank you.

00:17:14.803 --> 00:17:26.713
(Applause)

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.626
Bruno Giussani: You seem to describe a political leadership

00:17:28.626 --> 00:17:30.811
that is kind of unprepared

00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:33.593
and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets,

00:17:33.593 --> 00:17:35.953
and that scene in Brussels that you describe, to me,

00:17:35.953 --> 00:17:38.456
as a citizen, is terrifying.

00:17:38.456 --> 00:17:42.755
Help us understand how you felt after the decision.

00:17:42.755 --> 00:17:44.323
It was not a good decision, clearly,

00:17:44.323 --> 00:17:46.907
but how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister,

00:17:46.907 --> 00:17:49.096
but as George?

00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:51.638
George Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:55.564
which didn't allow me or others to make

00:17:55.564 --> 00:17:57.004
the types of decisions we would have wanted,

00:17:57.004 --> 00:17:59.769
and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time

00:17:59.769 --> 00:18:01.476
to make the reforms which would have dealt

00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:03.969
with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit

00:18:03.969 --> 00:18:05.684
which was the symptom of the problem.

00:18:05.684 --> 00:18:07.883
And that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all,

00:18:07.883 --> 00:18:11.387
hurt the younger generation, and not only,

00:18:11.387 --> 00:18:13.324
many of them are demonstrating outside,

00:18:13.324 --> 00:18:14.948
but I think this is one of our problems.

00:18:14.948 --> 00:18:20.180
When we face these crises, we have kept the potential,

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.315
the huge potential of our society out of this process,

00:18:23.315 --> 00:18:26.139
and we are closing in on ourselves in politics,

00:18:26.139 --> 00:18:28.885
and I think we need to change that, to really find

00:18:28.885 --> 00:18:33.058
new participatory ways using the great capabilities

00:18:33.058 --> 00:18:36.208
that now exist even in technology but not only in technology,

00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:39.349
the minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions

00:18:39.349 --> 00:18:41.156
which are much better, but we have to be open.

00:18:41.156 --> 00:18:42.816
BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward

00:18:42.816 --> 00:18:46.427
is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse

00:18:46.427 --> 00:18:48.150
right now in most European countries.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.877
It's rather the other way -- more closed borders

00:18:51.877 --> 00:18:54.307
and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out

00:18:54.307 --> 00:18:58.012
of some of the different parts of the European construction.

00:18:58.012 --> 00:18:59.951
How do you reconcile that?

00:18:59.951 --> 00:19:02.380
GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.612
during this crisis is that we started a blame game.

00:19:04.612 --> 00:19:08.170
And the fundamental idea of Europe is that

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.276
we can cooperate beyond borders,

00:19:10.276 --> 00:19:12.577
go beyond our conflicts and work together.

00:19:12.577 --> 00:19:18.546
And the paradox is that, because we have this blame game,

00:19:18.546 --> 00:19:21.726
we have less the potential to convince our citizens

00:19:21.726 --> 00:19:23.437
that we should work together,

00:19:23.437 --> 00:19:25.510
while now is the time when we really need

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.278
to bring our powers together.

00:19:27.278 --> 00:19:30.232
Now, more Europe for me is not simply

00:19:30.232 --> 00:19:31.687
giving more power to Brussels.

00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:35.560
It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.408
that is, really making Europe a project of the people.

00:19:39.408 --> 00:19:41.976
So that, I think, would be a way to answer

00:19:41.976 --> 00:19:44.849
some of the fears that we have in our society.

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:46.372
BG: George, thank you for coming to TED.

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:49.558
GP: Thank you very much.BG: Thank you.(Applause)
