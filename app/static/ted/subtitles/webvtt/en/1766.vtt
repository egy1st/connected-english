00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:03.849
I write fiction sci-fi thrillers,

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:06.042
so if I say "killer robots,"

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:08.403
you'd probably think something like this.

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:10.958
But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:13.906
I'm here to talk about very real killer robots,

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:17.028
autonomous combat drones.

00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:20.655
Now, I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones,

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.915
which have a human making targeting decisions.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:27.044
I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons

00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:29.698
that make lethal decisions about human beings

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:32.115
all on their own.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:36.115
There's actually a technical term for this: lethal autonomy.

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:38.971
Now, lethally autonomous killer robots

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:42.040
would take many forms -- flying, driving,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.786
or just lying in wait.

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:47.895
And actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:50.379
These are two automatic sniper stations

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.516
currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea.

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:56.687
Both of these machines are capable of automatically

00:00:56.687 --> 00:01:00.211
identifying a human target and firing on it,

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:04.535
the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:08.124
Now, in both cases, there's still a human in the loop

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.496
to make that lethal firing decision,

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:15.909
but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.002
And it's that choice that I want to focus on,

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.643
because as we migrate lethal decision-making

00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:24.752
from humans to software,

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:28.228
we risk not only taking the humanity out of war,

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:31.754
but also changing our social landscape entirely,

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:33.978
far from the battlefield.

00:01:33.978 --> 00:01:38.487
That's because the way humans resolve conflict

00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:40.220
shapes our social landscape.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.853
And this has always been the case, throughout history.

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.514
For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems

00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:47.593
in 1400 A.D.

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:50.737
Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain,

00:01:50.737 --> 00:01:53.977
but with these you could dominate the populace,

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:57.866
and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.553
Power was focused at the very top.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.081
And what changed? Technological innovation.

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.952
Gunpowder, cannon.

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:09.769
And pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete,

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.302
and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield

00:02:12.302 --> 00:02:16.081
versus how many people you brought to the battlefield.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:19.719
And as armies grew in size, the nation-state arose

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.399
as a political and logistical requirement of defense.

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.775
And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace,

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:27.608
they began to share power.

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:30.207
Representative government began to form.

00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:33.495
So again, the tools we use to resolve conflict

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:36.799
shape our social landscape.

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.863
Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool,

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:46.031
except that, by requiring very few people to go to war,

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:50.871
they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands,

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:57.386
possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.143
Now, I think, knowing this,

00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:03.495
we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions,

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:07.474
to do what humans do best, which is adapt.

00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:09.479
But time is a factor.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.330
Seventy nations are developing remotely-piloted

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.487
combat drones of their own,

00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:17.080
and as you'll see, remotely-piloted combat drones

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.552
are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.

00:03:21.552 --> 00:03:24.319
That's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones,

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.703
there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making

00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:32.303
away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself.

00:03:32.303 --> 00:03:37.562
The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce.

00:03:37.562 --> 00:03:41.415
For example, in 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produced

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:46.727
a grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:51.226
By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours,

00:03:51.226 --> 00:03:54.375
outstripping human ability to review it all,

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:58.039
but even that number is about to go up drastically.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.614
The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs

00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:03.778
will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes

00:04:03.778 --> 00:04:05.816
on each drone platform,

00:04:05.816 --> 00:04:09.119
and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it.

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.279
And that means visual intelligence software will need

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.327
to scan it for items of interest.

00:04:15.327 --> 00:04:16.675
And that means very soon

00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:19.422
drones will tell humans what to look at,

00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:21.919
not the other way around.

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.392
But there's a second powerful incentive pushing

00:04:24.392 --> 00:04:27.775
decision-making away from humans and onto machines,

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:30.647
and that's electromagnetic jamming,

00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.883
severing the connection between the drone

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:35.697
and its operator.

00:04:35.697 --> 00:04:38.315
Now we saw an example of this in 2011

00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:41.271
when an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:45.578
got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack,

00:04:45.578 --> 00:04:50.692
but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack,

00:04:50.692 --> 00:04:52.744
and that means drones

00:04:52.744 --> 00:04:56.364
will have to shoulder more decision-making.

00:04:56.364 --> 00:04:59.407
They'll know their mission objective,

00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:04.252
and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.

00:05:04.252 --> 00:05:06.833
They'll ignore external radio signals

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:09.163
and send very few of their own.

00:05:09.163 --> 00:05:11.169
Which brings us to, really, the third

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.031
and most powerful incentive pushing decision-making

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:18.373
away from humans and onto weapons:

00:05:18.373 --> 00:05:21.666
plausible deniability.

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:24.553
Now we live in a global economy.

00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:28.887
High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents.

00:05:28.887 --> 00:05:31.801
Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs

00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:33.687
to parts unknown,

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:35.701
and in that environment, it is very likely

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:40.435
that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories,

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:42.605
proliferate in the gray market.

00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:45.065
And in that situation, sifting through the wreckage

00:05:45.065 --> 00:05:48.025
of a suicide drone attack, it will be very difficult to say

00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:52.425
who sent that weapon.

00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:55.225
This raises the very real possibility

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:58.160
of anonymous war.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.774
This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head,

00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:04.265
make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:07.113
against an attacker, and that could shift the balance

00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:10.877
in the 21st century away from defense and toward offense.

00:06:10.877 --> 00:06:14.001
It could make military action a viable option

00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.289
not just for small nations,

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.834
but criminal organizations, private enterprise,

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:21.313
even powerful individuals.

00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:24.641
It could create a landscape of rival warlords

00:06:24.641 --> 00:06:28.321
undermining rule of law and civil society.

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.937
Now if responsibility and transparency

00:06:31.937 --> 00:06:34.321
are two of the cornerstones of representative government,

00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:38.641
autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both.

00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.187
Now you might be thinking that

00:06:40.187 --> 00:06:42.433
citizens of high-tech nations

00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:45.136
would have the advantage in any robotic war,

00:06:45.136 --> 00:06:48.769
that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable,

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:53.057
particularly against developing nations.

00:06:53.057 --> 00:06:56.581
But I think the truth is the exact opposite.

00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:58.832
I think citizens of high-tech societies

00:06:58.832 --> 00:07:02.561
are more vulnerable to robotic weapons,

00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:07.026
and the reason can be summed up in one word: data.

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:10.507
Data powers high-tech societies.

00:07:10.507 --> 00:07:13.697
Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata,

00:07:13.697 --> 00:07:17.169
social media, email, text, financial transaction data,

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.701
transportation data, it's a wealth of real-time data

00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:24.074
on the movements and social interactions of people.

00:07:24.074 --> 00:07:27.849
In short, we are more visible to machines

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:30.091
than any people in history,

00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:35.707
and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons.

00:07:35.707 --> 00:07:37.445
What you're looking at here

00:07:37.445 --> 00:07:40.691
is a link analysis map of a social group.

00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:44.325
Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals.

00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:47.205
And these types of maps can be automatically generated

00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:51.920
based on the data trail modern people leave behind.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.397
Now it's typically used to market goods and services

00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:58.813
to targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology,

00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:02.173
because targeting is used in another context.

00:08:02.173 --> 00:08:04.733
Notice that certain individuals are highlighted.

00:08:04.733 --> 00:08:08.013
These are the hubs of social networks.

00:08:08.013 --> 00:08:11.603
These are organizers, opinion-makers, leaders,

00:08:11.603 --> 00:08:14.285
and these people also can be automatically identified

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.667
from their communication patterns.

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:18.813
Now, if you're a marketer, you might then target them

00:08:18.813 --> 00:08:21.356
with product samples, try to spread your brand

00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:24.185
through their social group.

00:08:24.185 --> 00:08:26.138
But if you're a repressive government

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:30.948
searching for political enemies, you might instead remove them,

00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:33.708
eliminate them, disrupt their social group,

00:08:33.708 --> 00:08:36.877
and those who remain behind lose social cohesion

00:08:36.877 --> 00:08:39.498
and organization.

00:08:39.498 --> 00:08:42.822
Now in a world of cheap, proliferating robotic weapons,

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:45.457
borders would offer very little protection

00:08:45.457 --> 00:08:47.403
to critics of distant governments

00:08:47.403 --> 00:08:51.049
or trans-national criminal organizations.

00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:54.542
Popular movements agitating for change

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:58.151
could be detected early and their leaders eliminated

00:08:58.151 --> 00:09:01.062
before their ideas achieve critical mass.

00:09:01.062 --> 00:09:03.653
And ideas achieving critical mass

00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:07.589
is what political activism in popular government is all about.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:11.586
Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action

00:09:11.586 --> 00:09:15.368
an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests.

00:09:15.368 --> 00:09:19.102
And this would put a chill on free speech

00:09:19.102 --> 00:09:24.410
and popular political action, the very heart of democracy.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.324
And this is why we need an international treaty

00:09:27.324 --> 00:09:30.864
on robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban

00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:34.772
on the development and deployment of killer robots.

00:09:34.772 --> 00:09:38.026
Now we already have international treaties

00:09:38.026 --> 00:09:41.412
on nuclear and biological weapons, and, while imperfect,

00:09:41.412 --> 00:09:43.700
these have largely worked.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.468
But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous,

00:09:47.468 --> 00:09:50.756
because they will almost certainly be used,

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:55.783
and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions.

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:59.251
Now in November 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense

00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:01.709
issued a directive requiring

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:06.228
a human being be present in all lethal decisions.

00:10:06.228 --> 00:10:11.004
This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military,

00:10:11.004 --> 00:10:14.757
but that directive needs to be made permanent.

00:10:14.757 --> 00:10:19.133
And it could set the stage for global action.

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:22.978
Because we need an international legal framework

00:10:22.978 --> 00:10:25.116
for robotic weapons.

00:10:25.116 --> 00:10:28.044
And we need it now, before there's a devastating attack

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:31.196
or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:33.120
to rush to adopt these weapons

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.891
before thinking through the consequences.

00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:39.872
Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:46.155
in too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself.

00:10:46.155 --> 00:10:48.841
Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons

00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:51.459
of great uses for unarmed civilian drones:

00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:55.398
environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics.

00:10:55.398 --> 00:10:58.224
If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons,

00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:01.811
how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones

00:11:01.811 --> 00:11:04.459
and vehicles while still protecting ourselves

00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:08.439
against illegal robotic weapons?

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:13.180
I think the secret will be transparency.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.193
No robot should have an expectation of privacy

00:11:16.193 --> 00:11:19.644
in a public place.

00:11:19.644 --> 00:11:24.692
(Applause)

00:11:24.692 --> 00:11:26.737
Each robot and drone should have

00:11:26.737 --> 00:11:29.620
a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.543
that can be used to track its movement through public spaces.

00:11:32.543 --> 00:11:35.924
We have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft.

00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:37.765
This is no different.

00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:39.777
And every citizen should be able to download an app

00:11:39.777 --> 00:11:42.902
that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:45.331
moving through public spaces around them,

00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:48.064
both right now and historically.

00:11:48.064 --> 00:11:51.612
And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:53.956
to detect rogue drones,

00:11:53.956 --> 00:11:57.132
and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down,

00:11:57.132 --> 00:12:00.124
they should notify humans to their presence.

00:12:00.124 --> 00:12:02.730
And in certain very high-security areas,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.639
perhaps civic drones would snare them

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:07.480
and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.507
But notice, this is more an immune system

00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:11.828
than a weapons system.

00:12:11.828 --> 00:12:14.420
It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.452
of autonomous vehicles and drones

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:20.747
while still preserving our open, civil society.

00:12:20.747 --> 00:12:23.746
We must ban the deployment and development

00:12:23.746 --> 00:12:25.608
of killer robots.

00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:30.458
Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:33.176
Autocratic governments and criminal organizations

00:12:33.176 --> 00:12:36.132
undoubtedly will, but let's not join them.

00:12:36.132 --> 00:12:38.023
Autonomous robotic weapons

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:40.074
would concentrate too much power

00:12:40.074 --> 00:12:42.556
in too few unseen hands,

00:12:42.556 --> 00:12:45.811
and that would be corrosive to representative government.

00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:48.772
Let's make sure, for democracies at least,

00:12:48.772 --> 00:12:51.376
killer robots remain fiction.

00:12:51.376 --> 00:12:52.486
Thank you.

00:12:52.486 --> 00:12:57.051
(Applause)

00:12:57.051 --> 00:13:01.667
Thank you. (Applause)
