00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:05.795
Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:08.057
You know that all over the world,

00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:10.852
people fight for their freedom,

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:13.058
fight for their rights.

00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:16.219
Some battle oppressive governments.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.955
Others battle oppressive societies.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:24.811
Which battle do you think is harder?

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:27.283
Allow me to try to answer this question

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:30.363
in the few coming minutes.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:36.179
Let me take you back two years ago in my life.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.135
It was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:41.819
He was five at the time.

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:44.259
After finishing his bedtime rituals,

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:48.341
he looked at me and he asked a question:

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:51.572
"Mommy, are we bad people?"

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:54.032
I was shocked.

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:57.189
"Why do you say such things, Aboody?"

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:59.524
Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.107
on his face when he came from school.

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:04.073
He wouldn't tell me what happened.

00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:08.136
[But now] he was ready to tell.

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:10.947
"Two boys hit me today in school.

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:14.316
They told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:19.102
You and your mom should be put in jail.'"

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:22.243
I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:26.947
I've been always a proud woman of my achievements.

00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:29.162
But those questioning eyes of my son

00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:31.987
were my moment of truth,

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:35.740
when it all came together.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.158
You see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:42.293
for driving a car in a country

00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:47.248
where women are not supposed to drive cars.

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:49.639
Just for giving me his car keys,

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:53.495
my own brother was detained twice,

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:55.108
and he was harassed to the point he had

00:01:55.108 --> 00:01:57.096
to quit his job as a geologist,

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:00.430
leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.528
My father had to sit in a Friday sermon

00:02:02.528 --> 00:02:06.200
listening to the imam condemning women drivers

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.168
and calling them prostitutes

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:10.504
amongst tons of worshippers,

00:02:10.504 --> 00:02:14.816
some of them our friends and family of my own father.

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:18.400
I was faced with an organized defamation campaign

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.382
in the local media combined with false rumors

00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:24.240
shared in family gatherings, in the streets

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.984
and in schools.

00:02:26.984 --> 00:02:29.328
It all hit me.

00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:31.522
It came into focus that those kids

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:33.816
did not mean to be rude to my son.

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:37.886
They were just influenced by the adults around them.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.355
And it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:45.169
for taking the wheel and driving a few miles.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.018
It was a punishment for daring to challenge

00:02:48.018 --> 00:02:51.715
the society's rules.

00:02:51.715 --> 00:02:56.252
But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:00.048
Allow me to give you a briefing

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:02.240
about my story.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.276
It was May, 2011,

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:06.235
and I was complaining to a work colleague

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:08.069
about the harassments I had to face

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.857
trying to find a ride back home,

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:13.341
although I have a car and an international driver's license.

00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:15.466
As long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:17.952
have been always complaining about the ban,

00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:20.368
but it's been 20 years since anyone

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:22.400
tried to do anything about it,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.600
a whole generation ago.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.736
He broke the good/bad news in my face.

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:29.893
"But there is no law banning you from driving."

00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:32.097
I looked it up, and he was right.

00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:34.776
There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.916
It was just a custom and traditions

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:40.932
that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas

00:03:40.932 --> 00:03:42.936
and imposed on women.

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:46.024
That realization ignited the idea of June 17,

00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:48.465
where we encouraged women to take the wheel

00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:51.193
and go drive.

00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:55.048
It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these

00:03:55.048 --> 00:03:58.254
"Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."

00:03:58.254 --> 00:04:00.920
A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.520
she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.134
she drove a car and she announced

00:04:05.134 --> 00:04:06.863
but she didn't record a video.

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:08.723
We needed proof.

00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:11.584
So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.495
And to my surprise,

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:16.384
it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.

00:04:16.384 --> 00:04:18.090
What happened next, of course?

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.984
I started receiving threats

00:04:19.984 --> 00:04:24.546
to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.

00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:28.158
The Saudi authorities remained very quiet.

00:04:28.158 --> 00:04:30.338
That really creeped us out.

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:32.465
I was in the campaign with other Saudi women

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:34.418
and even men activists.

00:04:34.418 --> 00:04:36.882
We wanted to know how the authorities

00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:40.490
would respond on the actual day, June 17,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.219
when women go out and drive.

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.277
So this time I asked my brother

00:04:44.277 --> 00:04:46.368
to come with me and drive by a police car.

00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:49.122
It went fast. We were arrested,

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.806
signed a pledge not to drive again, released.

00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:56.018
Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day,

00:04:56.018 --> 00:04:58.281
and I was sent to jail.

00:04:58.281 --> 00:04:59.906
I wasn't sure why I was sent there,

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:03.083
because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:05.370
But what I was sure of was my innocence.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.835
I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya

00:05:07.835 --> 00:05:11.711
â€” it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house â€”

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.693
and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off,

00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:17.366
but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying,

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.591
"No, I'm leaving today."

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:23.047
Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy,

00:05:23.047 --> 00:05:25.351
some attacking me badly,

00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:29.076
and others supportive and even collecting signatures

00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:33.319
in a petition to be sent to the king to release me.

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.103
I was released after nine days.

00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:37.789
June 17 comes.

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.479
The streets were packed with police cars

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.640
and religious police cars,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.943
but some hundred brave Saudi women

00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:46.975
broke the ban and drove that day.

00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:50.063
None were arrested. We broke the taboo.

00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:55.406
(Applause)

00:06:00.407 --> 00:06:03.799
So I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive,

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:05.984
or women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia,

00:06:05.984 --> 00:06:08.282
but maybe few know why.

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:10.866
Allow me to help you answer this question.

00:06:10.866 --> 00:06:14.002
There was this official study

00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:16.046
that was presented to the Shura Council --

00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:18.310
it's the consultative council appointed

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.293
by the king in Saudi Arabia â€”

00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:22.334
and it was done by a local professor,

00:06:22.334 --> 00:06:23.652
a university professor.

00:06:23.652 --> 00:06:28.015
He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.

00:06:28.015 --> 00:06:31.007
And the study states,

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:34.799
the percentage of rape, adultery,

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:38.239
illegitimate children, even drug abuse,

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:41.327
prostitution in countries where women drive

00:06:41.327 --> 00:06:44.849
is higher than countries where women don't drive.

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:46.186
(Laughter)

00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:47.689
I know, I was like this, I was shocked.

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:50.809
I was like, "We are the last country in the world

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:52.762
where women don't drive."

00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:54.928
So if you look at the map of the world,

00:06:54.928 --> 00:06:56.621
that only leaves two countries:

00:06:56.621 --> 00:07:01.007
Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world.

00:07:01.007 --> 00:07:04.095
We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study,

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:06.563
and it made headlines around the world.

00:07:06.563 --> 00:07:08.327
[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns]

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:09.592
(Laughter)

00:07:09.592 --> 00:07:12.263
And only then we realized it's so empowering

00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:13.727
to mock your oppressor.

00:07:13.727 --> 00:07:18.226
It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.

00:07:18.226 --> 00:07:21.830
This system is based on ultra-conservative

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.737
traditions and customs

00:07:23.737 --> 00:07:26.984
that deal with women as if they are inferior

00:07:26.984 --> 00:07:29.481
and they need a guardian to protect them,

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:31.685
so they need to take permission from this guardian,

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:33.851
whether verbal or written, all their lives.

00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:36.307
We are minors until the day we die.

00:07:36.307 --> 00:07:40.213
And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas

00:07:40.213 --> 00:07:42.915
based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law,

00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:45.105
or the religious laws.

00:07:45.105 --> 00:07:47.230
What's worst, when they become codified

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.681
as laws in the system,

00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:53.077
and when women themselves believe in their inferiority,

00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:55.567
and they even fight those who try

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:59.137
to question these rules.

00:07:59.137 --> 00:08:03.403
So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.

00:08:03.403 --> 00:08:06.217
It was about living two totally different

00:08:06.217 --> 00:08:09.177
perceptions of my personality, of my person --

00:08:09.177 --> 00:08:11.889
the villain back in my home country,

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:13.912
and the hero outside.

00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:17.987
Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.

00:08:17.987 --> 00:08:20.365
One of them is when I was in jail.

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:22.023
I'm pretty sure when I was in jail,

00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:26.474
everyone saw titles in the international media

00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:30.519
something like this during these nine days I was in jail.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:33.996
But in my home country, it was a totally different picture.

00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:35.665
It was more like this:

00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:38.697
"Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order

00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:42.439
and inciting women to drive."

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.473
I know.

00:08:45.473 --> 00:08:47.522
"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."

00:08:47.522 --> 00:08:50.089
Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite.

00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:52.486
"Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses:

00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:54.298
'Foreign forces incited me.'"

00:08:54.298 --> 00:08:56.657
(Laughter)

00:08:56.657 --> 00:09:01.854
And it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.

00:09:01.854 --> 00:09:05.282
So it's a totally different picture.

00:09:05.282 --> 00:09:07.054
I was asked last year to give a speech

00:09:07.054 --> 00:09:09.666
at the Oslo Freedom Forum.

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:12.251
I was surrounded by this love

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:14.386
and the support of people around me,

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:16.571
and they looked at me as an inspiration.

00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:19.433
At the same time, I flew back to my home country,

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:21.358
they hated that speech so much.

00:09:21.358 --> 00:09:23.897
The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.489
and the Saudi people,

00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:28.850
and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.119
Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag,

00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:34.937
while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero,

00:09:34.937 --> 00:09:36.721
there was like a handful of tweets written.

00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:38.661
They even started a poll.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.944
More than 13,000 voters answered this poll:

00:09:41.944 --> 00:09:44.970
whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.996
Ninety percent said yes, she's a traitor.

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:51.886
So it's these two totally different perceptions

00:09:51.886 --> 00:09:53.493
of my personality.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.517
For me, I'm a proud Saudi woman,

00:09:55.517 --> 00:09:57.116
and I do love my country,

00:09:57.116 --> 00:10:00.045
and because I love my country, I'm doing this.

00:10:00.045 --> 00:10:02.910
Because I believe a society will not be free

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.453
if the women of that society are not free.

00:10:05.453 --> 00:10:15.382
(Applause)

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:17.734
Thank you.

00:10:17.734 --> 00:10:20.550
(Applause)

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.174
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:35.938
(Applause)

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:39.615
Thank you.

00:10:39.615 --> 00:10:43.836
But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.

00:10:43.836 --> 00:10:46.054
I learned to be always there.

00:10:46.054 --> 00:10:48.292
The first thing, I got out of jail,

00:10:48.292 --> 00:10:51.612
of course after I took a shower, I went online,

00:10:51.612 --> 00:10:54.831
I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page,

00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:57.119
and I've been always very respectful

00:10:57.119 --> 00:10:58.626
to those people who are opining to me.

00:10:58.626 --> 00:11:00.226
I would listen to what they say,

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:03.159
and I would never defend myself with words only.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.567
I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign,

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:08.725
I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate

00:11:08.725 --> 00:11:12.967
of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license.

00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:14.942
There are a lot of people also --

00:11:14.942 --> 00:11:17.247
very big support, like those 3,000 people

00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:19.611
who signed the petition to release me.

00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:22.815
We sent a petition to the Shura Council

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:26.047
in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women,

00:11:26.047 --> 00:11:29.256
and there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.889
and they signed that petition.

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:33.760
There were people like that, I just showed some examples,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.872
who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia,

00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:39.600
and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.408
because of speaking up and voicing their views.

00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:45.785
Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps

00:11:45.785 --> 00:11:47.994
toward enhancing women's rights.

00:11:47.994 --> 00:11:50.192
The Shura Council that's appointed by the king,

00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:52.546
by royal decree of King Abdullah,

00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:56.154
last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council,

00:11:56.154 --> 00:11:58.682
like 20 percent.

00:11:58.682 --> 00:12:01.410
20 percent of the Council. (Applause)

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.570
The same time, finally, that Council,

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.562
after rejecting our petition four times for women driving,

00:12:06.562 --> 00:12:09.137
they finally accepted it last February.

00:12:09.137 --> 00:12:14.127
(Applause)

00:12:14.127 --> 00:12:15.964
After being sent to jail

00:12:15.964 --> 00:12:18.817
or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial,

00:12:18.817 --> 00:12:20.906
the spokesperson of the traffic police said,

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:25.217
we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.

00:12:25.217 --> 00:12:26.655
The Grand Mufti, who is the head

00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:29.431
of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia,

00:12:29.431 --> 00:12:33.543
he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.

00:12:33.543 --> 00:12:38.073
It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti.

00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:43.622
So for me, it's not about only these small steps.

00:12:43.622 --> 00:12:45.187
It's about women themselves.

00:12:45.187 --> 00:12:46.839
A friend once asked me, she said,

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:49.590
"So when do you think this women driving will happen?"

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.339
I told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?'

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:55.113
and take action to make it now."

00:12:55.113 --> 00:12:56.767
So it's not only about the system,

00:12:56.767 --> 00:13:03.210
it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:09.362
So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.

00:13:09.362 --> 00:13:13.329
And I don't know how I became one now.

00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:16.977
But all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future

00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:19.745
when someone asks me my story,

00:13:19.745 --> 00:13:21.977
I will say, "I'm proud

00:13:21.977 --> 00:13:24.833
to be amongst those women who lifted the ban,

00:13:24.833 --> 00:13:28.608
fought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom."

00:13:28.608 --> 00:13:31.905
So the question I started my talk with,

00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:35.105
who do you think is more difficult to face,

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:38.062
oppressive governments or oppressive societies?

00:13:38.062 --> 00:13:40.961
I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech.

00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:42.417
Thank you, everyone.

00:13:42.417 --> 00:13:47.185
(Applause)

00:13:47.185 --> 00:13:50.309
Thank you.

00:13:50.309 --> 00:13:55.993
(Applause)

00:13:55.993 --> 00:13:59.517
Thank you. (Applause)
