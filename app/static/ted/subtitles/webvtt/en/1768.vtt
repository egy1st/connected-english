00:00:00.818 --> 00:00:02.328
Once upon a time

00:00:02.328 --> 00:00:08.979
we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity.

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.674
This was called the Great Moderation,

00:00:12.674 --> 00:00:16.080
the misguided belief by most economists,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.383
policymakers and central banks

00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:22.714
that we have transformed into a new world

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:26.571
of never-ending growth and prosperity.

00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:31.314
This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth,

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:34.314
by low and controlled inflation,

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:36.553
by low unemployment,

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:40.459
and controlled and low financial volatility.

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:47.091
But the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008,

00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:50.570
the great crash, broke this illusion.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.594
A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:59.674
cascaded into five trillion dollars

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.558
of losses in world GDP

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:05.361
and almost $30 trillion losses

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:09.306
in the global stock market.

00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:14.501
So the understanding of this Great Recession

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:19.862
was that this was completely surprising,

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:21.208
this came out of the blue,

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:24.125
this was like the wrath of the gods.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.916
There was no responsibility.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:27.839
So, as a reflection of this,

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:31.448
we started the Financial Crisis Observatory.

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:35.386
We had the goal to diagnose in real time

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:37.757
financial bubbles

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:43.614
and identify in advance their critical time.

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:46.972
What is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:51.598
We developed a theory called "dragon-kings."

00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:54.804
Dragon-kings represent extreme events

00:01:54.804 --> 00:01:58.076
which are of a class of their own.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.919
They are special. They are outliers.

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:04.359
They are generated by specific mechanisms

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.245
that may make them predictable,

00:02:07.245 --> 00:02:10.143
perhaps controllable.

00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:13.970
Consider the financial price time series,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.143
a given stock, your perfect stock,

00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:18.495
or a global index.

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:20.549
You have these up-and-downs.

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.111
A very good measure of the risk of this financial market

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.533
is the peaks-to-valleys that represent

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.829
a worst case scenario

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.502
when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom.

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:36.251
You can look at the statistics, the frequency of the occurrence

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:38.606
of peak-to-valleys of different sizes,

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:41.157
which is represented in this graph.

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:44.189
Now, interestingly, 99 percent

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.982
of the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes

00:02:47.982 --> 00:02:51.442
can be represented by a universal power law

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:54.893
represented by this red line here.

00:02:54.893 --> 00:02:59.039
More interestingly, there are outliers, there are exceptions

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.942
which are above this red line,

00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:04.701
occur 100 times more frequently, at least,

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:08.854
than the extrapolation would predict them to occur

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:12.791
based on the calibration of the 99 percent remaining

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.040
peak-to-valleys.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.640
They are due to trenchant dependancies

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.152
such that a loss is followed by a loss

00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:26.115
which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss.

00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:29.226
These kinds of dependencies

00:03:29.226 --> 00:03:34.838
are largely missed by standard risk management tools,

00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:37.767
which ignore them and see lizards

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:41.586
when they should see dragon-kings.

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:45.503
The root mechanism of a dragon-king

00:03:45.503 --> 00:03:48.639
is a slow maturation towards instability,

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.261
which is the bubble,

00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:52.891
and the climax of the bubble is often the crash.

00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:56.516
This is similar to the slow heating of water

00:03:56.516 --> 00:03:59.419
in this test tube reaching the boiling point,

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.909
where the instability of the water occurs

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.246
and you have the phase transition to vapor.

00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:08.923
And this process, which is absolutely non-linear --

00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:11.203
cannot be predicted by standard techniques --

00:04:11.203 --> 00:04:15.379
is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.758
which is fundamentally endogenous.

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:20.971
So the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisis

00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:24.155
has to be found in an inner instability of the system,

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:30.191
and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur.

00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.891
Now, some of you may have come to the mind

00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:36.516
that is this not related to the black swan concept

00:04:36.516 --> 00:04:39.451
you have heard about frequently?

00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:41.868
Remember, black swan is this rare bird

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:45.277
that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief

00:04:45.277 --> 00:04:47.751
that all swans should be white,

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:51.295
so it has captured the idea of unpredictability,

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:52.804
unknowability, that the extreme events

00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:55.635
are fundamentally unknowable.

00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:57.360
Nothing can be further

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.998
from the dragon-king concept I propose,

00:04:59.998 --> 00:05:03.716
which is exactly the opposite, that most extreme events

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:06.939
are actually knowable and predictable.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.444
So we can be empowered and take responsibility

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:12.663
and make predictions about them.

00:05:12.663 --> 00:05:15.863
So let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept.

00:05:15.863 --> 00:05:17.489
(Laughter)

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:20.429
There are many early warning signals

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:22.308
that are predicted by this theory.

00:05:22.308 --> 00:05:24.675
Let me just focus on one of them:

00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:27.827
the super-exponential growth with positive feedback.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.987
What does it mean?

00:05:28.987 --> 00:05:31.160
Imagine you have an investment

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.314
that returns the first year five percent,

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:37.469
the second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent,

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.011
the next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?

00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:43.409
This is a super-exponential growth.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.346
A standard exponential growth corresponds

00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:49.090
to a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percent

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.571
The point is that, many times during bubbles,

00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:56.168
there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times,

00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:59.867
such that previous growths enhance,

00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:03.355
push forward, increase the next growth

00:06:03.355 --> 00:06:05.857
through this kind of super-exponential growth,

00:06:05.857 --> 00:06:08.971
which is very trenchant, not sustainable.

00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:12.028
And the key idea is that the mathematical solution

00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:15.666
of this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities,

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:19.019
which means that there is a critical time

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:22.223
where the system will break, will change regime.

00:06:22.223 --> 00:06:25.499
It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else.

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:27.766
And the key idea is that the critical time,

00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:30.295
the information about the critical time is contained

00:06:30.295 --> 00:06:35.779
in the early development of this super-exponential growth.

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:40.139
We have applied this theory early on, that was our first success,

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.698
to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements

00:06:43.698 --> 00:06:46.227
on the iron rocket.

00:06:46.227 --> 00:06:49.049
Using acoustic emission, you know, this little noise

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:51.346
that you hear a structure emit, sing to you

00:06:51.346 --> 00:06:55.037
when they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on,

00:06:55.037 --> 00:06:57.477
there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback,

00:06:57.477 --> 00:06:59.174
the more damage gives the more damage,

00:06:59.174 --> 00:07:01.649
so you can actually predict,

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:03.789
within, of course, a probability band,

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.702
when the rupture will occur.

00:07:05.702 --> 00:07:08.137
So this is now so successful that it is used

00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:12.502
in the initial phase of [unclear] the flight.

00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:15.309
Perhaps more surprisingly, the same type of theory

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:18.037
applies to biology and medicine,

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:21.733
parturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:25.357
From seven months of pregnancy, a mother

00:07:25.357 --> 00:07:31.021
starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus

00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:35.125
that are the sign of these maturations

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:38.549
toward the instability, giving birth to the baby,

00:07:38.549 --> 00:07:40.920
the dragon-king.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.526
So if you measure the precursor signal,

00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:49.751
you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems

00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:51.222
in advance.

00:07:51.222 --> 00:07:54.982
Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size,

00:07:54.982 --> 00:07:58.262
and when the brain goes to a super-critical state,

00:07:58.262 --> 00:08:01.835
you have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:07.342
and this can help the patient to deal with this illness.

00:08:07.342 --> 00:08:09.527
We have applied this theory to many systems,

00:08:09.527 --> 00:08:12.382
landslides, glacier collapse,

00:08:12.382 --> 00:08:15.949
even to the dynamics of prediction of success:

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:20.335
blockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on.

00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:23.471
But perhaps the most important application

00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:25.837
is for finance, and this theory

00:08:25.837 --> 00:08:29.276
illuminates, I believe, the deep reason

00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:31.972
for the financial crisis that we have gone through.

00:08:31.972 --> 00:08:36.020
This is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.732
starting in 1980, with the global bubble

00:08:39.732 --> 00:08:41.819
crashing in 1987,

00:08:41.819 --> 00:08:44.188
followed by many other bubbles.

00:08:44.188 --> 00:08:46.900
The biggest one was the "new economy" Internet bubble

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.825
in 2000, crashing in 2000,

00:08:48.825 --> 00:08:50.873
the real estate bubbles in many countries,

00:08:50.873 --> 00:08:53.653
financial derivative bubbles everywhere,

00:08:53.653 --> 00:08:55.942
stock market bubbles also everywhere,

00:08:55.942 --> 00:08:59.893
commodity and all bubbles, debt and credit bubbles --

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:02.606
bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.

00:09:02.606 --> 00:09:05.245
We had a global bubble.

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:09.486
This is a measure of global overvaluation

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:13.492
of all markets, expressing what I call

00:09:13.508 --> 00:09:16.677
an illusion of a perpetual money machine

00:09:16.677 --> 00:09:20.629
that suddenly broke in 2007.

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:24.863
The problem is that we see the same process,

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:27.594
in particular through quantitative easing,

00:09:27.594 --> 00:09:30.778
of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:35.181
to tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe,

00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:37.469
in Japan.

00:09:37.469 --> 00:09:39.859
This has very important implications

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:43.937
to understand the failure of quantitative easing

00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:45.813
as well as austerity measures

00:09:45.813 --> 00:09:48.622
as long as we don't attack the core,

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:53.813
the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking.

00:09:53.813 --> 00:09:56.429
Now, these are big claims.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.311
Why would you believe me?

00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:02.191
Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 years

00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:05.383
we have come out of our ivory tower,

00:10:05.383 --> 00:10:08.119
and started to publish ex ante --

00:10:08.119 --> 00:10:11.447
and I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" —

00:10:11.447 --> 00:10:13.585
before the crash confirmed

00:10:13.585 --> 00:10:16.271
the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.

00:10:16.271 --> 00:10:19.993
These are a few of the major bubbles

00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:24.471
that we have lived through in recent history.

00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:27.311
Again, many interesting stories for each of them.

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:30.025
Let me tell you just one or two stories

00:10:30.025 --> 00:10:32.071
that deal with massive bubbles.

00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:34.407
We all know the Chinese miracle.

00:10:34.407 --> 00:10:37.477
This is the expression of the stock market

00:10:37.477 --> 00:10:40.357
of a massive bubble, a factor of three,

00:10:40.357 --> 00:10:42.527
300 percent in just a few years.

00:10:42.527 --> 00:10:45.729
In September 2007,

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:49.376
I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund

00:10:49.376 --> 00:10:51.825
management conference,

00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:55.880
and I showed to the conference a prediction

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.073
that by the end of 2007, this bubble

00:11:00.073 --> 00:11:02.042
would change regime.

00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:05.127
There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable.

00:11:05.127 --> 00:11:10.369
Now, how do you believe the very smart,

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:15.799
very motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managers

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:17.755
reacted to this prediction?

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:19.711
You know, they had made billions

00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:22.546
just surfing this bubble until now.

00:11:22.546 --> 00:11:24.130
They told me, "Didier,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.167
yeah, the market might be overvalued,

00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:29.063
but you forget something.

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.415
There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:33.679
in August 2008, and it's very clear that

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:36.871
the Chinese government is controlling the economy

00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:38.224
and doing what it takes

00:11:38.224 --> 00:11:42.671
to also avoid any wave and control the stock market."

00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:45.142
Three weeks after my presentation,

00:11:45.142 --> 00:11:47.268
the markets lost 20 percent

00:11:47.268 --> 00:11:49.529
and went through a phase of volatility,

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:52.255
upheaval, and a total market loss of

00:11:52.255 --> 00:11:54.523
70 percent until the end of the year.

00:11:54.523 --> 00:11:57.399
So how can we be so collectively wrong

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:01.541
by misreading or ignoring the science

00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:04.372
of the fact that when an instability has developed,

00:12:04.372 --> 00:12:06.823
and the system is ripe, any perturbation

00:12:06.823 --> 00:12:10.504
makes it essentially impossible to control?

00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:15.209
The Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded.

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:19.965
In 2009, we also identified that this new bubble,

00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:22.551
a smaller one, was unsustainable,

00:12:22.551 --> 00:12:26.183
so we published again a prediction, in advance,

00:12:26.183 --> 00:12:30.510
stating that by August 2009, the market will correct,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.191
will not continue on this track.

00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:36.343
Our critics, reading the prediction,

00:12:36.343 --> 00:12:40.256
said, "No, it's not possible.

00:12:40.256 --> 00:12:41.750
The Chinese government is there.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.432
They have learned their lesson. They will control.

00:12:44.432 --> 00:12:46.239
They want to benefit from the growth."

00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:49.895
Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously.

00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:53.727
So the crisis did occur. The market corrected.

00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:56.063
The same critics then said, "Ah, yes,

00:12:56.063 --> 00:12:57.912
but you published your prediction.

00:12:57.912 --> 00:12:59.568
You influenced the market.

00:12:59.568 --> 00:13:02.701
It was not a prediction."

00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:06.058
Maybe I am very powerful then.

00:13:06.058 --> 00:13:08.102
Now, this is interesting.

00:13:08.102 --> 00:13:11.039
It shows that it's essentially impossible until now

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:13.167
to develop a science of economics

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.310
because we are sentient beings who anticipate

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:20.373
and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies.

00:13:20.373 --> 00:13:24.106
So we invented a new way of doing science.

00:13:24.106 --> 00:13:26.818
We created the Financial Bubble Experiment.

00:13:26.818 --> 00:13:29.490
The idea is the following. We monitor the markets.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.658
We identify excesses, bubbles.

00:13:33.658 --> 00:13:36.962
We do our work. We write a report

00:13:36.962 --> 00:13:41.234
in which we put our prediction of the critical time.

00:13:41.234 --> 00:13:43.809
We don't release the report. It's kept secret.

00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:46.674
But with modern encrypting techniques,

00:13:46.674 --> 00:13:50.696
we have a hash, we publish a public key,

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:54.651
and six months later, we release the report,

00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:57.050
and there is authentication.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.818
And all this is done on an international archive

00:14:01.818 --> 00:14:06.018
so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes.

00:14:06.018 --> 00:14:09.410
Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.668
17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago,

00:14:12.668 --> 00:14:14.346
we identified that the U.S. stock market

00:14:14.346 --> 00:14:16.738
was on an unsustainable path

00:14:16.738 --> 00:14:20.540
and we released this on our website on the 21st of May

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.585
that there will be a change of regime.

00:14:22.585 --> 00:14:27.369
The next day, the market started to change regime, course.

00:14:27.369 --> 00:14:28.860
This is not a crash.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.459
This is just the third or fourth act

00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:34.322
of a massive bubble in the making.

00:14:34.322 --> 00:14:37.418
Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet,

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:38.443
we see the same thing.

00:14:38.443 --> 00:14:41.364
Wherever we look, it's observable:

00:14:41.364 --> 00:14:44.594
in the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean,

00:14:44.594 --> 00:14:48.498
showing these super-exponential trajectories

00:14:48.498 --> 00:14:51.129
characterizing an unsustainable path

00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:53.746
and announcing a phase transition.

00:14:53.746 --> 00:14:55.450
This diagram on the right

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.450
shows a very beautiful compilation of studies

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.160
suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibility

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.309
for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades.

00:15:06.309 --> 00:15:09.931
So there are bubbles everywhere.

00:15:09.931 --> 00:15:11.895
From one side, this is exciting

00:15:11.895 --> 00:15:14.655
for me, as a professor who chases bubbles

00:15:14.655 --> 00:15:19.413
and slays dragons, as the media has sometimes called me.

00:15:19.413 --> 00:15:22.464
But can we really slay the dragons?

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:24.608
Very recently, with collaborators,

00:15:24.608 --> 00:15:27.311
we studied a dynamical system

00:15:27.311 --> 00:15:30.215
where you see the dragon-king as these big loops

00:15:30.215 --> 00:15:34.136
and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times

00:15:34.136 --> 00:15:39.071
that removed, when control is on, these dragons.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:42.005
"Gouverner, c'est prévoir."

00:15:42.005 --> 00:15:47.799
Governing is the art of planning and predicting.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:50.552
But is it not the case that this is probably

00:15:50.552 --> 00:15:54.452
one of the biggest gaps of mankind,

00:15:54.452 --> 00:15:57.712
which has the responsibility to steer

00:15:57.712 --> 00:16:00.415
our societies and our planet toward sustainability

00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:05.272
in the face of growing challenges and crises?

00:16:05.272 --> 00:16:09.767
But the dragon-king theory gives hope.

00:16:09.767 --> 00:16:13.335
We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability.

00:16:13.335 --> 00:16:18.235
It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises

00:16:18.235 --> 00:16:21.794
so that we can be prepared, we can take measures,

00:16:21.794 --> 00:16:24.549
we can take responsibility,

00:16:24.549 --> 00:16:27.296
and so that never again will

00:16:27.296 --> 00:16:31.150
extremes and crises like the Great Recession

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.560
or the European crisis take us by surprise.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.035
Thank you.

00:16:37.035 --> 00:16:43.328
(Applause)
