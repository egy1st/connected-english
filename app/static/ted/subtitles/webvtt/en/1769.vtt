00:00:01.809 --> 00:00:06.129
The idea of eliminating poverty
is a great goal.

00:00:07.026 --> 00:00:09.806
I don't think anyone
in this room would disagree.

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:15.036
What worries me
is when politicians with money

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.681
and charismatic rock stars --

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:19.285
(Laughter)

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:20.626
use the words,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.819
" ... it all just sounds so, so simple."

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:30.165
Now, I've got no bucket of money today

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.380
and I've got no policy to release,

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:35.643
and I certainly haven't got a guitar.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:37.527
I'll leave that to others.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.122
But I do have an idea,

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:42.764
and that idea is called
Housing for Health.

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:46.037
Housing for Health works with poor people.

00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:49.092
It works in the places where they live,

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:52.218
and the work is done
to improve their health.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.204
Over the last 28 years,

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:58.656
this tough, grinding, dirty work

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.141
has been done by literally
thousands of people around Australia

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.605
and, more recently, overseas,

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:07.833
and their work has proven

00:01:07.857 --> 00:01:13.307
that focused design can improve
even the poorest living environments.

00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:14.673
It can improve health

00:01:14.697 --> 00:01:19.462
and it can play a part in reducing,
if not eliminating, poverty.

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:23.307
I'm going to start
where the story began --

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:27.176
1985, in Central Australia.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.923
A man called Yami Lester,
an Aboriginal man,

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:31.785
was running a health service.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.575
Eighty percent of what walked
in the door, in terms of illness,

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.788
was infectious disease --

00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:41.660
third world, developing world
infectious disease,

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:44.447
caused by a poor living environment.

00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:50.953
Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.442
He got a medical doctor.

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:56.242
He got an environmental health guy.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:02:01.010
And he hand-selected a team
of local Aboriginal people

00:02:01.034 --> 00:02:02.667
to work on this project.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.245
Yami told us at that first meeting,

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:09.011
"There's no money," --
always a good start --

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:12.524
" ... no money, you have six months,

00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:15.562
and I want you to start on a project --"
which, in his language,

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:18.314
he called "Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku,"

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:23.300
which, translated, is "a plan
to stop people getting sick" --

00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:24.737
a profound brief.

00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:28.827
That was our task.

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:34.300
First step, the medical doctor went away
for about six months.

00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:39.363
And he worked on what were to become
these nine health goals --

00:02:39.387 --> 00:02:41.223
what were we aiming at?

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:45.427
After six months of work,
he came to my office

00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:50.022
and presented me with
those nine words on a piece of paper.

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:54.042
[The 9 Healthy Living Practices: Washing,
clothes, wastewater, nutrition, crowding,

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:55.733
animals, dust, temperature, injury]

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:59.027
I was very unimpressed.
Big ideas need big words,

00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:00.762
and preferably a lot of them.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.266
This didn't fit the bill.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.656
What I didn't see and what you can't see

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.994
was that he'd assembled thousands of pages

00:03:12.018 --> 00:03:15.784
of local, national
and international health research

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:20.610
that filled out the picture
as to why these were the health targets.

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:24.786
The pictures that came a bit later
had a very simple reason.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.073
The Aboriginal people who were our bosses
and the senior people

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:30.439
were most commonly illiterate,

00:03:30.463 --> 00:03:32.622
so the story had to be told in pictures

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:34.347
of what these goals were.

00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:36.673
We worked with the community,

00:03:36.697 --> 00:03:38.680
not telling them what was going to happen

00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:40.533
in a language they didn't understand.

00:03:41.593 --> 00:03:44.836
So we had the goals
and each one of these goals --

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.721
and I won't go through them all --

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:50.824
puts at the center the person
and their health issue,

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:52.800
and it then connects them

00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:57.309
to the bits of the physical
environment that are actually needed

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:58.865
to keep their health good.

00:03:59.262 --> 00:04:01.943
And the highest priority,
you see on the screen,

00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:05.768
is washing people once a day,
particularly children.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.064
And I hope most of you are thinking,

00:04:08.088 --> 00:04:09.390
"What? That sounds simple."

00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:13.470
Now, I'm going to ask you all
a very personal question.

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:14.875
This morning before you came,

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:19.070
who could have had a wash using a shower?

00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:23.413
I'm not going to ask if you had a shower,
because I'm too polite.

00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:24.588
That's it.

00:04:24.612 --> 00:04:25.613
(Laughter)

00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:27.399
All right, I think it's fair to say

00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:30.470
most people here could have had
a shower this morning.

00:04:30.494 --> 00:04:32.618
I'm going to ask you to do some more work.

00:04:32.642 --> 00:04:35.146
I want you all to select one of the houses

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.222
of the 25 houses you see on the screen.

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:40.652
I want you to select one of them
and note the position of that house

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:42.053
and keep that in your head.

00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:43.603
Have you all got a house?

00:04:43.627 --> 00:04:46.077
I'm going to ask you to live there
for a few months,

00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:47.707
so make sure you've got it right.

00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:50.754
It's in the northwest of
Western Australia, very pleasant place.

00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:53.990
OK. Let's see if your shower
in that house is working.

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:58.463
I hear some "Aw!" and I hear some "Ah!"

00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:01.267
If you get a green tick,
your shower's working.

00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:02.577
You and your kids are fine.

00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:04.970
If you get a red cross,

00:05:04.994 --> 00:05:07.233
well, I've looked carefully
around the room

00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:10.433
and it's not going to make
much difference to this crew.

00:05:10.457 --> 00:05:12.981
Why? Because you're all too old.

00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:16.217
I know that's going to come as a shock
to some of you, but you are.

00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:18.120
And before you get offended and leave,

00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:19.960
I've got to say that being too old,

00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:23.532
in this case, means that pretty much
everyone in the room, I think,

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:25.461
is over five years of age.

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:30.226
We're really concerned
with kids naught to five.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.470
And why?

00:05:31.946 --> 00:05:36.747
Washing is the antidote
to the sort of bugs,

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:39.994
the common infectious diseases
of the eyes, the ears,

00:05:40.018 --> 00:05:42.414
the chest and the skin

00:05:42.438 --> 00:05:45.310
that, if they occur in the first
five years of life,

00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:48.737
permanently damage those organs.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:52.194
They leave a lifelong remnant.

00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:55.225
That means that by the age of five,

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:57.535
you can't see as well
for the rest of your life.

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.049
You can't hear as well
for the rest of your life.

00:06:00.073 --> 00:06:01.415
You can't breathe as well.

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.929
You've lost a third of your lung
capacity by the age of five.

00:06:04.953 --> 00:06:06.796
And even skin infection,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.376
which we originally thought
wasn't that big a problem,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.625
mild skin infections
naught to five give you

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:15.105
a greatly increased
chance of renal failure,

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.673
needing dialysis at age 40.

00:06:18.364 --> 00:06:21.259
This is a big deal, so the ticks
and crosses on the screen

00:06:21.283 --> 00:06:24.147
are actually critical for young kids.

00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:27.806
Those ticks and crosses
represent the 7,800 houses

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.894
we've looked at nationally
around Australia,

00:06:29.918 --> 00:06:31.327
the same proportion.

00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:32.806
What you see on the screen --

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.063
35 percent of those not-so-famous houses

00:06:36.087 --> 00:06:38.963
lived in by 50,000 indigenous people --

00:06:38.987 --> 00:06:41.548
35 percent had a working shower.

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:47.937
Ten percent of those same 7,800 houses
had safe electrical systems.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.610
And 58 percent of those houses
had a working toilet.

00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:58.433
These are by a simple, standard test.

00:06:58.457 --> 00:07:00.858
In the case of the shower:

00:07:00.882 --> 00:07:05.390
does it have hot and cold water,
two taps that work,

00:07:05.414 --> 00:07:10.163
a shower rose to get water
onto your head or onto your body,

00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:12.021
and a drain that takes the water away?

00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:16.093
Not well-designed,
not beautiful, not elegant --

00:07:16.117 --> 00:07:17.284
just that they function.

00:07:17.308 --> 00:07:19.531
And the same tests
for the electrical system

00:07:19.555 --> 00:07:20.886
and the toilets.

00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:24.743
Housing for Health projects
aren't about measuring failure --

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:27.065
they're actually about improving houses.

00:07:27.475 --> 00:07:31.369
We start on day one of every project.

00:07:31.393 --> 00:07:34.632
We've learned -- we don't make promises,
we don't do reports.

00:07:34.656 --> 00:07:39.978
We arrive in the morning with tools,
tons of equipment, trades,

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:43.486
and we train up a local team
on the first day to start work.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.290
By the evening of the first day,

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:49.725
a few houses in that community are better
than when we started in the morning.

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.004
That work continues for six to 12 months,

00:07:52.028 --> 00:07:53.726
until all the houses are improved

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.351
and we've spent our budget
of 7,500 dollars total per house.

00:07:58.375 --> 00:07:59.879
That's our average budget.

00:08:00.451 --> 00:08:04.747
At the end of six months to a year,
we test every house again.

00:08:04.771 --> 00:08:06.832
It's very easy to spend money.

00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:09.174
It's very difficult to improve

00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:11.603
the function of all those
parts of the house.

00:08:11.627 --> 00:08:14.623
And for a whole house,
the nine healthy living practices,

00:08:14.647 --> 00:08:18.308
we test, check and fix
250 items in every house.

00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:23.251
And these are the results we can get
with our 7,500 dollars.

00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:25.877
We can get showers
up to 86 percent working,

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:29.692
we can get electrical systems
up to 77 percent working

00:08:29.716 --> 00:08:32.349
and we can get 90 percent
of toilets working

00:08:32.373 --> 00:08:34.532
in those 7,500 houses.

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:36.407
(Applause)

00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:37.679
Thank you.

00:08:37.703 --> 00:08:43.997
(Applause)

00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:46.996
The teams do a great job,
and that's their work.

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:50.932
I think there's an obvious question

00:08:50.956 --> 00:08:52.806
that I hope you're thinking about.

00:08:53.593 --> 00:08:55.545
Why do we have to do this work?

00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:58.699
Why are the houses in such poor condition?

00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:02.808
Seventy percent of the work we do
is due to lack of routine maintenance --

00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:05.237
the sort of things that happen
in all our houses.

00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:09.144
Things wear out, should have been done
by state government or local government,

00:09:09.168 --> 00:09:12.354
simply not done, the house doesn't work.

00:09:12.378 --> 00:09:16.269
Twenty-one percent of the things we fix
are due to faulty construction --

00:09:16.293 --> 00:09:19.294
literally things that are built
upside down and back to front.

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:21.167
They don't work, we have to fix them.

00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:27.681
And if you've lived in Australia
in the last 30 years, the final cause --

00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:31.360
you will have heard always
that indigenous people trash houses.

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:34.822
It's one of the almost
rock-solid pieces of evidence

00:09:34.846 --> 00:09:36.861
which I've never seen evidence for,

00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:40.345
that's always reeled out as "That's
the problem with indigenous housing."

00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:42.539
Well, nine percent
of what we spend is damage,

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:44.234
misuse or abuse of any sort.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.165
We argue strongly that the people
living in the house

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:50.820
are simply not the problem.

00:09:51.384 --> 00:09:53.182
And we'll go a lot further than that;

00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:57.019
the people living in the house
are actually a major part of the solution.

00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:01.114
Seventy-five percent
of our national team in Australia --

00:10:01.138 --> 00:10:03.591
over 75 at the minute --

00:10:03.615 --> 00:10:07.943
are actually local, indigenous people
from the communities we work in.

00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:09.721
They do all aspects of the work.

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:15.929
(Applause)

00:10:15.953 --> 00:10:19.811
In 2010, for example, there were 831,

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:22.408
all over Australia,
and the Torres Strait Islands,

00:10:22.432 --> 00:10:26.891
all states, working to improve the houses
where they and their families live,

00:10:26.915 --> 00:10:29.174
and that's an important thing.

00:10:29.198 --> 00:10:32.308
Our work's always had a focus on health.

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:33.498
That's the key.

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:37.894
The developing world bug,
trachoma, causes blindness.

00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:40.284
It's a developing-world illness,

00:10:40.308 --> 00:10:42.137
and yet, the picture you see behind

00:10:42.161 --> 00:10:45.957
is in an Aboriginal community
in the late 1990s,

00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:49.981
where 95 percent of school-aged
kids had active trachoma

00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:51.960
in their eyes, doing damage.

00:10:53.142 --> 00:10:54.418
OK, what do we do?

00:10:54.442 --> 00:10:57.745
Well, first thing we do,
we get showers working.

00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:59.610
Why? Because that flushes the bug out.

00:10:59.634 --> 00:11:01.975
We put washing facilities
in the school as well,

00:11:01.999 --> 00:11:04.736
so kids can wash their faces
many times during the day.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.649
We wash the bug out.

00:11:06.673 --> 00:11:10.514
Second, the eye doctors tell us
that dust scours the eye

00:11:10.538 --> 00:11:11.855
and lets the bug in quick.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.088
So what do we do?

00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:16.612
We call up the doctor of dust,
and there is such a person.

00:11:16.636 --> 00:11:18.562
He was loaned to us by a mining company.

00:11:18.586 --> 00:11:21.256
He controls dust on mining company sites.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.083
And he came out and, within a day,

00:11:23.107 --> 00:11:25.298
it worked out that most dust
in this community

00:11:25.322 --> 00:11:28.572
was within a meter of the ground,
the wind-driven dust --

00:11:28.596 --> 00:11:31.477
so he suggested making mounds
to catch the dust

00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:35.223
before it went into the house area
and affected the eyes of kids.

00:11:35.247 --> 00:11:38.790
So we used dirt to stop dust.

00:11:38.814 --> 00:11:41.582
We did it. He provided us dust monitors.

00:11:41.606 --> 00:11:44.062
We tested and we reduced the dust.

00:11:44.086 --> 00:11:46.287
Then we wanted to get rid
of the bug generally.

00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:47.461
So how do we do that?

00:11:47.485 --> 00:11:52.219
Well, we call up the doctor of flies --
and, yes, there is a doctor of flies.

00:11:52.728 --> 00:11:54.282
As our Aboriginal mate said,

00:11:54.306 --> 00:11:56.417
"You white fellows ought to get out more."

00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:58.671
(Laughter)

00:11:58.695 --> 00:12:01.800
And the doctor of flies
very quickly determined

00:12:01.824 --> 00:12:05.902
that there was one fly
that carried the bug.

00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:08.349
He could give school kids
in this community

00:12:08.373 --> 00:12:11.551
the beautiful fly trap you see
above in the slide.

00:12:11.575 --> 00:12:14.111
They could trap the flies,
send them to him in Perth.

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:16.088
When the bug was in the gut,

00:12:16.112 --> 00:12:19.079
he'd send back by return post
some dung beetles.

00:12:19.103 --> 00:12:21.396
The dung beetles ate the camel dung,

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.166
the flies died through lack of food,

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.499
and trachoma dropped.

00:12:24.523 --> 00:12:30.336
And over the year, trachoma dropped
radically in this place, and stayed low.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.802
We changed the environment,
not just treated the eyes.

00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:37.524
And finally, you get a good eye.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.705
All these small health gains

00:12:40.729 --> 00:12:43.951
and small pieces of the puzzle
make a big difference.

00:12:43.975 --> 00:12:45.958
The New South Wales Department of Health,

00:12:45.982 --> 00:12:47.259
that radical organization,

00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:50.823
did an independent trial over three years

00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:53.420
to look at 10 years of the work
we've been doing

00:12:53.444 --> 00:12:55.912
in these sorts of projects
in New South Wales.

00:12:55.936 --> 00:13:01.480
And they found a 40 percent reduction
in hospital admissions

00:13:01.504 --> 00:13:05.234
for the illnesses that you could attribute
to the poor environment --

00:13:05.258 --> 00:13:07.628
a 40 percent reduction.

00:13:07.652 --> 00:13:14.616
(Applause)

00:13:15.845 --> 00:13:18.567
Just to show that the principles
we've used in Australia

00:13:18.591 --> 00:13:19.929
can be used in other places,

00:13:19.953 --> 00:13:22.691
I'm just going to go
to one other place, and that's Nepal.

00:13:22.715 --> 00:13:24.326
And what a beautiful place to go.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.711
We were asked by a small
village of 600 people

00:13:27.735 --> 00:13:31.740
to go in and make toilets
where none existed.

00:13:31.764 --> 00:13:32.975
Health was poor.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.739
We went in with no grand plan,

00:13:35.763 --> 00:13:37.890
no grand promises of a great program,

00:13:37.914 --> 00:13:41.122
just the offer to build
two toilets for two families.

00:13:41.146 --> 00:13:44.494
It was during the design
of the first toilet

00:13:44.518 --> 00:13:45.777
that I went for lunch,

00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:48.850
invited by the family
into their main room of the house.

00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:50.874
It was choking with smoke.

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:54.473
People were cooking
on their only fuel source, green timber.

00:13:54.497 --> 00:13:56.594
The smoke coming off
that timber is choking,

00:13:56.618 --> 00:13:59.318
and in an enclosed house,
you simply can't breathe.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:03.938
Later we found the leading cause
of illness and death

00:14:03.962 --> 00:14:07.517
in this particular region
is through respiratory failure.

00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:09.665
So all of a sudden, we had two problems.

00:14:09.689 --> 00:14:11.753
We were there originally
to look at toilets

00:14:11.777 --> 00:14:14.075
and get human waste
off the ground, that's fine.

00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:17.013
But all of a sudden now
there was a second problem:

00:14:17.037 --> 00:14:18.862
How do we actually get the smoke down?

00:14:18.886 --> 00:14:22.922
So two problems, and design should
be about more than one thing.

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:26.516
Solution: Take human waste,
take animal waste,

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.898
put it into a chamber,
out of that, extract biogas,

00:14:29.922 --> 00:14:31.561
methane gas.

00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:34.986
The gas gives three to four
hours cooking a day --

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.650
clean, smokeless and free for the family.

00:14:38.674 --> 00:14:43.818
(Applause)

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:46.726
I put it to you:
is this eliminating poverty?

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.162
And the answer from the Nepali team
who's working at the minute would say,

00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:52.337
don't be ridiculous --

00:14:52.361 --> 00:14:54.433
we have three million
more toilets to build

00:14:54.457 --> 00:14:57.308
before we can even make
a stab at that claim.

00:14:57.332 --> 00:15:00.291
And I don't pretend anything else.

00:15:00.315 --> 00:15:02.973
But as we all sit here today,

00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:04.833
there are now over 100 toilets built

00:15:04.857 --> 00:15:07.270
in this village and a couple nearby.

00:15:07.294 --> 00:15:10.743
Well over 1,000 people use those toilets.

00:15:10.767 --> 00:15:13.942
Yami Lama, he's a young boy.

00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:18.270
He's got significantly less gut infection
because he's now got toilets,

00:15:18.294 --> 00:15:20.654
and there isn't human waste on the ground.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.357
Kanji Maya, she's a mother,
and a proud one.

00:15:25.381 --> 00:15:29.824
She's probably right now
cooking lunch for her family

00:15:29.848 --> 00:15:32.293
on biogas, smokeless fuel.

00:15:32.317 --> 00:15:33.563
Her lungs have got better,

00:15:33.587 --> 00:15:35.563
and they'll get better as time increases,

00:15:35.587 --> 00:15:37.768
because she's not cooking
in the same smoke.

00:15:37.792 --> 00:15:40.394
Surya takes the waste
out of the biogas chamber

00:15:40.418 --> 00:15:43.335
when it's shed the gas,
he puts it on his crops.

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:46.057
He's trebled his crop income,

00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:48.996
more food for the family
and more money for the family.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.774
And finally Bishnu,
the leader of the team,

00:15:53.798 --> 00:15:56.961
has now understood that not only
have we built toilets,

00:15:56.985 --> 00:15:59.137
we've also built a team,

00:15:59.161 --> 00:16:01.793
and that team is now
working in two villages

00:16:01.817 --> 00:16:04.290
where they're training up
the next two villages

00:16:04.314 --> 00:16:06.144
to keep the work expanding.

00:16:06.168 --> 00:16:07.793
And that, to me, is the key.

00:16:07.817 --> 00:16:12.484
(Applause)

00:16:12.508 --> 00:16:15.212
People are not the problem.

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:18.196
We've never found that.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.915
The problem: poor living environment,

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.907
poor housing and the bugs
that do people harm.

00:16:25.137 --> 00:16:30.876
None of those are limited by geography,
by skin color or by religion.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.278
None of them.

00:16:33.087 --> 00:16:35.540
The common link between all
the work we've had to do

00:16:35.564 --> 00:16:37.435
is one thing, and that's poverty.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.187
Nelson Mandela said, in the mid-2000s,
not too far from here,

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:49.492
he said that like slavery and apartheid,
"Poverty is not natural.

00:16:49.516 --> 00:16:53.375
It is man-made and can be
overcome and eradicated

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:55.523
by the actions of human beings."

00:16:56.864 --> 00:16:58.173
I want to end by saying

00:16:58.197 --> 00:17:04.354
it's been the actions of thousands
of ordinary human beings

00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:07.603
doing -- I think -- extraordinary work,

00:17:07.627 --> 00:17:10.271
that have actually improved health,

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:13.416
and, maybe only in a small way,
reduced poverty.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.112
Thank you very much for your time.

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:21.841
(Applause)
