WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the problems and the opportunities that we face,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, you've all seen "Inconvenient Truth." This is a little more inconvenient.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
(Video): Man: ... extremely dangerous questions.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Because, with our present knowledge, we have no idea what would happen.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Even now, man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
through the waste products of his civilization.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Due to our release, through factories and automobiles every year,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which helps air absorb heat from the sun --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is bad?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
melt the polar ice caps.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
through 150 feet of tropical water.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
For, in weather, we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
than even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Larry Brilliant: Should we feel good, or should we feel bad

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Well, it depends, really, on what your goals are.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I think, as my goals, I always go back to Gandhi's talisman.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
When Mahatma Gandhi was asked,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
"How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
or the wrong one?" he said, "Consider the face of the poorest,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And if it will be, it's the right thing to do, and if not, rethink it."

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
For those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
it's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
who are the poorest and the most vulnerable,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But there's also a wonderful case for optimism.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Let's review them both. First of all, the megatrends.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
There's two degrees, or three degrees of climate change baked into the system.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
as will the increasing rise of population.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Even though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and we will not see 20 billion people in this decade, as he had forecast,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we eat as if we were 20 billion.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And we consume so much that again, a rise of 6.5 billion to 9.5 billion

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the poorest and the most vulnerable.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
That's why they migrate to cities.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
That's why in June of this year, we passed, as a species, 51 percent of us living in cities,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and bustees, and slums, and shantytowns.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The green revolution never reached Africa.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And with desertification, sandstorms, the Gobi Desert, the Ogaden,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
to produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So humans are turning more towards animal consumption.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
In Africa last year, Africans ate 600 million wild animals,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that have never been charted, the genomic sequences of which we don't know.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
-- in bioweapons, and in technology that puts us on a collision course

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
to magnify any anger, hatred or feeling of marginalization.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And in fact, with increasing globalization --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
for which there are big winners and even bigger losers

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
-- today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
One percent of us own 40 percent of all the goods and services.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
rise to three billion in the next 30 years?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
The one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world's goods

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and services. Not because they've grown richer,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Last week, Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
"This situation is unprecedented, unequal, unfair and unstable."

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So there's lots of reason for pessimism.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Darfur is, at its origin, a resource war.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Last year, there were 85,000 riots in China,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
230 a day, that required police or military intervention.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Most of them were about resources.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
We are facing an unprecedented number, scale of disasters.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Some are weather-related, human-rights related, epidemics.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
a quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And unlike destabilized world in the past, it will be broadcast to you on YouTube,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
What will that lead to?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
For some, it will lead to anger, religious and sectarian violence and terrorism.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
For others, withdrawal, nihilism, materialism.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
For us, where does it take us, as social activists and entrepreneurs?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000
As we look at these trends, do we become despondent, or will we become energized?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Let's look at one case, the case of Bangladesh.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
First, even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
global warming would continue.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
the next decades will see rising sea levels.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that we can hope for, and it could be 10 times that.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
What will that do to Bangladesh? Let's take a look.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So here's Bangladesh.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And we'll watch as global warming makes them melt. More water comes down,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
the deforested areas, here in the Tarai, will be unable to absorb the effluent,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Now we're looking down south, through the Kali Gandaki.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Many of you, I think, have probably trekked here.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
coming from the north, and in the seas rising from the south.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And now let's look from the south, looking up, and let's see this in relief.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
A minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000
As many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
into India and into China.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
This is the difficulty that one country faces.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But if you look at the globe, all around the earth, wherever there is low-lying area,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
populated areas near the water,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Sub-Saharan Africa, and even our own San Francisco Bay Area.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We're all in this together.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
This is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Global warming is something that happens to all of us, all at once.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
As are these newly emerging communicable diseases,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
names that you hadn't heard 20 years ago: ebola, lhasa fever, monkey pox.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
we live in each other's viral environment.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Do you remember, 20 years ago, no one had ever heard of West Nile fever?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and it marched every year, westwardly.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Do you remember no one had heard of ebola

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It's just the beginning, unfortunately.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
There have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It's more than enough reason for pessimism.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But now let's look at the case for optimism. (Laughter)

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Enough of the bad news. Human beings have always risen to the challenge.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
We've been here before, paralyzed by fear, paralyzed into inaction,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
when some -- probably one of you in this room -- jumped into the breach

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
which fought against the nuclear threat,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Medicins Sans Frontieres, that renewed our commitment to disaster relief,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Mohamed ElBaradei, and the tremendous hope and optimism that he

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
brought all of us, and our own Muhammad Yunus.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
We've seen the eradication of smallpox.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
We may see the eradication of polio this year.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Last year, there were only 2,000 cases in the world.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year --

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
there are only 35,000 cases left in the world.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
20 years ago, there were three and a half million.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And we've seen a new disease, not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome. (Laughter)

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It's an amazing phenomenon.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
All throughout the technology world, we're seeing young people bitten by this

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
disease of sudden wealth syndrome.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
But they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
They're not waiting until they die to create foundations.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
They're actively guiding their money, their resources, their hearts, their commitments,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
to make the world a better place.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Certainly, nothing can give you more optimism than that.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
More reasons to be optimistic:

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
in the '60s, and I am a creature of the '60s, there was a movement.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
We all felt that we were part of it, that a better world was right around the corner,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Today, there's another kind of movement. It's a movement to save the earth.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
It's just beginning.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Five weeks ago, a group of activists from the business community gathered together

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal-fired electrical plants

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that would have contributed to destroying the environment.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Six months ago, a group of business activists gathered together to join with the

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Republican governor in California to pass AB 32,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the most far-reaching legislation in environmental history.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Can you imagine? (Laughter)

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I would not have believed, as the evangelical community

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
has understood the desperate situation of global warming.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It is something to be greatly optimistic about.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
The European 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And on April 14th, there will be Step Up Day, where there will be a thousand

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000
individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And on July 7th, around the world, I learned only yesterday,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
there will be global Live Earth concerts.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Now, that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
hurts the poorest and the weakest the most.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
That means that people are beginning the first step,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
which is acting out of their own self-interest.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
But I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys, Google,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
so many other organizations, a beginning of understanding that we need

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
to work not just on primary prevention of global warming,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
on the poorest and the most vulnerable.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
But for me, I have another reason to be an incurable optimist.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And you've heard so many inspiring stories here, and I heard so many last night

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that I thought I would share a little bit of mine.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
My background is not exactly conventional medical training.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And I lived in a Himalayan monastery, and I studied with a very wise teacher,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny --

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
it felt like Yoda -- it is your destiny to go to work for WHO

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and to help eradicate smallpox,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
at a time when there was no smallpox program.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
because it was the worst disease in history.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
In the last century -- that's the one that was seven years ago --

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
half a billion people died from smallpox:

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
more than all the wars in history,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.000
In the Summer of Love, in 1967, two million people, children, died of smallpox.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
It's not ancient history.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
When you read the biblical plague of boils, that was smallpox.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth, whose picture is here, died of smallpox.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
To eradicate smallpox, we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
We visited every house in India, searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
once every month, for nearly two years.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
In a cruel reversal, after we had almost conquered smallpox --

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur, the realm of the final inch.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
When we had almost eradicated smallpox, it came back again,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
who could come there and get employment.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and they went home to die.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And when they did, they took smallpox to 10 other countries

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and reignited the epidemic.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And we had to start all over again.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
But, in the end, we succeeded, and the last case of smallpox:

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
this little girl, Rahima Banu -- Barisal, in Bangladesh --

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
when she coughed or breathed, and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000
thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
How can that not make you optimistic?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India, and blinded half of

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
all of those who were made blind in India, ended.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And most importantly for us here in this room, a bond was created.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Doctors, health workers, from 30 different countries,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
of every race, every religion, every color, worked together,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
fought alongside each other,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
fought against a common enemy, didn't fight against each other.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
(Applause)
