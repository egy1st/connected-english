00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:03.543
Living in Africa is to be on the edge,

00:00:03.543 --> 00:00:06.297
metaphorically, and quite literally

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:09.929
when you think about connectivity before 2008.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.641
Though many human intellectual and technological leaps

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.665
had happened in Europe and the rest of the world,

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.254
but Africa was sort of cut off.

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:21.881
And that changed, first with ships

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:25.158
when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.259
and also the Industrial Revolution.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.286
And now we've got the digital revolution.

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:33.286
These revolutions have not been evenly distributed

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:35.619
across continents and nations.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:38.349
Never have been.

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:42.114
Now, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables

00:00:42.114 --> 00:00:45.018
that connect Africa to the rest of the world.

00:00:45.018 --> 00:00:47.058
What I find amazing is that Africa

00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:49.868
is transcending its geography problem.

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:51.682
Africa is connecting to the rest of the world

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.518
and within itself.

00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:56.794
The connectivity situation has improved greatly,

00:00:56.794 --> 00:00:58.995
but some barriers remain.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:02.683
It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.

00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:07.219
In 2008, one of the problems that we faced

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.757
was lack of information flow.

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.053
There was a media blackout in 2008,

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:14.429
when there was post-election violence in Kenya.

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.253
It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:20.003
So we came together and we created software

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:21.569
called Ushahidi.

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.169
And Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili.

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:28.339
I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:30.445
This is David and Erik.

00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:32.517
I call them brothers from another mother.

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:35.529
Clearly I have a German mother somewhere.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.118
And we worked together first with building

00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:39.566
and growing Ushahidi.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.565
And the idea of the software was to gather information

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:45.338
from SMS, email and web, and put a map

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:48.253
so that you could see what was happening where,

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:50.357
and you could visualize that data.

00:01:50.357 --> 00:01:52.613
And after that initial prototype,

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:55.108
we set out to make free and open-source software

00:01:55.108 --> 00:01:59.959
so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.930
All the while, we also wanted to give back

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.162
to the local tech community that helped us

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:07.667
grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:10.250
And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.274
an actual physical space

00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:14.740
where we could collaborate,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.297
and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.

00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.067
We did that with the support of different organizations

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:25.072
like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.

00:02:25.072 --> 00:02:28.249
And we were able to grow this software footprint,

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.015
and a few years later it became

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:33.712
very useful software,

00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:36.939
and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.008
where citizens could indicate where they are

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:41.402
and what their needs were,

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:44.699
and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.738
and the tsunami in Japan.

00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:50.132
Now, this year the Internet turns 20,

00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:52.414
and Ushahidi turned five.

00:02:52.414 --> 00:02:55.215
Ushahidi is not only the software that we made.

00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:58.272
It is the team, and it's also the community

00:02:58.272 --> 00:03:02.557
that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:05.877
We did not imagine that there would be this many maps

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:07.388
around the world.

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:10.910
There are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.437
and even environmental monitoring crowd maps.

00:03:14.437 --> 00:03:17.893
We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya

00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:20.609
and that it has some use to people around the world

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.960
trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.831
There is more that we're doing to explore this idea

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.446
of collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen,

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:32.382
if I share the information with whatever device that I have,

00:03:32.382 --> 00:03:34.925
could inform you about what is going on,

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.783
and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.627
of what's going on.

00:03:39.627 --> 00:03:41.688
I moved back to Kenya in 2011.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.836
Erik moved in 2010.

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.983
Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:48.133
where there was abundant Internet access.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.965
I had never had to deal with a blackout.

00:03:50.965 --> 00:03:53.849
And in Kenya, it's a very different reality,

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.946
and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress

00:03:56.946 --> 00:04:00.730
and the digital revolution is the electricity problem.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.501
The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:06.737
can be, let's just say very annoying.

00:04:06.737 --> 00:04:08.702
Blackouts are not fun.

00:04:08.702 --> 00:04:11.615
Imagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:13.295
the power goes out,

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.970
your Internet connection goes down with it,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.618
so you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem,

00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:21.607
how do I switch back?

00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:24.325
And then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.

00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:27.517
Now, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now,

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.882
and other parts of Africa.

00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:31.838
The other problem that we're facing

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:36.125
is that communication costs are also still a challenge.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.289
It costs me five Kenyan shillings,

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.342
or .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.

00:04:44.342 --> 00:04:48.912
Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?

00:04:48.912 --> 00:04:52.186
Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:54.296
to connect within Africa.

00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:56.430
And also, when traveling within Africa,

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.696
you've got different settings for different mobile providers.

00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:02.405
This is the reality that we deal with.

00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:05.020
So we've got a joke in Ushahidi

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.818
where we say, "If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere."

00:05:09.818 --> 00:05:11.970
[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.]

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.216
What if we could overcome the problem

00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:18.081
of unreliable Internet and electricity

00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:20.106
and reduce the cost of connection?

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:22.072
Could we leverage the cloud?

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.903
We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.

00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:26.328
Could we leverage these technologies

00:05:26.328 --> 00:05:31.393
to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country?

00:05:31.393 --> 00:05:32.691
So we looked at the modem,

00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:35.970
an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.481
and asked ourselves why

00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:40.436
the modems that we are using right now

00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:42.660
are built for a different context, where you've got

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.615
ubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity,

00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:51.652
yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:54.149
We wanted to redesign the modem

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.196
for the developing world, for our context,

00:05:57.196 --> 00:05:59.107
and for our reality.

00:05:59.107 --> 00:06:02.784
What if we could have connectivity with less friction?

00:06:02.784 --> 00:06:06.313
This is the BRCK.

00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:09.217
It acts as a backup to the Internet

00:06:09.217 --> 00:06:12.994
so that, when the power goes out,

00:06:12.994 --> 00:06:19.142
it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.

00:06:19.142 --> 00:06:21.983
Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:24.323
It's actually everywhere.

00:06:24.323 --> 00:06:27.251
Most towns at least have a 3G connection.

00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:30.160
So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.358
The other reason that we built this

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:34.944
is when electricity goes down, this has eight hours

00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:36.958
of battery left, so you can continue working,

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.046
you can continue being productive,

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:43.268
and let's just say you are less stressed.

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:45.598
And for rural areas, it can be

00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:47.701
the primary means of connection.

00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:50.437
The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play

00:06:50.437 --> 00:06:53.496
when we wondered how can we use the cloud

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.438
to be more intelligent so that

00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:57.823
you can analyze the different networks,

00:06:57.823 --> 00:07:00.962
and whenever you switch on the backup,

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.471
you pick on the fastest network,

00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:05.870
so we'll have multi-SIM capability

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.966
so that you can put multiple SIMs,

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:11.380
and if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.729
and if the up time on that is not very good,

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.144
then you hop onto the next one.

00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:20.881
The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.

00:07:20.881 --> 00:07:23.769
With load balancing, this can be possible.

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:27.622
The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors --

00:07:27.622 --> 00:07:31.050
is this idea that you could have an on-ramp

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.977
for the Internet of things.

00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:36.597
Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this.

00:07:36.597 --> 00:07:39.336
It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach

00:07:39.336 --> 00:07:41.106
a satellite module so that you could have

00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:44.631
Internet connectivity even in very remote areas.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.376
Out of adversity can come innovation,

00:07:47.376 --> 00:07:51.415
and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers

00:07:51.415 --> 00:07:55.494
in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?

00:07:55.494 --> 00:07:57.750
And for us, we begin with solving the problem

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.694
in our own backyard in Kenya.

00:08:00.694 --> 00:08:03.094
It is not without challenge.

00:08:03.094 --> 00:08:05.847
Our team has basically been mules carrying components

00:08:05.847 --> 00:08:09.041
from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations

00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:10.969
with customs border agents.

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:12.767
"What are you carrying?"

00:08:12.767 --> 00:08:15.537
And the local financing is not

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:20.888
part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.

00:08:20.888 --> 00:08:23.607
So we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that,

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:25.848
through the support of many people,

00:08:25.848 --> 00:08:27.847
not only here but online,

00:08:27.847 --> 00:08:30.102
the BRCK has been Kickstarted,

00:08:30.102 --> 00:08:34.192
and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins.

00:08:34.192 --> 00:08:37.086
I will close by saying that, if we solve this

00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:39.646
for the local market, it could be impactful

00:08:39.646 --> 00:08:42.096
not only for the coders in Nairobi

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:44.448
but also for small business owners

00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:47.112
who need reliable connectivity,

00:08:47.112 --> 00:08:49.312
and it can reduce the cost of connecting,

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:53.992
and hopefully collaboration within African countries.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:58.964
The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy

00:08:58.964 --> 00:09:02.483
are connectivity and entrepreneurship.

00:09:02.483 --> 00:09:04.923
The BRCK is our part

00:09:04.923 --> 00:09:07.507
to keep Africans connected,

00:09:07.507 --> 00:09:11.291
and to help them drive the global digital revolution.

00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:12.505
Thank you.

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:16.744
(Applause)
