00:00:00.965 --> 00:00:04.468
I was born and raised in North Korea.

00:00:04.468 --> 00:00:09.268
Although my family constantly struggled against poverty,

00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:12.796
I was always loved and cared for first,

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:14.947
because I was the only son

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:18.117
and the youngest of two in the family.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:21.724
But then the great famine began in 1994.

00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:24.183
I was four years old.

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:27.980
My sister and I would go searching for firewood

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.956
starting at 5 in the morning

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:32.762
and come back after midnight.

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:36.650
I would wander the streets searching for food,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.823
and I remember seeing a small child

00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:41.645
tied to a mother's back eating chips,

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.869
and wanting to steal them from him.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.702
Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness.

00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:52.905
For a hungry child, politics and freedom

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:55.657
are not even thought of.

00:00:55.657 --> 00:00:58.345
On my ninth birthday, my parents

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:01.774
couldn't give me any food to eat.

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:05.718
But even as a child, I could feel the heaviness

00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:08.753
in their hearts.

00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:13.953
Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time,

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:17.664
and in 2003, when I was 13 years old,

00:01:17.664 --> 00:01:20.577
my father became one of them.

00:01:20.577 --> 00:01:24.465
I saw my father wither away and die.

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:28.597
In the same year, my mother disappeared one day,

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:30.402
and then my sister told me

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.003
that she was going to China to earn money,

00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:37.198
but that she would return with money and food soon.

00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:40.149
Since we had never been separated,

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.119
and I thought we would be together forever,

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.992
I didn't even give her a hug when she left.

00:01:46.992 --> 00:01:51.205
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life.

00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:52.916
But again, I didn't know

00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:56.404
it was going to be a long goodbye.

00:01:56.404 --> 00:02:01.341
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then.

00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:05.560
Suddenly, I became an orphan and homeless.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.649
My daily life became very hard,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.701
but very simple.

00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:14.724
My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.

00:02:14.724 --> 00:02:17.631
But that is no way to survive.

00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:22.349
I started to realize, begging would not be the solution.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.675
So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets.

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:30.640
Sometimes, I found small jobs

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.970
in exchange for food.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.116
Once, I even spent two months in the winter

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:37.859
working in a coal mine,

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.634
33 meters underground without any protection

00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:47.067
for up to 16 hours a day.

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:49.431
I was not uncommon.

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:56.992
Many other orphans survived this way, or worse.

00:02:56.992 --> 00:03:01.128
When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:02.595
or hunger pains,

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:05.443
I hoped that, the next morning,

00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:08.006
my sister would come back to wake me up

00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:10.276
with my favorite food.

00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:13.426
That hope kept me alive.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.224
I don't mean big, grand hope.

00:03:16.224 --> 00:03:19.346
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:21.809
that the next trash can had bread,

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.942
even though it usually didn't.

00:03:24.942 --> 00:03:28.385
But if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't even try,

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:30.478
and then I would die.

00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:34.416
Hope kept me alive.

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:37.176
Every day, I told myself,

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:39.904
no matter how hard things got,

00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:43.806
still I must live.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:47.936
After three years of waiting for my sister's return,

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:52.288
I decided to go to China to look for her myself.

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:55.148
I realized

00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:58.798
I couldn't survive much longer this way.

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:01.603
I knew the journey would be risky,

00:04:01.603 --> 00:04:04.500
but I would be risking my life either way.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.686
I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea,

00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:12.144
or at least I could try for a better life

00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:15.380
by escaping to China.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.610
I had learned that many people tried to cross

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.397
the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen.

00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:27.355
North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:30.728
trying to cross the border without permission.

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:33.379
Chinese soldiers will catch

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.233
and send back North Koreans,

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:39.573
where they face severe punishment.

00:04:39.573 --> 00:04:42.654
I decided to cross during the day,

00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:48.087
first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark,

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:52.736
second because I knew I was already taking a risk,

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:56.151
and since not many people tried to cross during the day,

00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:57.841
I thought I might be able to cross

00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:01.266
without being seen by anyone.

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:05.174
I made it to China on February 15, 2006.

00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:07.402
I was 16 years old.

00:05:07.402 --> 00:05:10.322
I thought things in China would be easier,

00:05:10.322 --> 00:05:13.595
since there was more food.

00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:16.651
I thought more people would help me.

00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:20.664
But it was harder than living in North Korea,

00:05:20.664 --> 00:05:22.359
because I was not free.

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:25.104
I was always worried about being caught

00:05:25.104 --> 00:05:27.899
and sent back.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.170
By a miracle, some months later,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.613
I met someone who was running

00:05:32.613 --> 00:05:35.955
an underground shelter for North Koreans,

00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:38.563
and was allowed to live there

00:05:38.563 --> 00:05:43.915
and eat regular meals for the first time in many years.

00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:48.396
Later that year, an activist helped me escape China

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:52.617
and go to the United States as a refugee.

00:05:52.617 --> 00:05:55.917
I went to America without knowing a word of English,

00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:00.296
yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school.

00:06:00.296 --> 00:06:04.495
Even in North Korea, I was an F student.

00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:05.879
(Laughter)

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.586
And I barely finished elementary school.

00:06:09.586 --> 00:06:12.890
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.828
Textbooks and the library were not my playground.

00:06:16.828 --> 00:06:20.573
My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying,

00:06:20.573 --> 00:06:23.124
but it didn't work.

00:06:23.124 --> 00:06:26.267
At one point, my father gave up on me.

00:06:26.267 --> 00:06:30.236
He said, "You're not my son anymore."

00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:34.988
I was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.

00:06:34.988 --> 00:06:37.649
But nevertheless, my level of motivation

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:42.356
still didn't change before he died.

00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:45.161
So in America, it was kind of ridiculous

00:06:45.161 --> 00:06:48.188
that they said I should go to high school.

00:06:48.188 --> 00:06:50.612
I didn't even go to middle school.

00:06:50.612 --> 00:06:53.996
I decided to go, just because they told me to,

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:56.404
without trying much.

00:06:56.404 --> 00:06:59.817
But one day, I came home and my foster mother

00:06:59.817 --> 00:07:03.026
had made chicken wings for dinner.

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:06.280
And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.476
but I realized there were not enough for everyone,

00:07:09.476 --> 00:07:12.973
so I decided against it.

00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:15.298
When I looked down at my plate,

00:07:15.298 --> 00:07:20.434
I saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his.

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:22.752
I was so happy.

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:25.015
I looked at him sitting next to me.

00:07:25.015 --> 00:07:28.331
He just looked back at me very warmly,

00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:31.003
but said no words.

00:07:31.003 --> 00:07:35.847
Suddenly I remembered my biological father.

00:07:35.847 --> 00:07:38.820
My foster father's small act of love

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.041
reminded me of my father,

00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:44.041
who would love to share his food with me

00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:48.678
when he was hungry, even if he was starving.

00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:53.010
I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.477
yet my father died of starvation.

00:07:56.477 --> 00:08:00.680
My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.171
and that night I also thought of what else I could do

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:06.387
to honor him.

00:08:06.387 --> 00:08:09.121
And my answer was to promise to myself

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:12.551
that I would study hard and get the best education

00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:16.115
in America to honor his sacrifice.

00:08:16.115 --> 00:08:18.651
I took school seriously,

00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:21.451
and for the first time ever in my life,

00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:25.348
I received an academic award for excellence,

00:08:25.348 --> 00:08:30.962
and made dean's list from the first semester in high school.

00:08:30.962 --> 00:08:38.594
(Applause)

00:08:38.594 --> 00:08:41.324
That chicken wing changed my life.

00:08:41.324 --> 00:08:45.381
(Laughter)

00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:48.973
Hope is personal. Hope is something

00:08:48.973 --> 00:08:51.482
that no one can give to you.

00:08:51.482 --> 00:08:54.402
You have to choose to believe in hope.

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:57.569
You have to make it yourself.

00:08:57.569 --> 00:09:00.809
In North Korea, I made it myself.

00:09:00.809 --> 00:09:03.522
Hope brought me to America.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:06.522
But in America, I didn't know what to do,

00:09:06.522 --> 00:09:11.554
because I had this overwhelming freedom.

00:09:11.554 --> 00:09:15.605
My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction,

00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:19.131
and he motivated me and gave me a purpose

00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:23.058
to live in America.

00:09:23.058 --> 00:09:26.178
I did not come here by myself.

00:09:26.178 --> 00:09:31.132
I had hope, but hope by itself is not enough.

00:09:31.132 --> 00:09:35.286
Many people helped me along the way to get here.

00:09:35.286 --> 00:09:39.274
North Koreans are fighting hard to survive.

00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:42.063
They have to force themselves to survive,

00:09:42.063 --> 00:09:44.818
have hope to survive,

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:49.579
but they cannot make it without help.

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:51.925
This is my message to you.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.634
Have hope for yourself,

00:09:54.634 --> 00:09:57.746
but also help each other.

00:09:57.746 --> 00:10:04.328
Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live.

00:10:04.328 --> 00:10:08.114
My foster father didn't intend to change my life.

00:10:08.114 --> 00:10:12.486
In the same way, you may also change someone's life

00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:17.006
with even the smallest act of love.

00:10:17.006 --> 00:10:22.124
A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger,

00:10:22.124 --> 00:10:25.225
and having the hope will bring you bread

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:27.510
to keep you alive.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.727
But I confidently believe that

00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:34.185
your act of love and caring

00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:37.589
can also save another Joseph's life

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:43.031
and change thousands of other Josephs

00:10:43.031 --> 00:10:47.033
who are still having hope to survive.

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:48.340
Thank you.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:57.438
(Applause)

00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:27.386
Adrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:30.568
that very personal and special story with us.

00:11:30.568 --> 00:11:33.793
I know you haven't seen your sister for, you said,

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.253
it was almost exactly a decade,

00:11:36.253 --> 00:11:38.670
and in the off chance that she may be able to see this,

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.497
we wanted to give you an opportunity

00:11:40.497 --> 00:11:42.725
to send her a message.

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:43.861
Joseph Kim: In Korean?

00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:46.469
AH: You can do English, then Korean as well.

00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:50.377
(Laughter)

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.718
JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean

00:11:52.718 --> 00:11:55.459
because I don't think I can make it

00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:59.115
without tearing up.

00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:03.836
Nuna, it has been already 10 years

00:12:03.836 --> 00:12:10.357
that I haven’t seen you.

00:12:10.357 --> 00:12:13.749
I just wanted to say

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:17.933
that I miss you, and I love you,

00:12:17.933 --> 00:12:22.276
and please come back to me and stay alive.

00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:27.162
And I -- oh, gosh.

00:12:27.162 --> 00:12:31.482
I still haven't given up my hope to see you.

00:12:33.591 --> 00:12:38.253
I will live my life happily

00:12:38.253 --> 00:12:41.572
and study hard

00:12:41.572 --> 00:12:43.649
until I see you,

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:48.228
and I promise I will not cry again.

00:12:48.228 --> 00:12:49.785
(Laughter)

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:52.373
Yes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you,

00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:54.644
and if you can't find me,

00:12:54.644 --> 00:12:57.716
I will also look for you,

00:12:57.716 --> 00:13:00.452
and I hope to see you one day.

00:13:00.452 --> 00:13:03.788
And can I also make a small message to my mom?

00:13:03.788 --> 00:13:05.439
AH: Sure, please.

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:08.228
JK: I haven't spent much time with you,

00:13:08.228 --> 00:13:10.140
but I know that you still love me,

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.084
and you probably still pray for me

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.204
and think about me.

00:13:16.204 --> 00:13:18.356
I just wanted to say thank you

00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:21.890
for letting me be in this world.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.359
Thank you.

00:13:23.359 --> 00:13:28.683
(Applause)
