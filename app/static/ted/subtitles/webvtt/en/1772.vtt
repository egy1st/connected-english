00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:06.216
Writing biography is a strange thing to do.

00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:08.899
It's a journey into the foreign territory

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:12.095
of somebody else's life,

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.768
a journey, an exploration that can take you places

00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:17.039
you never dreamed of going

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.264
and still can't quite believe you've been,

00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:22.992
especially if, like me, you're an agnostic Jew

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:24.817
and the life you've been exploring

00:00:24.817 --> 00:00:29.649
is that of Muhammad.

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.080
Five years ago, for instance,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.348
I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:38.831
to what I knew was an impossible question:

00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:42.049
What actually happened

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:43.488
one desert night,

00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:47.082
half the world and almost half of history away?

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:48.802
What happened, that is,

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:51.120
on the night in the year 610

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.971
when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:59.048
on a mountain just outside Mecca?

00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:03.653
This is the core mystical moment of Islam,

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:05.019
and as such, of course,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.095
it defies empirical analysis.

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:12.200
Yet the question wouldn't let go of me.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.384
I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am,

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:17.263
just asking it could be seen

00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:20.523
as pure chutzpah.

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:23.205
(Laughter)

00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:25.816
And I plead guilty as charged,

00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:29.847
because all exploration, physical or intellectual,

00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:33.724
is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression,

00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:37.121
of crossing boundaries.

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:43.136
Still, some boundaries are larger than others.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:46.056
So a human encountering the divine,

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:49.178
as Muslims believe Muhammad did,

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:52.019
to the rationalist, this is a matter not of fact

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:53.776
but of wishful fiction,

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:57.714
and like all of us, I like to think of myself as rational.

00:01:57.714 --> 00:02:00.598
Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts

00:02:00.598 --> 00:02:02.375
we have of that night,

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:05.194
what struck me even more than what happened

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:10.716
was what did not happen.

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:13.868
Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain

00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:16.818
as though walking on air.

00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:19.292
He did not run down shouting, "Hallelujah!"

00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:21.652
and "Bless the Lord!"

00:02:21.652 --> 00:02:25.380
He did not radiate light and joy.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.959
There were no choirs of angels,

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.259
no music of the spheres, no elation, no ecstasy,

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.921
no golden aura surrounding him,

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:38.063
no sense of an absolute, fore-ordained role

00:02:38.063 --> 00:02:41.139
as the messenger of God.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.094
That is, he did none of the things

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:46.848
that might make it easy to cry foul,

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:51.995
to put down the whole story as a pious fable.

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:54.827
Quite the contrary.

00:02:54.827 --> 00:02:58.572
In his own reported words,

00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:00.949
he was convinced at first

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:06.230
that what had happened couldn't have been real.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.942
At best, he thought, it had to have been a hallucination --

00:03:08.942 --> 00:03:10.751
a trick of the eye or the ear, perhaps,

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.926
or his own mind working against him.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.103
At worst, possession --

00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:17.392
that he'd been seized by an evil jinn,

00:03:17.392 --> 00:03:19.183
a spirit out to deceive him,

00:03:19.183 --> 00:03:22.192
even to crush the life out of him.

00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:25.216
In fact, he was so sure that he could only be majnun,

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:26.844
possessed by a jinn,

00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:28.956
that when he found himself still alive,

00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:33.805
his first impulse was to finish the job himself,

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:36.008
to leap off the highest cliff

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:40.126
and escape the terror of what he'd experienced

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:47.228
by putting an end to all experience.

00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:50.148
So the man who fled down the mountain that night

00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:52.599
trembled not with joy

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.319
but with a stark, primordial fear.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.239
He was overwhelmed not with conviction, but by doubt.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.040
And that panicked disorientation,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.919
that sundering of everything familiar,

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.587
that daunting awareness of something

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:15.512
beyond human comprehension,

00:04:15.512 --> 00:04:22.087
can only be called a terrible awe.

00:04:22.087 --> 00:04:25.301
This might be somewhat difficult to grasp

00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:27.839
now that we use the word "awesome"

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:32.018
to describe a new app or a viral video.

00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:35.223
With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake,

00:04:35.223 --> 00:04:37.871
we're protected from real awe.

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:39.759
We close the doors and hunker down,

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.305
convinced that we're in control,

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:45.327
or, at least, hoping for control.

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:47.235
We do our best to ignore the fact that

00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:49.296
we don't always have it,

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:52.053
and that not everything can be explained.

00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:56.215
Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic,

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:58.910
whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.174
came from inside himself or from outside,

00:05:03.174 --> 00:05:07.878
what's clear is that he did experience them,

00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:10.314
and that he did so with a force that would shatter

00:05:10.314 --> 00:05:12.635
his sense of himself and his world

00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:15.775
and transform this otherwise modest man

00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:22.468
into a radical advocate for social and economic justice.

00:05:22.468 --> 00:05:27.710
Fear was the only sane response,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.734
the only human response.

00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:35.242
Too human for some,

00:05:35.242 --> 00:05:37.975
like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:39.842
the account of his wanting to kill himself

00:05:39.842 --> 00:05:42.280
shouldn't even be mentioned, despite the fact

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.734
that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies.

00:05:46.734 --> 00:05:49.525
They insist that he never doubted

00:05:49.525 --> 00:05:56.135
for even a single moment, let alone despaired.

00:05:56.135 --> 00:05:59.972
Demanding perfection, they refuse to tolerate

00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:04.691
human imperfection.

00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:11.886
Yet what, exactly, is imperfect about doubt?

00:06:11.886 --> 00:06:14.860
As I read those early accounts, I realized it was

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.670
precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.067
that allowed me to begin to see him in full,

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:24.653
to accord him the integrity of reality.

00:06:24.653 --> 00:06:26.822
And the more I thought about it,

00:06:26.822 --> 00:06:29.839
the more it made sense that he doubted,

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:36.422
because doubt is essential to faith.

00:06:36.422 --> 00:06:39.302
If this seems a startling idea at first,

00:06:39.302 --> 00:06:42.963
consider that doubt, as Graham Greene once put it,

00:06:42.963 --> 00:06:46.798
is the heart of the matter.

00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:51.203
Abolish all doubt, and what's left is not faith,

00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:56.446
but absolute, heartless conviction.

00:06:56.446 --> 00:07:00.317
You're certain that you possess the Truth --

00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:04.608
inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T --

00:07:04.608 --> 00:07:07.166
and this certainty quickly devolves

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:10.678
into dogmatism and righteousness,

00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:14.781
by which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride

00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:18.569
in being so very right,

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:26.457
in short, the arrogance of fundamentalism.

00:07:26.457 --> 00:07:30.933
It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:33.991
that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists

00:07:33.991 --> 00:07:37.182
is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists

00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:39.994
known as Crusaders:

00:07:39.994 --> 00:07:45.219
"infidel," from the Latin for "faithless."

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:49.558
Doubly ironic, in this case, because their absolutism

00:07:49.558 --> 00:07:54.023
is in fact the opposite of faith.

00:07:54.023 --> 00:07:59.982
In effect, they are the infidels.

00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:02.809
Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes,

00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:06.654
they have no questions, only answers.

00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:09.446
They found the perfect antidote to thought

00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:13.217
and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith.

00:08:13.217 --> 00:08:15.166
They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob

00:08:15.166 --> 00:08:17.216
wrestling through the night with the angel,

00:08:17.216 --> 00:08:20.374
or like Jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness,

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:23.576
or like Muhammad, not only that night on the mountain,

00:08:23.576 --> 00:08:26.070
but throughout his years as a prophet,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.254
with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair,

00:08:30.254 --> 00:08:33.542
and condemning those who most loudly proclaim

00:08:33.542 --> 00:08:37.339
that they know everything there is to know

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:44.233
and that they and they alone are right.

00:08:44.233 --> 00:08:51.646
And yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority,

00:08:51.646 --> 00:08:57.415
have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority.

00:08:57.415 --> 00:08:59.908
We've allowed Judaism to be claimed

00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:03.779
by violently messianic West Bank settlers,

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.726
Christianity by homophobic hypocrites

00:09:06.726 --> 00:09:09.246
and misogynistic bigots,

00:09:09.246 --> 00:09:14.205
Islam by suicide bombers.

00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:16.976
And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that

00:09:16.976 --> 00:09:19.168
no matter whether they claim to be Christians,

00:09:19.168 --> 00:09:20.783
Jews or Muslims,

00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:26.438
militant extremists are none of the above.

00:09:26.438 --> 00:09:32.052
They're a cult all their own, blood brothers

00:09:32.052 --> 00:09:37.546
steeped in other people's blood.

00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:39.748
This isn't faith.

00:09:39.748 --> 00:09:44.910
It's fanaticism, and we have to stop confusing the two.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.932
We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers.

00:09:49.932 --> 00:09:54.010
It's difficult and stubborn.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.248
It involves an ongoing struggle,

00:09:56.248 --> 00:09:59.302
a continual questioning of what we think we know,

00:09:59.302 --> 00:10:01.867
a wrestling with issues and ideas.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:05.167
It goes hand in hand with doubt,

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:08.244
in a never-ending conversation with it,

00:10:08.244 --> 00:10:14.639
and sometimes in conscious defiance of it.

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:19.687
And this conscious defiance is why I, as an agnostic,

00:10:19.687 --> 00:10:23.828
can still have faith.

00:10:23.828 --> 00:10:26.816
I have faith, for instance, that peace in the Middle East

00:10:26.816 --> 00:10:31.126
is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence

00:10:31.126 --> 00:10:34.287
to the contrary.

00:10:34.287 --> 00:10:36.659
I'm not convinced of this.

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:38.783
I can hardly say I believe it.

00:10:38.783 --> 00:10:40.725
I can only have faith in it,

00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:44.743
commit myself, that is, to the idea of it,

00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:47.744
and I do this precisely because of the temptation

00:10:47.744 --> 00:10:49.744
to throw up my hands in resignation

00:10:49.744 --> 00:10:53.265
and retreat into silence.

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:57.946
Because despair is self-fulfilling.

00:10:57.946 --> 00:11:00.266
If we call something impossible,

00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:04.034
we act in such a way that we make it so.

00:11:04.034 --> 00:11:09.967
And I, for one, refuse to live that way.

00:11:09.967 --> 00:11:12.266
In fact, most of us do,

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:15.842
whether we're atheist or theist

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:19.782
or anywhere in between or beyond, for that matter,

00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:24.098
what drives us is that, despite our doubts

00:11:24.098 --> 00:11:26.426
and even because of our doubts,

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:30.898
we reject the nihilism of despair.

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:34.131
We insist on faith in the future

00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:38.869
and in each other.

00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:42.370
Call this naive if you like.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.467
Call it impossibly idealistic if you must.

00:11:45.467 --> 00:11:47.895
But one thing is sure:

00:11:47.895 --> 00:11:51.361
Call it human.

00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:54.396
Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world

00:11:54.396 --> 00:11:57.248
without such faith, without the refusal

00:11:57.248 --> 00:12:01.964
to cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty?

00:12:01.964 --> 00:12:05.230
I think not.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.273
After keeping company with him as a writer

00:12:07.273 --> 00:12:10.573
for the past five years, I can't see

00:12:10.573 --> 00:12:15.676
that he'd be anything but utterly outraged

00:12:15.676 --> 00:12:18.823
at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak

00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:24.292
and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today.

00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:28.582
He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:31.580
because of their gender.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:39.561
He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.

00:12:39.561 --> 00:12:42.267
He'd call out terrorism for what it is,

00:12:42.267 --> 00:12:47.011
not only criminal but an obscene travesty

00:12:47.011 --> 00:12:51.916
of everything he believed in and struggled for.

00:12:51.916 --> 00:12:57.185
He'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life

00:12:57.185 --> 00:13:00.386
takes the life of all humanity.

00:13:00.386 --> 00:13:07.582
Anyone who saves a life, saves the life of all humanity.

00:13:07.582 --> 00:13:10.652
And he'd commit himself fully

00:13:10.652 --> 00:13:17.672
to the hard and thorny process of making peace.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.107
Thank you.

00:13:19.107 --> 00:13:23.506
(Applause)

00:13:23.506 --> 00:13:27.506
Thank you. (Applause)
