00:00:01.268 --> 00:00:04.829
In the northwest corner
of the United States,

00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:07.703
right up near the Canadian border,

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:11.529
there's a little town
called Libby, Montana,

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:16.014
and it's surrounded
by pine trees and lakes

00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:20.737
and just amazing wildlife

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:26.075
and these enormous trees
that scream up into the sky.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.594
And in there is a little town
called Libby,

00:00:29.618 --> 00:00:33.939
which I visited, which feels
kind of lonely,

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:36.336
a little isolated.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.988
And in Libby, Montana,
there's a rather unusual woman

00:00:40.012 --> 00:00:42.015
named Gayla Benefield.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.378
She always felt a little bit
of an outsider,

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:46.942
although she's been there
almost all her life,

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.390
a woman of Russian extraction.

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:51.129
She told me when she went to school,

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:52.902
she was the only girl who ever chose

00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:56.150
to do mechanical drawing.

00:00:56.174 --> 00:01:00.048
Later in life, she got
a job going house to house

00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:04.158
reading utility meters -- gas
meters, electricity meters.

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:07.158
And she was doing the work
in the middle of the day,

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:10.585
and one thing particularly
caught her notice, which was,

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.691
in the middle of the day
she met a lot of men

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:19.081
who were at home, middle
aged, late middle aged,

00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:24.524
and a lot of them seemed
to be on oxygen tanks.

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:27.287
It struck her as strange.

00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:30.898
Then, a few years later, her
father died at the age of 59,

00:01:30.922 --> 00:01:34.828
five days before he was due
to receive his pension.

00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:35.916
He'd been a miner.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.358
She thought he must just have
been worn out by the work.

00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:45.090
But then a few years
later, her mother died,

00:01:45.114 --> 00:01:48.107
and that seemed stranger still,

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.941
because her mother came
from a long line of people

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.802
who just seemed to live forever.

00:01:54.826 --> 00:01:58.371
In fact, Gayla's uncle
is still alive to this day,

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:00.545
and learning how to waltz.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.980
It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:06.434
should die so young.

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:10.678
It was an anomaly, and she kept
puzzling over anomalies.

00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:12.734
And as she did, other ones came to mind.

00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:14.462
She remembered, for example,

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:17.561
when her mother had broken a leg
and went into the hospital,

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:19.336
and she had a lot of x-rays,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.291
and two of them were leg
x-rays, which made sense,

00:02:22.315 --> 00:02:27.101
but six of them were chest
x-rays, which didn't.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:30.083
She puzzled and puzzled over every piece

00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:32.459
of her life and her parents' life,

00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:36.460
trying to understand what she was seeing.

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:38.171
She thought about her town.

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:41.159
The town had a vermiculite mine in it.

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:43.992
Vermiculite was used
for soil conditioners,

00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:47.272
to make plants grow faster and better.

00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:50.330
Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts,

00:02:50.354 --> 00:02:52.977
huge amounts of it put under the roof

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.828
to keep houses warm
during the long Montana winters.

00:02:56.852 --> 00:02:59.195
Vermiculite was in the playground.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.648
It was in the football ground.

00:03:00.672 --> 00:03:03.081
It was in the skating rink.

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:06.910
What she didn't learn until she started
working this problem

00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:13.995
is vermiculite is a very
toxic form of asbestos.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.774
When she figured out the puzzle,

00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:18.680
she started telling everyone she could

00:03:18.704 --> 00:03:21.347
what had happened, what had
been done to her parents

00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:24.417
and to the people
that she saw on oxygen tanks

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:27.578
at home in the afternoons.

00:03:27.602 --> 00:03:28.979
But she was really amazed.

00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:32.051
She thought, when everybody knows,
they'll want to do something,

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:34.273
but actually nobody wanted to know.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.388
In fact, she became so annoying

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:38.825
as she kept insisting
on telling this story

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.040
to her neighbors, to her friends,
to other people in the community,

00:03:42.064 --> 00:03:44.160
that eventually a bunch
of them got together

00:03:44.184 --> 00:03:45.668
and they made a bumper sticker,

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.936
which they proudly displayed
on their cars, which said,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.082
"Yes, I'm from Libby, Montana,

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:56.622
and no, I don't have asbestosis."

00:03:56.646 --> 00:04:00.002
But Gayla didn't stop.
She kept doing research.

00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:03.193
The advent of the Internet
definitely helped her.

00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:05.213
She talked to anybody she could.

00:04:05.237 --> 00:04:08.488
She argued and argued,
and finally she struck lucky

00:04:08.512 --> 00:04:10.688
when a researcher came through town

00:04:10.712 --> 00:04:13.122
studying the history of mines in the area,

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:16.264
and she told him her story,
and at first, of course,

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:18.535
like everyone, he didn't believe her,

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.178
but he went back to Seattle
and he did his own research

00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:25.338
and he realized that she was right.

00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:29.400
So now she had an ally.

00:04:29.424 --> 00:04:31.990
Nevertheless, people still
didn't want to know.

00:04:32.014 --> 00:04:35.714
They said things like, "Well,
if it were really dangerous,

00:04:35.738 --> 00:04:38.747
someone would have told us."

00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:41.769
"If that's really why everyone was dying,

00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:46.345
the doctors would have told us."

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.721
Some of the guys used
to very heavy jobs said,

00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:51.532
"I don't want to be a victim.

00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:53.550
I can't possibly be a victim, and anyway,

00:04:53.574 --> 00:05:00.483
every industry has its accidents."

00:05:00.507 --> 00:05:04.289
But still Gayla went on,
and finally she succeeded

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:06.901
in getting a federal
agency to come to town

00:05:06.925 --> 00:05:11.189
and to screen the inhabitants
of the town --

00:05:11.213 --> 00:05:15.917
15,000 people -- and what they discovered

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.336
was that the town had a mortality rate

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.394
80 times higher than anywhere
in the United States.

00:05:25.418 --> 00:05:29.410
That was in 2002, and even at that moment,

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:33.100
no one raised their hand to say, "Gayla,

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:37.415
look in the playground where
your grandchildren are playing.

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.119
It's lined with vermiculite."

00:05:42.143 --> 00:05:45.186
This wasn't ignorance.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.955
It was willful blindness.

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.434
Willful blindness is a legal
concept which means,

00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:54.411
if there's information that you
could know and you should know

00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:57.838
but you somehow manage not to know,

00:05:57.862 --> 00:06:00.584
the law deems that you're willfully blind.

00:06:00.608 --> 00:06:04.359
You have chosen not to know.

00:06:04.383 --> 00:06:08.758
There's a lot of willful
blindness around these days.

00:06:08.782 --> 00:06:11.609
You can see willful blindness in banks,

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.666
when thousands of people
sold mortgages to people

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.374
who couldn't afford them.

00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:18.032
You could see them in banks

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:20.196
when interest rates were manipulated

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.608
and everyone around knew
what was going on,

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.782
but everyone studiously ignored it.

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:29.206
You can see willful blindness
in the Catholic Church,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.827
where decades of child abuse went ignored.

00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:36.122
You could see willful blindness

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:40.633
in the run-up to the Iraq War.

00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:44.272
Willful blindness exists
on epic scales like those,

00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:47.167
and it also exists on very small scales,

00:06:47.191 --> 00:06:51.095
in people's families,
in people's homes and communities,

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:56.573
and particularly in organizations
and institutions.

00:06:56.597 --> 00:07:00.815
Companies that have been studied
for willful blindness

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.098
can be asked questions like,

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.924
"Are there issues at work

00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:09.354
that people are afraid to raise?"

00:07:09.378 --> 00:07:11.569
And when academics have
done studies like this

00:07:11.593 --> 00:07:13.866
of corporations in the United States,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.114
what they find is 85
percent of people say yes.

00:07:19.138 --> 00:07:22.122
Eighty-five percent of people
know there's a problem,

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:24.197
but they won't say anything.

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.584
And when I duplicated
the research in Europe,

00:07:27.608 --> 00:07:30.246
asking all the same questions,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.336
I found exactly the same number.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.387
Eighty-five percent.
That's a lot of silence.

00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:39.469
It's a lot of blindness.

00:07:39.493 --> 00:07:43.113
And what's really interesting is that when
I go to companies in Switzerland,

00:07:43.137 --> 00:07:46.531
they tell me, "This
is a uniquely Swiss problem."

00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:50.731
And when I go to Germany, they say,
"Oh yes, this is the German disease."

00:07:50.755 --> 00:07:53.041
And when I go to companies
in England, they say,

00:07:53.065 --> 00:07:56.780
"Oh, yeah, the British
are really bad at this."

00:07:56.804 --> 00:08:01.450
And the truth is, this is a human problem.

00:08:01.474 --> 00:08:07.815
We're all, under certain
circumstances, willfully blind.

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:10.363
What the research shows
is that some people are blind

00:08:10.387 --> 00:08:13.968
out of fear. They're
afraid of retaliation.

00:08:13.992 --> 00:08:17.343
And some people are blind
because they think, well,

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:19.761
seeing anything is just futile.

00:08:19.785 --> 00:08:21.617
Nothing's ever going to change.

00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:24.431
If we make a protest, if we protest
against the Iraq War,

00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:26.201
nothing changes, so why bother?

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:30.743
Better not to see this stuff at all.

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:33.741
And the recurrent theme
that I encounter all the time

00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:36.221
is people say, "Well, you know,

00:08:36.245 --> 00:08:39.721
the people who do see,
they're whistleblowers,

00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:42.345
and we all know what happens to them."

00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:46.394
So there's this profound
mythology around whistleblowers

00:08:46.418 --> 00:08:50.707
which says, first of all,
they're all crazy.

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:53.020
But what I've found going around the world

00:08:53.044 --> 00:08:56.207
and talking to whistleblowers
is, actually,

00:08:56.231 --> 00:09:00.962
they're very loyal and quite
often very conservative people.

00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:04.867
They're hugely dedicated
to the institutions that they work for,

00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:07.174
and the reason that they speak up,

00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:10.056
the reason they insist on seeing,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.553
is because they care so
much about the institution

00:09:13.577 --> 00:09:17.139
and want to keep it healthy.

00:09:17.163 --> 00:09:19.302
And the other thing that people often say

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:22.530
about whistleblowers is,
"Well, there's no point,

00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:25.099
because you see what happens to them.

00:09:25.123 --> 00:09:26.413
They are crushed.

00:09:26.437 --> 00:09:30.155
Nobody would want to go
through something like that."

00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:33.482
And yet, when I talk to whistleblowers,

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:38.642
the recurrent tone that I hear is pride.

00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:41.027
I think of Joe Darby.

00:09:41.051 --> 00:09:44.479
We all remember the photographs
of Abu Ghraib,

00:09:44.503 --> 00:09:48.201
which so shocked the world
and showed the kind of war

00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:50.865
that was being fought in Iraq.

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:53.876
But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.372
the very obedient, good soldier

00:09:57.396 --> 00:10:02.135
who found those photographs
and handed them in.

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:05.853
And he said, "You know,
I'm not the kind of guy

00:10:05.877 --> 00:10:10.079
to rat people out, but some things
just cross the line.

00:10:10.103 --> 00:10:12.175
Ignorance is bliss, they say,

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:15.903
but you can't put
up with things like this."

00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:18.938
I talked to Steve Bolsin,
a British doctor,

00:10:18.962 --> 00:10:23.244
who fought for five years
to draw attention

00:10:23.268 --> 00:10:28.267
to a dangerous surgeon
who was killing babies.

00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:30.339
And I asked him why
he did it, and he said,

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:34.425
"Well, it was really my daughter
who prompted me to do it.

00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:36.689
She came up to me one night,
and she just said,

00:10:36.713 --> 00:10:40.118
'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'"

00:10:40.142 --> 00:10:42.869
Or I think of Cynthia Thomas,

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:46.854
a really loyal army
daughter and army wife,

00:10:46.878 --> 00:10:49.806
who, as she saw her friends and relations

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.108
coming back from the Iraq
War, was so shocked

00:10:54.132 --> 00:10:55.996
by their mental condition

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.027
and the refusal of the military
to recognize and acknowledge

00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:02.691
post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:11:02.715 --> 00:11:08.299
that she set up a cafe
in the middle of a military town

00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:13.929
to give them legal, psychological
and medical assistance.

00:11:13.953 --> 00:11:16.869
And she said to me, she said,
"You know, Margaret,

00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:20.662
I always used to say I didn't
know what I wanted to be

00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:22.950
when I grow up.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:27.443
But I've found myself in this cause,

00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:32.460
and I'll never be the same."

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:35.756
We all enjoy so many freedoms today,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.712
hard-won freedoms:

00:11:37.736 --> 00:11:41.180
the freedom to write and publish
without fear of censorship,

00:11:41.204 --> 00:11:44.955
a freedom that wasn't here
the last time I came to Hungary;

00:11:44.979 --> 00:11:47.441
a freedom to vote,
which women in particular

00:11:47.465 --> 00:11:49.920
had to fight so hard for;

00:11:49.944 --> 00:11:52.802
the freedom for people of different
ethnicities and cultures

00:11:52.826 --> 00:11:57.758
and sexual orientation to live
the way that they want.

00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:02.592
But freedom doesn't exist
if you don't use it,

00:12:02.616 --> 00:12:04.933
and what whistleblowers do,

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:07.500
and what people like Gayla Benefield do

00:12:07.524 --> 00:12:12.106
is they use the freedom that they have.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.588
And what they're very
prepared to do is recognize

00:12:15.612 --> 00:12:18.218
that yes, this is going to be an argument,

00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:21.210
and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows

00:12:21.234 --> 00:12:25.199
with my neighbors
and my colleagues and my friends,

00:12:25.223 --> 00:12:28.421
but I'm going to become
very good at this conflict.

00:12:28.445 --> 00:12:30.764
I'm going to take on the naysayers,

00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:35.684
because they'll make my argument
better and stronger.

00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:38.116
I can collaborate with my opponents

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.598
to become better at what I do.

00:12:42.622 --> 00:12:45.420
These are people of immense persistence,

00:12:45.444 --> 00:12:50.323
incredible patience,
and an absolute determination

00:12:50.347 --> 00:12:55.794
not to be blind and not to be silent.

00:12:55.818 --> 00:12:58.987
When I went to Libby, Montana,

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:02.348
I visited the asbestosis clinic

00:13:02.372 --> 00:13:06.269
that Gayla Benefield brought into being,

00:13:06.293 --> 00:13:09.149
a place where at first some of the people

00:13:09.173 --> 00:13:12.391
who wanted help and needed
medical attention

00:13:12.415 --> 00:13:15.021
went in the back door

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.506
because they didn't want to acknowledge

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.951
that she'd been right.

00:13:19.975 --> 00:13:23.124
I sat in a diner, and I watched

00:13:23.148 --> 00:13:27.152
as trucks drove up and down the highway,

00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:31.406
carting away the earth out of gardens

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:38.318
and replacing it with fresh,
uncontaminated soil.

00:13:38.342 --> 00:13:40.578
I took my 12-year-old daughter with me,

00:13:40.602 --> 00:13:43.965
because I really wanted her to meet Gayla.

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:46.881
And she said, "Why? What's the big deal?"

00:13:46.905 --> 00:13:49.066
I said, "She's not a movie star,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.353
and she's not a celebrity,
and she's not an expert,

00:13:53.377 --> 00:13:56.091
and Gayla's the first person who'd say

00:13:56.115 --> 00:13:59.035
she's not a saint.

00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:02.175
The really important thing about Gayla

00:14:02.199 --> 00:14:04.842
is she is ordinary.

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:09.668
She's like you, and she's like me.

00:14:09.692 --> 00:14:15.631
She had freedom,
and she was ready to use it."

00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:17.130
Thank you very much.

00:14:17.154 --> 00:14:21.878
(Applause)
