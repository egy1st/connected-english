WEBVTT

00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:01.824
I'll never forget that day

00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:05.723
back in the spring of 2006.

00:00:05.723 --> 00:00:07.302
I was a surgical resident

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:09.733
at The Johns Hopkins Hospital,

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.510
taking emergency call.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.873
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:16.900
to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.694
on her foot.

00:00:18.694 --> 00:00:22.395
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:26.022
as I pulled the curtain back to see her.

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:28.367
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.719
and she needed to be in the hospital.

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.319
That wasn't being asked.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.461
The question that was being asked of me was a different one,

00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:37.390
which was, did she also need an amputation?

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.357
Now, looking back on that night,

00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:45.522
I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:48.658
on that night with the same empathy and compassion

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:52.893
I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed

00:00:52.893 --> 00:00:54.838
who came to the E.R. three nights earlier

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:56.452
with lower back pain

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:00.701
that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:02.864
In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do

00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:04.632
that was actually going to save her life.

00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:06.681
The cancer was too advanced.

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:09.361
But I was committed to making sure that

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.784
I could do anything possible to make her stay

00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:14.207
more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.927
and a cup of a coffee.

00:01:16.927 --> 00:01:19.112
I brought some for her parents.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:22.258
But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,

00:01:22.258 --> 00:01:24.155
because obviously she had done nothing

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:26.329
to bring this on herself.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.142
So why was it that, just a few nights later,

00:01:29.142 --> 00:01:32.300
as I stood in that same E.R. and determined

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.711
that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,

00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:39.615
why did I hold her in such bitter contempt?

00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:42.080
You see, unlike the woman the night before,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.479
this woman had type 2 diabetes.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.031
She was fat.

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:47.944
And we all know that's from eating too much

00:01:47.944 --> 00:01:50.299
and not exercising enough, right?

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.983
I mean, how hard can it be?

00:01:52.983 --> 00:01:55.344
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:58.232
if you just tried caring even a little bit,

00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:01.222
you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment

00:02:01.222 --> 00:02:02.999
with some doctor you've never met

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.814
about to amputate your foot.

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:10.456
Why did I feel justified in judging her?

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:13.025
I'd like to say I don't know.

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.061
But I actually do.

00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:17.392
You see, in the hubris of my youth,

00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:20.496
I thought I had her all figured out.

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:22.326
She ate too much. She got unlucky.

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:25.695
She got diabetes. Case closed.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:27.098
Ironically, at that time in my life,

00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:29.496
I was also doing cancer research,

00:02:29.496 --> 00:02:31.839
immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific,

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.812
and in that world I was actually taught to question everything,

00:02:35.812 --> 00:02:37.848
to challenge all assumptions

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:41.658
and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.

00:02:41.658 --> 00:02:45.034
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes

00:02:45.034 --> 00:02:48.583
that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma,

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:52.011
I never once questioned the conventional wisdom.

00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:55.057
I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events

00:02:55.057 --> 00:02:57.642
was settled science.

00:02:57.642 --> 00:03:01.042
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:03.642
But this time, I was the patient.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:07.473
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day,

00:03:07.473 --> 00:03:10.038
and following the food pyramid to the letter,

00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:12.195
I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something

00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:14.480
called metabolic syndrome.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.464
Some of you may have heard of this.

00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:19.909
I had become insulin-resistant.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.358
You can think of insulin as this master hormone

00:03:22.358 --> 00:03:26.421
that controls what our body does with the foods we eat,

00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:28.535
whether we burn it or store it.

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.349
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.525
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.

00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:37.181
And insulin resistance, as its name suggests,

00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.861
is when your cells get increasingly resistant

00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:43.374
to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.

00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:45.550
Once you're insulin-resistant,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.925
you're on your way to getting diabetes,

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:48.989
which is what happens when your pancreas

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.312
can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.

00:03:52.312 --> 00:03:54.940
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.572
and an entire cascade of pathologic events

00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:01.273
sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:04.882
cancer, even Alzheimer's disease,

00:04:04.882 --> 00:04:09.764
and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:12.725
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically,

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:14.902
adding and subtracting things most of you would find

00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:17.982
almost assuredly shocking.

00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:21.861
I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.902
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.

00:04:24.902 --> 00:04:27.069
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.113
But most important, I was left

00:04:29.113 --> 00:04:32.962
with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away:

00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:35.411
How did this happen to me if I was supposedly

00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:38.108
doing everything right?

00:04:38.108 --> 00:04:41.143
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me,

00:04:41.143 --> 00:04:44.930
was it possible it was failing someone else?

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.830
And underlying these questions,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.076
I became almost maniacally obsessed

00:04:50.076 --> 00:04:52.803
in trying to understand the real relationship

00:04:52.803 --> 00:04:56.433
between obesity and insulin resistance.

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:59.249
Now, most researchers believe obesity

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.641
is the cause of insulin resistance.

00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:04.756
Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,

00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:06.648
you get people to lose weight, right?

00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:09.412
You treat the obesity.

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:12.118
But what if we have it backwards?

00:05:12.118 --> 00:05:15.489
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:19.409
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem,

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.231
the tip of a proverbial iceberg?

00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:24.874
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:28.093
of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:31.307
What if obesity is a coping mechanism

00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:34.909
for a far more sinister problem going on

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.391
underneath the cell?

00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:38.757
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign,

00:05:38.757 --> 00:05:41.060
but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.771
of two metabolic evils.

00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:46.790
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.777
of our cells to partition fuel,

00:05:48.777 --> 00:05:51.068
as I alluded to a moment ago,

00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:52.990
taking those calories that we take in

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.429
and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:58.071
When we become insulin-resistant,

00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:01.438
the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.

00:06:01.438 --> 00:06:03.566
So now, when insulin says to a cell,

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:05.611
I want you to burn more energy

00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:08.046
than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,

00:06:08.046 --> 00:06:12.478
"No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."

00:06:12.478 --> 00:06:14.380
And because fat cells are actually missing most of

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.182
the complex cellular machinery found in other cells,

00:06:17.182 --> 00:06:19.953
it's probably the safest place to store it.

00:06:19.953 --> 00:06:24.922
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans,

00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:28.537
the appropriate response to insulin resistance

00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:33.466
may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,

00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:38.810
getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.985
This is a really subtle distinction,

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:44.352
but the implication could be profound.

00:06:44.352 --> 00:06:46.850
Consider the following analogy:

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.819
Think of the bruise you get on your shin

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.411
when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.

00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:56.298
Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly

00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:59.279
don't like the discolored look, but we all know

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.732
the bruise per Se is not the problem.

00:07:02.732 --> 00:07:06.474
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma,

00:07:06.474 --> 00:07:09.235
all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury

00:07:09.235 --> 00:07:12.219
to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.917
of infection to elsewhere in the body.

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:18.639
Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.507
and we evolved a giant medical establishment

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.647
and a culture around treating bruises:

00:07:24.647 --> 00:07:27.930
masking creams, painkillers, you name it,

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.156
all the while ignoring the fact that people

00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:33.776
are still banging their shins into coffee tables.

00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:36.979
How much better would we be if we treated the cause --

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:38.544
telling people to pay attention

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.147
when they walk through the living room --

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:43.420
rather than the effect?

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.297
Getting the cause and the effect right

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:47.776
makes all the difference in the world.

00:07:47.776 --> 00:07:50.855
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry

00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:53.535
can still do very well for its shareholders

00:07:53.535 --> 00:07:57.451
but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.

00:07:57.451 --> 00:08:00.295
Cause and effect.

00:08:00.295 --> 00:08:02.132
So what I'm suggesting is

00:08:02.132 --> 00:08:04.889
maybe we have the cause and effect wrong

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:07.523
on obesity and insulin resistance.

00:08:07.523 --> 00:08:09.300
Maybe we should be asking ourselves,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.185
is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:15.251
and the diseases associated with obesity,

00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:16.781
at least in most people?

00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:19.781
What if being obese is just a metabolic response

00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:22.002
to something much more threatening,

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.213
an underlying epidemic,

00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:26.770
the one we ought to be worried about?

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.242
Let's look at some suggestive facts.

00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:30.728
We know that 30 million obese Americans

00:08:30.728 --> 00:08:33.701
in the United States don't have insulin resistance.

00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.638
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any

00:08:35.638 --> 00:08:38.718
greater risk of disease than lean people.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:41.602
Conversely, we know that six million lean people

00:08:41.602 --> 00:08:45.039
in the United States are insulin-resistant,

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:48.106
and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk

00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:50.261
for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago

00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:52.083
than their obese counterparts.

00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:54.320
Now I don't know why, but it might be because,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.010
in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.295
the right thing to do with that excess energy.

00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:03.614
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,

00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:05.485
and you can be lean and have it,

00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:09.918
this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy

00:09:09.918 --> 00:09:12.942
for what's going on.

00:09:12.942 --> 00:09:15.357
So what if we're fighting the wrong war,

00:09:15.357 --> 00:09:19.157
fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:22.400
Even worse, what if blaming the obese

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.125
means we're blaming the victims?

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:28.844
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity

00:09:28.844 --> 00:09:30.702
are just wrong?

00:09:30.702 --> 00:09:34.825
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,

00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:37.408
let alone the luxury of certainty.

00:09:37.408 --> 00:09:40.254
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,

00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:42.166
but I'm wide open to others.

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:44.885
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.502
is this.

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:49.631
If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.358
when it becomes insulin resistant,

00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:54.033
the answer probably isn't too much food.

00:09:54.033 --> 00:09:57.683
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.

00:09:57.683 --> 00:09:59.977
Now, we know that refined grains and starches

00:09:59.977 --> 00:10:02.033
elevate your blood sugar in the short run,

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:03.941
and there's even reason to believe that sugar

00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:06.742
may lead to insulin resistance directly.

00:10:06.742 --> 00:10:10.837
So if you put these physiological processes to work,

00:10:10.837 --> 00:10:14.310
I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.173
of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving

00:10:17.173 --> 00:10:21.824
this epidemic of obesity and diabetes,

00:10:21.824 --> 00:10:23.662
but through insulin resistance,

00:10:23.662 --> 00:10:27.574
you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.

00:10:27.574 --> 00:10:30.159
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:32.759
I did it simply by restricting those things,

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:36.215
which admittedly suggests I have a bias

00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:38.576
based on my personal experience.

00:10:38.576 --> 00:10:41.231
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong,

00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:45.184
and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.

00:10:45.184 --> 00:10:48.291
But step one is accepting the possibility

00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:50.663
that our current beliefs about obesity,

00:10:50.663 --> 00:10:53.669
diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:56.544
and therefore must be tested.

00:10:56.544 --> 00:10:58.935
I'm betting my career on this.

00:10:58.935 --> 00:11:03.060
Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.233
and I'll go wherever the science takes me.

00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:09.764
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore

00:11:09.764 --> 00:11:12.808
is pretend I have the answers when I don't.

00:11:12.808 --> 00:11:16.916
I've been humbled enough by all I don't know.

00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:19.073
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough

00:11:19.073 --> 00:11:22.486
to work on this problem with the most amazing team

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:25.890
of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.195
and the best part is,

00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:31.094
just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals,

00:11:31.094 --> 00:11:32.590
we've done the same thing.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.853
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals,

00:11:35.853 --> 00:11:39.298
the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:40.912
for what's at the heart of this epidemic.

00:11:40.912 --> 00:11:43.293
Some think it's too many calories consumed.

00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:45.672
Others think it's too much dietary fat.

00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:49.142
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches.

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:51.750
But this team of multi-disciplinary,

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.734
highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers

00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:57.022
do agree on two things.

00:11:57.022 --> 00:12:00.671
First, this problem is just simply too important

00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:03.414
to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.

00:12:03.414 --> 00:12:06.198
And two, if we're willing to be wrong,

00:12:06.198 --> 00:12:08.735
if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom

00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:11.798
with the best experiments science can offer,

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:14.103
we can solve this problem.

00:12:14.103 --> 00:12:17.158
I know it's tempting to want an answer right now,

00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:21.655
some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription --

00:12:21.655 --> 00:12:23.384
eat this, not that —

00:12:23.384 --> 00:12:25.064
but if we want to get it right,

00:12:25.064 --> 00:12:27.298
we're going to have to do much more rigorous science

00:12:27.298 --> 00:12:30.151
before we can write that prescription.

00:12:30.151 --> 00:12:32.750
Briefly, to address this, our research program

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.993
is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.

00:12:35.993 --> 00:12:38.888
First, how do the various foods we consume

00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:41.689
impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,

00:12:41.689 --> 00:12:44.507
and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?

00:12:44.507 --> 00:12:46.757
Second, based on these insights,

00:12:46.757 --> 00:12:49.716
can people make the necessary changes in their diets

00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:53.447
in a way that's safe and practical to implement?

00:12:53.447 --> 00:12:56.456
And finally, once we identify what safe

00:12:56.456 --> 00:12:59.484
and practical changes people can make to their diet,

00:12:59.484 --> 00:13:03.159
how can we move their behavior in that direction

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:05.412
so that it becomes more the default

00:13:05.412 --> 00:13:07.268
rather than the exception?

00:13:07.268 --> 00:13:09.688
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:11.197
you're always going to do it.

00:13:11.197 --> 00:13:13.325
Sometimes we have to put cues around people

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.628
to make it easier, and believe it or not,

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:19.269
that can be studied scientifically.

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:21.853
I don't know how this journey is going to end,

00:13:21.853 --> 00:13:26.066
but this much seems clear to me, at least:

00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:31.062
We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients

00:13:31.062 --> 00:13:33.974
like I did.

00:13:33.974 --> 00:13:36.253
Most of them actually want to do the right thing,

00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:39.622
but they have to know what that is,

00:13:39.622 --> 00:13:42.668
and it's got to work.

00:13:42.668 --> 00:13:47.364
I dream of a day when our patients can

00:13:47.364 --> 00:13:49.099
shed their excess pounds

00:13:49.099 --> 00:13:51.912
and cure themselves of insulin resistance,

00:13:51.912 --> 00:13:54.642
because as medical professionals,

00:13:54.642 --> 00:13:56.612
we've shed our excess mental baggage

00:13:56.612 --> 00:13:59.938
and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently

00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:03.028
to go back to our original ideals:

00:14:03.028 --> 00:14:07.445
open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas

00:14:07.445 --> 00:14:10.773
when they don't appear to be working,

00:14:10.773 --> 00:14:13.892
and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final,

00:14:13.892 --> 00:14:16.640
but constantly evolving.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.932
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients

00:14:19.932 --> 00:14:23.180
and better for science.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.174
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy

00:14:26.174 --> 00:14:28.100
for metabolic illness,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.397
what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?

00:14:33.397 --> 00:14:37.941
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.

00:14:37.941 --> 00:14:40.254
seven years ago.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:43.878
I wish I could speak with that woman again.

00:14:43.878 --> 00:14:47.133
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.

00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:50.020
I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.680
the best clinical care I could,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.577
but as a human being,

00:14:57.577 --> 00:14:59.985
I let you down.

00:14:59.985 --> 00:15:04.230
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.728
You needed my empathy and compassion,

00:15:08.728 --> 00:15:10.723
and above all else, you needed a doctor

00:15:10.723 --> 00:15:13.352
who was willing to consider

00:15:13.352 --> 00:15:16.416
maybe you didn't let the system down.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.634
Maybe the system, of which I was a part,

00:15:19.634 --> 00:15:22.073
was letting you down.

00:15:22.073 --> 00:15:24.874
If you're watching this now,

00:15:24.874 --> 00:15:29.112
I hope you can forgive me.

00:15:29.112 --> 00:15:33.112
(Applause)
