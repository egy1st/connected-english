00:00:00.973 --> 00:00:02.044
Good morning.

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:07.070
My name is Eric Li, and I was born here.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:09.779
But no, I wasn't born there.

00:00:09.803 --> 00:00:12.311
This was where I was born:

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:16.283
Shanghai, at the height
of the Cultural Revolution.

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.118
My grandmother tells me that she heard

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:21.131
the sound of gunfire
along with my first cries.

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:24.886
When I was growing up, I was told a story

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.491
that explained all I ever
needed to know about humanity.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:29.930
It went like this.

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:33.188
All human societies develop
in linear progression,

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:36.780
beginning with primitive
society, then slave society,

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:39.811
feudalism, capitalism, socialism,

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:42.155
and finally, guess where we end up?

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.279
Communism!

00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:48.991
Sooner or later, all of humanity,

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.757
regardless of culture,
language, nationality,

00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:54.213
will arrive at this final stage

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:56.646
of political and social development.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.902
The entire world's peoples will be unified

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:01.166
in this paradise on Earth

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.934
and live happily ever after.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.221
But before we get there, we're engaged

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:08.662
in a struggle between good and evil,

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:11.803
the good of socialism
against the evil of capitalism,

00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:13.750
and the good shall triumph.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:16.246
That, of course, was the meta-narrative

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.026
distilled from the theories of Karl Marx.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.628
And the Chinese bought it.

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:24.541
We were taught that grand
story day in and day out.

00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:27.314
It became part of us,
and we believed in it.

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:29.508
The story was a bestseller.

00:01:29.532 --> 00:01:31.818
About one third of the entire
world's population

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:34.471
lived under that meta-narrative.

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.238
Then, the world changed overnight.

00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:40.884
As for me, disillusioned
by the failed religion of my youth,

00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:43.797
I went to America and became
a Berkeley hippie.

00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:46.996
(Laughter)

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.712
Now, as I was coming of age,
something else happened.

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.908
As if one big story wasn't enough,

00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:55.420
I was told another one.

00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:58.652
This one was just as grand.

00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:00.815
It also claims that all human societies

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:04.660
develop in a linear progression
towards a singular end.

00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:07.185
This one went as follows:

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.541
All societies, regardless of culture,

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:12.231
be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:14.960
must progress from traditional societies

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:17.506
in which groups are the basic units

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.007
to modern societies
in which atomized individuals

00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:22.470
are the sovereign units,

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:26.213
and all these individuals
are, by definition, rational,

00:02:26.237 --> 00:02:28.279
and they all want one thing:

00:02:28.303 --> 00:02:30.779
the vote.

00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:33.439
Because they are all rational,
once given the vote,

00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:34.873
they produce good government

00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:37.072
and live happily ever after.

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:39.991
Paradise on Earth, again.

00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:43.092
Sooner or later, electoral
democracy will be

00:02:43.116 --> 00:02:47.103
the only political system
for all countries and all peoples,

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:49.567
with a free market to make them all rich.

00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:53.117
But before we get there,
we're engaged in a struggle

00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:54.810
between good and evil.

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:56.370
(Laughter)

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:58.608
The good belongs to those
who are democracies

00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:00.823
and are charged with a mission
of spreading it

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:04.016
around the globe, sometimes by force,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.442
against the evil of those
who do not hold elections.

00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:09.332
(Video) George H.W. Bush:
A new world order...

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.023
(Video) George W. Bush:...
ending tyranny in our world...

00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:14.476
(Video) Barack Obama:...
a single standard for all

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.816
who would hold power.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.620
Eric X. Li: Now --

00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:26.301
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:30.324
This story also became a bestseller.

00:03:30.348 --> 00:03:32.191
According to Freedom House,

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:35.194
the number of democracies
went from 45 in 1970

00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.729
to 115 in 2010.

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:40.923
In the last 20 years,
Western elites tirelessly

00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:44.218
trotted around the globe
selling this prospectus:

00:03:44.242 --> 00:03:46.833
Multiple parties fight for political power

00:03:46.857 --> 00:03:48.379
and everyone voting on them

00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:50.400
is the only path to salvation

00:03:50.424 --> 00:03:53.167
to the long-suffering developing world.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.279
Those who buy the prospectus
are destined for success.

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:59.371
Those who do not are doomed to fail.

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.569
But this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.

00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:05.088
Fool me once...

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:09.657
(Laughter)

00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:11.959
The rest is history.

00:04:11.983 --> 00:04:13.555
In just 30 years, China went from

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.151
one of the poorest agricultural
countries in the world

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:18.074
to its second-largest economy.

00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:20.130
Six hundred fifty million people

00:04:20.154 --> 00:04:21.745
were lifted out of poverty.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.733
Eighty percent of the entire
world's poverty alleviation

00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:26.958
during that period happened in China.

00:04:26.982 --> 00:04:29.607
In other words, all the new
and old democracies

00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:32.675
put together amounted to a mere fraction

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.944
of what a single, one-party
state did without voting.

00:04:37.968 --> 00:04:41.122
See, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.055
Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:45.647
per person per month at one point.

00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:49.818
Needless to say, I ate
all my grandmother's portions.

00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:53.553
So I asked myself, what's wrong
with this picture?

00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:55.554
Here I am in my hometown,

00:04:55.578 --> 00:04:57.340
my business growing leaps and bounds.

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:59.639
Entrepreneurs are starting
companies every day.

00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:02.720
Middle class is expanding
in speed and scale

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:04.721
unprecedented in human history.

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:07.258
Yet, according to the grand story,

00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:10.193
none of this should be happening.

00:05:10.217 --> 00:05:13.399
So I went and did the only thing I could.
I studied it.

00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:15.406
Yes, China is a one-party state

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.291
run by the Chinese Communist
Party, the Party,

00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:21.243
and they don't hold elections.

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:23.802
Three assumptions are made

00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:26.456
by the dominant political
theories of our time.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.339
Such a system is operationally rigid,

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:33.025
politically closed,
and morally illegitimate.

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.235
Well, the assumptions are wrong.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.445
The opposites are true.

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.783
Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:43.717
are the three defining characteristics

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:46.088
of China's one-party system.

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:48.160
Now, most political
scientists will tell us

00:05:48.184 --> 00:05:51.345
that a one-party system
is inherently incapable

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:53.273
of self-correction.

00:05:53.297 --> 00:05:55.591
It won't last long
because it cannot adapt.

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:57.389
Now here are the facts.

00:05:57.413 --> 00:06:00.949
In 64 years of running the largest
country in the world,

00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:03.509
the range of the Party's policies
has been wider

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:06.426
than any other country in recent memory,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.397
from radical land collectivization
to the Great Leap Forward,

00:06:10.421 --> 00:06:13.049
then privatization of farmland,

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:15.345
then the Cultural Revolution,

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:18.041
then Deng Xiaoping's market reform,

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:21.454
then successor Jiang Zemin
took the giant political step

00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:24.602
of opening up Party membership
to private businesspeople,

00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:27.665
something unimaginable during Mao's rule.

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.486
So the Party self-corrects
in rather dramatic fashions.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.116
Institutionally, new rules get enacted

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.695
to correct previous dysfunctions.

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:38.569
For example, term limits.

00:06:38.593 --> 00:06:41.355
Political leaders used to retain
their positions for life,

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.189
and they used that to accumulate power

00:06:43.213 --> 00:06:44.758
and perpetuate their rules.

00:06:44.782 --> 00:06:46.978
Mao was the father of modern China,

00:06:47.002 --> 00:06:49.850
yet his prolonged rule led
to disastrous mistakes.

00:06:49.874 --> 00:06:52.010
So the Party instituted term limits

00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:55.763
with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.

00:06:55.787 --> 00:06:58.012
One thing we often hear is,

00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:01.190
"Political reforms have lagged
far behind economic reforms,"

00:07:01.214 --> 00:07:04.464
and "China is in dire need
of political reform."

00:07:04.488 --> 00:07:07.423
But this claim is a rhetorical trap

00:07:07.447 --> 00:07:10.039
hidden behind a political bias.

00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:12.536
See, some have decided a priori

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.418
what kinds of changes they want to see,

00:07:14.442 --> 00:07:18.025
and only such changes can
be called political reform.

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:20.985
The truth is, political
reforms have never stopped.

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.218
Compared with 30 years ago,
20 years, even 10 years ago,

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:26.608
every aspect of Chinese society,

00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:27.480
how the country is governed,

00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:29.790
from the most local level
to the highest center,

00:07:29.814 --> 00:07:32.213
are unrecognizable today.

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:35.399
Now such changes are simply not possible

00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:39.119
without political reforms
of the most fundamental kind.

00:07:39.143 --> 00:07:41.312
Now I would venture to suggest the Party

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:45.419
is the world's leading
expert in political reform.

00:07:45.443 --> 00:07:48.451
The second assumption
is that in a one-party state,

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:51.182
power gets concentrated
in the hands of the few,

00:07:51.206 --> 00:07:53.884
and bad governance and corruption follow.

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:56.057
Indeed, corruption is a big problem,

00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:58.191
but let's first look
at the larger context.

00:07:58.215 --> 00:08:00.319
Now, this may be counterintuitive to you.

00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:03.338
The Party happens to be
one of the most meritocratic

00:08:03.362 --> 00:08:06.134
political institutions in the world today.

00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:10.235
China's highest ruling body,
the Politburo, has 25 members.

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:12.323
In the most recent one, only five of them

00:08:12.347 --> 00:08:15.945
came from a background of privilege,
so-called princelings.

00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:18.541
The other 20, including the president
and the premier,

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:21.196
came from entirely ordinary backgrounds.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.637
In the larger central
committee of 300 or more,

00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:25.504
the percentage of those who were born

00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:27.963
into power and wealth was even smaller.

00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:30.793
The vast majority
of senior Chinese leaders

00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:33.438
worked and competed their way to the top.

00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:35.570
Compare that with the ruling elites

00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:37.672
in both developed
and developing countries,

00:08:37.696 --> 00:08:40.182
I think you'll find the Party
being near the top

00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:42.816
in upward mobility.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.345
The question then is,
how could that be possible

00:08:45.369 --> 00:08:48.564
in a system run by one party?

00:08:48.588 --> 00:08:51.456
Now we come to a powerful
political institution,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.973
little-known to Westerners:

00:08:52.997 --> 00:08:55.624
the Party's Organization Department.

00:08:55.648 --> 00:08:57.824
The department functions like a giant

00:08:57.848 --> 00:09:00.200
human resource engine
that would be the envy

00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:03.530
of even some of the most successful
corporations.

00:09:03.554 --> 00:09:05.799
It operates a rotating pyramid

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:07.166
made up of three components:

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.722
civil service, state-owned enterprises,

00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:11.966
and social organizations like a university

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.104
or a community program.

00:09:14.128 --> 00:09:16.615
They form separate
yet integrated career paths

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.519
for Chinese officials.

00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:21.604
They recruit college grads
into entry-level positions

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:24.354
in all three tracks,
and they start from the bottom,

00:09:24.378 --> 00:09:25.910
called "keyuan" [clerk].

00:09:25.934 --> 00:09:27.293
Then they could get promoted

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:32.409
through four increasingly elite ranks:

00:09:32.433 --> 00:09:35.721
fuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu
[deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].

00:09:35.745 --> 00:09:38.031
Now these are not moves
from "Karate Kid," okay?

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:41.375
It's serious business.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.712
The range of positions is wide,

00:09:43.736 --> 00:09:45.498
from running health care in a village

00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:47.559
to foreign investment in a city district

00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:49.684
to manager in a company.

00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:52.280
Once a year, the department
reviews their performance.

00:09:52.304 --> 00:09:54.615
They interview
their superiors, their peers,

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:57.396
their subordinates. They vet
their personal conduct.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.428
They conduct public opinion surveys.

00:09:59.452 --> 00:10:01.391
Then they promote the winners.

00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:03.225
Throughout their careers, these cadres

00:10:03.249 --> 00:10:06.059
can move
through and out of all three tracks.

00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:08.937
Over time, the good ones move
beyond the four base levels

00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:11.961
to the fuju [deputy bureau chief]
and ju [bureau chief] levels.

00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:14.473
There, they enter high officialdom.

00:10:14.497 --> 00:10:16.633
By that point, a typical
assignment will be

00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:19.492
to manage a district
with a population in the millions

00:10:19.516 --> 00:10:23.023
or a company with hundreds
of millions of dollars in revenue.

00:10:23.047 --> 00:10:26.952
Just to show you
how competitive the system is,

00:10:26.976 --> 00:10:30.670
in 2012, there were 900,000
fuke and ke levels,

00:10:30.694 --> 00:10:33.494
600,000 fuchu and chu levels,

00:10:33.518 --> 00:10:36.929
and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.

00:10:36.953 --> 00:10:38.657
After the ju levels,

00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:41.258
the best few move further
up several more ranks,

00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:44.389
and eventually make it
to the Central Committee.

00:10:44.413 --> 00:10:47.141
The process takes two to three decades.

00:10:47.165 --> 00:10:50.250
Does patronage play a role?
Yes, of course.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:53.822
But merit remains the fundamental driver.

00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:56.352
In essence, the Organization
Department runs

00:10:56.376 --> 00:10:58.825
a modernized version
of China's centuries-old

00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:00.889
mentoring system.

00:11:00.913 --> 00:11:02.980
China's new president, Xi Jinping,

00:11:03.004 --> 00:11:05.559
is the son of a former leader,
which is very unusual,

00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:07.779
first of his kind to make the top job.

00:11:07.803 --> 00:11:10.674
Even for him, the career took 30 years.

00:11:10.698 --> 00:11:12.542
He started as a village manager,

00:11:12.566 --> 00:11:14.519
and by the time he entered the Politburo,

00:11:14.543 --> 00:11:16.660
he had managed areas
with a total population

00:11:16.684 --> 00:11:18.264
of 150 million people

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:22.710
and combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S.
dollars.

00:11:22.734 --> 00:11:25.030
Now, please don't get me wrong, okay?

00:11:25.054 --> 00:11:28.284
This is not a put-down of anyone.
It's just a statement of fact.

00:11:28.308 --> 00:11:32.118
George W. Bush, remember him?

00:11:32.142 --> 00:11:34.559
This is not a put-down.

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:35.364
(Laughter)

00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:38.463
Before becoming governor of Texas,

00:11:38.487 --> 00:11:41.082
or Barack Obama
before running for president,

00:11:41.106 --> 00:11:43.841
could not make even a small county manager

00:11:43.865 --> 00:11:45.769
in China's system.

00:11:45.793 --> 00:11:47.793
Winston Churchill once said that democracy

00:11:47.817 --> 00:11:50.110
is a terrible system
except for all the rest.

00:11:50.134 --> 00:11:54.391
Well, apparently he hadn't heard
of the Organization Department.

00:11:54.415 --> 00:11:56.735
Now, Westerners always assume that

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:59.753
multi-party election
with universal suffrage

00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:02.895
is the only source
of political legitimacy.

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:06.257
I was asked once, "The Party
wasn't voted in by election.

00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:08.487
Where is the source of legitimacy?"

00:12:08.511 --> 00:12:12.049
I said, "How about competency?"

00:12:12.073 --> 00:12:13.526
We all know the facts.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.467
In 1949, when the Party took power,

00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:18.794
China was mired in civil wars,
dismembered by foreign aggression,

00:12:18.818 --> 00:12:23.089
average life expectancy
at that time, 41 years old.

00:12:23.113 --> 00:12:25.999
Today, it's the second largest
economy in the world,

00:12:26.023 --> 00:12:28.602
an industrial powerhouse,
and its people live

00:12:28.626 --> 00:12:30.689
in increasing prosperity.

00:12:30.713 --> 00:12:33.842
Pew Research polls Chinese
public attitudes,

00:12:33.866 --> 00:12:35.899
and here are the numbers in recent years.

00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:40.399
Satisfaction with the direction
of the country: 85 percent.

00:12:40.423 --> 00:12:43.043
Those who think they're better
off than five years ago:

00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:44.974
70 percent.

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:47.358
Those who expect the future to be better:

00:12:47.382 --> 00:12:50.022
a whopping 82 percent.

00:12:50.046 --> 00:12:53.551
Financial Times polls
global youth attitudes,

00:12:53.575 --> 00:12:56.966
and these numbers, brand new,
just came from last week.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.748
Ninety-three percent
of China's Generation Y

00:12:59.772 --> 00:13:02.334
are optimistic
about their country's future.

00:13:02.358 --> 00:13:08.222
Now, if this is not legitimacy,
I'm not sure what is.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.391
In contrast, most electoral
democracies around the world

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.494
are suffering from dismal performance.

00:13:13.518 --> 00:13:15.809
I don't need to elaborate
for this audience

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:20.146
how dysfunctional it is,
from Washington to European capitals.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.035
With a few exceptions, the vast number

00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:25.942
of developing countries that have
adopted electoral regimes

00:13:25.966 --> 00:13:29.753
are still suffering
from poverty and civil strife.

00:13:29.777 --> 00:13:31.825
Governments get elected,
and then they fall

00:13:31.849 --> 00:13:34.428
below 50 percent approval in a few months

00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:37.976
and stay there and get worse
until the next election.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.399
Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle

00:13:40.423 --> 00:13:42.777
of elect and regret.

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:46.306
At this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.926
not China's one-party
system, that is in danger

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.185
of losing legitimacy.

00:13:51.209 --> 00:13:54.035
Now, I don't want to create
the misimpression

00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:56.043
that China's hunky-dory, on the way

00:13:56.067 --> 00:13:57.836
to some kind of superpowerdom.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.795
The country faces enormous challenges.

00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:02.819
The social and economic problems that come

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:06.704
with wrenching change
like this are mind-boggling.

00:14:06.728 --> 00:14:10.251
Pollution is one. Food safety.
Population issues.

00:14:10.275 --> 00:14:14.198
On the political front, the worst
problem is corruption.

00:14:14.222 --> 00:14:17.030
Corruption is widespread
and undermines the system

00:14:17.054 --> 00:14:18.832
and its moral legitimacy.

00:14:18.856 --> 00:14:21.679
But most analysts misdiagnose the disease.

00:14:21.703 --> 00:14:24.588
They say that corruption is the result
of the one-party system,

00:14:24.612 --> 00:14:26.279
and therefore, in order to cure it,

00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:28.351
you have to do away
with the entire system.

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:31.228
But a more careful look
would tell us otherwise.

00:14:31.252 --> 00:14:34.148
Transparency International ranks China

00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:37.914
between 70 and 80 in recent
years among 170 countries,

00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:40.091
and it's been moving up.

00:14:40.115 --> 00:14:42.154
India, the largest democracy in the world,

00:14:42.178 --> 00:14:44.301
94 and dropping.

00:14:44.325 --> 00:14:47.183
For the hundred or so countries
that are ranked below China,

00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:49.772
more than half of them
are electoral democracies.

00:14:49.796 --> 00:14:53.067
So if election is the panacea
for corruption,

00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:56.310
how come these countries can't fix it?

00:14:56.334 --> 00:14:59.904
Now, I'm a venture capitalist.
I make bets.

00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:02.236
It wouldn't be fair
to end this talk without

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.880
putting myself on the line
and making some predictions.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.585
So here they are.

00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:09.387
In the next 10 years, China
will surpass the U.S.

00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:11.764
and become the largest
economy in the world.

00:15:11.788 --> 00:15:13.845
Income per capita will be near the top

00:15:13.869 --> 00:15:16.027
of all developing countries.

00:15:16.051 --> 00:15:18.349
Corruption will be curbed,
but not eliminated,

00:15:18.373 --> 00:15:20.762
and China will move up 10 to 20 notches

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:23.604
to above 60 in T.I. ranking.

00:15:23.628 --> 00:15:26.676
Economic reform will accelerate,
political reform will continue,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.032
and the one-party system will hold firm.

00:15:30.056 --> 00:15:33.190
We live in the dusk of an era.

00:15:33.214 --> 00:15:36.475
Meta-narratives that make universal claims

00:15:36.499 --> 00:15:38.436
failed us in the 20th century

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.220
and are failing us in the 21st.

00:15:41.244 --> 00:15:43.814
Meta-narrative is the cancer

00:15:43.838 --> 00:15:46.621
that is killing democracy from the inside.

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:48.388
Now, I want to clarify something.

00:15:48.412 --> 00:15:50.908
I'm not here to make
an indictment of democracy.

00:15:50.932 --> 00:15:53.501
On the contrary, I think
democracy contributed

00:15:53.525 --> 00:15:56.697
to the rise of the West
and the creation of the modern world.

00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:59.808
It is the universal claim
that many Western elites

00:15:59.832 --> 00:16:03.297
are making about their political
system, the hubris,

00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:06.536
that is at the heart
of the West's current ills.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.841
If they would spend
just a little less time

00:16:08.865 --> 00:16:10.981
on trying to force their way onto others,

00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:14.648
and a little bit more
on political reform at home,

00:16:14.672 --> 00:16:18.038
they might give their democracy
a better chance.

00:16:18.062 --> 00:16:20.416
China's political model
will never supplant

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.736
electoral democracy,
because unlike the latter,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.693
it doesn't pretend to be universal.

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:28.525
It cannot be exported. But
that is the point precisely.

00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:31.124
The significance of China's example

00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:33.091
is not that it provides an alternative,

00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:37.531
but the demonstration
that alternatives exist.

00:16:37.555 --> 00:16:41.165
Let us draw to a close this
era of meta-narratives.

00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:44.528
Communism and democracy may
both be laudable ideals,

00:16:44.552 --> 00:16:48.629
but the era of their dogmatic
universalism is over.

00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:51.116
Let us stop telling
people and our children

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.368
there's only one way to govern ourselves

00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:55.177
and a singular future towards which

00:16:55.201 --> 00:16:57.559
all societies must evolve.

00:16:57.583 --> 00:17:00.354
It is wrong. It is irresponsible.

00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:04.592
And worst of all, it is boring.

00:17:04.616 --> 00:17:08.511
Let universality make way for plurality.

00:17:08.535 --> 00:17:11.708
Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us.

00:17:11.732 --> 00:17:13.921
Are we brave enough to welcome it?

00:17:13.944 --> 00:17:15.115
Thank you.

00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:31.134
(Applause)

00:17:31.158 --> 00:17:34.770
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

00:17:34.794 --> 00:17:36.976
Bruno Giussani: Eric, stay
with me for a couple of minutes,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.690
because I want to ask you
a couple of questions.

00:17:39.714 --> 00:17:43.218
I think many here, and in general
in Western countries,

00:17:43.242 --> 00:17:46.620
would agree with your statement
about analysis

00:17:46.644 --> 00:17:49.325
of democratic systems
becoming dysfunctional,

00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:52.252
but at the same time,
many would kind of find

00:17:52.276 --> 00:17:56.197
unsettling the thought
that there is an unelected

00:17:56.221 --> 00:18:01.593
authority that, without any form
of oversight or consultation,

00:18:01.617 --> 00:18:04.508
decides what the national interest is.

00:18:04.532 --> 00:18:07.510
What is the mechanism in the Chinese model

00:18:07.534 --> 00:18:09.729
that allows people to say, actually,

00:18:09.753 --> 00:18:12.316
the national interest
as you defined it is wrong?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.378
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama,
the political scientist,

00:18:16.402 --> 00:18:20.222
called the Chinese system
"responsive authoritarianism."

00:18:20.246 --> 00:18:23.332
It's not exactly right,
but I think it comes close.

00:18:23.356 --> 00:18:27.306
So I know the largest public
opinion survey company

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.188
in China, okay?

00:18:29.212 --> 00:18:31.868
Do you know who their biggest client is?

00:18:31.892 --> 00:18:33.714
The Chinese government.

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.180
Not just from the central government,

00:18:36.204 --> 00:18:37.604
the city government,
the provincial government,

00:18:37.628 --> 00:18:39.683
to the most local neighborhood districts.

00:18:39.707 --> 00:18:41.826
They conduct surveys all the time.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.436
Are you happy with the garbage collection?

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.548
Are you happy with the general
direction of the country?

00:18:46.572 --> 00:18:49.809
So there is, in China, there
is a different kind of mechanism

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:53.370
to be responsive to the demands
and the thinking of the people.

00:18:53.394 --> 00:18:56.578
My point is, I think we should get unstuck

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:59.009
from the thinking
that there's only one political system --

00:18:59.033 --> 00:19:00.554
election, election, election --

00:19:00.578 --> 00:19:02.282
that could make it responsive.

00:19:02.306 --> 00:19:04.266
I'm not sure, actually, elections produce

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.212
responsive government
anymore in the world.

00:19:07.236 --> 00:19:11.919
(Applause)

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:13.079
BG: Many seem to agree.

00:19:13.103 --> 00:19:15.735
One of the features of a democratic system

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:19.004
is a space for civil
society to express itself.

00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:21.372
And you have shown figures
about the support

00:19:21.396 --> 00:19:24.276
that the government
and the authorities have in China.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.581
But then you've just
mentioned other elements

00:19:27.605 --> 00:19:29.735
like, you know, big challenges,
and there are, of course,

00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:32.661
a lot of other data that go
in a different direction:

00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:35.318
tens of thousands of unrests and protests

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:38.177
and environmental protests, etc.

00:19:38.201 --> 00:19:41.193
So you seem to suggest the Chinese model

00:19:41.217 --> 00:19:43.304
doesn't have a space outside of the Party

00:19:43.328 --> 00:19:45.605
for civil society to express itself.

00:19:45.629 --> 00:19:49.783
EXL: There's a vibrant
civil society in China,

00:19:49.807 --> 00:19:51.412
whether it's environment or what-have-you.

00:19:51.436 --> 00:19:53.660
But it's different. You
wouldn't recognize it.

00:19:53.684 --> 00:19:56.542
Because, by Western definitions,
a so-called civil society

00:19:56.566 --> 00:19:59.386
has to be separate or even in opposition

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.077
to the political system,

00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:05.842
but that concept is alien
for Chinese culture.

00:20:05.866 --> 00:20:08.315
For thousands of years,
you have civil society,

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:10.804
yet they are consistent and coherent

00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:13.651
and part of a political order, and I think

00:20:13.675 --> 00:20:17.021
it's a big cultural difference.

00:20:17.045 --> 00:20:20.672
BG: Eric, thank you for sharing
this with TED. EXL: Thank you.
