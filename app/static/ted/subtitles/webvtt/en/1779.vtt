00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:02.578
There's an old joke about a cop

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.959
who's walking his beat
in the middle of the night,

00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:07.086
and he comes across a guy
under a street lamp

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.801
who's looking at the ground
and moving from side to side,

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.602
and the cop asks him what he's doing.

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:13.560
The guys says he's looking for his keys.

00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:15.023
So the cop takes his time

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.317
and looks over and kind of
makes a little matrix

00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:19.546
and looks for about two, three minutes.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.721
No keys.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.117
The cop says, "Are you sure?

00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:25.450
Hey buddy, are you sure
you lost your keys here?"

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:27.506
And the guy says,
"No, actually I lost them

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.256
down at the other end of the street,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.725
but the light is better here."

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.374
(Laughter)

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.410
There's a concept that people talk
about nowadays called "big data."

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:40.077
And what they're talking
about is all of the information

00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:42.252
that we're generating
through our interaction

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.579
with and over the Internet,

00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:45.363
everything from Facebook and Twitter

00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:49.020
to music downloads, movies,
streaming, all this kind of stuff,

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:50.506
the live streaming of TED.

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:53.603
And the folks who work
with big data, for them,

00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:55.631
they talk about that their biggest problem

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.402
is we have so much information.

00:00:57.426 --> 00:01:00.803
The biggest problem is: how do we
organize all that information?

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:03.432
I can tell you that,
working in global health,

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:05.740
that is not our biggest problem.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.416
Because for us, even though
the light is better on the Internet,

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:14.355
the data that would help us solve
the problems we're trying to solve

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.528
is not actually present on the Internet.

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:17.997
So we don't know, for example,

00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.312
how many people right now
are being affected by disasters

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:23.305
or by conflict situations.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.048
We don't know for, really,
basically, any of the clinics

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:28.222
in the developing world,

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:30.701
which ones have medicines
and which ones don't.

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:34.099
We have no idea of what
the supply chain is for those clinics.

00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:37.821
We don't know -- and this is really
amazing to me -- we don't know

00:01:37.845 --> 00:01:41.615
how many children were born --
or how many children there are --

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:45.047
in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan.

00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:48.088
We don't know how many kids died last week

00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:49.358
in any of those countries.

00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:52.429
We don't know the needs
of the elderly, the mentally ill.

00:01:52.453 --> 00:01:55.668
For all of these different
critically important problems

00:01:55.692 --> 00:01:58.992
or critically important areas
that we want to solve problems in,

00:01:59.016 --> 00:02:01.282
we basically know nothing at all.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.486
And part of the reason
why we don't know anything at all

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.689
is that the information technology systems
that we use in global health

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:15.126
to find the data to solve
these problems is what you see here.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.384
This is about a 5,000-year-old technology.

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:19.140
Some of you may have used it before.

00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:20.703
It's kind of on its way out now,

00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:23.166
but we still use it
for 99 percent of our stuff.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.680
This is a paper form.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.043
And what you're looking at is a paper form

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:31.246
in the hand of a Ministry of Health
nurse in Indonesia,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.510
who is tramping out across the countryside

00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:37.185
in Indonesia on, I'm sure,
a very hot and humid day,

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.891
and she is going to be knocking
on thousands of doors

00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:41.994
over a period of weeks or months,

00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:43.615
knocking on the doors and saying,

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.517
"Excuse me, we'd like to ask
you some questions.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.746
Do you have any children?
Were your children vaccinated?"

00:02:50.223 --> 00:02:52.358
Because the only way
we can actually find out

00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:55.317
how many children were vaccinated
in the country of Indonesia,

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.898
what percentage were vaccinated,

00:02:56.922 --> 00:03:01.050
is actually not on the Internet,
but by going out and knocking on doors,

00:03:01.074 --> 00:03:03.288
sometimes tens of thousands of doors.

00:03:03.312 --> 00:03:07.310
Sometimes it takes months to even years
to do something like this.

00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:09.451
You know, a census of Indonesia

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.569
would probably take
two years to accomplish.

00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:13.665
And the problem, of course,
with all of this

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.586
is that, with all those paper forms --

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.729
and I'm telling you, we have
paper forms for every possible thing:

00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:20.817
We have paper forms
for vaccination surveys.

00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:24.002
We have paper forms to track
people who come into clinics.

00:03:24.026 --> 00:03:28.068
We have paper forms to track
drug supplies, blood supplies --

00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:31.326
all these different paper forms
for many different topics,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.666
they all have a single, common endpoint,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.309
and the common endpoint
looks something like this.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.666
And what we're looking
at here is a truckful of data.

00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:45.126
This is the data from a single
vaccination coverage survey

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.341
in a single district
in the country of Zambia

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:49.655
from a few years ago,
that I participated in.

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.026
The only thing anyone
was trying to find out

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.303
is what percentage of Zambian
children are vaccinated,

00:03:55.327 --> 00:03:58.581
and this is the data,
collected on paper over weeks,

00:03:58.605 --> 00:03:59.788
from a single district,

00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:02.487
which is something like a county
in the United States.

00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:05.186
You can imagine that,
for the entire country of Zambia,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.503
answering just that single question ...

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.945
looks something like this.

00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:13.112
Truck after truck after truck,

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:16.049
filled with stack after stack
after stack of data.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.642
And what makes it even worse
is that's just the beginning.

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:21.760
Because once you've collected
all that data,

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:24.324
of course, someone --
some unfortunate person --

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:26.563
is going to have to type that
into a computer.

00:04:26.587 --> 00:04:28.039
When I was a graduate student,

00:04:28.063 --> 00:04:30.522
I actually was that unfortunate
person sometimes.

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:33.561
I can tell you, I often wasn't
really paying attention.

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:35.852
I probably made a lot
of mistakes when I did it

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:38.496
that no one ever discovered,
so data quality goes down.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.540
But eventually that data, hopefully,
gets typed into a computer,

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:43.295
and someone can begin to analyze it,

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.191
and once they have
an analysis and a report,

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:49.239
hopefully, then you can take
the results of that data collection

00:04:49.263 --> 00:04:51.230
and use it to vaccinate children better.

00:04:51.254 --> 00:04:56.795
Because if there's anything worse
in the field of global public health --

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.801
I don't know what's worse
than allowing children on this planet

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:01.941
to die of vaccine-preventable diseases --

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:05.377
diseases for which
the vaccine costs a dollar.

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:09.187
And millions of children die
of these diseases every year.

00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:12.185
And the fact is, millions
is a gross estimate,

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:15.423
because we don't really know
how many kids die each year of this.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.229
What makes it even more frustrating
is that the data-entry part,

00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:21.443
the part that I used to do
as a grad student,

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:22.925
can take sometimes six months.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.401
Sometimes it can take two years
to type that information into a computer,

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.535
And sometimes, actually not infrequently,

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.387
it actually never happens.

00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.887
Now try and wrap your head
around that for a second.

00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:35.086
You just had teams of hundreds of people.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.013
They went out into the field
to answer a particular question.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.433
You probably spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:43.493
on fuel and photocopying and per diem.

00:05:44.072 --> 00:05:46.116
And then for some reason, momentum is lost

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.533
or there's no money left,

00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:49.894
and all of that comes to nothing,

00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:52.641
because no one actually types it
into the computer at all.

00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:53.841
The process just stops.

00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:55.789
Happens all the time.

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:58.928
This is what we base
our decisions on in global health:

00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:02.369
little data, old data, no data.

00:06:03.924 --> 00:06:05.377
So back in 1995,

00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:08.641
I began to think about ways
in which we could improve this process.

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:11.333
Now 1995 -- obviously,
that was quite a long time ago.

00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:14.335
It kind of frightens me to think
of how long ago that was.

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:17.097
The top movie of the year
was "Die Hard with a Vengeance."

00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.938
As you can see, Bruce Willis
had a lot more hair back then.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:22.627
I was working in the Centers
for Disease Control

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:24.830
and I had a lot more
hair back then as well.

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:28.449
But to me, the most significant
thing that I saw in 1995

00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:29.691
was this.

00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:32.544
Hard for us to imagine, but in 1995,

00:06:32.568 --> 00:06:35.683
this was the ultimate elite mobile device.

00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:38.842
It wasn't an iPhone.
It wasn't a Galaxy phone.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.230
It was a PalmPilot.

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.782
And when I saw the PalmPilot
for the first time, I thought,

00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:46.203
"Why can't we put the forms
on these PalmPilots?

00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:49.378
And go out into the field
just carrying one PalmPilot,

00:06:49.402 --> 00:06:53.167
which can hold the capacity
of tens of thousands of paper forms?

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:54.618
Why don't we try to do that?

00:06:54.642 --> 00:06:55.905
Because if we can do that,

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:59.738
if we can actually just collect
the data electronically, digitally,

00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:01.419
from the very beginning,

00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:04.719
we can just put a shortcut right
through that whole process

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:09.735
of typing, of having somebody type
that stuff into the computer.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.599
We can skip straight to the analysis

00:07:11.623 --> 00:07:14.762
and then straight to the use
of the data to actually save lives."

00:07:14.786 --> 00:07:17.373
So that's what I began to do.

00:07:17.397 --> 00:07:21.746
Working at CDC, I began to travel
to different programs around the world

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.912
and to train them in using
PalmPilots to do data collection,

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:27.314
instead of using paper.

00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:29.226
And it actually worked great.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.302
It worked exactly as well
as anybody would have predicted.

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:33.483
What do you know?

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:37.119
Digital data collection is actually
more efficient than collecting on paper.

00:07:37.143 --> 00:07:39.175
While I was doing it, my business partner,

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.278
Rose, who's here with her husband,
Matthew, here in the audience,

00:07:42.302 --> 00:07:45.175
Rose was out doing similar stuff
for the American Red Cross.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.585
The problem was,
after a few years of doing that,

00:07:47.609 --> 00:07:51.506
I realized -- I had been to maybe
six or seven programs --

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.791
and I thought, you know,
if I keep this up at this pace,

00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:55.966
over my whole career,

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.669
maybe I'm going to go
to maybe 20 or 30 programs.

00:07:58.693 --> 00:08:01.836
But the problem is, 20 or 30 programs,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.810
like, training 20 or 30 programs
to use this technology,

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:07.000
that is a tiny drop in the bucket.

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:10.964
The demand for this, the need
for data to run better programs

00:08:10.988 --> 00:08:13.846
just within health -- not to mention
all of the other fields

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.866
in developing countries -- is enormous.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.876
There are millions and millions
and millions of programs,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.468
millions of clinics
that need to track drugs,

00:08:22.492 --> 00:08:23.896
millions of vaccine programs.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.181
There are schools
that need to track attendance.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:30.111
There are all these different things
for us to get the data that we need to do.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:34.754
And I realized if I kept up
the way that I was doing,

00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:37.998
I was basically hardly
going to make any impact

00:08:38.022 --> 00:08:39.375
by the end of my career.

00:08:39.756 --> 00:08:41.624
And so I began to rack my brain,

00:08:41.648 --> 00:08:44.592
trying to think about, what
was the process that I was doing?

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:45.898
How was I training folks,

00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:49.096
and what were the bottlenecks
and what were the obstacles

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.815
to doing it faster
and to doing it more efficiently?

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:54.675
And, unfortunately, after thinking
about this for some time,

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:57.870
I identified the main obstacle.

00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:00.396
And the main obstacle, it turned out --

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.008
and this is a sad realization --

00:09:02.032 --> 00:09:03.745
the main obstacle was me.

00:09:04.229 --> 00:09:05.658
So what do I mean by that?

00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:08.254
I had developed a process

00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:12.645
whereby I was the center
of the universe of this technology.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.627
If you wanted to use this technology,
you had to get in touch with me.

00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:19.475
That means you had to know I existed.

00:09:19.499 --> 00:09:22.912
Then you had to find the money
to pay for me to fly out to your country

00:09:22.936 --> 00:09:26.531
and the money to pay for my hotel
and my per diem and my daily rate.

00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:29.554
So you could be talking
about 10- or 20- or 30,000 dollars,

00:09:29.578 --> 00:09:31.872
if I actually had the time
or it fit my schedule

00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:33.245
and I wasn't on vacation.

00:09:33.594 --> 00:09:35.555
The point is that anything,

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:37.942
any system that depends
on a single human being

00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:39.869
or two or three or five human beings --

00:09:39.893 --> 00:09:41.546
it just doesn't scale.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.769
And this is a problem for which
we need to scale this technology,

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.363
and we need to scale it now.

00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:49.141
And so I began to think of ways
in which I could basically

00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:51.753
take myself out of the picture.

00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:55.715
And, you know, I was thinking,

00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:57.843
"How could I take myself
out of the picture?"

00:09:57.867 --> 00:09:59.486
for quite some time.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.986
I'd been trained that the way
you distribute technology

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.566
within international development

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.152
is always consultant-based.

00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:09.177
It's always guys
that look pretty much like me,

00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:11.749
flying from countries
that look pretty much like this

00:10:11.773 --> 00:10:14.112
to other countries
with people with darker skin.

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:17.231
And you go out there,
and you spend money on airfare

00:10:17.255 --> 00:10:20.491
and you spend time and you spend per diem

00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:22.864
and you spend for a hotel
and all that stuff.

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:26.300
As far as I knew, that was the only way
you could distribute technology,

00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:28.359
and I couldn't figure out a way around it.

00:10:28.383 --> 00:10:30.137
But the miracle that happened --

00:10:30.851 --> 00:10:32.757
I'm going to call it Hotmail for short.

00:10:33.168 --> 00:10:35.591
You may not think of Hotmail
as being miraculous,

00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.052
but for me it was miraculous,

00:10:37.076 --> 00:10:40.688
because I noticed, just as I
was wrestling with this problem --

00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:44.218
I was working in sub-Saharan
Africa, mostly, at the time --

00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.807
I noticed that every sub-Saharan
African health worker

00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:49.775
that I was working with
had a Hotmail account.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:54.317
And it struck me, "Wait a minute --

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:58.579
I know the Hotmail people surely didn't
fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya

00:10:58.603 --> 00:11:00.679
to train people in how to use Hotmail.

00:11:01.382 --> 00:11:05.630
So these guys are distributing technology,
getting software capacity out there,

00:11:05.654 --> 00:11:07.982
but they're not actually
flying around the world.

00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:09.578
I need to think about this more."

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:11.052
While I was thinking about it,

00:11:11.076 --> 00:11:14.235
people started using even more
things like this, just as we were.

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:17.490
They started using LinkedIn and Flickr
and Gmail and Google Maps --

00:11:17.514 --> 00:11:18.671
all these things.

00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:21.386
Of course, all of these things
are cloud based

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.559
and don't require any training.

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.259
They don't require any programmers.

00:11:25.283 --> 00:11:26.786
They don't require consultants.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.295
Because the business model
for all these businesses

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:32.256
requires that something be so simple
we can use it ourselves,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.574
with little or no training.

00:11:33.598 --> 00:11:36.193
You just have to hear about it
and go to the website.

00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:40.413
And so I thought, what would happen
if we built software

00:11:40.437 --> 00:11:42.501
to do what I'd been consulting in?

00:11:42.525 --> 00:11:46.597
Instead of training people
how to put forms onto mobile devices,

00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:49.922
let's create software that lets them
do it themselves with no training

00:11:49.946 --> 00:11:51.382
and without me being involved.

00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:52.890
And that's exactly what we did.

00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:58.135
So we created software called Magpi,
which has an online form creator.

00:11:58.159 --> 00:11:59.411
No one has to speak to me,

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:02.236
you just have to hear about it
and go to the website.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.918
You can create forms,
and once you've created the forms,

00:12:04.942 --> 00:12:07.403
you push them to a variety
of common mobile phones.

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:10.944
Obviously, nowadays, we've moved
past PalmPilots to mobile phones.

00:12:10.968 --> 00:12:14.197
And it doesn't have to be a smartphone,
it can be a basic phone,

00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:16.711
like the phone on the right,
the basic Symbian phone

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.797
that's very common
in developing countries.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:22.510
And the great part about this
is it's just like Hotmail.

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:23.685
It's cloud based,

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:26.962
and it doesn't require any training,
programming, consultants.

00:12:26.986 --> 00:12:29.189
But there are some
additional benefits as well.

00:12:29.213 --> 00:12:31.086
Now we knew when we built this system,

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.665
the whole point of it,
just like with the PalmPilots,

00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:36.488
was that you'd be able to collect the data

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:39.110
and immediately upload
the data and get your data set.

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:42.119
But what we found, of course,
since it's already on a computer,

00:12:42.143 --> 00:12:44.754
we can deliver instant maps
and analysis and graphing.

00:12:44.778 --> 00:12:46.849
We can take a process that took two years

00:12:46.873 --> 00:12:49.881
and compress that
down to the space of five minutes.

00:12:50.222 --> 00:12:52.377
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.448
Cloud based, no training,
no consultants, no me.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.791
And I told you that in the first few years

00:12:59.815 --> 00:13:01.884
of trying to do this
the old-fashioned way,

00:13:01.908 --> 00:13:03.187
going out to each country,

00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:07.432
we probably trained about 1,000 people.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.553
What happened after we did this?

00:13:09.577 --> 00:13:11.038
In the second three years,

00:13:11.062 --> 00:13:13.212
we had 14,000 people find the website,

00:13:13.236 --> 00:13:15.349
sign up and start using it
to collect data:

00:13:15.373 --> 00:13:17.283
data for disaster response,

00:13:17.307 --> 00:13:21.741
Canadian pig farmers
tracking pig disease and pig herds,

00:13:21.765 --> 00:13:23.646
people tracking drug supplies.

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:27.585
One of my favorite examples, the IRC,
International Rescue Committee,

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:30.822
they have a program
where semi-literate midwives,

00:13:30.846 --> 00:13:33.249
using $10 mobile phones,

00:13:33.273 --> 00:13:36.574
send a text message
using our software, once a week,

00:13:36.598 --> 00:13:39.074
with the number of births
and the number of deaths,

00:13:39.098 --> 00:13:42.670
which gives IRC something that no one
in global health has ever had:

00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:46.216
a near-real-time system
of counting babies,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.874
of knowing how many kids are born,

00:13:47.898 --> 00:13:50.540
of knowing how many children
there are in Sierra Leone,

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.787
which is the country
where this is happening,

00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:54.564
and knowing how many children die.

00:13:55.394 --> 00:13:56.967
Physicians for Human Rights --

00:13:56.991 --> 00:13:59.583
this is moving a little bit
outside the health field --

00:13:59.607 --> 00:14:04.390
they're basically training people
to do rape exams in Congo,

00:14:04.414 --> 00:14:05.863
where this is an epidemic,

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.680
a horrible epidemic,

00:14:07.704 --> 00:14:10.880
and they're using our software
to document the evidence they find,

00:14:10.904 --> 00:14:12.878
including photographically,

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:15.805
so that they can bring
the perpetrators to justice.

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:20.549
Camfed, another charity
based out of the UK --

00:14:20.573 --> 00:14:23.286
Camfed pays girls' families
to keep them in school.

00:14:24.165 --> 00:14:27.640
They understand this is the most
significant intervention they can make.

00:14:27.664 --> 00:14:31.504
They used to track the disbursements,
the attendance, the grades, on paper.

00:14:31.528 --> 00:14:34.875
The turnaround time between a teacher
writing down grades or attendance

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:37.734
and getting that into a report
was about two to three years.

00:14:37.758 --> 00:14:38.909
Now it's real time.

00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:42.116
And because this is such a low-cost
system and based in the cloud,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.129
it costs, for the entire five countries
that Camfed runs this in,

00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:48.018
with tens of thousands of girls,

00:14:48.042 --> 00:14:50.750
the whole cost combined
is 10,000 dollars a year.

00:14:51.154 --> 00:14:53.115
That's less than I used to get

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:56.035
just traveling out for two weeks
to do a consultation.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:01.608
So I told you before that when
we were doing it the old-fashioned way,

00:15:01.632 --> 00:15:05.427
I realized all of our work was really
adding up to just a drop in the bucket --

00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:07.173
10, 20, 30 different programs.

00:15:08.036 --> 00:15:09.449
We've made a lot of progress,

00:15:09.473 --> 00:15:11.029
but I recognize that right now,

00:15:11.053 --> 00:15:14.417
even the work that we've done
with 14,000 people using this

00:15:14.441 --> 00:15:15.904
is still a drop in the bucket.

00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:18.658
But something's changed,
and I think it should be obvious.

00:15:18.682 --> 00:15:20.837
What's changed now is,

00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:24.163
instead of having a program
in which we're scaling at such a slow rate

00:15:24.187 --> 00:15:27.498
that we can never reach
all the people who need us,

00:15:27.522 --> 00:15:31.104
we've made it unnecessary
for people to get reached by us.

00:15:31.128 --> 00:15:36.131
We've created a tool
that lets programs keep kids in school,

00:15:36.155 --> 00:15:40.094
track the number of babies that are born
and the number of babies that die,

00:15:40.118 --> 00:15:43.895
catch criminals and successfully
prosecute them --

00:15:43.919 --> 00:15:48.341
to do all these different things
to learn more about what's going on,

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:49.666
to understand more,

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.006
to see more ...

00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:53.816
and to save lives and improve lives.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.072
Thank you.

00:15:57.096 --> 00:16:01.365
(Applause)
