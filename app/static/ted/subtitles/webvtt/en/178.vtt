00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the body formerly known as a planet.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we, living on it, came to be.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and search for answers to questions like this,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we visited Saturn in the early 1980s --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that humanity had ever established around the Sun.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
for a much larger human voyage

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and also how humans fit into that picture.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that we are conducting around Saturn,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and have been for the past two and a half years.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and, until Cassini had arrived there,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that we had remaining in our solar system.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It has a very large, thick atmosphere,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
more like the environment we have here on the Earth,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
except that its atmosphere is suffused with

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But these haze particles, it was surmised,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in a thick organic sludge.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000
especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It's a condensable in the atmosphere,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
it might be raining, and you might be standing

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini, 


00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is every bit as fascinating as that story is.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And yet another moon there --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And we have taken pictures like this.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
meaning it's a very young surface.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And there are features that look tectonic.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
They look like they've been pulled apart.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And so it's been tectonically altered.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
But we couldn't make sense of our images,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
until, six months after we got into orbit,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
an event occurred that many have regarded

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
This is a device of human making,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It is so significant that, in my mind,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
this was an event that should have been celebrated

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and sadly, that wasn't the case.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
(Laughter).

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It was a moving demonstration of what the words

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
"united nations" are supposed to mean:

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and to come to understand a planetary system

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
that, for all of human history, had been unreachable,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and now humans had actually touched it.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It was a tremendously emotional event,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
(Applause).

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and it also took panoramic pictures.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
those other pictures taken from orbit to be.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And you can follow these channels

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and you can see how they all converge.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You are looking at a shoreline.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
you would be flying at these altitudes.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
as you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter)

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And here is the horizon, OK?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
(Applause).

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
What the probe came down in was basically

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And it's probably the case that this material

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
has washed off the highlands of Titan

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
through these channels that we saw,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
But still, there was no sign in our images,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
separated by a few kilometers,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and they go on for miles and miles and miles.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And then, only a week and a half ago,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and having Earth-like geological formations

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and a tremendous geographical diversity,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
(Laughter).

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It is a very geologically active body.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
where we found this system of fractures.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
extending hundreds of miles into space.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
we see that these jets feed a plume

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
into the space above Enceladus.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
My team and I have examined images like this,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And we have arrived at the conclusion

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
that these jets may be erupting from pockets

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
elsewhere in our solar system,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
It is precious, it is unique,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
you would remember this very famous picture

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And in this impossibly beautiful picture,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
you see the refracted image of the Sun

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
and you see this ring created, in fact,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
by the exhalations of Enceladus.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
sight of our own planet,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Now, there is something deeply moving

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
about seeing ourselves from afar,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
in the skies of other worlds.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And thank you very much.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:52.000
(Applause)
