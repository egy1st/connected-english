00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.746
Clouds.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.368
Have you ever noticed how much
people moan about them?

00:00:05.392 --> 00:00:07.615
They get a bad rap.

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.162
If you think about it,
the English language

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:14.455
has written into it negative
associations towards the clouds.

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.922
Someone who's down or depressed,

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:18.613
they're under a cloud.

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:20.304
And when there's bad news in store,

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:23.152
there's a cloud on the horizon.

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:25.184
I saw an article the other day.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.370
It was about problems
with computer processing

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.192
over the Internet.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:35.116
"A cloud over the cloud,"
was the headline.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.099
It seems like they're everyone's default

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:39.373
doom-and-gloom metaphor.

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:41.526
But I think they're beautiful, don't you?

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.639
It's just that their beauty is missed

00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:46.639
because they're so omnipresent,

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.988
so, I don't know, commonplace,

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:51.441
that people don't notice them.

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:54.656
They don't notice the beauty,
but they don't even notice the clouds

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.933
unless they get in the way of the sun.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.238
And so people think of clouds as

00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:01.318
things that get in the way.

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:06.389
They think of them as the annoying,
frustrating obstructions,

00:01:06.413 --> 00:01:09.309
and then they rush off and do
some blue-sky thinking.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.694
(Laughter)

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.917
But most people, when
you stop to ask them,

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:18.767
will admit to harboring a strange
sort of fondness for clouds.

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:21.426
It's like a nostalgic fondness,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.560
and they make them think of their youth.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.796
Who here can't remember thinking, well,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.398
looking and finding shapes in the clouds

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:31.741
when they were kids?

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:38.472
You know, when you were
masters of daydreaming?

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:41.239
Aristophanes, the ancient
Greek playwright,

00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:44.590
he described the clouds
as the patron godesses

00:01:44.614 --> 00:01:46.374
of idle fellows

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.018
two and a half thousand years ago,

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.471
and you can see what he means.

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:53.928
It's just that these days,
us adults seem reluctant

00:01:53.952 --> 00:01:57.288
to allow ourselves the indulgence

00:01:57.312 --> 00:01:59.920
of just allowing our imaginations

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:03.590
to drift along in the breeze,
and I think that's a pity.

00:02:03.614 --> 00:02:05.976
I think we should perhaps
do a bit more of it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.996
I think we should be a bit
more willing, perhaps,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.939
to look at the beautiful sight
of the sunlight bursting out

00:02:12.963 --> 00:02:16.405
from behind the clouds
and go, "Wait a minute,

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.744
that's two cats dancing the salsa!"

00:02:18.768 --> 00:02:20.141
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:25.907
Or seeing the big, white,
puffy one up there

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:27.829
over the shopping center looks like

00:02:27.853 --> 00:02:31.462
the Abominable Snowman
going to rob a bank.

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:34.658
(Laughter)

00:02:34.682 --> 00:02:38.576
They're like nature's version
of those inkblot images,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.981
you know, that shrinks used
to show their patients

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:42.248
in the '60s,

00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:45.973
and I think if you consider
the shapes you see in the clouds,

00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:49.863
you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills.

00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:51.742
Let's say you're in love. All right?

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.939
And you look up and what do you see?

00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:56.565
Right? Or maybe the opposite.

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.609
You've just been dumped by your partner,

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:01.718
and everywhere you look,
it's kissing couples.

00:03:01.742 --> 00:03:03.670
(Laughter)

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:07.426
Perhaps you're having a moment
of existential angst.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.879
You know, you're thinking
about your own mortality.

00:03:09.903 --> 00:03:12.875
And there, on the horizon,
it's the Grim Reaper.

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.834
(Laughter)

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:19.279
Or maybe you see a topless sunbather.

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:20.908
(Laughter)

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:23.980
What would that mean?

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:29.511
What would that mean? I have no idea.

00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:31.741
But one thing I do know is this:

00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:35.116
The bad press that clouds
get is totally unfair.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.855
I think we should stand up for them,

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.308
which is why, a few years ago,

00:03:38.332 --> 00:03:40.994
I started the Cloud Appreciation Society.

00:03:41.018 --> 00:03:43.566
Tens of thousands of members now

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.592
in almost 100 countries around the world.

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:48.593
And all these photographs
that I'm showing,

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:50.949
they were sent in by members.

00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:54.413
And the society exists
to remind people of this:

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:57.460
Clouds are not something to moan about.

00:03:57.484 --> 00:03:59.843
Far from it. They are, in fact,

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:07.553
the most diverse, evocative,
poetic aspect of nature.

00:04:07.577 --> 00:04:10.820
I think, if you live
with your head in the clouds

00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:13.797
every now and then, it helps you
keep your feet on the ground.

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:15.419
And I want to show you
why, with the help of

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:17.499
some of my favorite types of clouds.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.857
Let's start with this one.
It's the cirrus cloud,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.776
named after the Latin for a lock of hair.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.397
It's composed entirely of ice crystals

00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:26.913
cascading from the upper
reaches of the troposphere,

00:04:26.937 --> 00:04:28.414
and as these ice crystals fall,

00:04:28.438 --> 00:04:31.058
they pass through different
layers with different winds

00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:32.742
and they speed up and slow down,

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:35.801
giving the cloud these
brush-stroked appearances,

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:38.736
these brush-stroke forms
known as fall streaks.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.747
And these winds up there
can be very, very fierce.

00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:43.328
They can be 200 miles
an hour, 300 miles an hour.

00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:44.829
These clouds are bombing along,

00:04:44.853 --> 00:04:46.612
but from all the way down here,

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:49.760
they appear to be moving
gracefully, slowly,

00:04:49.784 --> 00:04:51.969
like most clouds.

00:04:51.993 --> 00:04:55.192
And so to tune into the clouds
is to slow down,

00:04:55.216 --> 00:04:57.137
to calm down.

00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:59.970
It's like a bit of everyday meditation.

00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:01.130
Those are common clouds.

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:03.932
What about rarer ones,
like the lenticularis,

00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:06.283
the UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?

00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:08.803
These clouds form
in the region of mountains.

00:05:08.827 --> 00:05:11.688
When the wind passes, rises
to pass over the mountain,

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:14.927
it can take on a wave-like
path in the lee of the peak,

00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:17.654
with these clouds hovering at the crest

00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:20.314
of these invisible standing waves of air,

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:22.576
these flying saucer-like forms,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.240
and some of the early
black-and-white UFO photos

00:05:25.264 --> 00:05:28.156
are in fact lenticularis clouds.
It's true.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.995
A little rarer are the fallstreak holes.
All right?

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:34.400
This is when a layer is made
up of very, very cold

00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:37.247
water droplets, and in one region
they start to freeze,

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:40.414
and this freezing sets off a chain
reaction which spreads outwards

00:05:40.438 --> 00:05:43.118
with the ice crystals cascading
and falling down below,

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:47.957
giving the appearance
of jellyfish tendrils down below.

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:52.037
Rarer still, the Kelvin–Helmholtz cloud.

00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:55.479
Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.

00:05:55.503 --> 00:05:59.239
This looks like a series
of breaking waves,

00:05:59.263 --> 00:06:01.933
and it's caused by shearing
winds -- the wind

00:06:01.957 --> 00:06:04.196
above the cloud layer
and below the cloud layer

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.751
differ significantly,
and in the middle, in between,

00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:08.634
you get this undulating of the air,

00:06:08.658 --> 00:06:11.135
and if the difference in those
speeds is just right,

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.037
the tops of the undulations curl over

00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:16.599
in these beautiful breaking
wave-like vortices.

00:06:16.623 --> 00:06:19.004
All right. Those are rarer
clouds than the cirrus,

00:06:19.028 --> 00:06:20.711
but they're not that rare.

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:23.559
If you look up, and you
pay attention to the sky,

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.432
you'll see them sooner or later,

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:28.218
maybe not quite as dramatic
as these, but you'll see them.

00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:30.272
And you'll see them around where you live.

00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:32.833
Clouds are the most egalitarian

00:06:32.857 --> 00:06:35.507
of nature's displays,
because we all have a good,

00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:38.138
fantastic view of the sky.

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:39.978
And these clouds, these rarer clouds,

00:06:40.002 --> 00:06:44.698
remind us that the exotic can
be found in the everyday.

00:06:44.722 --> 00:06:47.457
Nothing is more nourishing,
more stimulating

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.924
to an active, inquiring
mind than being surprised,

00:06:50.948 --> 00:06:54.620
being amazed. It's why we're
all here at TED, right?

00:06:54.644 --> 00:06:57.565
But you don't need to rush off

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.925
away from the familiar, across the world

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.387
to be surprised.

00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:04.162
You just need to step outside,

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:06.738
pay attention to what's so
commonplace, so everyday,

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:10.725
so mundane that everybody else misses it.

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:13.139
One cloud that people
rarely miss is this one:

00:07:13.163 --> 00:07:16.107
the cumulonimbus storm cloud.

00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:18.608
It's what's produces thunder
and lightning and hail.

00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:21.716
These clouds spread
out at the top in this enormous

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.538
anvil fashion stretching 10
miles up into the atmosphere.

00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:27.957
They are an expression
of the majestic architecture

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.842
of our atmosphere.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:33.228
But from down below,
they are the embodiment

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:37.359
of the powerful, elemental force and power

00:07:37.383 --> 00:07:39.253
that drives our atmosphere.

00:07:39.277 --> 00:07:43.367
To be there is to be connected
in the driving rain

00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:46.669
and the hail, to feel
connected to our atmosphere.

00:07:46.693 --> 00:07:48.967
It's to be reminded that we are creatures

00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:50.676
that inhabit this ocean of air.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.073
We don't live beneath the sky.
We live within it.

00:07:54.097 --> 00:07:58.156
And that connection, that visceral
connection to our atmosphere

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.592
feels to me like an antidote.

00:08:00.616 --> 00:08:03.696
It's an antidote to the growing
tendency we have

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.571
to feel that we can really
ever experience life

00:08:07.595 --> 00:08:09.786
by watching it on a computer
screen, you know,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.236
when we're in a wi-fi zone.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.520
But the one cloud that best expresses

00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:17.445
why cloudspotting is more
valuable today than ever

00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:20.636
is this one, the cumulus cloud.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.715
Right? It forms on a sunny day.

00:08:22.739 --> 00:08:24.835
If you close your eyes
and think of a cloud,

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:27.184
it's probably one of these
that comes to mind.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.808
All those cloud shapes at the beginning,

00:08:29.832 --> 00:08:31.951
those were cumulus clouds.

00:08:31.975 --> 00:08:35.575
The sharp, crisp outlines
of this formation

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.731
make it the best
one for finding shapes in.

00:08:38.755 --> 00:08:40.703
And it reminds us

00:08:40.727 --> 00:08:44.647
of the aimless nature of cloudspotting,

00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:46.896
what an aimless activity it is.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.635
You're not going to change the world

00:08:48.659 --> 00:08:52.687
by lying on your back and gazing
up at the sky, are you?

00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:54.910
It's pointless. It's a pointless activity,

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:59.766
which is precisely why it's so important.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.795
The digital world
conspires to make us feel

00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:06.566
eternally busy, perpetually busy.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.400
You know, when you're not dealing with

00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:11.078
the traditional pressures
of earning a living

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:13.732
and putting food on the table,
raising a family,

00:09:13.756 --> 00:09:15.806
writing thank you letters,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.518
you have to now contend with

00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:22.084
answering a mountain of unanswered emails,

00:09:22.108 --> 00:09:23.942
updating a Facebook page,

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:26.490
feeding your Twitter feed.

00:09:26.514 --> 00:09:30.276
And cloudspotting
legitimizes doing nothing.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.181
(Laughter)

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:34.833
And sometimes we need —

00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:40.441
(Applause)

00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:44.524
Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing.

00:09:44.548 --> 00:09:47.306
We need to be reminded by these

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.838
patron goddesses of idle fellows

00:09:50.862 --> 00:09:53.813
that slowing down

00:09:53.837 --> 00:09:57.616
and being in the present,
not thinking about

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.470
what you've got to do
and what you should have done,

00:10:00.494 --> 00:10:03.205
but just being here,
letting your imagination

00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:05.967
lift from the everyday concerns down here

00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:08.799
and just being in the present,
it's good for you,

00:10:08.823 --> 00:10:10.937
and it's good for the way you feel.

00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:14.505
It's good for your ideas.
It's good for your creativity.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:17.855
It's good for your soul.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:20.082
So keep looking up,

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:23.135
marvel at the ephemeral beauty,

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:26.559
and always remember to live life
with your head in the clouds.

00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:27.746
Thank you very much.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:33.417
(Applause)
