00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:03.557
Throughout the history of computers

00:00:03.581 --> 00:00:06.804
we've been striving
to shorten the gap between us

00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:08.398
and digital information,

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:10.232
the gap between our physical world

00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:12.030
and the world in the screen

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:14.872
where our imagination can go wild.

00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:18.799
And this gap has become shorter,

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:21.564
shorter, and even shorter,

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.208
and now this gap is shortened down

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:24.518
to less than a millimeter,

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.396
the thickness of a touch-screen glass,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.846
and the power of computing

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.749
has become accessible to everyone.

00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:37.788
But I wondered, what if there
could be no boundary at all?

00:00:37.812 --> 00:00:41.532
I started to imagine
what this would look like.

00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:43.983
First, I created this tool

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:46.492
which penetrates into the digital space,

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.583
so when you press it hard on the screen,

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:51.916
it transfers its physical
body into pixels.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.028
Designers can materialize their ideas

00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:55.724
directly in 3D,

00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:58.276
and surgeons can practice
on virtual organs

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.500
underneath the screen.

00:01:00.524 --> 00:01:05.397
So with this tool, this
boundary has been broken.

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:08.364
But our two hands still
remain outside the screen.

00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:10.848
How can you reach inside and interact

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:12.275
with the digital information

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.279
using the full dexterity of our hands?

00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:17.581
At Microsoft Applied Sciences,

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.497
along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:20.768
I redesigned the computer

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:23.649
and turned a little space
above the keyboard

00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:26.014
into a digital workspace.

00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:28.515
By combining a transparent
display and depth cameras

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.165
for sensing your fingers and face,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.475
now you can lift up your hands
from the keyboard

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.313
and reach inside this 3D space

00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:37.813
and grab pixels with your bare hands.

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:40.784
(Applause)

00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:44.990
Because windows and files have
a position in the real space,

00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:48.349
selecting them is as easy
as grabbing a book off your shelf.

00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:50.502
Then you can flip through this book

00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:52.219
while highlighting the lines, words

00:01:52.243 --> 00:01:54.783
on the virtual touch pad
below each floating window.

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:57.318
Architects can stretch
or rotate the models

00:01:57.342 --> 00:01:59.743
with their two hands directly.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.363
So in these examples,

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.100
we are reaching into the digital world.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.446
But how about reversing its role

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.265
and having the digital
information reach us instead?

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.337
I'm sure many of us
have had the experience

00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:15.444
of buying and returning items online.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.421
But now you don't have to worry about it.

00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:22.059
What I got here is an online
augmented fitting room.

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:23.961
This is a view that you get from

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:25.705
head-mounted or see-through display

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:30.852
when the system understands
the geometry of your body.

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:34.403
Taking this idea further,
I started to think,

00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:37.772
instead of just seeing
these pixels in our space,

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:39.294
how can we make it physical

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:43.556
so that we can touch and feel it?

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.605
What would such a future look like?

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.263
At MIT Media Lab,
along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii

00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:52.286
and my collaborator Rehmi Post,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.930
we created this one physical pixel.

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:58.554
Well, in this case, this spherical magnet

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.906
acts like a 3D pixel in our space,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.810
which means that both computers and people

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.708
can move this object to anywhere

00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:07.677
within this little 3D space.

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:11.169
What we did was essentially
canceling gravity

00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:13.308
and controlling the movement by combining

00:03:13.332 --> 00:03:16.132
magnetic levitation
and mechanical actuation

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:18.609
and sensing technologies.

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:21.114
And by digitally programming the object,

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:23.891
we are liberating
the object from constraints

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:27.326
of time and space, which means that now,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.222
human motions can be
recorded and played back

00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:34.841
and left permanently
in the physical world.

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:37.874
So choreography can be taught
physically over distance

00:03:37.898 --> 00:03:40.470
and Michael Jordan's famous
shooting can be replicated

00:03:40.494 --> 00:03:43.948
over and over as a physical reality.

00:03:43.972 --> 00:03:46.128
Students can use this as a tool

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:48.070
to learn about the complex concepts

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:52.154
such as planetary motion, physics,

00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:54.973
and unlike computer screens or textbooks,

00:03:54.997 --> 00:03:57.455
this is a real, tangible experience

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.113
that you can touch and feel,
and it's very powerful.

00:04:01.137 --> 00:04:03.095
And what's more exciting

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:06.443
than just turning what's currently
in the computer physical

00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:09.632
is to start imagining
how programming the world

00:04:09.656 --> 00:04:13.352
will alter even our daily
physical activities.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.918
(Laughter)

00:04:17.942 --> 00:04:20.675
As you can see, the digital information

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.193
will not just show us something

00:04:22.217 --> 00:04:24.303
but it will start directly acting upon us

00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:26.602
as a part of our physical surroundings

00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:30.800
without disconnecting
ourselves from our world.

00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:35.146
Today, we started by talking
about the boundary,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.826
but if we remove this boundary,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.714
the only boundary left is our imagination.

00:04:41.738 --> 00:04:42.962
Thank you.

00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:48.071
(Applause)
