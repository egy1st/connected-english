00:00:02.583 --> 00:00:09.583
(Music)

00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:49.264
(Applause)

00:01:49.288 --> 00:01:56.288
(Music)

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.037
(Music ends)

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:16.443
(Applause)

00:02:19.124 --> 00:02:21.103
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.322
Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.

00:02:23.346 --> 00:02:25.672
We're so excited to be here.
It's such an honor.

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:28.259
Like he said, we're
three brothers from New Jersey --

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:30.935
you know, the bluegrass
capital of the world.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.746
(Laughter)

00:02:33.182 --> 00:02:35.919
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago,

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:37.332
and we fell in love with it.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.699
We hope you guys will too.

00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:42.738
This next song is an original
we wrote called "Time Lapse,"

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.802
and it will probably live up to its name.

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:51.826
(Tuning)

00:02:53.528 --> 00:03:00.528
(Music)

00:04:35.768 --> 00:04:36.918
(Music ends)

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.639
(Applause)

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:50.908
TM: Thank you very much.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.092
RM: I'm just going to take
a second to introduce the band.

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:57.380
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.

00:04:57.404 --> 00:05:02.985
(Applause)

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.786
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:09.042
(Applause)

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:10.462
He's also our brother.

00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:13.812
And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14,
and I play the fiddle.

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:18.604
(Applause)

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.847
As you can see, we decided
to make it hard on ourselves,

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:23.396
and we chose to play three songs

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.664
in three different keys.

00:05:24.688 --> 00:05:27.037
(Tuning)

00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:29.966
Yeah. I'm also going to explain,
a lot of people want to know

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.441
where we got the name
"Sleepy Man Banjo Boys" from.

00:05:32.913 --> 00:05:35.181
So, it started when Jonny was little,

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:38.579
and he first started the banjo,
he would play on his back

00:05:38.603 --> 00:05:39.836
with his eyes closed,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.954
and we'd say it looked
like he was sleeping.

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.484
So you can probably piece
the rest together.

00:05:44.508 --> 00:05:46.556
TM: We can't really figure out the reason.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.555
It might have been
that it weighs about a million pounds.

00:05:50.378 --> 00:05:57.378
(Music)

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.804
(Applause)

00:07:31.828 --> 00:07:38.828
(Music)

00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:13.206
(Music ends)

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:18.264
(Applause)

00:08:18.288 --> 00:08:19.716
TM: Thank you very much.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.891
(Cheering)

00:08:20.915 --> 00:08:22.399
RM: Thank you.

00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:29.423
(Applause)
