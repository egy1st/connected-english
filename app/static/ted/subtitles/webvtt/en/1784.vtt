00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:02.828
When we talk about corruption,

00:00:02.852 --> 00:00:06.298
there are typical types
of individuals that spring to mind.

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.626
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.815
Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.803
Until his death in 2006,

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:17.109
he was the all-powerful
leader of Turkmenistan,

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.874
a Central Asian country
rich in natural gas.

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:24.824
Now, he really loved to issue
presidential decrees.

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:27.069
And one renamed the months of the year

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:30.219
including after himself and his mother.

00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:32.253
He spent millions of dollars

00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:35.073
creating a bizarre personality cult,

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.042
and his crowning glory was the building

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:41.082
of a 40-foot-high gold-plated
statue of himself

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:44.146
which stood proudly
in the capital's central square

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.138
and rotated to follow the sun.

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:49.911
He was a slightly unusual guy.

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:51.768
And then there's that cliché,

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:55.167
the African dictator
or minister or official.

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:58.278
There's Teodorín Obiang.

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:02.509
So his daddy is president
for life of Equatorial Guinea,

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.633
a West African nation that has exported

00:01:05.657 --> 00:01:09.114
billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s

00:01:09.138 --> 00:01:13.158
and yet has a truly appalling
human rights record.

00:01:13.182 --> 00:01:15.052
The vast majority of its people

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:18.007
are living in really miserable poverty

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.127
despite an income
per capita that's on a par

00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.625
with that of Portugal.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.330
So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself

00:01:25.354 --> 00:01:29.762
a $30 million mansion
in Malibu, California.

00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:30.863
I've been up to its front gates.

00:01:30.887 --> 00:01:33.958
I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.

00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:37.677
He bought an €18 million art collection

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.816
that used to belong to fashion
designer Yves Saint Laurent,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.364
a stack of fabulous sports cars,

00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:45.919
some costing a million dollars apiece --

00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:48.235
oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.596
Now get this:

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.737
Until recently, he was earning
an official monthly salary

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:57.891
of less than 7,000 dollars.

00:01:57.915 --> 00:01:59.944
And there's Dan Etete.

00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:02.588
Well, he was the former
oil minister of Nigeria

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:04.562
under President Abacha,

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:08.064
and it just so happens
he's a convicted money launderer too.

00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:10.306
We've spent a great deal of time

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.707
investigating a $1 billion --

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.470
that's right, a $1 billion —

00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:17.131
oil deal that he was involved with,

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:19.083
and what we found was pretty shocking,

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:21.849
but more about that later.

00:02:21.873 --> 00:02:25.366
So it's easy to think
that corruption happens

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.226
somewhere over there,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.682
carried out by a bunch of greedy despots

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:31.706
and individuals up to no good in countries

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.714
that we, personally, may
know very little about

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.403
and feel really unconnected to

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:39.891
and unaffected by what might be going on.

00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:43.134
But does it just happen over there?

00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:46.413
Well, at 22, I was very lucky.

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:49.194
My first job out of university

00:02:49.218 --> 00:02:53.178
was investigating the illegal
trade in African ivory.

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:57.407
And that's how my relationship
with corruption really began.

00:02:57.431 --> 00:03:00.415
In 1993, with two friends
who were colleagues,

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.218
Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley,

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:06.819
we set up an organization
called Global Witness.

00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:09.569
Our first campaign
was investigating the role

00:03:09.593 --> 00:03:13.875
of illegal logging in funding
the war in Cambodia.

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.918
So a few years later, and it's now 1997,

00:03:16.942 --> 00:03:21.679
and I'm in Angola undercover
investigating blood diamonds.

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:23.406
Perhaps you saw the film,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.097
the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,"

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.674
the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:03:26.698 --> 00:03:30.129
Well, some of that sprang from our work.

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:32.845
Luanda, it was full of land mine victims

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.025
who were struggling
to survive on the streets

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.113
and war orphans living
in sewers under the streets,

00:03:38.137 --> 00:03:40.202
and a tiny, very wealthy elite

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:43.421
who gossiped about shopping
trips to Brazil and Portugal.

00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:46.182
And it was a slightly crazy place.

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:49.866
So I'm sitting in a hot
and very stuffy hotel room

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.926
feeling just totally overwhelmed.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.282
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:58.184
Because I'd been speaking
to lots of people there

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:00.552
who, well, they talked
about a different problem:

00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:03.973
that of a massive web
of corruption on a global scale

00:04:03.997 --> 00:04:07.307
and millions of oil dollars going missing.

00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:09.768
And for what was then
a very small organization

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:11.916
of just a few people,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.658
trying to even begin to think
how we might tackle that

00:04:14.682 --> 00:04:17.129
was an enormous challenge.

00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:18.677
And in the years that I've been,

00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.232
and we've all been campaigning
and investigating,

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:23.495
I've repeatedly seen
that what makes corruption

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:25.763
on a global, massive scale possible,

00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:28.897
well it isn't just greed
or the misuse of power

00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:31.336
or that nebulous phrase "weak governance."

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.373
I mean, yes, it's all of those,

00:04:33.397 --> 00:04:36.325
but corruption, it's made
possible by the actions

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.946
of global facilitators.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.136
So let's go back to some of those
people I talked about earlier.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.653
Now, they're all people
we've investigated,

00:04:44.677 --> 00:04:47.439
and they're all people who couldn't
do what they do alone.

00:04:47.463 --> 00:04:49.879
Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up

00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:53.718
with high-end art and luxury
houses without help.

00:04:53.742 --> 00:04:55.893
He did business with global banks.

00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:59.732
A bank in Paris held accounts
of companies controlled by him,

00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:02.130
one of which was used to buy the art,

00:05:02.154 --> 00:05:04.771
and American banks, well, they funneled

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:07.707
73 million dollars into the States,

00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:11.806
some of which was used to buy
that California mansion.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.714
And he didn't do all of this
in his own name either.

00:05:14.738 --> 00:05:16.468
He used shell companies.

00:05:16.492 --> 00:05:18.802
He used one to buy
the property, and another,

00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:20.888
which was in somebody else's name,

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:24.886
to pay the huge bills it
cost to run the place.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.114
And then there's Dan Etete.

00:05:27.138 --> 00:05:29.196
Well, when he was oil minister,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.326
he awarded an oil block now
worth over a billion dollars

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.160
to a company that, guess what, yeah,

00:05:37.184 --> 00:05:39.543
he was the hidden owner of.

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:42.945
Now, it was then much later traded on

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.541
with the kind assistance
of the Nigerian government --

00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:47.623
now I have to be careful what I say here —

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:51.772
to subsidiaries of Shell
and the Italian Eni,

00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:54.426
two of the biggest oil companies around.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.879
So the reality is,
is that the engine of corruption,

00:05:56.903 --> 00:05:59.322
well, it exists far
beyond the shores of countries

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:02.521
like Equatorial Guinea
or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.

00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:04.845
This engine, well, it's driven

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.211
by our international banking system,

00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:09.754
by the problem of anonymous
shell companies,

00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:12.136
and by the secrecy that we have afforded

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.105
big oil, gas and mining operations,

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.838
and, most of all, by the failure
of our politicians

00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:20.913
to back up their rhetoric and do something

00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:25.905
really meaningful and systemic
to tackle this stuff.

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:27.916
Now let's take the banks first.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.250
Well, it's not going
to come as any surprise

00:06:30.274 --> 00:06:34.562
for me to tell you that banks
accept dirty money,

00:06:34.586 --> 00:06:39.106
but they prioritize their profits
in other destructive ways too.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.213
For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.

00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:45.852
Now this region, it has just five percent

00:06:45.876 --> 00:06:51.268
of its forests left intact. Five percent.

00:06:51.292 --> 00:06:52.603
So how did that happen?

00:06:52.627 --> 00:06:55.659
Well, because an elite
and its facilitators

00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:57.833
have been making millions of dollars

00:06:57.857 --> 00:07:01.364
from supporting logging
on an industrial scale

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:03.770
for many years.

00:07:03.794 --> 00:07:06.024
So we sent an undercover investigator in

00:07:06.048 --> 00:07:09.614
to secretly film meetings
with members of the ruling elite,

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.945
and the resulting footage, well,
it made some people very angry,

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:15.195
and you can see that on YouTube,

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:17.172
but it proved what we had long suspected,

00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:20.669
because it showed
how the state's chief minister,

00:07:20.693 --> 00:07:22.579
despite his later denials,

00:07:22.603 --> 00:07:25.978
used his control over land
and forest licenses

00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:29.009
to enrich himself and his family.

00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:33.608
And HSBC, well, we know
that HSBC bankrolled

00:07:33.632 --> 00:07:35.617
the region's largest logging companies

00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:38.022
that were responsible
for some of that destruction

00:07:38.046 --> 00:07:40.609
in Sarawak and elsewhere.

00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:44.317
The bank violated its own
sustainability policies in the process,

00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:48.137
but it earned around 130 million dollars.

00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:50.473
Now shortly after our exposé,

00:07:50.497 --> 00:07:53.075
very shortly after our exposé
earlier this year,

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:56.079
the bank announced
a policy review on this.

00:07:56.103 --> 00:07:58.665
And is this progress? Maybe,

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:01.168
but we're going to be
keeping a very close eye

00:08:01.192 --> 00:08:03.505
on that case.

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:06.918
And then there's the problem
of anonymous shell companies.

00:08:06.942 --> 00:08:09.747
Well, we've all heard
about what they are, I think,

00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:12.243
and we all know they're used quite a bit

00:08:12.267 --> 00:08:14.829
by people and companies
who are trying to avoid

00:08:14.853 --> 00:08:17.876
paying their proper dues to society,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.929
also known as taxes.

00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:22.838
But what doesn't usually come to light

00:08:22.862 --> 00:08:27.388
is how shell companies are used to steal

00:08:27.412 --> 00:08:30.760
huge sums of money,
transformational sums of money,

00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:32.806
from poor countries.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.226
In virtually every case of corruption
that we've investigated,

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.438
shell companies have appeared,

00:08:38.462 --> 00:08:40.798
and sometimes
it's been impossible to find out

00:08:40.822 --> 00:08:44.310
who is really involved in the deal.

00:08:44.334 --> 00:08:46.638
A recent study by the World Bank

00:08:46.662 --> 00:08:49.588
looked at 200 cases of corruption.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.678
It found that over 70
percent of those cases

00:08:52.702 --> 00:08:55.632
had used anonymous shell companies,

00:08:55.656 --> 00:08:59.014
totaling almost 56 billion dollars.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.276
Now many of these
companies were in America

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.586
or the United Kingdom,

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.987
its overseas territories
and Crown dependencies,

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.241
and so it's not just an offshore problem,

00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:09.533
it's an on-shore one too.

00:09:09.557 --> 00:09:11.672
You see, shell companies, they're central

00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:14.926
to the secret deals which may
benefit wealthy elites

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.950
rather than ordinary citizens.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.196
One striking recent case
that we've investigated

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.172
is how the government
in the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:28.529
sold off a series of valuable,
state-owned mining assets

00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:31.883
to shell companies
in the British Virgin Islands.

00:09:31.907 --> 00:09:34.155
So we spoke to sources in country,

00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:37.191
trawled through company
documents and other information

00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:41.246
trying to piece together a really
true picture of the deal.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.071
And we were alarmed to find
that these shell companies

00:09:44.095 --> 00:09:46.587
had quickly flipped many of the assets on

00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:50.808
for huge profits to major
international mining companies

00:09:50.832 --> 00:09:53.171
listed in London.

00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:56.427
Now, the Africa Progress
Panel, led by Kofi Annan,

00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:59.315
they've calculated
that Congo may have lost

00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:04.419
more than 1.3 billion dollars
from these deals.

00:10:04.443 --> 00:10:06.672
That's almost twice

00:10:06.696 --> 00:10:12.312
the country's annual health
and education budget combined.

00:10:12.336 --> 00:10:14.938
And will the people of Congo,
will they ever get their money back?

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.596
Well, the answer to that question,

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.490
and who was really involved
and what really happened,

00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:20.993
well that's going to probably
remain locked away

00:10:21.017 --> 00:10:24.142
in the secretive company registries
of the British Virgin Islands

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:28.976
and elsewhere unless we all do
something about it.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.963
And how about the oil, gas
and mining companies?

00:10:31.987 --> 00:10:34.677
Okay, maybe it's a bit
of a cliché to talk about them.

00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:36.797
Corruption in that sector, no surprise.

00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:41.230
There's corruption everywhere,
so why focus on that sector?

00:10:41.254 --> 00:10:43.430
Well, because there's a lot at stake.

00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:47.527
In 2011, natural resource exports

00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:51.039
outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one

00:10:51.063 --> 00:10:55.462
in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Nineteen to one.

00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:59.099
Now that's a hell of a lot
of schools and universities

00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:01.076
and hospitals and business startups,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.434
many of which haven't
materialized and never will

00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:07.765
because some of that money
has simply been stolen away.

00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:10.170
Now let's go back to the oil
and mining companies,

00:11:10.194 --> 00:11:13.186
and let's go back to Dan Etete
and that $1 billion deal.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.475
And now forgive me, I'm
going to read the next bit

00:11:16.499 --> 00:11:18.772
because it's a very live
issue, and our lawyers

00:11:18.796 --> 00:11:20.962
have been through this in some detail

00:11:20.986 --> 00:11:24.272
and they want me to get it right.

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:28.445
Now, on the surface, the deal
appeared straightforward.

00:11:28.469 --> 00:11:30.545
Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni

00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:33.519
paid the Nigerian
government for the block.

00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:35.682
The Nigerian government transferred

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:38.506
precisely the same amount,
to the very dollar,

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:43.121
to an account earmarked
for a shell company

00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:45.247
whose hidden owner was Etete.

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.636
Now, that's not bad going
for a convicted money launderer.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.093
And here's the thing.

00:11:50.117 --> 00:11:51.970
After many months of digging around

00:11:51.994 --> 00:11:55.505
and reading through hundreds
of pages of court documents,

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:57.460
we found evidence that, in fact,

00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:00.889
Shell and Eni had known that the funds

00:12:00.913 --> 00:12:03.964
would be transferred
to that shell company,

00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:07.671
and frankly, it's hard
to believe they didn't know

00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:10.962
who they were really dealing with there.

00:12:10.986 --> 00:12:14.050
Now, it just shouldn't take
these sorts of efforts

00:12:14.074 --> 00:12:16.579
to find out where the money
in deals like this went.

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:18.148
I mean, these are state assets.

00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:19.614
They're supposed to be
used for the benefit

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:21.347
of the people in the country.

00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:24.536
But in some countries,
citizens and journalists

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.560
who are trying to expose stories like this

00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:28.061
have been harassed and arrested

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:32.516
and some have even risked
their lives to do so.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.320
And finally, well, there
are those who believe

00:12:36.344 --> 00:12:38.644
that corruption is unavoidable.

00:12:38.668 --> 00:12:40.793
It's just how some business is done.

00:12:40.817 --> 00:12:43.358
It's too complex and difficult to change.

00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:46.285
So in effect, what? We just accept it.

00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:48.678
But as a campaigner and investigator,

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:49.729
I have a different view,

00:12:49.753 --> 00:12:51.899
because I've seen what can happen

00:12:51.923 --> 00:12:54.453
when an idea gains momentum.

00:12:54.477 --> 00:12:57.197
In the oil and mining sector, for example,

00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.460
there is now the beginning

00:12:58.484 --> 00:13:01.709
of a truly worldwide transparency standard

00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:04.729
that could tackle some of these problems.

00:13:04.753 --> 00:13:07.151
In 1999, when Global Witness called

00:13:07.175 --> 00:13:10.490
for oil companies to make
payments on deals transparent,

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:14.279
well, some people laughed
at the extreme naiveté

00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:16.382
of that small idea.

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:19.952
But literally hundreds
of civil society groups

00:13:19.976 --> 00:13:21.830
from around the world came together

00:13:21.854 --> 00:13:23.439
to fight for transparency,

00:13:23.463 --> 00:13:27.420
and now it's fast becoming
the norm and the law.

00:13:27.444 --> 00:13:29.392
Two thirds of the value

00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:31.712
of the world's oil and mining companies

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:35.483
are now covered by transparency laws.
Two thirds.

00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:36.956
So this is change happening.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.846
This is progress.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.969
But we're not there yet, by far.

00:13:41.993 --> 00:13:44.215
Because it really isn't about corruption

00:13:44.239 --> 00:13:46.330
somewhere over there, is it?

00:13:46.354 --> 00:13:48.535
In a globalized world, corruption

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:50.798
is a truly globalized business,

00:13:50.822 --> 00:13:52.913
and one that needs global solutions,

00:13:52.937 --> 00:13:56.913
supported and pushed by us
all, as global citizens,

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:58.075
right here.

00:13:58.099 --> 00:13:59.265
Thank you.

00:13:59.289 --> 00:14:06.105
(Applause)
