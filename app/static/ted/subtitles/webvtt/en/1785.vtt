00:00:01.342 --> 00:00:04.138
This is my grandfather.

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:06.482
And this is my son.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.710
My grandfather taught me to work with wood

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:10.344
when I was a little boy,

00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:12.347
and he also taught me the idea that

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:15.256
if you cut down a tree
to turn it into something,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.535
honor that tree's life
and make it as beautiful

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.685
as you possibly can.

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:23.197
My little boy reminded me

00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.076
that for all the technology
and all the toys in the world,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.466
sometimes just a small block of wood,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.297
if you stack it up tall,

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:34.380
actually is an incredibly inspiring thing.

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:36.217
These are my buildings.

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.937
I build all around the world

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.769
out of our office
in Vancouver and New York.

00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:43.530
And we build buildings
of different sizes and styles

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:45.556
and different materials,
depending on where we are.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.839
But wood is the material
that I love the most,

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:49.794
and I'm going to tell you
the story about wood.

00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:51.790
And part of the reason
I love it is that every time

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:54.083
people go into my buildings that are wood,

00:00:54.107 --> 00:00:56.829
I notice they react
completely differently.

00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:59.377
I've never seen anybody walk
into one of my buildings

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:01.730
and hug a steel or a concrete column,

00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:04.629
but I've actually seen
that happen in a wood building.

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:07.126
I've actually seen
how people touch the wood,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.211
and I think there's a reason for it.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.717
Just like snowflakes,
no two pieces of wood

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:14.401
can ever be the same anywhere on Earth.

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:16.298
That's a wonderful thing.

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.834
I like to think that wood

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:22.395
gives Mother Nature
fingerprints in our buildings.

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:24.481
It's Mother
Nature's fingerprints that make

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:29.127
our buildings connect us to nature
in the built environment.

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.189
Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest

00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:34.266
that grows to 33 stories tall.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.814
Down the coast here
in California, the redwood forest

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:39.866
grows to 40 stories tall.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.508
But the buildings
that we think about in wood

00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:45.613
are only four stories tall
in most places on Earth.

00:01:45.637 --> 00:01:49.334
Even building codes actually limit
the ability for us to build

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:51.717
much taller than four
stories in many places,

00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:53.741
and that's true here in the United States.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:55.569
Now there are exceptions,

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:57.117
but there needs to be some exceptions,

00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:59.189
and things are going
to change, I'm hoping.

00:01:59.213 --> 00:02:01.162
And the reason I think that way is that

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:04.286
today half of us live in cities,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.674
and that number is going
to grow to 75 percent.

00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:09.759
Cities and density mean that our buildings

00:02:09.783 --> 00:02:12.205
are going to continue to be big,

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.023
and I think there's a role
for wood to play in cities.

00:02:16.047 --> 00:02:19.179
And I feel that way
because three billion people

00:02:19.203 --> 00:02:22.025
in the world today,
over the next 20 years,

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.545
will need a new home.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.093
That's 40 percent of the world
that are going to need

00:02:26.117 --> 00:02:29.178
a new building built for them
in the next 20 years.

00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:31.753
Now, one in three people
living in cities today

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.603
actually live in a slum.

00:02:33.627 --> 00:02:36.944
That's one billion people
in the world live in slums.

00:02:36.968 --> 00:02:41.265
A hundred million people
in the world are homeless.

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.856
The scale of the challenge for architects

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.997
and for society to deal with in building

00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:50.591
is to find a solution
to house these people.

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:54.071
But the challenge is,
as we move to cities,

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:57.060
cities are built in these two materials,

00:02:57.084 --> 00:03:00.306
steel and concrete,
and they're great materials.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.408
They're the materials of the last century.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:04.997
But they're also materials
with very high energy

00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:09.316
and very high greenhouse gas
emissions in their process.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.591
Steel represents about three percent

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:13.911
of man's greenhouse gas emissions,

00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:16.512
and concrete is over five percent.

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:19.126
So if you think about that, eight percent

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.543
of our contribution
to greenhouse gases today

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:25.711
comes from those two materials alone.

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:28.127
We don't think about it
a lot, and unfortunately,

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.723
we actually don't even think
about buildings, I think,

00:03:30.747 --> 00:03:31.923
as much as we should.

00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:35.543
This is a U.S. statistic
about the impact of greenhouse gases.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:38.809
Almost half of our greenhouse gases
are related to the building industry,

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.096
and if we look at energy,
it's the same story.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.263
You'll notice that transportation's sort
of second down that list,

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:46.953
but that's the conversation
we mostly hear about.

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:50.519
And although a lot
of that is about energy,

00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:53.400
it's also so much about carbon.

00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:56.383
The problem I see is that, ultimately,

00:03:56.407 --> 00:03:58.690
the clash of how we solve that problem

00:03:58.714 --> 00:04:01.958
of serving those three billion people
that need a home,

00:04:01.982 --> 00:04:05.430
and climate change,
are a head-on collision

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:08.383
about to happen, or already happening.

00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:11.094
That challenge means that we have
to start thinking in new ways,

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.690
and I think wood is going
to be part of that solution,

00:04:13.714 --> 00:04:15.276
and I'm going to tell
you the story of why.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.690
As an architect, wood
is the only material,

00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:20.106
big material, that I can build with

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.076
that's already grown
by the power of the sun.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.854
When a tree grows in the forest
and gives off oxygen

00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:28.951
and soaks up carbon dioxide,

00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:31.917
and it dies and it falls
to the forest floor,

00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:36.222
it gives that carbon dioxide back
to the atmosphere or into the ground.

00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:39.192
If it burns in a forest fire,
it's going to give that carbon

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:41.628
back to the atmosphere as well.

00:04:41.652 --> 00:04:44.672
But if you take that wood
and you put it into a building

00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:48.008
or into a piece of furniture
or into that wooden toy,

00:04:48.032 --> 00:04:49.699
it actually has an amazing capacity

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:53.854
to store the carbon and provide
us with a sequestration.

00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:57.133
One cubic meter of wood will store

00:04:57.157 --> 00:04:59.899
one tonne of carbon dioxide.

00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:02.114
Now our two solutions
to climate are obviously

00:05:02.138 --> 00:05:04.650
to reduce our emissions and find storage.

00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:07.008
Wood is the only major
material building material

00:05:07.032 --> 00:05:10.608
I can build with that actually
does both those two things.

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:13.709
So I believe that we have

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:16.261
an ethic that the Earth grows our food,

00:05:16.285 --> 00:05:18.524
and we need to move
to an ethic in this century

00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:21.205
that the Earth should grow our homes.

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.774
Now, how are we going to do that

00:05:22.798 --> 00:05:24.064
when we're urbanizing at this rate

00:05:24.088 --> 00:05:26.664
and we think about wood
buildings only at four stories?

00:05:26.688 --> 00:05:29.165
We need to reduce the concrete
and steel and we need

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.380
to grow bigger,
and what we've been working on

00:05:31.404 --> 00:05:35.728
is 30-story tall buildings made of wood.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:39.326
We've been engineering
them with an engineer

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.776
named Eric Karsh who works with me on it,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.089
and we've been doing this new work because

00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:46.634
there are new wood products
out there for us to use,

00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:48.856
and we call them mass timber panels.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.179
These are panels made with young trees,

00:05:51.203 --> 00:05:54.821
small growth trees, small pieces of wood

00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:57.340
glued together to make
panels that are enormous:

00:05:57.364 --> 00:06:01.695
eight feet wide, 64 feet long,
and of various thicknesses.

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.834
The way I describe this
best, I've found, is to say

00:06:04.858 --> 00:06:07.097
that we're all used
to two-by-four construction

00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:08.104
when we think about wood.

00:06:08.128 --> 00:06:10.423
That's what people jump
to as a conclusion.

00:06:10.447 --> 00:06:12.295
Two-by-four construction
is sort of like the little

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.034
eight-dot bricks of Lego
that we all played with as kids,

00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:17.971
and you can make all kinds
of cool things out of Lego

00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:20.890
at that size, and out of two-by-fours.

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:21.758
But do remember when you were a kid,

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:24.497
and you kind of sifted
through the pile in your basement,

00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.631
and you found that big
24-dot brick of Lego,

00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:27.466
and you were kind of like,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.620
"Cool, this is awesome. I can
build something really big,

00:06:29.644 --> 00:06:31.199
and this is going to be great."

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:32.542
That's the change.

00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:35.488
Mass timber panels
are those 24-dot bricks.

00:06:35.512 --> 00:06:37.189
They're changing the scale
of what we can do,

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:39.862
and what we've developed
is something we call FFTT,

00:06:39.886 --> 00:06:42.316
which is a Creative Commons solution

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.231
to building a very flexible system

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:49.914
of building with these large
panels where we tilt up

00:06:49.938 --> 00:06:53.773
six stories at a time if we want to.

00:06:53.797 --> 00:06:57.389
This animation shows you
how the building goes together

00:06:57.413 --> 00:07:00.945
in a very simple way, but these
buildings are available

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:03.198
for architects and engineers
now to build on

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.937
for different cultures in the world,

00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:07.540
different architectural
styles and characters.

00:07:07.564 --> 00:07:10.342
In order for us to build safely,

00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:12.542
we've engineered these
buildings, actually,

00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:14.262
to work in a Vancouver context,

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:15.810
where we're a high seismic zone,

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:18.981
even at 30 stories tall.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.903
Now obviously, every time I bring this up,

00:07:20.927 --> 00:07:22.867
people even, you know, here
at the conference, say,

00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:25.844
"Are you serious? Thirty stories?
How's that going to happen?"

00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:29.251
And there's a lot of really
good questions that are asked

00:07:29.275 --> 00:07:31.058
and important questions
that we spent quite a long time

00:07:31.082 --> 00:07:33.437
working on the answers
to as we put together

00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:36.010
our report and the peer reviewed report.

00:07:36.034 --> 00:07:37.594
I'm just going to focus on a few of them,

00:07:37.618 --> 00:07:39.103
and let's start with fire,
because I think fire

00:07:39.127 --> 00:07:42.318
is probably the first one that you're
all thinking about right now.

00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:42.921
Fair enough.

00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:44.614
And the way I describe it is this.

00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:46.809
If I asked you to take
a match and light it

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.797
and hold up a log and try
to get that log to go on fire,

00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:52.596
it doesn't happen, right?
We all know that.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.369
But to build a fire, you kind
of start with small pieces

00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:56.965
of wood and you work your way up,

00:07:56.989 --> 00:07:59.612
and eventually you can
add the log to the fire,

00:07:59.636 --> 00:08:02.065
and when you do add the log
to the fire, of course,

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:04.597
it burns, but it burns slowly.

00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:06.717
Well, mass timber panels,
these new products

00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:08.964
that we're using, are much like the log.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.659
It's hard to start them
on fire, and when they do,

00:08:11.683 --> 00:08:14.276
they actually burn
extraordinarily predictably,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.628
and we can use fire science
in order to predict

00:08:16.652 --> 00:08:18.748
and make these buildings
as safe as concrete

00:08:18.772 --> 00:08:21.336
and as safe as steel.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.101
The next big issue, deforestation.

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:26.571
Eighteen percent of our contribution

00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:28.656
to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.157
is the result of deforestation.

00:08:30.181 --> 00:08:33.599
The last thing we want
to do is cut down trees.

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:37.796
Or, the last thing we want to do
is cut down the wrong trees.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.738
There are models for sustainable forestry

00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:42.909
that allow us to cut trees properly,

00:08:42.933 --> 00:08:44.838
and those are the only trees appropriate

00:08:44.862 --> 00:08:46.559
to use for these kinds of systems.

00:08:46.583 --> 00:08:48.688
Now I actually think that these ideas

00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:52.266
will change the economics
of deforestation.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.367
In countries with deforestation issues,

00:08:54.391 --> 00:08:56.851
we need to find a way to provide

00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:59.317
better value for the forest

00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:01.701
and actually encourage
people to make money

00:09:01.725 --> 00:09:03.579
through very fast growth cycles --

00:09:03.603 --> 00:09:06.550
10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees
that make these products

00:09:06.574 --> 00:09:08.949
and allow us to build at this scale.

00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:11.150
We've calculated a 20-story building:

00:09:11.174 --> 00:09:14.437
We'll grow enough wood in North
America every 13 minutes.

00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:16.879
That's how much it takes.

00:09:16.903 --> 00:09:19.648
The carbon story here
is a really good one.

00:09:19.672 --> 00:09:23.250
If we built a 20-story building
out of cement and concrete,

00:09:23.274 --> 00:09:25.723
the process would result
in the manufacturing

00:09:25.747 --> 00:09:29.688
of that cement and 1,200
tonnes of carbon dioxide.

00:09:29.712 --> 00:09:31.992
If we did it in wood, in this solution,

00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:33.895
we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes,

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:36.595
for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.

00:09:36.619 --> 00:09:39.272
That's the equivalent of about 900 cars

00:09:39.296 --> 00:09:42.009
removed from the road in one year.

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:43.891
Think back to that three billion people

00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:45.130
that need a new home,

00:09:45.154 --> 00:09:48.202
and maybe this
is a contributor to reducing.

00:09:48.226 --> 00:09:50.883
We're at the beginning
of a revolution, I hope,

00:09:50.907 --> 00:09:53.479
in the way we build, because this
is the first new way

00:09:53.503 --> 00:09:57.908
to build a skyscraper
in probably 100 years or more.

00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.431
But the challenge is changing
society's perception

00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:02.455
of possibility, and it's a huge challenge.

00:10:02.479 --> 00:10:05.964
The engineering is, truthfully,
the easy part of this.

00:10:05.988 --> 00:10:07.981
And the way I describe it is this.

00:10:08.005 --> 00:10:10.141
The first skyscraper, technically --

00:10:10.165 --> 00:10:12.691
and the definition of a skyscraper is 10
stories tall, believe it or not —

00:10:12.715 --> 00:10:15.049
but the first skyscraper
was this one in Chicago,

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:18.004
and people were terrified to walk
underneath this building.

00:10:18.028 --> 00:10:19.944
But only four years after it was built,

00:10:19.968 --> 00:10:22.570
Gustave Eiffel was building
the Eiffel Tower,

00:10:22.594 --> 00:10:24.166
and as he built the Eiffel Tower,

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.773
he changed the skylines
of the cities of the world,

00:10:28.797 --> 00:10:31.845
changed and created a competition

00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:34.060
between places like New
York City and Chicago,

00:10:34.084 --> 00:10:36.989
where developers started building
bigger and bigger buildings

00:10:37.013 --> 00:10:40.270
and pushing the envelope
up higher and higher

00:10:40.294 --> 00:10:42.370
with better and better engineering.

00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:44.404
We built this model in New York, actually,

00:10:44.428 --> 00:10:47.191
as a theoretical model on the campus

00:10:47.215 --> 00:10:49.539
of a technical university soon to come,

00:10:49.563 --> 00:10:51.390
and the reason we picked this site

00:10:51.414 --> 00:10:54.127
to just show you what these
buildings may look like,

00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:55.914
because the exterior can change.

00:10:55.938 --> 00:10:58.647
It's really just the structure
that we're talking about.

00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:01.814
The reason we picked it is because this
is a technical university,

00:11:01.838 --> 00:11:03.656
and I believe that wood is the most

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.296
technologically advanced
material I can build with.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.097
It just happens to be that Mother
Nature holds the patent,

00:11:10.121 --> 00:11:12.788
and we don't really feel
comfortable with it.

00:11:12.812 --> 00:11:14.632
But that's the way it should be,

00:11:14.656 --> 00:11:18.427
nature's fingerprints
in the built environment.

00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:20.346
I'm looking for this opportunity

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.536
to create an Eiffel Tower
moment, we call it.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.576
Buildings are starting
to go up around the world.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.457
There's a building in London
that's nine stories,

00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:29.840
a new building that just
finished in Australia

00:11:29.864 --> 00:11:31.797
that I believe is 10 or 11.

00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:35.344
We're starting to push the height
up of these wood buildings,

00:11:35.368 --> 00:11:37.149
and we're hoping, and I'm hoping,

00:11:37.173 --> 00:11:40.161
that my hometown of Vancouver
actually potentially

00:11:40.185 --> 00:11:42.831
announces the world's tallest
at around 20 stories

00:11:42.855 --> 00:11:45.514
in the not-so-distant future.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.244
That Eiffel Tower moment
will break the ceiling,

00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:49.935
these arbitrary ceilings of height,

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.627
and allow wood buildings
to join the competition.

00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:54.592
And I believe the race is ultimately on.

00:11:54.616 --> 00:11:56.042
Thank you.

00:11:56.066 --> 00:12:01.328
(Applause)
