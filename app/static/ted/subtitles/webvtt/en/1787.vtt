00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:04.825
Have you ever experienced
a moment in your life

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:07.855
that was so painful and confusing,

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:10.074
that all you wanted to do

00:00:10.098 --> 00:00:13.795
was learn as much as you could
to make sense of it all?

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:18.441
When I was 13, a close family friend
who was like an uncle to me

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:20.495
passed away from pancreatic cancer.

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:23.742
When the disease hit so close to home,

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.825
I knew I needed to learn more.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.879
So I went online to find answers.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:33.461
Using the Internet, I found a variety
of statistics on pancreatic cancer,

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:35.465
and what I had found shocked me.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.387
Over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers
are diagnosed late,

00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:44.461
when someone has less
than a two percent chance of survival.

00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:48.802
Why are we so bad at detecting
pancreatic cancer?

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:51.653
The reason?

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:55.498
Today's current "modern" medicine
is a 60-year-old technique.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.164
That's older than my dad.

00:00:57.516 --> 00:01:00.801
(Laughter)

00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:07.540
But also, it's extremely expensive,
costing 800 dollars per test,

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:12.604
and it's grossly inaccurate, missing
30 percent of all pancreatic cancers.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:17.536
Your doctor would have to be ridiculously
suspicious that you have the cancer

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.253
in order to give you this test.

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.888
Learning this, I knew there
had to be a better way.

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:25.835
So, I set up scientific criteria

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.945
as to what a sensor
would have to look like

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.839
in order to effectively
diagnose pancreatic cancer.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.929
The sensor would have to be:

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:37.681
inexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive,

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.329
selective, and minimally invasive.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:47.114
Now, there's a reason why this test
hasn't been updated in over six decades.

00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:50.353
And that's because when
we're looking for pancreatic cancer,

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.065
we're looking at your bloodstream,

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:56.815
which is already abundant in all these
tons and tons of protein,

00:01:56.839 --> 00:02:00.614
and you're looking for this miniscule
difference in this tiny amount of protein.

00:02:00.638 --> 00:02:01.788
Just this one protein.

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:03.617
That's next to impossible.

00:02:04.044 --> 00:02:07.775
However, undeterred
due to my teenage optimism --

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.985
(Laughter)

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.580
(Applause)

00:02:13.604 --> 00:02:18.835
I went online to a teenager's
two best friends, Google and Wikipedia.

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.775
I got everything for my homework
from those two sources.

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:22.949
(Laughter)

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.629
And what I had found was an article

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:29.500
that listed a database
of over 8,000 different proteins

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.715
that are found when you have
pancreatic cancer.

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.424
So, I decided to go
and make it my new mission

00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:37.181
to go through all these proteins,

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:40.536
and see which ones could serve
as a bio-marker for pancreatic cancer.

00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:43.363
And to make it a bit simpler for myself,

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:47.140
I decided to map out
scientific criteria, and here it is.

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.745
Essentially, first, the protein would have
to be found in all pancreatic cancers,

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.512
at high levels in the bloodstream,

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:57.037
in the earliest stages,
but also only in cancer.

00:02:57.553 --> 00:03:00.912
And so I'm just plugging and chugging
through this gargantuan task,

00:03:00.936 --> 00:03:03.795
and finally, on the 4,000th try,

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.735
when I'm close to losing my sanity,

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.909
I find the protein.

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:11.365
And the name of the protein
I'd located was called mesothelin,

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.254
and it's just your ordinary,
run-of-the-mill type protein,

00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:17.542
unless, of course, you have
pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer,

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:20.901
in which case it's found at these
very high levels in your bloodstream.

00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:25.584
But also, the key is that it's found
in the earliest stages of the disease,

00:03:25.608 --> 00:03:28.368
when someone has close
to 100 percent chance of survival.

00:03:29.144 --> 00:03:32.465
So now that I'd found
a reliable protein I could detect,

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.426
I then shifted my focus
to actually detecting that protein,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.784
and thus, pancreatic cancer.

00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:41.080
Now, my breakthrough
came in a very unlikely place,

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:44.111
possibly the most unlikely
place for innovation --

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:48.258
my high school biology class,
the absolute stifler of innovation.

00:03:48.282 --> 00:03:50.815
(Laughter)

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.809
(Applause)

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.789
And I had snuck in this article
on these things called carbon nanotubes,

00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:00.270
and that's just a long,
thin pipe of carbon

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:04.068
that's an atom thick, and one
50,000th the diameter of your hair.

00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:06.528
And despite their extremely small sizes,

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:08.499
they have these incredible properties.

00:04:08.523 --> 00:04:11.242
They're kind of like the superheroes
of material science.

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:15.313
And while I was sneakily reading this
article under my desk in my biology class,

00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:19.099
we were supposed to be paying attention
to these other kind of cool molecules,

00:04:19.123 --> 00:04:20.279
called antibodies.

00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:22.805
And these are pretty cool
because they only react

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.366
with one specific protein,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.136
but they're not nearly
as interesting as carbon nanotubes.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.825
And so then, I was sitting in class,
and suddenly it hit me:

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.805
I could combine what I was
reading about, carbon nanotubes,

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:39.845
with what I was supposed to be
thinking about, antibodies.

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:42.530
Essentially, I could weave
a bunch of these antibodies

00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:44.765
into a network of carbon nanotubes,

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.415
such that you have a network
that only reacts with one protein,

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.795
but also, due to the properties
of these nanotubes,

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.795
it will change its electrical properties,

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.809
based on the amount of protein present.

00:04:56.252 --> 00:04:57.890
However, there's a catch.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:01.480
These networks of carbon
nanotubes are extremely flimsy.

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:04.801
And since they're so delicate,
they need to be supported.

00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:06.878
So that's why I chose to use paper.

00:05:07.532 --> 00:05:10.499
Making a cancer sensor
out of paper is about as simple

00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:12.714
as making chocolate chip
cookies, which I love.

00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:15.296
(Laughs)

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:18.845
You start with some water,
pour in some nanotubes,

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:23.845
add antibodies, mix it up,
take some paper, dip it, dry it,

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:25.533
and you can detect cancer.

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:33.616
(Applause)

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.835
Then, suddenly, a thought occurred

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:40.759
that kind of put a blemish
on my amazing plan here.

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:44.215
I can't really do cancer research
on my kitchen countertop.

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:45.811
My mom wouldn't really like that.

00:05:46.516 --> 00:05:49.587
So instead, I decided to go for a lab.

00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:54.213
So I typed up a budget, a materials list,
a timeline, and a procedure,

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:56.909
and I emailed it
to 200 different professors

00:05:56.933 --> 00:06:00.208
at Johns Hopkins University
and the National Institutes of Health --

00:06:00.232 --> 00:06:03.462
essentially, anyone that had anything
to do with pancreatic cancer.

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:06.611
I sat back waiting for these
positive emails to be pouring in,

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:09.432
saying, "You're a genius!
You're going to save us all!"

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:10.727
And --

00:06:10.751 --> 00:06:13.517
(Laughter)

00:06:13.651 --> 00:06:17.631
Then reality took hold,
and over the course of a month,

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:22.211
I got 199 rejections
out of those 200 emails.

00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:24.751
One professor even went
through my entire procedure,

00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:27.872
painstakingly -- I'm not really
sure where he got all this time --

00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:31.484
and he went through and said
why each and every step

00:06:31.508 --> 00:06:33.604
was like the worst mistake
I could ever make.

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:38.710
Clearly, the professors did not have
as high of an opinion of my work as I did.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.324
However, there is a silver lining.

00:06:42.348 --> 00:06:45.315
One professor said, "Maybe I might
be able to help you, kid."

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.720
So, I went in that direction.

00:06:47.678 --> 00:06:51.657
(Laughter)

00:06:51.762 --> 00:06:53.702
As you can never say no to a kid.

00:06:54.157 --> 00:06:56.745
And so then, three months later,

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:59.640
I finally nailed down
a harsh deadline with this guy,

00:06:59.664 --> 00:07:03.234
and I get into his lab, I get
all excited, and then I sit down,

00:07:03.258 --> 00:07:05.138
I start opening my mouth and talking,

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:07.610
and five seconds later,
he calls in another Ph.D.

00:07:07.634 --> 00:07:11.368
Ph.D.s just flock into this little room,

00:07:11.392 --> 00:07:13.536
and they're just firing
these questions at me,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.360
and by the end, I kind of felt
like I was in a clown car.

00:07:16.384 --> 00:07:18.576
There were 20 Ph.D.s,
plus me and the professor

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.442
crammed into this tiny office space,

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:23.443
with them firing these
rapid-fire questions at me,

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:25.493
trying to sink my procedure.

00:07:25.651 --> 00:07:27.667
How unlikely is that? I mean, pshhh.

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:31.739
(Laughter)

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.356
However, subjecting myself
to that interrogation --

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.327
I answered all their questions,
and I guessed on quite a few

00:07:38.351 --> 00:07:39.598
but I got them right --

00:07:39.622 --> 00:07:43.200
and I finally landed
the lab space I needed.

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:47.615
But it was shortly afterwards that
I discovered my once brilliant procedure

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.765
had something like a million holes in it,

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:51.550
and over the course of seven months,

00:07:51.574 --> 00:07:54.509
I painstakingly filled
each and every one of those holes.

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:55.760
The result?

00:07:55.784 --> 00:08:00.610
One small paper sensor that costs
three cents and takes five minutes to run.

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:04.406
This makes it 168 times faster,

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.229
over 26,000 times less expensive,

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:10.775
and over 400 times more sensitive
than our current standard

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:12.759
for pancreatic cancer detection.

00:08:13.745 --> 00:08:20.735
(Applause)

00:08:22.738 --> 00:08:25.055
One of the best parts
of the sensor, though,

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:27.580
is that it has close
to 100 percent accuracy,

00:08:27.604 --> 00:08:30.290
and can detect the cancer
in the earliest stages,

00:08:30.314 --> 00:08:32.998
when someone has close
to 100 percent chance of survival.

00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:35.443
And so in the next two to five years,

00:08:35.467 --> 00:08:38.802
this sensor could potentially lift
the pancreatic cancer survival rates

00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:42.924
from a dismal 5.5 percent
to close to 100 percent,

00:08:42.948 --> 00:08:45.603
and it would do similar
for ovarian and lung cancer.

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.955
But it wouldn't stop there.

00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:49.899
By switching out that antibody,

00:08:49.923 --> 00:08:53.429
you can look at a different protein,
thus, a different disease --

00:08:53.453 --> 00:08:56.371
potentially any disease
in the entire world.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:09:01.493
So that ranges from heart disease,
to malaria, HIV, AIDS,

00:09:01.517 --> 00:09:03.794
as well as other forms
of cancer -- anything.

00:09:04.462 --> 00:09:06.409
And so, hopefully one day,

00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:08.845
we can all have that one extra uncle,

00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:12.103
that one mother, that one brother, sister,

00:09:12.127 --> 00:09:14.366
we can have that one more
family member to love.

00:09:15.023 --> 00:09:19.785
And that our hearts will be rid
of that one disease burden

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.735
that comes from pancreatic,
ovarian and lung cancer,

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:24.835
and potentially any disease.

00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:27.660
But through the Internet,
anything is possible.

00:09:27.684 --> 00:09:28.964
Theories can be shared,

00:09:28.988 --> 00:09:31.715
and you don't have to be
a professor with multiple degrees

00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:33.245
to have your ideas valued.

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:37.310
It's a neutral space, where
what you look like, age or gender --

00:09:37.334 --> 00:09:38.490
it doesn't matter.

00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:40.424
It's just your ideas that count.

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:45.815
For me, it's all about looking
at the Internet in an entirely new way,

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.935
to realize that there's so much more to it

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:50.829
than just posting duck-face
pictures of yourself online.

00:09:51.464 --> 00:09:52.614
(Laughter)

00:09:53.277 --> 00:09:54.939
You could be changing the world.

00:09:56.202 --> 00:10:01.464
So if a 15 year-old who didn't even know
what a pancreas was

00:10:01.488 --> 00:10:04.229
could find a new way
to detect pancreatic cancer --

00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:07.149
just imagine what you could do.

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:08.614
Thank you.

00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:15.337
