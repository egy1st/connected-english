00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:07.796
(Nature sounds)

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.512
When I first began
recording wild soundscapes

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:12.443
45 years ago,

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.865
I had no idea that ants,

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.344
insect larvae, sea anemones and viruses

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:20.472
created a sound signature.

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:21.915
But they do.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.328
And so does every wild
habitat on the planet,

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:28.563
like the Amazon rainforest
you're hearing behind me.

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:32.137
In fact, temperate
and tropical rainforests

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:35.317
each produce a vibrant animal orchestra,

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.545
that instantaneous
and organized expression

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:43.353
of insects, reptiles,
amphibians, birds and mammals.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:46.280
And every soundscape
that springs from a wild habitat

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:49.872
generates its own unique signature,

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:52.789
one that contains incredible
amounts of information,

00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:57.148
and it's some of that information
I want to share with you today.

00:00:57.172 --> 00:01:00.354
The soundscape is made
up of three basic sources.

00:01:00.378 --> 00:01:02.893
The first is the geophony,

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:05.259
or the nonbiological sounds that occur

00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:07.236
in any given habitat,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.828
like wind in the trees, water in a stream,

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:13.422
waves at the ocean shore,
movement of the Earth.

00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:16.700
The second of these is the biophony.

00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:19.822
The biophony is all of the sound

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.940
that's generated by organisms
in a given habitat

00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:26.560
at one time and in one place.

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:31.094
And the third is all of the sound
that we humans generate

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:32.912
that's called anthrophony.

00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:36.273
Some of it is controlled,
like music or theater,

00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:40.190
but most of it is chaotic and incoherent,

00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:43.895
which some of us refer to as noise.

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:46.595
There was a time when
I considered wild soundscapes

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.327
to be a worthless artifact.

00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:52.409
They were just there,
but they had no significance.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.782
Well, I was wrong. What
I learned from these encounters

00:01:55.806 --> 00:02:00.558
was that careful listening gives
us incredibly valuable tools

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:03.142
by which to evaluate
the health of a habitat

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.954
across the entire spectrum of life.

00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:10.166
When I began recording in the late '60s,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.442
the typical methods
of recording were limited

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:17.910
to the fragmented capture
of individual species

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:21.006
like birds mostly, in the beginning,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.707
but later animals
like mammals and amphibians.

00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:30.219
To me, this was a little like trying
to understand

00:02:30.243 --> 00:02:33.284
the magnificence
of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony

00:02:33.308 --> 00:02:36.193
by abstracting the sound
of a single violin player

00:02:36.217 --> 00:02:38.763
out of the context of the orchestra

00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:41.866
and hearing just that one part.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.883
Fortunately, more and more institutions

00:02:44.907 --> 00:02:46.951
are implementing the more holistic models

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:49.314
that I and a few of my colleagues
have introduced

00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:53.187
to the field of soundscape ecology.

00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:58.255
When I began recording
over four decades ago,

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.664
I could record for 10 hours

00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:02.899
and capture one hour of usable material,

00:03:02.923 --> 00:03:05.956
good enough for an album
or a film soundtrack

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.675
or a museum installation.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.628
Now, because of global warming,

00:03:11.652 --> 00:03:13.046
resource extraction,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.115
and human noise, among many other factors,

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.791
it can take up to 1,000 hours or more

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:21.624
to capture the same thing.

00:03:21.648 --> 00:03:24.679
Fully 50 percent of my archive

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:27.875
comes from habitats so radically altered

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.775
that they're either altogether silent

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.496
or can no longer be heard
in any of their original form.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.782
The usual methods of evaluating a habitat

00:03:37.806 --> 00:03:41.108
have been done by visually
counting the numbers of species

00:03:41.132 --> 00:03:45.313
and the numbers of individuals
within each species in a given area.

00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:48.865
However, by comparing
data that ties together

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.665
both density and diversity
from what we hear,

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:57.038
I'm able to arrive at much
more precise fitness outcomes.

00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:59.078
And I want to show you some examples

00:03:59.102 --> 00:04:01.868
that typify the possibilities unlocked

00:04:01.892 --> 00:04:04.890
by diving into this universe.

00:04:04.914 --> 00:04:06.282
This is Lincoln Meadow.

00:04:06.306 --> 00:04:08.497
Lincoln
Meadow's a three-and-a-half-hour drive

00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:11.390
east of San Francisco
in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,

00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:13.487
at about 2,000 meters altitude,

00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:16.296
and I've been recording
there for many years.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.216
In 1988, a logging company
convinced local residents

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.378
that there would be absolutely
no environmental impact

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:25.022
from a new method they were trying

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:26.742
called "selective logging,"

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.297
taking out a tree here and there

00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:31.580
rather than clear-cutting a whole area.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.340
With permission granted to record

00:04:33.364 --> 00:04:35.303
both before and after the operation,

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:39.921
I set up my gear and captured
a large number of dawn choruses

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:43.454
to very strict protocol
and calibrated recordings,

00:04:43.478 --> 00:04:45.648
because I wanted a really good baseline.

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:47.833
This is an example of a spectrogram.

00:04:47.857 --> 00:04:50.264
A spectrogram is a graphic
illustration of sound

00:04:50.288 --> 00:04:53.437
with time from left
to right across the page --

00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:55.944
15 seconds in this case is represented â€”

00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:58.799
and frequency from the bottom
of the page to the top,

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:00.018
lowest to highest.

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:03.152
And you can see
that the signature of a stream

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:07.957
is represented here in the bottom
third or half of the page,

00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:11.400
while birds that were once in that meadow

00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:14.457
are represented in the signature
across the top.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.612
There were a lot of them.

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:18.776
And here's Lincoln Meadow
before selective logging.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:33.569
(Nature sounds)

00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:35.447
Well, a year later I returned,

00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.204
and using the same protocols

00:05:37.228 --> 00:05:39.919
and recording under the same conditions,

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:42.147
I recorded a number of examples

00:05:42.171 --> 00:05:44.247
of the same dawn choruses,

00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:46.390
and now this is what we've got.

00:05:46.414 --> 00:05:47.670
This is after selective logging.

00:05:47.694 --> 00:05:49.980
You can see that the stream
is still represented

00:05:50.004 --> 00:05:51.650
in the bottom third of the page,

00:05:51.674 --> 00:05:56.153
but notice what's missing
in the top two thirds.

00:05:56.177 --> 00:06:01.666
(Nature sounds)

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:11.153
Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker.

00:06:11.177 --> 00:06:13.743
Well, I've returned
to Lincoln Meadow 15 times

00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:15.227
in the last 25 years,

00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:18.913
and I can tell you that the biophony,

00:06:18.937 --> 00:06:21.818
the density and diversity
of that biophony,

00:06:21.842 --> 00:06:24.370
has not yet returned
to anything like it was

00:06:24.394 --> 00:06:26.568
before the operation.

00:06:26.592 --> 00:06:29.666
But here's a picture
of Lincoln Meadow taken after,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.904
and you can see
that from the perspective of the camera

00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:34.015
or the human eye,

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.790
hardly a stick or a tree
appears to be out of place,

00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:39.730
which would confirm the logging
company's contention

00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:42.359
that there's nothing
of environmental impact.

00:06:42.383 --> 00:06:48.776
However, our ears tell us
a very different story.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.603
Young students are always asking me

00:06:50.627 --> 00:06:52.056
what these animals are saying,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.887
and really I've got no idea.

00:06:56.911 --> 00:07:02.156
But I can tell you that they do
express themselves.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.234
Whether or not we understand
it is a different story.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.562
I was walking along the shore in Alaska,

00:07:07.586 --> 00:07:09.906
and I came across this tide pool

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.938
filled with a colony of sea anemones,

00:07:12.962 --> 00:07:15.014
these wonderful eating machines,

00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:17.865
relatives of coral and jellyfish.

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.223
And curious to see
if any of them made any noise,

00:07:20.247 --> 00:07:21.394
I dropped a hydrophone,

00:07:21.418 --> 00:07:24.386
an underwater microphone
covered in rubber,

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.574
down the mouth part,

00:07:25.598 --> 00:07:27.335
and immediately the critter began

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:29.544
to absorb the microphone into its belly,

00:07:29.568 --> 00:07:32.238
and the tentacles were
searching out of the surface

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:34.649
for something of nutritional value.

00:07:34.673 --> 00:07:37.154
The static-like sounds that are very low,

00:07:37.178 --> 00:07:39.158
that you're going to hear right now.

00:07:39.182 --> 00:07:43.560
(Static sounds)

00:07:43.584 --> 00:07:46.427
Yeah, but watch. When it
didn't find anything to eat --

00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:47.816
(Honking sound)

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.476
(Laughter)

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.973
I think that's an expression
that can be understood

00:07:52.997 --> 00:07:54.390
in any language.

00:07:54.414 --> 00:07:59.256
(Laughter)

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.856
At the end of its breeding cycle,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.012
the Great Basin Spadefoot toad

00:08:03.036 --> 00:08:05.087
digs itself down about a meter under

00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:08.237
the hard-panned desert
soil of the American West,

00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:10.116
where it can stay for many seasons

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.616
until conditions are just
right for it to emerge again.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.736
And when there's enough moisture
in the soil

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.531
in the spring, frogs will dig
themselves to the surface

00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:22.602
and gather around these
large, vernal pools

00:08:22.626 --> 00:08:24.639
in great numbers.

00:08:24.663 --> 00:08:28.045
And they vocalize in a chorus

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:31.253
that's absolutely in sync
with one another.

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.849
And they do that for two reasons.

00:08:32.873 --> 00:08:36.278
The first is competitive,
because they're looking for mates,

00:08:36.302 --> 00:08:37.731
and the second is cooperative,

00:08:37.755 --> 00:08:40.212
because if they're
all vocalizing in sync together,

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:44.371
it makes it really difficult
for predators like coyotes,

00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:48.590
foxes and owls to single
out any individual for a meal.

00:08:48.614 --> 00:08:51.862
This is a spectrogram
of what the frog chorusing looks like

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:54.123
when it's in a very healthy pattern.

00:08:54.147 --> 00:09:04.139
(Frogs croaking)

00:09:04.163 --> 00:09:08.104
Mono Lake is just to the east
of Yosemite National Park

00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:09.933
in California,

00:09:09.957 --> 00:09:12.788
and it's a favorite
habitat of these toads,

00:09:12.812 --> 00:09:15.675
and it's also favored by U.S.
Navy jet pilots,

00:09:15.699 --> 00:09:18.721
who train in their fighters
flying them at speeds

00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:21.179
exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour

00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:23.960
and altitudes only a couple hundred meters

00:09:23.984 --> 00:09:26.539
above ground level of the Mono Basin,

00:09:26.563 --> 00:09:30.213
very fast, very low, and so loud

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:33.079
that the anthrophony, the human noise,

00:09:33.103 --> 00:09:35.103
even though it's six and a half kilometers

00:09:35.127 --> 00:09:37.903
from the frog pond you
just heard a second ago,

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:41.469
it masked the sound
of the chorusing toads.

00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:44.735
You can see in this spectrogram
that all of the energy

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:47.482
that was once in the first
spectrogram is gone

00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:49.229
from the top end of the spectrogram,

00:09:49.253 --> 00:09:52.063
and that there's breaks
in the chorusing at two and a half,

00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:54.255
four and a half,
and six and a half seconds,

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:57.354
and then the sound
of the jet, the signature,

00:09:57.378 --> 00:09:59.913
is in yellow at the very
bottom of the page.

00:09:59.937 --> 00:10:09.558
(Frogs croaking)

00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:11.952
Now at the end of that flyby,

00:10:11.976 --> 00:10:15.441
it took the frogs fully 45 minutes

00:10:15.465 --> 00:10:17.845
to regain their chorusing synchronicity,

00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:20.790
during which time, and under a full moon,

00:10:20.814 --> 00:10:23.571
we watched as two coyotes
and a great horned owl

00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:26.694
came in to pick
off a few of their numbers.

00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:30.220
The good news is that, with a little bit
of habitat restoration

00:10:30.244 --> 00:10:32.925
and fewer flights, the frog populations,

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:36.648
once diminishing
during the 1980s and early '90s,

00:10:36.672 --> 00:10:40.181
have pretty much returned to normal.

00:10:40.205 --> 00:10:43.120
I want to end with a story
told by a beaver.

00:10:43.144 --> 00:10:44.594
It's a very sad story,

00:10:44.618 --> 00:10:48.472
but it really illustrates how animals

00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:50.454
can sometimes show emotion,

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:55.106
a very controversial subject
among some older biologists.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.339
A colleague of mine was recording
in the American Midwest

00:10:58.363 --> 00:11:00.881
around this pond that had been formed

00:11:00.905 --> 00:11:04.780
maybe 16,000 years ago at the end
of the last ice age.

00:11:04.804 --> 00:11:06.933
It was also formed in part by a beaver dam

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:09.851
at one end that held
that whole ecosystem together

00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:12.603
in a very delicate balance.

00:11:12.627 --> 00:11:16.378
And one afternoon, while he was recording,

00:11:16.402 --> 00:11:20.202
there suddenly appeared
from out of nowhere

00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:22.650
a couple of game wardens,

00:11:22.674 --> 00:11:24.245
who for no apparent reason,

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:25.824
walked over to the beaver dam,

00:11:25.848 --> 00:11:29.106
dropped a stick of dynamite
down it, blowing it up,

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.136
killing the female and her young babies.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.968
Horrified, my colleagues remained behind

00:11:35.992 --> 00:11:38.009
to gather his thoughts

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:41.493
and to record whatever he could
the rest of the afternoon,

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:46.386
and that evening, he captured
a remarkable event:

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.575
the lone surviving male beaver
swimming in slow circles

00:11:50.599 --> 00:11:56.308
crying out inconsolably for its
lost mate and offspring.

00:11:56.332 --> 00:11:59.217
This is probably the saddest sound

00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:02.135
I've ever heard coming from any organism,

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:04.878
human or other.

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:22.156
(Beaver crying)

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.971
Yeah. Well.

00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:26.553
There are many facets to soundscapes,

00:12:26.577 --> 00:12:29.769
among them the ways in which animals
taught us to dance and sing,

00:12:29.793 --> 00:12:32.394
which I'll save for another time.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.412
But you have heard how biophonies

00:12:35.436 --> 00:12:39.255
help clarify our understanding
of the natural world.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:41.719
You've heard the impact
of resource extraction,

00:12:41.743 --> 00:12:44.783
human noise and habitat destruction.

00:12:44.807 --> 00:12:47.046
And where environmental
sciences have typically

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.103
tried to understand
the world from what we see,

00:12:50.127 --> 00:12:54.571
a much fuller understanding
can be got from what we hear.

00:12:54.595 --> 00:12:58.428
Biophonies and geophonies
are the signature voices

00:12:58.452 --> 00:13:00.419
of the natural world,

00:13:00.443 --> 00:13:01.772
and as we hear them,

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:04.444
we're endowed with a sense of place,

00:13:04.468 --> 00:13:07.861
the true story of the world we live in.

00:13:07.885 --> 00:13:09.780
In a matter of seconds,

00:13:09.804 --> 00:13:12.495
a soundscape reveals much more information

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:14.043
from many perspectives,

00:13:14.067 --> 00:13:18.665
from quantifiable data
to cultural inspiration.

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:21.566
Visual capture implicitly frames

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.562
a limited frontal perspective
of a given spatial context,

00:13:25.586 --> 00:13:27.935
while soundscapes widen that scope

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:33.120
to a full 360 degrees,
completely enveloping us.

00:13:33.144 --> 00:13:36.892
And while a picture may
be worth 1,000 words,

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:41.265
a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures.

00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:43.389
And our ears tell us

00:13:43.413 --> 00:13:46.984
that the whisper
of every leaf and creature

00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:50.058
speaks to the natural
sources of our lives,

00:13:50.082 --> 00:13:55.120
which indeed may hold the secrets
of love for all things,

00:13:55.144 --> 00:13:57.078
especially our own humanity,

00:13:57.102 --> 00:14:03.363
and the last word goes
to a jaguar from the Amazon.

00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:17.111
(Growling)

00:14:17.135 --> 00:14:19.311
Thank you for listening.

00:14:19.335 --> 00:14:25.032
(Applause)
