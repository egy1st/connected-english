00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.583
Where do you come from?

00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:04.654
It's such a simple question,

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:06.837
but these days, of course,
simple questions

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.883
bring ever more complicated answers.

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:12.835
People are always asking
me where I come from,

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.015
and they're expecting me to say India,

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.116
and they're absolutely right
insofar as 100 percent

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.682
of my blood and ancestry
does come from India.

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:26.747
Except, I've never lived
one day of my life there.

00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:29.155
I can't speak even one word

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.155
of its more than 22,000 dialects.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.365
So I don't think I've really
earned the right

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:36.811
to call myself an Indian.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:38.359
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:41.426
means "Where were you born
and raised and educated?"

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.852
then I'm entirely
of that funny little country

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.223
known as England,

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:47.634
except I left England
as soon as I completed

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:49.547
my undergraduate education,

00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:51.264
and all the time I was growing up,

00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:54.060
I was the only kid in all my classes

00:00:54.084 --> 00:00:57.189
who didn't begin to look
like the classic English heroes

00:00:57.213 --> 00:00:59.867
represented in our textbooks.

00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:01.169
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.860
means "Where do you pay your taxes?

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:05.408
Where do you see your doctor
and your dentist?"

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.771
then I'm very much of the United States,

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:10.339
and I have been for 48 years now,

00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:12.427
since I was a really small child.

00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:14.135
Except, for many of those years,

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.636
I've had to carry around this
funny little pink card

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.565
with green lines running through my face

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:21.178
identifying me as a permanent alien.

00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:25.440
I do actually feel more alien
the longer I live there.

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:27.627
(Laughter)

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:29.214
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:31.980
means "Which place goes deepest inside you

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:35.160
and where do you try
to spend most of your time?"

00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:36.333
then I'm Japanese,

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:38.586
because I've been living as much as I can

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.971
for the last 25 years in Japan.

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:45.024
Except, all of those years
I've been there on a tourist visa,

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:47.166
and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.057
would want to consider me one of them.

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:53.308
And I say all this just to stress

00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:56.028
how very old-fashioned and straightforward

00:01:56.052 --> 00:01:57.027
my background is,

00:01:57.051 --> 00:02:01.075
because when I go to Hong
Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:02.971
most of the kids I meet

00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:06.770
are much more international
and multi-cultured than I am.

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:09.435
And they have one home
associated with their parents,

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.591
but another associated
with their partners,

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:15.980
a third connected maybe with the place
where they happen to be,

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.894
a fourth connected with the place
they dream of being,

00:02:18.918 --> 00:02:21.238
and many more besides.

00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:24.524
And their whole life will be
spent taking pieces

00:02:24.548 --> 00:02:28.011
of many different places
and putting them together

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:30.853
into a stained glass whole.

00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:33.294
Home for them is really
a work in progress.

00:02:33.318 --> 00:02:35.890
It's like a project
on which they're constantly adding

00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:39.024
upgrades and improvements and corrections.

00:02:39.048 --> 00:02:40.919
And for more and more of us,

00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:45.374
home has really less to do
with a piece of soil

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.125
than, you could say, with a piece of soul.

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.530
If somebody suddenly asks
me, "Where's your home?"

00:02:50.554 --> 00:02:53.445
I think about my sweetheart
or my closest friends

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.712
or the songs that travel with me
wherever I happen to be.

00:02:57.736 --> 00:02:59.569
And I'd always felt this way,

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.312
but it really came home to me, as it were,

00:03:02.336 --> 00:03:05.030
some years ago when
I was climbing up the stairs

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:07.732
in my parents' house in California,

00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:10.558
and I looked through the living
room windows

00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:15.736
and I saw that we were
encircled by 70-foot flames,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.222
one of those wildfires
that regularly tear through

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:22.053
the hills of California
and many other such places.

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:25.078
And three hours later,
that fire had reduced

00:03:25.102 --> 00:03:27.822
my home and every last thing in it

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:30.840
except for me to ash.

00:03:30.864 --> 00:03:33.550
And when I woke up the next morning,

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:35.241
I was sleeping on a friend's floor,

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:37.669
the only thing I had
in the world was a toothbrush

00:03:37.693 --> 00:03:40.236
I had just bought
from an all-night supermarket.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.142
Of course, if anybody asked me then,

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:43.501
"Where is your home?"

00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:47.493
I literally couldn't point
to any physical construction.

00:03:47.517 --> 00:03:52.225
My home would have to be whatever
I carried around inside me.

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.217
And in so many ways, I think
this is a terrific liberation.

00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:58.411
Because when my grandparents were born,

00:03:58.435 --> 00:04:00.938
they pretty much had their sense of home,

00:04:00.962 --> 00:04:04.430
their sense of community,
even their sense of enmity,

00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:06.355
assigned to them at birth,

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.333
and didn't have much chance
of stepping outside of that.

00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:13.040
And nowadays, at least some of us
can choose our sense of home,

00:04:13.064 --> 00:04:15.198
create our sense of community,

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:18.779
fashion our sense of self, and in so doing

00:04:18.803 --> 00:04:20.916
maybe step a little beyond

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.702
some of the black and white divisions

00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:24.534
of our grandparents' age.

00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:26.418
No coincidence that the president

00:04:26.442 --> 00:04:29.149
of the strongest nation
on Earth is half-Kenyan,

00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:30.756
partly raised in Indonesia,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.355
has a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law.

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.819
The number of people living
in countries not their own

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:42.606
now comes to 220 million,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.220
and that's an almost unimaginable number,

00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:48.970
but it means that if you took
the whole population of Canada

00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:50.886
and the whole population of Australia

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.196
and then the whole population
of Australia again

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.838
and the whole population of Canada again

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.521
and doubled that number,

00:04:57.545 --> 00:04:59.688
you would still have
fewer people than belong

00:04:59.712 --> 00:05:01.895
to this great floating tribe.

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.681
And the number of us who live outside

00:05:03.705 --> 00:05:07.765
the old nation-state categories
is increasing so quickly,

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.395
by 64 million just in the last 12 years,

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.875
that soon there will be more
of us than there are Americans.

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:19.549
Already, we represent
the fifth-largest nation on Earth.

00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:22.405
And in fact, in Canada's largest
city, Toronto,

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:26.095
the average resident today
is what used to be called

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:30.187
a foreigner, somebody born
in a very different country.

00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.976
And I've always felt that the beauty
of being surrounded by the foreign

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.573
is that it slaps you awake.

00:05:35.597 --> 00:05:38.377
You can't take anything for granted.

00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:41.111
Travel, for me, is a little bit
like being in love,

00:05:41.135 --> 00:05:45.168
because suddenly all your senses
are at the setting marked "on."

00:05:45.192 --> 00:05:49.169
Suddenly you're alert to the secret
patterns of the world.

00:05:49.193 --> 00:05:53.485
The real voyage of discovery,
as Marcel Proust famously said,

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.483
consists not in seeing new sights,

00:05:56.507 --> 00:05:58.853
but in looking with new eyes.

00:05:58.877 --> 00:06:00.819
And of course, once you have new eyes,

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:03.256
even the old sights, even your home

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.933
become something different.

00:06:05.957 --> 00:06:08.751
Many of the people living
in countries not their own

00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:11.834
are refugees who never
wanted to leave home

00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:14.550
and ache to go back home.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.197
But for the fortunate among us,

00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:20.478
I think the age of movement brings
exhilarating new possibilities.

00:06:20.502 --> 00:06:21.543
Certainly when I'm traveling,

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:23.857
especially to the major
cities of the world,

00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:25.982
the typical person I meet today

00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:30.527
will be, let's say, a half-Korean,
half-German young woman

00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:32.230
living in Paris.

00:06:32.254 --> 00:06:35.288
And as soon as she meets a half-Thai,

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:38.502
half-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,

00:06:38.526 --> 00:06:40.979
she recognizes him as kin.

00:06:41.003 --> 00:06:45.318
She realizes that she probably
has much more in common with him

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:48.911
than with anybody entirely
of Korea or entirely of Germany.

00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:51.669
So they become friends. They fall in love.

00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:53.947
They move to New York City.

00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:56.110
(Laughter)

00:06:56.134 --> 00:06:57.496
Or Edinburgh.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.770
And the little girl
who arises out of their union

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:02.901
will of course be not Korean or German

00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:05.444
or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian

00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:07.549
or even American, but a wonderful

00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:11.683
and constantly evolving
mix of all those places.

00:07:11.707 --> 00:07:14.448
And potentially, everything about the way

00:07:14.472 --> 00:07:17.197
that young woman dreams about the world,

00:07:17.221 --> 00:07:20.243
writes about the world,
thinks about the world,

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:22.213
could be something different,

00:07:22.237 --> 00:07:25.408
because it comes out of this
almost unprecedented

00:07:25.432 --> 00:07:27.381
blend of cultures.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:30.465
Where you come from now
is much less important

00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:32.113
than where you're going.

00:07:32.137 --> 00:07:34.509
More and more of us
are rooted in the future

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:37.805
or the present tense
as much as in the past.

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:40.368
And home, we know, is not just the place

00:07:40.392 --> 00:07:42.478
where you happen to be born.

00:07:42.502 --> 00:07:46.951
It's the place where you become yourself.

00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:49.373
And yet,

00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:52.038
there is one great problem with movement,

00:07:52.062 --> 00:07:55.249
and that is that it's really
hard to get your bearings

00:07:55.273 --> 00:07:56.867
when you're in midair.

00:07:56.891 --> 00:08:00.153
Some years ago, I noticed
that I had accumulated

00:08:00.177 --> 00:08:03.675
one million miles
on United Airlines alone.

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:05.725
You all know that crazy system,

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:09.453
six days in hell, you get
the seventh day free.

00:08:09.477 --> 00:08:12.959
(Laughter)

00:08:12.983 --> 00:08:15.235
And I began to think that really,

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:18.514
movement was only as good
as the sense of stillness

00:08:18.538 --> 00:08:22.361
that you could bring to it
to put it into perspective.

00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:25.215
And eight months
after my house burned down,

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:27.937
I ran into a friend who taught
at a local high school,

00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:31.469
and he said, "I've got
the perfect place for you."

00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:33.477
"Really?" I said. I'm
always a bit skeptical

00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:34.955
when people say things like that.

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:36.325
"No, honestly," he went on,

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.171
"it's only three hours away by car,

00:08:38.195 --> 00:08:39.785
and it's not very expensive,

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.365
and it's probably not like anywhere
you've stayed before."

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:47.564
"Hmm." I was beginning to get
slightly intrigued. "What is it?"

00:08:47.588 --> 00:08:50.343
"Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed —

00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:53.925
"Well, actually
it's a Catholic hermitage."

00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:55.891
This was the wrong answer.

00:08:55.915 --> 00:08:58.438
I had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,

00:08:58.462 --> 00:09:03.036
so I had had enough hymnals
and crosses to last me a lifetime.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.307
Several lifetimes, actually.

00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:07.865
But my friend assured me
that he wasn't Catholic,

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:09.318
nor were most of his students,

00:09:09.342 --> 00:09:12.099
but he took his classes
there every spring.

00:09:12.123 --> 00:09:16.862
And as he had it,
even the most restless, distractible,

00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:20.896
testosterone-addled
15-year-old Californian boy

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.132
only had to spend three days in silence

00:09:24.156 --> 00:09:28.386
and something in him cooled
down and cleared out.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.695
He found himself.

00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:33.434
And I thought, "Anything
that works for a 15-year-old boy

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:34.773
ought to work for me."

00:09:34.797 --> 00:09:38.383
So I got in my car,
and I drove three hours north

00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:39.859
along the coast,

00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:42.419
and the roads grew emptier and narrower,

00:09:42.443 --> 00:09:45.183
and then I turned
onto an even narrower path,

00:09:45.207 --> 00:09:48.823
barely paved, that snaked for two miles

00:09:48.847 --> 00:09:51.346
up to the top of a mountain.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.185
And when I got out of my car,

00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:56.555
the air was pulsing.

00:09:56.579 --> 00:09:58.415
The whole place was absolutely silent,

00:09:58.439 --> 00:10:01.875
but the silence wasn't
an absence of noise.

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:05.916
It was really a presence of a kind
of energy or quickening.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.427
And at my feet was the great,
still blue plate

00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:11.681
of the Pacific Ocean.

00:10:11.705 --> 00:10:16.115
All around me were 800
acres of wild dry brush.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:18.901
And I went down to the room
in which I was to be sleeping.

00:10:18.925 --> 00:10:20.626
Small but eminently comfortable,

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.835
it had a bed and a rocking chair

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:26.009
and a long desk and even longer
picture windows

00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:30.298
looking out on a small,
private, walled garden,

00:10:30.322 --> 00:10:33.498
and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass

00:10:33.522 --> 00:10:36.490
running down to the sea.

00:10:36.514 --> 00:10:39.659
And I sat down, and I began to write,

00:10:39.683 --> 00:10:41.163
and write, and write,

00:10:41.187 --> 00:10:44.776
even though I'd gone there
really to get away from my desk.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.270
And by the time I got up,
four hours had passed.

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:51.399
Night had fallen,

00:10:51.423 --> 00:10:56.155
and I went out under this great
overturned saltshaker of stars,

00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:58.407
and I could see the tail lights of cars

00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:02.620
disappearing around the headlands
12 miles to the south.

00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:06.328
And it really seemed
like my concerns of the previous day

00:11:06.352 --> 00:11:08.278
vanishing.

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:10.090
And the next day, when I woke up

00:11:10.114 --> 00:11:13.558
in the absence of telephones
and TVs and laptops,

00:11:13.582 --> 00:11:17.711
the days seemed to stretch
for a thousand hours.

00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:21.410
It was really all the freedom
I know when I'm traveling,

00:11:21.434 --> 00:11:26.024
but it also profoundly
felt like coming home.

00:11:26.048 --> 00:11:27.640
And I'm not a religious person,

00:11:27.664 --> 00:11:29.141
so I didn't go to the services.

00:11:29.165 --> 00:11:31.710
I didn't consult the monks for guidance.

00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:34.490
I just took walks along the monastery road

00:11:34.514 --> 00:11:36.839
and sent postcards to loved ones.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.673
I looked at the clouds,

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:42.998
and I did what is hardest
of all for me to do usually,

00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:45.492
which is nothing at all.

00:11:45.516 --> 00:11:47.800
And I started to go back to this place,

00:11:47.824 --> 00:11:51.368
and I noticed that I was doing
my most important work there

00:11:51.392 --> 00:11:54.899
invisibly just by sitting still,

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:58.024
and certainly coming
to my most critical decisions

00:11:58.048 --> 00:12:00.306
the way I never could when I was racing

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.879
from the last email
to the next appointment.

00:12:02.903 --> 00:12:05.508
And I began to think that something in me

00:12:05.532 --> 00:12:07.497
had really been crying out for stillness,

00:12:07.521 --> 00:12:09.045
but of course I couldn't hear it

00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:10.831
because I was running around so much.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.484
I was like some crazy guy
who puts on a blindfold

00:12:13.508 --> 00:12:16.715
and then complains
that he can't see a thing.

00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:19.256
And I thought back
to that wonderful phrase

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.628
I had learned as a boy from Seneca,

00:12:21.652 --> 00:12:25.286
in which he says, "That man is poor

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:30.659
not who has little but who hankers
after more."

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:32.751
And, of course, I'm not suggesting

00:12:32.775 --> 00:12:34.585
that anybody here go into a monastery.

00:12:34.609 --> 00:12:36.177
That's not the point.

00:12:36.201 --> 00:12:39.895
But I do think
it's only by stopping movement

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:42.191
that you can see where to go.

00:12:42.215 --> 00:12:45.796
And it's only by stepping
out of your life and the world

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.365
that you can see what you
most deeply care about

00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:51.771
and find a home.

00:12:51.795 --> 00:12:53.814
And I've noticed so many people now

00:12:53.838 --> 00:12:56.902
take conscious measures
to sit quietly for 30 minutes

00:12:56.926 --> 00:12:59.435
every morning just collecting themselves

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:01.995
in one corner of the room
without their devices,

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:04.068
or go running every evening,

00:13:04.092 --> 00:13:06.024
or leave their cell phones behind

00:13:06.048 --> 00:13:09.941
when they go to have a long
conversation with a friend.

00:13:09.965 --> 00:13:13.110
Movement is a fantastic privilege,

00:13:13.134 --> 00:13:16.467
and it allows us to do so
much that our grandparents

00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:18.588
could never have dreamed of doing.

00:13:18.612 --> 00:13:20.493
But movement, ultimately,

00:13:20.517 --> 00:13:25.034
only has a meaning if you
have a home to go back to.

00:13:25.058 --> 00:13:27.825
And home, in the end, is of course

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:30.693
not just the place where you sleep.

00:13:30.717 --> 00:13:33.332
It's the place where you stand.

00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:34.789
Thank you.

00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:40.506
(Applause)
