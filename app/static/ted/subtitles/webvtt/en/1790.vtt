00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:04.672
It is said that the grass is always greener

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:07.726
on the other side of the fence,

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.872
and I believe this is true,

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:13.456
especially when I hear President Obama

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:15.954
often talk about the Korean education system

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:19.465
as a benchmark of success.

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.862
Well, I can tell you that,

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:25.409
in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.600
of the Korean school system,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.934
also known as pressure cooker,

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:35.593
not everyone can do well in that environment.

00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:38.218
While many people responded in different ways

00:00:38.218 --> 00:00:41.218
about our education system,

00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:44.594
my response to the high-pressure environment

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:47.524
was making bows with pieces of wood

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:50.268
found near my apartment building.

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:52.788
Why bows?

00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:55.539
I'm not quite sure.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.484
Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure,

00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:01.731
my caveman instinct of survival

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:06.053
has connected with the bows.

00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:07.787
If you think about it,

00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:11.200
the bow has really helped drive human survival

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.925
since prehistoric times.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:17.192
The area within three kilometers of my home

00:01:17.192 --> 00:01:19.375
used to be a mulberry forest

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.665
during the Joseon dynasty,

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:26.122
where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:30.828
In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact,

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:35.163
the government has planted mulberry trees.

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:36.941
The seeds from these trees

00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:39.740
also have spread by birds here and there

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.218
nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:47.584
that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.

00:01:47.584 --> 00:01:50.085
The area near these walls,

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:53.065
which nobody bothers to pay attention to,

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:56.259
had been left free from major intervention,

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.159
and this is where I first found my treasures.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.360
As I fell deeper into bow making,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.571
I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.

00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.689
When I went on school field trips,

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.913
family vacations, or simply on my way home

00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:17.763
from extracurricular classes,

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:19.862
I wandered around wooded areas

00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:21.601
and gathered tree branches

00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:25.572
with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.

00:02:25.572 --> 00:02:29.273
And they would be somethings like saws, knives,

00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:31.519
sickles and axes

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.207
that I covered up with a piece of towel.

00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:38.088
I would bring the branches home,

00:02:38.088 --> 00:02:40.077
riding buses and subways,

00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:43.466
barely holding them in my hands.

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:47.342
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.

00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:48.898
Airport security.

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:50.978
(Laughter)

00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:54.697
In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust,

00:02:54.697 --> 00:02:58.751
I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long

00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:01.218
until a bow took shape.

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:05.713
One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:10.468
and ended up setting the place on fire.

00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:15.257
Where? The rooftop of my apartment building,

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:18.897
a place where 96 families call home.

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:21.488
A customer from a department store across from my building

00:03:21.488 --> 00:03:22.978
called 911,

00:03:22.978 --> 00:03:25.025
and I ran downstairs to tell my mom

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:30.242
with half of my hair burned.

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.370
I want to take this opportunity

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.074
to tell my mom, in the audience today:

00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:38.415
Mom, I was really sorry,

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:42.061
and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:44.695
My mother had to do a lot of explaining,

00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:47.024
telling people that her son did not commit

00:03:47.024 --> 00:03:50.483
a premeditated arson.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.405
I also researched extensively on bows around the world.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.466
In that process, I tried to combine

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:01.907
the different bows from across time and places

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:05.690
to create the most effective bow.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.043
I also worked with many different types of wood,

00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:11.231
such as maple, yew and mulberry,

00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.171
and did many shooting experiments

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:15.670
in the wooded area near the urban expressway

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.505
that I mentioned before.

00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:20.530
The most effective bow for me

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.297
would be like this.

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:27.510
One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.041
when you draw and shoot the arrow.

00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:35.938
Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight,

00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:39.599
which means more power.

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.911
Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb

00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:46.816
for maximum tension storage.

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:55.055
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.

00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:58.053
After fixing, breaking, redesigning,

00:04:58.053 --> 00:05:00.984
mending, bending and amending,

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:04.291
my ideal bow began to take shape,

00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:08.146
and when it was finally done,

00:05:08.146 --> 00:05:11.600
it looked like this.

00:05:12.673 --> 00:05:14.910
I was so proud of myself

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.984
for inventing a perfect bow on my own.

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:24.416
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows

00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:26.312
taken from a museum,

00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:31.796
and see how my bow resembles them.

00:05:31.796 --> 00:05:33.362
Thanks to my ancestors

00:05:33.362 --> 00:05:38.653
for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)

00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:41.394
Through bowmaking,

00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:44.455
I came in contact with part of my heritage.

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:48.018
Learning the information that has accumulated over time

00:05:48.018 --> 00:05:50.856
and reading the message left by my ancestors

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:53.455
were better than any consolation therapy

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:58.404
or piece of advice any living adults could give me.

00:05:58.404 --> 00:06:01.322
You see, I searched far and wide,

00:06:01.322 --> 00:06:04.798
but never bothered to look close and near.

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:07.043
From this realization,

00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:09.864
I began to take interest in Korean history,

00:06:09.864 --> 00:06:13.261
which had never inspired me before.

00:06:13.261 --> 00:06:16.637
In the end, the grass is often greener

00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:18.427
on my side of the fence,

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:21.604
although we don't realize it.

00:06:21.604 --> 00:06:26.355
Now, I am going to show you how my bow works.

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:29.476
And let's see how this one works.

00:06:31.568 --> 00:06:33.705
This is a bamboo bow,

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:37.637
with 45-pound draw weights.

00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:39.821
(Noise of shooting arrow)

00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:44.779
(Applause)

00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:52.694
A bow may function in a simple mechanism,

00:06:52.694 --> 00:06:55.245
but in order to make a good bow,

00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:59.257
a great amount of sensitivity is required.

00:06:59.257 --> 00:07:01.787
You need to console and communicate

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:04.533
with the wood material.

00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:06.225
Each fiber in the wood

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:09.051
has its own reason and function for being,

00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:12.446
and only through cooperation and harmony among them

00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:16.043
comes a great bow.

00:07:16.043 --> 00:07:17.833
I may be an [odd] student

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:20.024
with unconventional interests,

00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:22.966
but I hope I am making a contribution

00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:26.855
by sharing my story with all of you.

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:29.108
My ideal world is a place

00:07:29.108 --> 00:07:31.321
where no one is left behind,

00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:34.614
where everyone is needed exactly where they are,

00:07:34.614 --> 00:07:38.210
like the fibers and the tendons in a bow,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.479
a place where the strong is flexible

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.272
and the vulnerable is resilient.

00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:46.923
The bow resembles me,

00:07:46.923 --> 00:07:49.971
and I resemble the bow.

00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:54.835
Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you.

00:07:54.835 --> 00:07:57.585
No, better yet, a part of my mind

00:07:57.585 --> 00:08:00.424
has just been shot over to your mind.

00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:02.668
Did it strike you?

00:08:02.668 --> 00:08:04.208
Thank you.

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:09.870
(Applause)
