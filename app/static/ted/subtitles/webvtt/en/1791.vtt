00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:05.917
So here's the most important economic fact of our time.

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:09.947
We are living in an age of surging income inequality,

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:12.872
particularly between those at the very top

00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:14.708
and everyone else.

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:18.730
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.928
but it's a global phenomenon.

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:23.251
It's happening in communist China,

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.974
in formerly communist Russia,

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:28.268
it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:31.235
We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:34.860
like Sweden, Finland and Germany.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.771
Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.480
In the 1970s, the One Percent

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.757
accounted for about 10 percent of the national income

00:00:45.757 --> 00:00:47.521
in the United States.

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:50.830
Today, their share has more than doubled

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.269
to above 20 percent.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.369
But what's even more striking

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.055
is what's happening at the very tippy top

00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:00.297
of the income distribution.

00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:03.301
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.

00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.530
today account for more than eight percent

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.420
of the national income.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.913
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.

00:01:12.913 --> 00:01:15.681
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective,

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:19.199
and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:20.658
by Robert Reich,

00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:23.397
the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.

00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:28.701
Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.421
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,

00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:34.370
and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.123
of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,

00:01:39.123 --> 00:01:41.965
120 million people.

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.329
Now, as it happens,

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.133
Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:50.860
he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.162
and he has his own favorite number.

00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:58.105
Buffett likes to point out that in 1992,

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.267
the combined wealth of the people

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:02.596
on the Forbes 400 list --

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:05.993
and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans --

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:08.765
was 300 billion dollars.

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:09.966
Just think about it.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.993
You didn't even need to be a billionaire

00:02:11.993 --> 00:02:14.966
to get on that list in 1992.

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:18.979
Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.865
to 1.7 trillion,

00:02:21.865 --> 00:02:24.043
and I probably don't need to tell you

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.504
that we haven't seen anything similar happen

00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:27.889
to the middle class,

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:32.590
whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.650
So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.691
but we've been slow to notice it.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.374
One of the reasons, I think,

00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:43.352
is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:45.915
Changes which are slow and gradual

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.455
can be hard to notice

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:50.359
even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.591
Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.

00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:56.406
But I think there's something else going on.

00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:58.516
Talking about income inequality,

00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:01.047
even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:03.188
can make us feel uncomfortable.

00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:06.633
It feels less positive, less optimistic,

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:09.162
to talk about how the pie is sliced

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:12.214
than to think about how to make the pie bigger.

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:14.942
And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,

00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:17.740
talking about income distribution,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.427
and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:23.967
can be downright threatening.

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:28.243
So we're living in the age of surging income inequality,

00:03:28.243 --> 00:03:30.356
especially at the top.

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:33.944
What's driving it, and what can we do about it?

00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:37.610
One set of causes is political:

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.205
lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:48.335
privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:50.775
all of these have contributed

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:54.892
to more and more income going to the very, very top.

00:03:54.892 --> 00:03:58.315
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped

00:03:58.315 --> 00:04:01.644
under the category of "crony capitalism,"

00:04:01.644 --> 00:04:03.821
political changes that benefit a group

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:05.983
of well-connected insiders

00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:09.521
but don't actually do much good for the rest of us.

00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.910
In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.951
is incredibly difficult.

00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:18.444
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes

00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:21.838
have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,

00:04:21.838 --> 00:04:24.867
or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks

00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:28.024
even after the most profound financial crisis

00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:29.646
since the Great Depression,

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:34.242
or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,

00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:38.253
including those whose motto might be "don't do evil,"

00:04:38.253 --> 00:04:41.027
to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that

00:04:41.027 --> 00:04:43.135
paid by the middle class.

00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:46.171
But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice

00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:48.167
is really, really hard,

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:51.635
at least intellectually, it's an easy problem.

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:57.284
After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.

00:04:57.284 --> 00:04:59.931
Indeed, this is one of those rare issues

00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:03.166
that unites the left and the right.

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:05.986
A critique of crony capitalism is as central

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:10.283
to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.

00:05:10.283 --> 00:05:14.621
But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,

00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:16.656
the easy part of the problem,

00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:19.931
things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers

00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:22.684
of surging income inequality.

00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:26.423
In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.

00:05:26.423 --> 00:05:29.470
Globalization and the technology revolution,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.010
the twin economic transformations

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.708
which are changing our lives

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.805
and transforming the global economy,

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:39.272
are also powering the rise of the super-rich.

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:40.852
Just think about it.

00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:42.840
For the first time in history,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.579
if you are an energetic entrepreneur

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.278
with a brilliant new idea

00:05:47.278 --> 00:05:49.693
or a fantastic new product,

00:05:49.693 --> 00:05:53.372
you have almost instant, almost frictionless access

00:05:53.372 --> 00:05:57.352
to a global market of more than a billion people.

00:05:57.352 --> 00:06:01.186
As a result, if you are very, very smart

00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:02.981
and very, very lucky,

00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:05.832
you can get very, very rich

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:08.362
very, very quickly.

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:11.204
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.184
is David Karp.

00:06:13.184 --> 00:06:16.039
The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.821
recently sold his company to Yahoo

00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:21.854
for 1.1 billion dollars.

00:06:21.854 --> 00:06:23.392
Think about that for a minute:

00:06:23.392 --> 00:06:27.806
1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.

00:06:27.806 --> 00:06:31.253
It's easiest to see how the technology revolution

00:06:31.253 --> 00:06:34.874
and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect

00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:36.817
in highly visible fields,

00:06:36.817 --> 00:06:39.120
like sports and entertainment.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.495
We can all watch how a fantastic athlete

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:46.839
or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.507
across the global economy as never before.

00:06:50.507 --> 00:06:52.587
But today, that superstar effect

00:06:52.587 --> 00:06:55.569
is happening across the entire economy.

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.746
We have superstar technologists.

00:06:57.746 --> 00:06:59.467
We have superstar bankers.

00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:02.803
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.

00:07:02.803 --> 00:07:04.232
There are superstar cooks

00:07:04.232 --> 00:07:05.744
and superstar farmers.

00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:08.527
There are even, and this is my personal favorite example,

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.518
superstar dentists,

00:07:10.518 --> 00:07:12.622
the most dazzling exemplar of whom

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:15.984
is Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers

00:07:15.984 --> 00:07:18.303
to the smiles of fellow superstars

00:07:18.303 --> 00:07:20.984
like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich

00:07:20.984 --> 00:07:23.845
or European-born American fashion designer

00:07:23.845 --> 00:07:25.890
Diane von Furstenberg.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.973
But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization

00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:30.885
and the technology revolution

00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:33.356
are creating this global plutocracy,

00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:37.523
what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.049
And that's because,

00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:41.426
in contrast with crony capitalism,

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:45.336
so much of what globalization and the technology revolution

00:07:45.336 --> 00:07:47.699
have done is highly positive.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.434
Let's start with technology.

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:53.044
I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:54.878
I love the fact that they mean that

00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:58.564
whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk

00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:00.611
far beyond this auditorium.

00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.720
I'm even more of a fan of globalization.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.707
This is the transformation

00:08:05.707 --> 00:08:08.131
which has lifted hundreds of millions

00:08:08.131 --> 00:08:11.180
of the world's poorest people out of poverty

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.622
and into the middle class,

00:08:12.622 --> 00:08:15.664
and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,

00:08:15.664 --> 00:08:19.171
it's made many new products affordable --

00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:21.697
who do you think built your iPhone? —

00:08:21.697 --> 00:08:25.519
and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:28.143
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.

00:08:28.143 --> 00:08:30.679
So what's not to like?

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:32.571
Well, a few things.

00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:34.675
One of the things that worries me

00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:38.838
is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy

00:08:38.838 --> 00:08:41.534
can become crony plutocracy.

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:44.193
Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur

00:08:44.193 --> 00:08:47.570
who has successfully sold that idea or that product

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.949
to the global billions

00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:51.515
and become a billionaire in the process.

00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:53.884
It gets tempting at that point

00:08:53.884 --> 00:08:56.859
to use your economic nous

00:08:56.859 --> 00:09:01.131
to manipulate the rules of the global political economy

00:09:01.131 --> 00:09:03.217
in your own favor.

00:09:03.217 --> 00:09:05.966
And that's no mere hypothetical example.

00:09:05.966 --> 00:09:10.395
Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.

00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:12.499
These are among the world's most admired,

00:09:12.499 --> 00:09:15.045
most beloved, most innovative companies.

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:17.969
They also happen to be particularly adept

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:20.207
at working the international tax system

00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:24.765
so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:29.080
And why stop at just playing the global political

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.168
and economic system as it exists

00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:33.313
to your own maximum advantage?

00:09:33.313 --> 00:09:37.630
Once you have the tremendous economic power

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.703
that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution

00:09:40.703 --> 00:09:43.953
and the political power that inevitably entails,

00:09:43.953 --> 00:09:46.466
it becomes tempting as well

00:09:46.466 --> 00:09:50.054
to start trying to change the rules of the game

00:09:50.054 --> 00:09:52.156
in your own favor.

00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:54.890
Again, this is no mere hypothetical.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.825
It's what the Russian oligarchs did

00:09:56.825 --> 00:10:00.087
in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization

00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:02.057
of Russia's natural resources.

00:10:02.057 --> 00:10:03.831
It's one way of describing what happened

00:10:03.831 --> 00:10:05.866
with deregulation of the financial services

00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:08.101
in the U.S. and the U.K.

00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:10.027
A second thing that worries me

00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:12.758
is how easily meritocratic plutocracy

00:10:12.758 --> 00:10:15.504
can become aristocracy.

00:10:15.504 --> 00:10:17.579
One way of describing the plutocrats

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:19.386
is as alpha geeks,

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:21.900
and they are people who are acutely aware

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.308
of how important highly sophisticated

00:10:24.308 --> 00:10:28.490
analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.909
That's why they are spending

00:10:30.909 --> 00:10:33.686
unprecedented time and resources

00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:35.583
educating their own children.

00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:38.850
The middle class is spending more on schooling too,

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.211
but in the global educational arms race

00:10:41.211 --> 00:10:42.995
that starts at nursery school

00:10:42.995 --> 00:10:46.733
and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,

00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:50.211
the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned

00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:51.750
by the One Percent.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.456
The result is something that economists Alan Krueger

00:10:54.456 --> 00:10:58.161
and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.

00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:00.964
As income inequality increases,

00:11:00.964 --> 00:11:03.737
social mobility decreases.

00:11:03.737 --> 00:11:06.495
The plutocracy may be a meritocracy,

00:11:06.495 --> 00:11:08.711
but increasingly you have to be born

00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:13.595
on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.

00:11:13.595 --> 00:11:16.619
The third thing, and this is what worries me the most,

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:20.970
is the extent to which those same largely positive forces

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.160
which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.592
also happen to be hollowing out the middle class

00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:30.546
in Western industrialized economies.

00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:32.633
Let's start with technology.

00:11:32.633 --> 00:11:35.706
Those same forces that are creating billionaires

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:39.729
are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.

00:11:39.729 --> 00:11:42.668
When's the last time you used a travel agent?

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:45.749
And in contrast with the industrial revolution,

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:47.905
the titans of our new economy

00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:50.707
aren't creating that many new jobs.

00:11:50.707 --> 00:11:54.526
At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:57.549
Facebook fewer than 10,000.

00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:00.219
The same is true of globalization.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:03.462
For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people

00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:05.802
out of poverty in the emerging markets,

00:12:05.802 --> 00:12:08.668
it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs

00:12:08.668 --> 00:12:10.969
from the developed Western economies.

00:12:10.969 --> 00:12:13.736
The terrifying reality is

00:12:13.736 --> 00:12:15.993
that there is no economic rule

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:18.930
which automatically translates

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.633
increased economic growth

00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:22.943
into widely shared prosperity.

00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:25.617
That's shown in what I consider to be

00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:29.300
the most scary economic statistic of our time.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.358
Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity

00:12:33.358 --> 00:12:36.020
have been decoupled from increases

00:12:36.036 --> 00:12:37.970
in wages and employment.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.914
That means that our countries are getting richer,

00:12:40.914 --> 00:12:43.538
our companies are getting more efficient,

00:12:43.538 --> 00:12:45.479
but we're not creating more jobs

00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:49.350
and we're not paying people, as a whole, more.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.559
One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:57.270
is to worry about structural unemployment.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.057
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.

00:13:01.057 --> 00:13:03.649
After all, in a totally free labor market,

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:06.851
we could find jobs for pretty much everyone.

00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:08.879
The dystopia that worries me

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:12.525
is a universe in which a few geniuses

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.605
invent Google and its ilk

00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:19.800
and the rest of us are employed giving them massages.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.433
So when I get really depressed about all of this,

00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:26.262
I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.

00:13:26.262 --> 00:13:30.157
After all, for all its grim, satanic mills,

00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:32.657
it worked out pretty well, didn't it?

00:13:32.657 --> 00:13:39.680
After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller --

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.706
well, there are a few exceptions —

00:13:41.706 --> 00:13:46.697
and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.

00:13:46.697 --> 00:13:49.281
But it's important to remember

00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:52.103
that before we learned how to share the fruits

00:13:52.103 --> 00:13:53.782
of the Industrial Revolution

00:13:53.782 --> 00:13:56.345
with the broad swathes of society,

00:13:56.345 --> 00:13:59.740
we had to go through two depressions,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.599
the Great Depression of the 1930s,

00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:04.453
the Long Depression of the 1870s,

00:14:04.453 --> 00:14:07.620
two world wars, communist revolutions

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.699
in Russia and in China,

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:12.024
and an era of tremendous social

00:14:12.024 --> 00:14:14.780
and political upheaval in the West.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.500
We also, not coincidentally,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.038
went through an era of tremendous

00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:22.617
social and political inventions.

00:14:22.617 --> 00:14:24.961
We created the modern welfare state.

00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:26.703
We created public education.

00:14:26.703 --> 00:14:28.407
We created public health care.

00:14:28.407 --> 00:14:30.182
We created public pensions.

00:14:30.182 --> 00:14:32.207
We created unions.

00:14:32.207 --> 00:14:34.723
Today, we are living through an era

00:14:34.723 --> 00:14:36.684
of economic transformation

00:14:36.684 --> 00:14:39.990
comparable in its scale and its scope

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.258
to the Industrial Revolution.

00:14:42.258 --> 00:14:45.449
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all

00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:47.567
and not just the plutocrats,

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:49.231
we need to embark on an era

00:14:49.231 --> 00:14:53.150
of comparably ambitious social and political change.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.808
We need a new New Deal.

00:14:55.808 --> 00:14:59.808
(Applause)
