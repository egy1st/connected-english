00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:01.894
My name is Tom,

00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:05.070
and I've come here today to come clean

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:08.527
about what I do for money.

00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:12.027
Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways

00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:14.217
in exchange for cash.

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:15.312
(Laughter)

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:18.511
I usually do this kind of thing
in seedy downtown bars

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:20.134
and on street corners,

00:00:20.158 --> 00:00:23.230
so this mightn't be
the most appropriate setting,

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:27.063
but I'd like to give you guys
a bit of a demonstration

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:30.210
about what I do.

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:42.659
(Beatboxing)

00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:05.752
And now, for my next number,

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:10.286
I'd like to return to the classics.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.356
(Applause)

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.743
We're going to take it back,

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.876
way back,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.962
back into time.

00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:30.129
(Beatboxing: "Billie Jean")

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:45.715
♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.646
♫ She's just a girl who claims
that I am the one ♫

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.619
♫ But the kid is not my son ♫

00:02:54.643 --> 00:02:59.541
(Applause) All right.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.459
Wassup.

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:06.968
Thank you very much, TEDx.

00:03:06.992 --> 00:03:09.498
If you guys haven't
figured it out already,

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.719
my name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer,

00:03:11.743 --> 00:03:14.120
which means all the sounds
that you just heard

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:17.071
were made entirely using just my voice,

00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:19.184
and the only thing was my voice.

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.126
And I can assure you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.776
there are absolutely no effects

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.147
on this microphone whatsoever.

00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:33.304
And I'm very, very stoked —

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:34.645
(Applause)

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.399
You guys are just applauding
for everything. It's great.

00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:42.807
Look at this, Mom! I made it!

00:03:42.831 --> 00:03:45.883
I'm very, very stoked to be here today,

00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:47.907
representing my kinfolk

00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:51.135
and all those that haven't
managed to make a career

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.733
out of an innate ability
for inhuman noisemaking.

00:03:54.757 --> 00:03:57.668
Because it is a bit of a niche market,

00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:00.032
and there's not much work going on,

00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:01.518
especially where I'm from.

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:02.876
You know, I'm from Brisbane,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.498
which is a great city to live in.

00:04:04.522 --> 00:04:07.381
Yeah! All right! Most of Brisbane's here.
That's good.

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:08.898
(Laughter)

00:04:08.922 --> 00:04:11.259
You know, I'm from Brizzy,

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:12.966
which is a great city to live in,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.337
but let's be honest --

00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:18.202
it's not exactly the cultural
hub of the Southern Hemisphere.

00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:21.606
So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.374
and outside Australia,

00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:26.469
and so the pursuit of this
crazy passion of mine

00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:27.839
has enabled me to see

00:04:27.863 --> 00:04:30.391
so many amazing places in the world.

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:35.734
So I'd like to share with you,
if I may, my experiences.

00:04:35.758 --> 00:04:37.652
So ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:40.625
I would like to take you on a journey

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:42.182
throughout the continents

00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:46.359
and throughout sound itself.

00:04:46.383 --> 00:04:50.688
We start our journey
in the central deserts.

00:04:50.712 --> 00:05:00.662
(Didgeridoo)

00:05:00.686 --> 00:05:04.197
(Airplane)

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:05.617
India.

00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:19.693
(Beatboxing)

00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:25.063
(Sitar)

00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:26.848
China.

00:05:26.872 --> 00:05:39.690
(Guzheng)

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:46.489
(Beatboxing)

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.602
Germany.

00:05:48.626 --> 00:06:02.106
(Beatboxing)

00:06:07.077 --> 00:06:08.795
Party, party, yeah.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.906
(Laughter)

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.363
And before we reach our final destination,

00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:18.966
ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.300
I would like to share
with you some technology

00:06:21.324 --> 00:06:24.563
that I brought all the way
from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane.

00:06:24.587 --> 00:06:28.608
These things in front of me
here are called Kaoss Pads,

00:06:28.632 --> 00:06:31.636
and they allow me to do a whole
lot of different things

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.745
with my voice.

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:36.243
For example, the one on the left here

00:06:36.267 --> 00:06:38.488
allows me to add

00:06:38.512 --> 00:06:41.585
a little bit of reverb to my sound,

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.224
which gives me that --

00:06:43.248 --> 00:06:49.456
(Trumpet) --

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.030
flavor.

00:06:51.054 --> 00:06:52.382
(Laughter)

00:06:52.406 --> 00:06:54.088
And the other ones here,

00:06:54.112 --> 00:06:56.174
I can use them in unison

00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:59.003
to mimic the effect of a drum machine

00:06:59.027 --> 00:07:00.070
or something like that.

00:07:00.094 --> 00:07:02.933
I can sample in my own sounds
and I can play it back

00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:07.976
just by hitting the pads here.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:21.535
(Noises)

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:27.605
TEDx.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:36.313
(Music)

00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:49.884
(Applause)

00:07:49.908 --> 00:07:54.264
I got way too much time on my hands.

00:07:54.288 --> 00:07:55.622
And last but not least,

00:07:55.646 --> 00:07:58.668
the one on my right here allows me to

00:07:58.692 --> 00:08:02.328
loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop

00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:04.935
my voice.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:08.005
So with all that in mind,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.855
I would like to take you on a journey

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:13.135
to a completely separate part of Earth

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.808
as I transform the Sydney Opera House

00:08:15.832 --> 00:08:20.095
into a smoky downtown jazz bar.

00:08:20.119 --> 00:08:23.914
All right boys, take it away.

00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:28.262
(Music)

00:08:33.482 --> 00:08:35.254
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you

00:08:35.278 --> 00:08:36.850
to a very special friend of mine,

00:08:36.874 --> 00:08:39.028
one of the greatest
double bassists I know.

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:43.582
Mr. Smokey Jefferson, let's take
it for a walk. Come on, baby.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:49.954
(Music)

00:09:26.946 --> 00:09:28.470
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:28.494 --> 00:09:30.875
I'd like to introduce you
to the star of the show,

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:33.162
one of the greatest jazz
legends of our time.

00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:35.763
Music lovers and jazz lovers alike,

00:09:35.787 --> 00:09:37.946
please give a warm hand of applause

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.705
for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom.
Take it away.

00:09:41.729 --> 00:09:46.163
(Music)

00:09:46.187 --> 00:09:53.291
(Applause)

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.393
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:09.494
(Applause)
