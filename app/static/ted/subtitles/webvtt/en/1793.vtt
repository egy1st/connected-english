WEBVTT

00:00:00.486 --> 00:00:04.546
I love paper, and I love technology,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.877
and what I do is I make paper interactive.

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:10.330
And that's what I say when
people ask me what I do,

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:12.229
but it really confuses most people,

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:14.408
so really, the best way
for me to convey it

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:17.420
is to take the technology and be creative

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:19.521
and create experiences.

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.773
So I tried to think
what I could use for here,

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:23.893
and a couple of weeks
ago I had a crazy idea

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:27.706
that I wanted to print two DJ decks

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.190
and to try and mix some music.

00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:32.405
And I'm going to try
and show that at the end,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.914
and the suspense will be
as much mine if it works.

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:38.580
And I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician,

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:41.303
so I'm a little bit scared of that.

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:46.840
So I think, I found the best
way to describe my journey

00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:48.490
is just to mention a few little things

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.590
that have happened to me
throughout my life.

00:00:50.614 --> 00:00:52.872
There's three particular
things that I've done,

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:54.563
and I'll just describe those first,

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.582
and then talk about some of my work.

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:59.811
So when I was a kid,
I was obsessed with wires,

00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:02.917
and I used to thread them under my carpet

00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:04.510
and thread them behind the walls

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.832
and have little switches
and little speakers,

00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:09.548
and I wanted to make
my bedroom be interactive

00:01:09.572 --> 00:01:11.078
but kind of all hidden away.

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:15.119
And I was also really
interested in wireless as well.

00:01:15.143 --> 00:01:17.763
So I bought one of those
little kits that you could get

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:19.348
to make a radio transmitter,

00:01:19.372 --> 00:01:22.613
and I got an old book
and I carved out the inside

00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:24.483
and I hid it inside there,

00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:26.890
and then I placed it next to my dad

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:30.968
and snuck back to my bedroom
and tuned in on the radio

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:32.696
so I could eavesdrop.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.101
I was not at all interested
in what he was saying.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:36.939
It's more that I just liked the idea

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.453
of an everyday object

00:01:38.477 --> 00:01:39.734
having something inside

00:01:39.758 --> 00:01:43.136
and doing something different.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.802
Several year later,

00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:48.025
I managed to successfully
fail all of my exams

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.750
and didn't really leave school
with much to show for at all,

00:01:52.774 --> 00:01:56.308
and my parents, maybe as a reward,

00:01:56.332 --> 00:01:58.168
bought me what turned out to be

00:01:58.192 --> 00:01:59.878
a one-way ticket to Australia,

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:03.320
and I came back home
about four years later.

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:07.302
I ended up on a farm
in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.750
It was in far western New South Wales.

00:02:09.774 --> 00:02:12.501
And this farm was 120,000 acres.

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:14.294
There were 22,000 sheep,

00:02:14.318 --> 00:02:16.208
and it was about 40 degrees,

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:18.862
or 100 or so Fahrenheit.

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:21.896
And on this farm there
was the farmer, his wife,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.607
and there was the four-year-old daughter.

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.229
And they kind of took me into the farm

00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:30.002
and showed me what it
was like to live and work.

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.788
Obviously, one of the most important
things was the sheep,

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:35.725
and so my job was, well,
pretty much to do everything,

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.125
but it was about bringing
the sheep back to the homestead.

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.116
And we'd do that by building fences,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.670
using motorbikes and horses,

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:46.123
and the sheep would make
their way all the way back

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:49.930
to the shearing shed
for the different seasons.

00:02:49.954 --> 00:02:51.838
And what I learned was,

00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:53.934
although at the time, like everyone else,

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.578
I thought sheep were pretty stupid

00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:57.286
because they didn't do
what we wanted them to do,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.407
what I realize now, probably
only just in the last few weeks

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.438
looking back, is the sheep
weren't stupid at all.

00:03:02.462 --> 00:03:04.870
We'd put them in an environment
where they didn't want to be,

00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:07.418
and they didn't want to do
what we wanted them to do.

00:03:07.442 --> 00:03:09.832
So the challenge was to try and get them

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:10.854
to do what we wanted them to do

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:13.945
by listening to the weather,
the lay of the land,

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.956
and creating things
that would let the sheep flow

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.654
and go where we wanted them to go.

00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:21.261
Another bunch of years later,

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:23.620
I ended up at Cambridge University

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:25.802
at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.

00:03:25.826 --> 00:03:27.516
doing a Ph.D. in physics.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.540
My Ph.D. was to move electrons
around, one at a time.

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:35.196
And I realize — again, it's kind
of these realizations

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.395
looking back as to what I did —

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.326
I realize now that it
was pretty much the same

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.163
as moving sheep around.

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:44.437
It really is.

00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:47.293
It's just you do it
by changing an environment.

00:03:47.317 --> 00:03:49.344
And that's kind
of been a big lesson to me,

00:03:49.368 --> 00:03:50.940
that you can't act on any object.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.488
You change its environment,
and the object will flow.

00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:55.530
So we made it very small,

00:03:55.554 --> 00:03:58.418
so things were about 30
nanometers in size;

00:03:58.442 --> 00:04:03.213
making it very cold, so
at liquid helium temperatures;

00:04:03.237 --> 00:04:06.273
and changing environment
by changing the voltage,

00:04:06.297 --> 00:04:09.737
and the electrons could
make flow around a loop

00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.374
one at a time, on and off,
a little memory node.

00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:14.310
And I wanted to go one step further,

00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:16.493
and I wanted to move one electron on

00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:18.428
and one electron off.

00:04:18.452 --> 00:04:21.290
And I was told that I wouldn't
be able to do this,

00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:23.304
which, you know, as we've heard
from other people,

00:04:23.328 --> 00:04:25.138
that's the thing that makes you do it.

00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:28.676
And I was determined, and I managed
to show that I could do that.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.415
And a lot of that learning, I think,

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.920
came from being on that farm,

00:04:31.944 --> 00:04:33.945
because when I was working on the farm,

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.973
we'd have to use what was around us,

00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:37.766
we'd have to use the environment,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.640
and there was no such thing

00:04:39.664 --> 00:04:40.950
as something can't be done,

00:04:40.974 --> 00:04:42.832
because you're in an environment where,

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:45.045
if you can't do what you need to do,

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.655
you can die, and, you know,

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:50.385
I had seen that sort of thing happen.

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.995
So now my obsession is printing,

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:55.812
and I'm really fascinated by the idea

00:04:55.836 --> 00:04:58.756
of using conventional printing processes,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.981
so the types of print
that are used to create

00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:02.339
many of the things around us

00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:06.104
to make paper and card interactive.

00:05:06.128 --> 00:05:08.225
When I spoke to some printers
when I started doing this

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:09.869
and told them what I wanted to do,

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.095
which was to print
conductive inks onto paper,

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:13.691
they told me it couldn't be done,

00:05:13.715 --> 00:05:15.937
again, that kind of favorite thing.

00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:20.643
So I got about 10 credit cards and loans

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:24.141
and got myself very close
to bankruptcy, really,

00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:26.234
and bought myself this
huge printing press,

00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:28.358
which I had no idea how to use at all.

00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:29.889
It was about five meters long,

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.147
and I covered myself
and the floor with ink

00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:35.435
and made a massive mess,
but I learned to print.

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:37.964
And then I took it back to the printers
and showed them what I've done,

00:05:37.988 --> 00:05:40.179
and they were like, "Of
course you can do that.

00:05:40.203 --> 00:05:42.383
Why didn't you come here
in the first place?"

00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:45.353
That's always the case.

00:05:45.377 --> 00:05:49.140
So what we do is we take
conventional printing presses,

00:05:49.164 --> 00:05:51.095
we make conductive inks,

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:54.588
and run those through a press,
and basically

00:05:54.612 --> 00:05:57.940
just letting hundreds
of thousands of electrons flow

00:05:57.964 --> 00:05:59.311
through pieces of paper

00:05:59.335 --> 00:06:01.300
so we can make that paper interactive.

00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:02.801
And it's pretty simple, really.

00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:05.664
It's just a collection of things
that have been done before,

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:07.879
but bringing them together
in a different way.

00:06:07.903 --> 00:06:10.503
So we have a piece of paper
with conductive ink on,

00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:15.116
and then add onto that a small circuit
board with a couple of chips,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.182
one to run some capacitive touch software,

00:06:17.206 --> 00:06:18.826
so we know where we've touched it,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.364
and the other to run, quite often,

00:06:21.388 --> 00:06:25.327
some wireless software so
the piece of paper can connect.

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:28.734
So I'll just describe a couple
of things that we've created.

00:06:28.758 --> 00:06:30.997
There's lots of different
things we've created.

00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:33.438
This is one of them, because I love cake.

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:36.130
And this one, it's a large poster,

00:06:36.154 --> 00:06:38.368
and you touch it and it has
a little speaker behind it,

00:06:38.392 --> 00:06:40.606
and the poster talks
to you when you touch it

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.297
and asks you a series of questions,

00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:44.311
and it works out your perfect cake.

00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:46.707
But it doesn't tell you
the cake there and then.

00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:48.305
It uploads a picture,

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:50.703
and the reason why it
chose that cake for you,

00:06:50.727 --> 00:06:53.926
to our Facebook page and to Twitter.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.753
So we're trying to create that connection

00:06:56.777 --> 00:06:58.539
between the physical and the digital,

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:00.577
but have it not looking on a screen,

00:07:00.601 --> 00:07:03.700
and just looking like a regular poster.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:08.436
We've worked with a bunch
of universities on a project

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.413
looking at interactive newsprint.

00:07:10.437 --> 00:07:12.554
So for example, we've created a newspaper,

00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:13.869
a regular newspaper.

00:07:13.893 --> 00:07:16.854
You can wear a pair of headphones
that are connected to it wirelessly,

00:07:16.878 --> 00:07:19.021
and when you touch it,
you can hear the music

00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:22.045
that's described on the top,
which is something you can't read.

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:24.211
You can hear a press conference

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.755
as well as reading
what the editor has determined

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.303
that press conference was about.

00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:30.440
And you can press a Facebook "like" button

00:07:30.464 --> 00:07:33.119
or you can vote on something as well.

00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:34.358
Something else that we created,

00:07:34.382 --> 00:07:36.622
and this was an idea that I had
a couple of years ago,

00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:37.691
and so we've done a project on this.

00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:39.732
It was for funding from the government

00:07:39.756 --> 00:07:43.262
for user-centered design
for energy-efficient buildings,

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:45.296
difficult to say, and something
I had no idea what it was

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.080
when I went into the workshop,
but quickly learned.

00:07:48.104 --> 00:07:50.243
And we wanted to try and encourage people

00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:52.091
to use energy better.

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:55.613
And I really liked the idea that,
instead of looking at dials

00:07:55.637 --> 00:07:58.159
and reading things to say --

00:07:58.183 --> 00:08:00.101
looking at your energy usage,

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:03.355
I wanted to create a poster
that was wirelessly connected

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:04.999
and had color-changing inks on it,

00:08:05.023 --> 00:08:08.575
and so if your energy usage
was trending better,

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:10.902
than the leaves would appear
and the rabbits would appear

00:08:10.926 --> 00:08:12.288
and all would be good.

00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:14.312
And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti

00:08:14.336 --> 00:08:16.241
and the leaves would fall off the trees.

00:08:16.265 --> 00:08:18.731
So it was trying to make
you look after something

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:20.856
in your immediate environment,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.345
which you don't want to see
not looking so good,

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.472
rather than expecting people to do things

00:08:25.496 --> 00:08:27.783
in the local environment
because of the effect

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:29.262
that it has a long way off.

00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:31.620
And I think, kind of like going
back to the farm,

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.648
it's about how to let people
do what you want them to do

00:08:34.672 --> 00:08:39.065
rather than making people do
what you want them to do.

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:40.525
Okay.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.347
So this is the bit I'm really scared of.

00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:45.586
So a couple of things I've created are,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.003
there's a poster over here

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.434
that you can play drums on.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:54.181
And I am not a musician. It seemed
like a good idea at the time.

00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:56.953
If anyone wants to try
and play drums, then they can.

00:08:56.977 --> 00:08:58.597
I'll just describe how this works.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.591
This poster is wirelessly
connected to my cell phone,

00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:05.467
and when you touch it,
it connects to the app.

00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:12.157
(Drums)

00:09:13.778 --> 00:09:15.598
And it has really good response time.

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:19.828
It's using Bluetooth 4, so
it's pretty instantaneous.

00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:22.880
Okay. Thanks.

00:09:22.904 --> 00:09:26.620
(Applause)

00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:28.930
And there's a couple of other things.

00:09:28.954 --> 00:09:31.462
So this one is like a sound board,

00:09:31.486 --> 00:09:36.072
so you can touch it, and I just
love these horrible noises.

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:40.116
(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass)

00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:46.661
Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable.

00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:49.118
So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,

00:09:49.142 --> 00:09:53.755
and this is a software
that's running on the iPad.

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:57.379
Oh, yes. I just love doing that.

00:09:57.403 --> 00:10:00.403
I'm not a D.J., though, but I just
always wanted to do that.

00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:02.804
(Scratching)

00:10:02.828 --> 00:10:07.697
So I have a crossfader,
and I have the two decks.

00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:10.052
So I've made some new technology,

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.648
and I love things being creative,

00:10:11.672 --> 00:10:13.577
and I love working with creative people.

00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:16.249
So my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,

00:10:16.273 --> 00:10:17.269
and she's called Charlotte,

00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:19.455
and I asked her to record something,

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:21.384
and I worked with a friend called Elliot

00:10:21.408 --> 00:10:22.901
to put some beats together.

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.961
So this is my niece, Charlotte.

00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:35.530
(Music)

00:10:58.273 --> 00:11:00.332
Yay!

00:11:00.356 --> 00:11:09.398
(Applause)

00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:11.470
So that's pretty much what I do.

00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:13.126
I just love bringing technology together,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.067
having a lot of fun, being creative.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.815
But it's not about the technology.

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:19.679
It's just about, I want to create
some great experiences.

00:11:19.703 --> 00:11:21.079
So thank you very much.

00:11:21.103 --> 00:11:26.119
(Applause)
