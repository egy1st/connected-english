00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:03.057
I'm going to talk about consciousness.

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:04.537
Why consciousness?

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.363
Well, it's a curiously neglected subject,

00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:10.927
both in our scientific
and our philosophical culture.

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:12.199
Now why is that curious?

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:15.709
Well, it is the most important
aspect of our lives

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.667
for a very simple, logical reason,

00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:20.064
namely, it's a necessary
condition on anything

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:22.541
being important in our lives
that we're conscious.

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:25.700
You care about science, philosophy,
music, art, whatever --

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:29.178
it's no good if you're
a zombie or in a coma, right?

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:31.522
So consciousness is number one.

00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:33.990
The second reason is that when people do

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:36.306
get interested in it,
as I think they should,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.157
they tend to say
the most appalling things.

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:41.801
And then, even when they're
not saying appalling things

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:44.159
and they're really trying
to do serious research,

00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:47.300
well, it's been slow.
Progress has been slow.

00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:50.440
When I first got interested
in this, I thought, well,

00:00:50.464 --> 00:00:52.646
it's a straightforward problem in biology.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.143
Let's get these brain stabbers
to get busy and figure out

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:56.027
how it works in the brain.

00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.051
So I went over to UCSF and I talked to all

00:00:58.075 --> 00:00:59.844
the heavy-duty neurobiologists there,

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:01.420
and they showed some impatience,

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:04.803
as scientists often do when you
ask them embarrassing questions.

00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:08.561
But the thing that struck me is,
one guy said in exasperation,

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:10.728
a very famous neurobiologist,
he said, "Look,

00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:14.151
in my discipline it's okay to be
interested in consciousness,

00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:17.718
but get tenure first. Get tenure first."

00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:20.436
Now I've been working
on this for a long time.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.414
I think now you might actually get tenure

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:23.772
by working on consciousness.

00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:26.318
If so, that's a real step forward.

00:01:26.342 --> 00:01:29.223
Okay, now why then is this
curious reluctance

00:01:29.247 --> 00:01:31.121
and curious hostility to consciousness?

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:33.851
Well, I think it's a combination
of two features

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.756
of our intellectual culture

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.282
that like to think they're
opposing each other

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:41.905
but in fact they share
a common set of assumptions.

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.867
One feature is the tradition
of religious dualism:

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:49.192
Consciousness is not a part
of the physical world.

00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:51.119
It's a part of the spiritual world.

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.655
It belongs to the soul,

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.951
and the soul is not a part
of the physical world.

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:58.982
That's the tradition of God,
the soul and immortality.

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.087
There's another tradition
that thinks it's opposed to this

00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:03.191
but accepts the worst assumption.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:07.269
That tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty
scientific materialists:

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.734
Consciousness is not a part
of the physical world.

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:13.380
Either it doesn't exist at all,
or it's something else,

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:16.030
a computer program
or some damn fool thing,

00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:19.225
but in any case it's not part of science.

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.433
And I used to get in an argument
that really gave me a stomachache.

00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:23.052
Here's how it went.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:27.084
Science is objective,
consciousness is subjective,

00:02:27.108 --> 00:02:30.411
therefore there cannot be
a science of consciousness.

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:36.915
Okay, so these twin
traditions are paralyzing us.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.783
It's very hard to get
out of these twin traditions.

00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:42.801
And I have only one real
message in this lecture,

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:46.185
and that is, consciousness
is a biological phenomenon

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.074
like photosynthesis, digestion, mitosis --

00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:53.409
you know all the biological phenomena
-- and once you accept that,

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:56.048
most, though not all, of the hard problems

00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:58.323
about consciousness simply evaporate.

00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:00.376
And I'm going to go through some of them.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.709
Okay, now I promised you to tell you some

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:05.448
of the outrageous things
said about consciousness.

00:03:05.472 --> 00:03:09.048
One: Consciousness does not exist.

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.278
It's an illusion, like sunsets.

00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:16.343
Science has shown sunsets
and rainbows are illusions.

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:18.266
So consciousness is an illusion.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.521
Two: Well, maybe it exists,
but it's really something else.

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:25.302
It's a computer program
running in the brain.

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:29.116
Three: No, the only thing
that exists is really behavior.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.724
It's embarrassing how influential
behaviorism was,

00:03:32.748 --> 00:03:34.079
but I'll get back to that.

00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:36.813
And four: Maybe consciousness exists,

00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:39.028
but it can't make
any difference to the world.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.748
How could spirituality move anything?

00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:43.963
Now, whenever somebody
tells me that, I think,

00:03:43.987 --> 00:03:46.253
you want to see spirituality
move something?

00:03:46.277 --> 00:03:49.105
Watch. I decide consciously
to raise my arm,

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.714
and the damn thing goes up. (Laughter)

00:03:51.738 --> 00:03:55.485
Furthermore, notice this:

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:59.480
We do not say, "Well, it's a bit
like the weather in Geneva.

00:03:59.504 --> 00:04:02.128
Some days it goes up and some days
it doesn't go up."

00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:04.783
No. It goes up whenever
I damn well want it to.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.093
Okay. I'm going to tell
you how that's possible.

00:04:07.117 --> 00:04:10.592
Now, I haven't yet given you a definition.

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:12.950
You can't do this if you
don't give a definition.

00:04:12.974 --> 00:04:15.936
People always say consciousness
is very hard to define.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.819
I think it's rather easy to define

00:04:17.843 --> 00:04:20.028
if you're not trying to give
a scientific definition.

00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:22.308
We're not ready
for a scientific definition,

00:04:22.332 --> 00:04:24.094
but here's a common-sense definition.

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:26.896
Consciousness consists
of all those states of feeling

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.964
or sentience or awareness.

00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:32.522
It begins in the morning when you
wake up from a dreamless sleep,

00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:34.991
and it goes on all day
until you fall asleep

00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:38.189
or die or otherwise become unconscious.

00:04:38.213 --> 00:04:41.309
Dreams are a form of consciousness
on this definition.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:44.211
Now, that's the common-sense definition.
That's our target.

00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:47.712
If you're not talking about that,
you're not talking about consciousness.

00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:51.196
But they think, "Well, if that's it,
that's an awful problem.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.154
How can such a thing exist
as part of the real world?"

00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:57.512
And this, if you've ever
had a philosophy course,

00:04:57.536 --> 00:05:00.263
this is known as the famous
mind-body problem.

00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:03.526
I think that has a simple solution too.
I'm going to give it to you.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.528
And here it is: All of our conscious
states, without exception,

00:05:07.552 --> 00:05:13.053
are caused by lower-level
neurobiological processes in the brain,

00:05:13.077 --> 00:05:15.234
and they are realized in the brain

00:05:15.258 --> 00:05:17.568
as higher-level or system features.

00:05:17.592 --> 00:05:20.724
It's about as mysterious
as the liquidity of water.

00:05:20.748 --> 00:05:24.199
Right? The liquidity is not
an extra juice squirted out

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:25.889
by the H2O molecules.

00:05:25.913 --> 00:05:28.767
It's a condition that the system is in.

00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:33.929
And just as the jar full of water
can go from liquid to solid

00:05:33.953 --> 00:05:36.001
depending on the behavior
of the molecules,

00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:38.878
so your brain can go
from a state of being conscious

00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:40.518
to a state of being unconscious,

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:43.504
depending on the behavior
of the molecules.

00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:47.889
The famous mind-body
problem is that simple.

00:05:47.913 --> 00:05:51.066
All right? But now we get
into some harder questions.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.510
Let's specify the exact
features of consciousness,

00:05:54.534 --> 00:05:56.982
so that we can then answer
those four objections

00:05:57.006 --> 00:05:58.269
that I made to it.

00:05:58.293 --> 00:06:02.536
Well, the first feature is,
it's real and irreducible.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.590
You can't get rid of it.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:08.761
You see, the distinction
between reality and illusion

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.430
is the distinction between how things

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:15.304
consciously seem to us
and how they really are.

00:06:15.328 --> 00:06:17.180
It consciously seems like there's --

00:06:17.204 --> 00:06:18.848
I like the French "arc-en-ciel" —

00:06:18.872 --> 00:06:21.046
it seems like there's an arch in the sky,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.826
or it seems like the sun
is setting over the mountains.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.923
It consciously seems to us,
but that's not really happening.

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:29.850
But for that distinction between

00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:32.351
how things consciously seem
and how they really are,

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:36.406
you can't make that distinction
for the very existence of consciousness,

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.257
because where the very existence
of consciousness is concerned,

00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:43.237
if it consciously seems to you
that you are conscious,

00:06:43.261 --> 00:06:45.122
you are conscious.

00:06:45.146 --> 00:06:48.476
I mean, if a bunch of experts
come to me and say,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.167
"We are heavy-duty neurobiologists
and we've done a study

00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:53.917
of you, Searle, and we're
convinced you are not conscious,

00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:55.989
you are a very cleverly
constructed robot,"

00:06:56.013 --> 00:06:59.258
I don't think, "Well, maybe these
guys are right, you know?"

00:06:59.282 --> 00:07:01.821
I don't think that for a moment,
because, I mean,

00:07:01.845 --> 00:07:04.731
Descartes may have made a lot
of mistakes, but he was right about this.

00:07:04.755 --> 00:07:07.686
You cannot doubt the existence
of your own consciousness.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.996
Okay, that's the first
feature of consciousness.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.800
It's real and irreducible.

00:07:11.824 --> 00:07:15.031
You cannot get rid of it
by showing that it's an illusion

00:07:15.055 --> 00:07:18.260
in a way that you can
with other standard illusions.

00:07:18.284 --> 00:07:20.792
Okay, the second feature is this one

00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:23.257
that has been such
a source of trouble to us,

00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:25.439
and that is, all of our conscious states

00:07:25.463 --> 00:07:28.403
have this qualitative character to them.

00:07:28.427 --> 00:07:30.808
There's something that it
feels like to drink beer

00:07:30.832 --> 00:07:33.753
which is not what it feels
like to do your income tax

00:07:33.777 --> 00:07:36.821
or listen to music,
and this qualitative feel

00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:39.382
automatically generates a third feature,

00:07:39.406 --> 00:07:43.176
namely, conscious states
are by definition subjective

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.131
in the sense that they only exist
as experienced

00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:48.326
by some human or animal subject,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.199
some self that experiences them.

00:07:50.223 --> 00:07:52.582
Maybe we'll be able to build
a conscious machine.

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:54.735
Since we don't know how our brains do it,

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.870
we're not in a position, so far,
to build a conscious machine.

00:07:58.894 --> 00:08:01.645
Okay. Another feature of consciousness

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:05.796
is that it comes in unified
conscious fields.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.152
So I don't just have the sight
of the people in front of me

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:10.866
and the sound of my voice
and the weight of my shoes

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.041
against the floor, but they occur to me

00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:16.523
as part of one single
great conscious field

00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:18.539
that stretches forward and backward.

00:08:18.563 --> 00:08:20.308
That is the key to understanding

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:22.747
the enormous power of consciousness.

00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:25.691
And we have not been able
to do that in a robot.

00:08:25.715 --> 00:08:28.192
The disappointment of robotics
derives from the fact

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.550
that we don't know how to make
a conscious robot,

00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:33.599
so we don't have a machine
that can do this kind of thing.

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:36.107
Okay, the next feature of consciousness,

00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:39.222
after this marvelous
unified conscious field,

00:08:39.246 --> 00:08:42.015
is that it functions
causally in our behavior.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.218
I gave you a scientific
demonstration by raising my hand,

00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:46.968
but how is that possible?

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:50.732
How can it be that this
thought in my brain

00:08:50.756 --> 00:08:52.932
can move material objects?

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:54.433
Well, I'll tell you the answer.

00:08:54.457 --> 00:08:56.457
I mean, we don't know the detailed answer,

00:08:56.481 --> 00:08:59.159
but we know the basic part
of the answer, and that is,

00:08:59.183 --> 00:09:01.452
there is a sequence of neuron firings,

00:09:01.476 --> 00:09:04.539
and they terminate where the acetylcholine

00:09:04.563 --> 00:09:07.360
is secreted at the axon
end-plates of the motor neurons.

00:09:07.384 --> 00:09:09.480
Sorry to use philosophical
terminology here,

00:09:09.504 --> 00:09:13.451
but when it's secreted at the axon
end-plates of the motor neurons,

00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:16.237
a whole lot of wonderful things
happen in the ion channels

00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:18.143
and the damned arm goes up.

00:09:18.167 --> 00:09:20.267
Now, think of what I told you.

00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:22.009
One and the same event,

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:25.044
my conscious decision to raise my arm

00:09:25.068 --> 00:09:27.839
has a level of description
where it has all of these

00:09:27.863 --> 00:09:29.985
touchy-feely spiritual qualities.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:32.386
It's a thought in my brain,
but at the same time,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.372
it's busy secreting acetylcholine

00:09:34.396 --> 00:09:36.063
and doing all sorts of other things

00:09:36.087 --> 00:09:38.695
as it makes its way from the motor cortex

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:41.392
down through the nerve fibers in the arm.

00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:45.208
Now, what that tells us
is that our traditional vocabularies

00:09:45.232 --> 00:09:48.592
for discussing these issues
are totally obsolete.

00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:51.849
One and the same event has
a level of description

00:09:51.873 --> 00:09:54.815
where it's neurobiological,
and another level of description

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:57.006
where it's mental,
and that's a single event,

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.554
and that's how nature works.
That's how it's possible

00:09:59.578 --> 00:10:02.147
for consciousness to function causally.

00:10:02.171 --> 00:10:05.006
Okay, now with that in mind,

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.073
with going through these various
features of consciousness,

00:10:08.097 --> 00:10:11.245
let's go back and answer
some of those early objections.

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:14.854
Well, the first one I said was,
consciousness doesn't exist,

00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:16.688
it's an illusion. Well,
I've already answered that.

00:10:16.712 --> 00:10:18.712
I don't think we need to worry about that.

00:10:18.736 --> 00:10:22.068
But the second one had
an incredible influence,

00:10:22.092 --> 00:10:23.912
and may still be around, and that is,

00:10:23.936 --> 00:10:27.103
"Well, if consciousness exists,
it's really something else.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.866
It's really a digital computer
program running in your brain

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.414
and that's what we need to do
to create consciousness

00:10:33.438 --> 00:10:34.867
is get the right program.

00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:37.415
Yeah, forget about the hardware.
Any hardware will do

00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:40.582
provided it's rich enough and stable
enough to carry the program."

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:43.140
Now, we know that that's wrong.

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:46.149
I mean, anybody who's thought
about computers at all

00:10:46.173 --> 00:10:48.613
can see that that's wrong,
because computation

00:10:48.637 --> 00:10:51.028
is defined as symbol manipulation,

00:10:51.052 --> 00:10:53.957
usually thought of as zeros
as ones, but any symbols will do.

00:10:53.981 --> 00:10:57.079
You get an algorithm that you can program

00:10:57.103 --> 00:11:00.186
in a binary code,
and that's the defining trait

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.237
of the computer program.

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:06.120
But we know that that's purely
syntactical. That's symbolic.

00:11:06.144 --> 00:11:10.135
We know that actual human consciousness
has something more than that.

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:13.328
It's got a content
in addition to the syntax.

00:11:13.352 --> 00:11:14.825
It's got a semantics.

00:11:14.849 --> 00:11:17.314
Now that argument, I made
that argument 30 --

00:11:17.338 --> 00:11:18.605
oh my God, I don't want
to think about it —

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:19.947
more than 30 years ago,

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:22.876
but there's a deeper argument
implicit in what I've told you,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.919
and I want to tell you that argument
briefly, and that is,

00:11:25.943 --> 00:11:30.069
consciousness creates
an observer-independent reality.

00:11:30.093 --> 00:11:33.557
It creates a reality of money,
property, government,

00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:37.529
marriage, CERN conferences,

00:11:37.553 --> 00:11:40.148
cocktail parties and summer vacations,

00:11:40.172 --> 00:11:42.897
and all of those are creations
of consciousness.

00:11:42.921 --> 00:11:45.732
Their existence is observer-relative.

00:11:45.756 --> 00:11:49.235
It's only relative to conscious
agents that a piece of paper

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:52.082
is money or that a bunch
of buildings is a university.

00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:55.956
Now, ask yourself about computation.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.625
Is that absolute, like force and mass
and gravitational attraction?

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:01.757
Or is it observer-relative?

00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:05.284
Well, some computations are intrinsic.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.195
I add two plus two to get four.

00:12:07.219 --> 00:12:09.766
That's going on no matter
what anybody thinks.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.255
But when I haul out my pocket calculator

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:16.037
and do the calculation,
the only intrinsic phenomenon

00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:19.212
is the electronic circuit
and its behavior.

00:12:19.236 --> 00:12:20.976
That's the only absolute phenomenon.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.404
All the rest is interpreted by us.

00:12:23.428 --> 00:12:27.245
Computation only exists
relative to consciousness.

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:30.020
Either a conscious agent
is carrying out the computation,

00:12:30.044 --> 00:12:33.806
or he's got a piece of machinery that admits
of a computational interpretation.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.731
Now that doesn't mean
computation is arbitrary.

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:39.179
I spent a lot of money on this hardware.

00:12:39.203 --> 00:12:41.325
But we have this persistent confusion

00:12:41.349 --> 00:12:46.046
between objectivity and subjectivity
as features of reality

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.974
and objectivity and subjectivity
as features of claims.

00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:53.140
And the bottom line of this
part of my talk is this:

00:12:53.164 --> 00:12:56.791
You can have a completely
objective science,

00:12:56.815 --> 00:12:59.703
a science where you make
objectively true claims,

00:12:59.727 --> 00:13:03.133
about a domain whose existence
is subjective,

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:06.368
whose existence is in the human brain

00:13:06.392 --> 00:13:08.507
consisting of subjective
states of sentience

00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:10.192
or feeling or awareness.

00:13:10.216 --> 00:13:14.529
So the objection that you can't have
an objective science of consciousness

00:13:14.553 --> 00:13:18.737
because it's subjective and science
is objective, that's a pun.

00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:21.446
That's a bad pun on objectivity
and subjectivity.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.770
You can make objective claims

00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:27.812
about a domain that is subjective
in its mode of existence,

00:13:27.836 --> 00:13:29.385
and indeed that's what neurologists do.

00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:31.933
I mean, you have patients
that actually suffer pains,

00:13:31.957 --> 00:13:34.564
and you try to get
an objective science of that.

00:13:34.588 --> 00:13:36.636
Okay, I promised to refute all these guys,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.211
and I don't have an awful
lot of time left,

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:40.140
but let me refute a couple more of them.

00:13:40.164 --> 00:13:42.354
I said that behaviorism ought to be

00:13:42.378 --> 00:13:45.643
one of the great embarrassments
of our intellectual culture,

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.536
because it's refuted
the moment you think about it.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.393
Your mental states are identical
with your behavior?

00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:54.544
Well, think about the distinction
between feeling a pain

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:56.247
and engaging in pain behavior.

00:13:56.271 --> 00:13:58.235
I won't demonstrate pain
behavior, but I can tell you

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:00.074
I'm not having any pains right now.

00:14:00.098 --> 00:14:04.194
So it's an obvious mistake. Why
did they make the mistake?

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:06.409
The mistake was — and you
can go back and read

00:14:06.433 --> 00:14:09.100
the literature on this, you
can see this over and over —

00:14:09.124 --> 00:14:12.683
they think if you accept
the irreducible existence

00:14:12.707 --> 00:14:15.478
of consciousness, you're
giving up on science.

00:14:15.502 --> 00:14:18.549
You're giving up on 300
years of human progress

00:14:18.573 --> 00:14:20.383
and human hope and all the rest of it.

00:14:20.407 --> 00:14:23.198
And the message I want
to leave you with is,

00:14:23.222 --> 00:14:25.641
consciousness has to become accepted

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:28.129
as a genuine biological phenomenon,

00:14:28.153 --> 00:14:30.596
as much subject to scientific analysis

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.556
as any other phenomenon in biology,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.710
or, for that matter, the rest of science.

00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:36.092
Thank you very much.

00:14:36.116 --> 00:14:41.609
(Applause)
