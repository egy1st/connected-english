WEBVTT

00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:03.146
So if I was to ask you

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.560
what the connection between

00:00:04.584 --> 00:00:07.832
a bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was,

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:09.496
you'd probably think
that's the easiest question

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.276
that you're going to be asked
in Edinburgh all week.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.915
But if I was to say
that they're both examples

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.144
of alternative or new forms of currency

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:21.682
in a hyperconnected,
data-driven global economy,

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:25.211
you'd probably think
I was a little bit bonkers.

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:27.778
But trust me, I work in advertising.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.811
(Laughter)

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:31.870
And I am going to tell you the answer,

00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:34.480
but obviously after this short break.

00:00:34.504 --> 00:00:36.389
So a more challenging question is one

00:00:36.413 --> 00:00:38.272
that I was asked, actually,
by one of our writers

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:40.773
a couple of weeks ago,
and I didn't know the answer:

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:43.013
What's the world's best
performing currency?

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:44.923
It's actually Bitcoin.

00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:47.138
Now, for those of you
who may not be familiar,

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:50.596
Bitcoin is a crypto-currency, a virtual
currency, synthetic currency.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.402
It was founded in 2008
by this anonymous programmer

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:57.270
using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:00:57.294 --> 00:00:59.641
No one knows who or what he is.

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:01.902
He's almost like the Banksy
of the Internet.

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:05.010
And I'm probably not going
to do it proper service here,

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:07.177
but my interpretation
of how it works is that

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.960
Bitcoins are released
through this process of mining.

00:01:09.984 --> 00:01:12.508
So there's a network
of computers that are challenged

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:14.662
to solve a very complex
mathematical problem

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:17.928
and the person that manages to solve
it first gets the Bitcoins.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:18.914
And the Bitcoins are released,

00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:21.558
they're put into a public
ledger called the Blockchain,

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.211
and then they float, so
they become a currency,

00:01:24.235 --> 00:01:27.258
and completely decentralized,
that's the sort of

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:29.806
scary thing about this,
which is why it's so popular.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.282
So it's not run
by the authorities or the state.

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:34.359
It's actually managed by the network.

00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:36.622
And the reason that it's proved
very successful

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:40.040
is it's private, it's anonymous,
it's fast, and it's cheap.

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:43.832
And you do get to the point where
there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin.

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:46.747
So in one level it went
from something like 13 dollars

00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:49.339
to 266, literally
in the space of four months,

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:52.078
and then crashed and lost half
of its value in six hours.

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:53.912
And it's currently around that kind of

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:56.392
110 dollar mark in value.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.188
But what it does show
is that it's sort of gaining ground,

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:00.115
it's gaining respectability.

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.211
You get services,
like Reddit and Wordpress

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:05.506
are actually accepting Bitcoin
as a payment currency now.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.449
And that's showing you that people

00:02:07.473 --> 00:02:10.000
are actually placing trust in technology,

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:12.760
and it's started to trump and disrupt

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:14.805
and interrogate traditional institutions

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.544
and how we think
about currencies and money.

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:18.992
And that's not surprising,
if you think about

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.912
the basket case that is the E.U.

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:23.127
I think there was a Gallup
survey out recently

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:25.113
that said something like, in America,

00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:28.887
trust in banks is at an all-time
low, it's something like 21 percent.

00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:30.702
And you can see here
some photographs from London

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:32.917
where Barclays sponsored
the city bike scheme,

00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:34.524
and some activists have
done some nice piece

00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:37.472
of guerrilla marketing here
and doctored the slogans.

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:40.969
"Sub-prime pedaling." "Barclays
takes you for a ride."

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:44.672
These are the more polite ones
I could share with you today.

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:47.125
But you get the gist, so
people have really started

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.648
to sort of lose faith in institutions.

00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:51.696
There's a P.R. company called Edelman,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.959
they do this very interesting
survey every year

00:02:53.983 --> 00:02:57.154
precisely around trust
and what people are thinking.

00:02:57.178 --> 00:02:59.896
And this is a global survey,
so these numbers are global.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.159
And what's interesting
is that you can see that

00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:04.763
hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:06.549
and it's all about heterarchical now,

00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:09.113
so people trust people
like themselves more

00:03:09.137 --> 00:03:12.197
than they trust corporations
and governments.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.380
And if you look at these figures
for the more developed markets

00:03:14.404 --> 00:03:17.108
like U.K., Germany, and so on,
they're actually much lower.

00:03:17.132 --> 00:03:18.119
And I find that sort of scary.

00:03:18.143 --> 00:03:20.191
People are actually
trusting businesspeople

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:23.620
more than they're trusting
governments and leaders.

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:26.727
So what's starting to happen,
if you think about money,

00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:28.936
if you sort of boil money
down to an essence,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.998
it is literally just an expression
of value, an agreed value.

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:35.118
So what's happening now,
in the digital age,

00:03:35.142 --> 00:03:37.860
is that we can quantify value
in lots of different ways

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.477
and do it more easily,

00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:42.155
and sometimes the way
that we quantify those values,

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.678
it makes it much easier

00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:48.475
to create new forms and valid
forms of currency.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.531
In that context, you can see
that networks like Bitcoin

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:55.174
suddenly start to make a bit more sense.

00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:58.218
So if you think we're starting to question

00:03:58.242 --> 00:04:00.808
and disrupt and interrogate
what money means,

00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:03.915
what our relationship with it
is, what defines money,

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.993
then the ultimate extension of that is,

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:09.846
is there a reason
for the government to be in charge

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.302
of money anymore?

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:14.136
So obviously I'm looking at this
through a marketing prism,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.806
so from a brand perspective,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.482
brands literally stand or fall
on their reputations.

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:21.808
And if you think about it, reputation
has now become a currency.

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:23.919
You know, reputations are built on trust,

00:04:23.943 --> 00:04:26.469
consistency, transparency.

00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:29.017
So if you've actually decided
that you trust a brand,

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:31.851
you want a relationship, you
want to engage with the brand,

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:34.710
you're already kind of participating
in lots of new forms

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.249
of currency.

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:38.239
So you think about loyalty.

00:04:38.263 --> 00:04:40.302
Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy.

00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:43.537
You think about rewards
schemes, air miles.

00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:45.686
The Economist said a few years ago that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.876
there are actually more
unredeemed air miles in the world

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.776
than there are dollar
bills in circulation.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.324
You know, when you are standing
in line in Starbucks,

00:04:55.348 --> 00:04:58.034
30 percent of transactions
in Starbucks on any one day

00:04:58.058 --> 00:05:01.096
are actually being made
with Starbucks Star points.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.930
So that's a sort of Starbucks currency

00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:04.963
staying within its ecosystem.

00:05:04.987 --> 00:05:07.891
And what I find interesting is that Amazon

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:10.971
has recently launched Amazon coins.

00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:13.710
So admittedly it's a currency at the moment
that's purely for the Kindle.

00:05:13.734 --> 00:05:16.898
So you can buy apps and make
purchases within those apps,

00:05:16.922 --> 00:05:18.295
but you think about Amazon,

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.653
you look at the trust
barometer that I showed you

00:05:20.677 --> 00:05:23.591
where people are starting
to trust businesses,

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.092
especially businesses
that they believe in and trust

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:27.482
more than governments.

00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:28.984
So suddenly, you start thinking,

00:05:29.008 --> 00:05:30.822
well Amazon potentially could push this.

00:05:30.846 --> 00:05:32.512
It could become a natural extension,

00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:34.013
that as well as buying stuff --

00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:36.704
take it out of the Kindle --
you could buy books, music,

00:05:36.728 --> 00:05:41.277
real-life products, appliances
and goods and so on.

00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:43.705
And suddenly you're getting
Amazon, as a brand,

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.322
is going head to head
with the Federal Reserve

00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:47.489
in terms of how you want
to spend your money,

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.864
what money is, what constitutes money.

00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:53.460
And I'll get you back
to Tide, the detergent now,

00:05:53.484 --> 00:05:54.872
as I promised.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.205
This is a fantastic article I came
across in New York Magazine,

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.035
where it was saying that drug
users across America

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.211
are actually purchasing drugs

00:06:02.235 --> 00:06:04.862
with bottles of Tide detergent.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.950
So they're going into convenience stores,

00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:08.060
stealing Tide,

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:10.254
and a $20 bottle of Tide

00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:15.130
is equal to 10 dollars
of crack cocaine or weed.

00:06:15.154 --> 00:06:17.393
And what they're saying,
so some criminologists

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:19.798
have looked at this and they're
saying, well, okay,

00:06:19.822 --> 00:06:21.624
Tide as a product sells at a premium.

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:23.741
It's 50 percent
above the category average.

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:27.069
It's infused with a very
complex cocktail of chemicals,

00:06:27.093 --> 00:06:29.454
so it smells very luxurious
and very distinctive,

00:06:29.478 --> 00:06:31.402
and, being a Procter and Gamble brand,

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:35.002
it's been supported by a lot
of mass media advertising.

00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:37.871
So what they're saying is that drug
users are consumers too,

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.943
so they have this
in their neural pathways.

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.872
When they spot Tide, there's a shortcut.

00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:44.629
They say, that is trust. I trust that.
That's quality.

00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:47.248
So it becomes this unit of currency,

00:06:47.272 --> 00:06:49.034
which the New York Magazine described

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:52.531
as a very oddly loyal crime
wave, brand-loyal crime wave,

00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:55.884
and criminals are actually
calling Tide "liquid gold."

00:06:55.908 --> 00:06:58.099
Now, what I thought
was funny was the reaction

00:06:58.123 --> 00:06:59.443
from the P&amp;G spokesperson.

00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:02.467
They said, obviously tried
to dissociate themselves from drugs,

00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:04.873
but said, "It reminds me of one thing

00:07:04.897 --> 00:07:08.914
and that's the value of the brand
has stayed consistent." (Laughter)

00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:10.775
Which backs up my point
and shows he didn't even

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:12.612
break a sweat when he said that.

00:07:12.636 --> 00:07:15.306
So that brings me back
to the connection with sweat.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.645
In Mexico, Nike has run
a campaign recently

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.419
called, literally, Bid Your Sweat.

00:07:19.443 --> 00:07:20.808
So you think about,

00:07:20.832 --> 00:07:22.542
these Nike shoes have got sensors in them,

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:24.043
or you're using a Nike FuelBand

00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:26.724
that basically tracks
your movement, your energy,

00:07:26.748 --> 00:07:28.529
your calorie consumption.

00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:30.364
And what's happening here,
this is where you've actually

00:07:30.388 --> 00:07:33.394
elected to join that Nike community.
You've bought into it.

00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:35.514
They're not advertising
loud messages at you,

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.712
and that's where advertising
has started to shift now

00:07:37.736 --> 00:07:40.366
is into things like services,
tools and applications.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.311
So Nike is literally acting
as a well-being partner,

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:46.196
a health and fitness partner
and service provider.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.354
So what happens with this
is they're saying, "Right,

00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:50.950
you have a data dashboard.
We know how far you've run,

00:07:50.974 --> 00:07:53.719
how far you've moved, what your calorie
intake, all that sort of stuff.

00:07:53.743 --> 00:07:56.941
What you can do is, the more you
run, the more points you get,

00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:59.919
and we have an auction where
you can buy Nike stuff

00:07:59.943 --> 00:08:03.442
but only by proving that you've actually
used the product to do stuff."

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.562
And you can't come into this.
This is purely

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.285
for the community that are sweating

00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:09.920
using Nike products. You
can't buy stuff with pesos.

00:08:09.944 --> 00:08:14.918
This is literally a closed
environment, a closed auction space.

00:08:14.942 --> 00:08:18.319
In Africa, you know, airtime has become

00:08:18.343 --> 00:08:20.153
literally a currency in its own right.

00:08:20.177 --> 00:08:22.256
People are used to,
because mobile is king,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.101
they're very, very used
to transferring money,

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:27.079
making payments via mobile.

00:08:27.103 --> 00:08:29.770
And one of my favorite examples
from a brand perspective

00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:31.715
going on is Vodafone, where, in Egypt,

00:08:31.739 --> 00:08:34.424
lots of people make purchases in markets

00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:36.205
and very small independent stores.

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:38.631
Loose change, small
change is a real problem,

00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:41.179
and what tends to happen
is you buy a bunch of stuff,

00:08:41.203 --> 00:08:42.164
you're due, say,

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.307
10 cents, 20 cents in change.

00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:46.947
The shopkeepers tend to give
you things like an onion

00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:48.447
or an aspirin, or a piece of gum,

00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.175
because they don't have small change.

00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:52.342
So when Vodafone came
in and saw this problem,

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:53.793
this consumer pain point, they created

00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:55.867
some small change which they call Fakka,

00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:57.548
which literally sits and is given

00:08:57.572 --> 00:08:59.743
by the shopkeepers to people,

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:02.577
and it's credit that goes
straight onto their mobile phone.

00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:04.963
So this currency becomes
credit, which again,

00:09:04.987 --> 00:09:06.431
is really, really interesting.

00:09:06.455 --> 00:09:08.741
And we did a survey
that backs up the fact that,

00:09:08.765 --> 00:09:10.387
you know, 45 percent of people

00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.681
in this very crucial
demographic in the U.S.

00:09:13.705 --> 00:09:15.705
were saying that they're comfortable using

00:09:15.729 --> 00:09:18.218
an independent or branded currency.

00:09:18.242 --> 00:09:20.242
So that's getting really interesting here,

00:09:20.266 --> 00:09:22.132
a really interesting dynamic going on.

00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:23.657
And you think, corporations

00:09:23.681 --> 00:09:26.391
should start taking their assets
and thinking of them

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:28.926
in a different way and trading them.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.386
And you think, is it much of a leap?

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.425
It seems farfetched,
but when you think about it,

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:37.143
in America in 1860,

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:41.350
there were 1,600 corporations
issuing banknotes.

00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:44.650
There were 8,000 kinds
of notes in America.

00:09:44.674 --> 00:09:45.907
And the only thing that stopped that,

00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:48.515
the government controlled
four percent of the supply,

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:50.159
and the only thing that stopped it

00:09:50.183 --> 00:09:51.852
was the Civil War breaking out,

00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:54.924
and the government suddenly wanted
to take control of the money.

00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:58.566
So government, money, war,
nothing changes there, then.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.421
So what I'm going to ask is, basically,

00:10:01.445 --> 00:10:03.816
is history repeating itself?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.717
Is technology making paper
money feel outmoded?

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.860
Are we decoupling money
from the government?

00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:12.884
You know, you think about, brands
are starting to fill the gaps.

00:10:12.908 --> 00:10:16.115
Corporations are filling gaps
that governments can't afford to fill.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:18.876
So I think, you know,
will we be standing on stage

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.561
buying a coffee -- organic,
fair trade coffee -- next year

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:25.342
using TED florins or TED shillings?

00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:27.029
Thank you very much.

00:10:27.053 --> 00:10:29.229
(Applause)

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:34.300
Thank you. (Applause)
