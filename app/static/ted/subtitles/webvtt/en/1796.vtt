00:00:01.478 --> 00:00:03.351
Francesca Fedeli: Ciao.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.907
So he's Mario. He's our son.

00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.766
He was born two and a half years ago,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.979
and I had a pretty tough pregnancy

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:17.129
because I had to stay still
in a bed for, like, eight months.

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.188
But in the end everything
seemed to be under control.

00:00:20.212 --> 00:00:23.042
So he got the right weight at birth.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.189
He got the right Apgar index.

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:28.274
So we were pretty reassured by this.

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:35.126
But at the end, 10 days
later after he was born,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.673
we discovered that he had a stroke.

00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:39.543
As you might know,

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:42.109
a stroke is a brain injury.

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.819
A perinatal stroke could be something

00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:48.734
that can happen
during the nine months of pregnancy

00:00:48.758 --> 00:00:51.326
or just suddenly after the birth,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.223
and in his case, as you can see,

00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:58.415
the right part of his brain has gone.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:03.906
So the effect that this stroke
could have on Mario's body

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.150
could be the fact that he couldn't
be able to control

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:09.926
the left side of his body.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.751
Just imagine, if you have
a computer and a printer

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:17.940
and you want to transmit,
to input to print out a document,

00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:21.384
but the printer doesn't
have the right drives,

00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:24.168
so the same is for Mario.

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:27.188
It's just like,
he would like to move his left side

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:31.131
of his body, but he's not able
to transmit the right input

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:36.011
to move his left arm and left leg.

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:38.253
So life had to change.

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:40.292
We needed to change our schedule.

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:46.203
We needed to change the impact
that this birth had

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:48.914
on our life.

00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:50.916
Roberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.212
unfortunately, we were not ready.

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:57.267
Nobody taught us how to deal
with such kinds of disabilities,

00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.354
and as many questions as possible started

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:01.286
to come to our minds.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.315
And that has been really a tough time.

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:06.612
Questions, some basics, like, you know,

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:08.792
why did this happen to us?

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:10.787
And what went wrong?

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:13.290
Some more tough, like, really,

00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:14.997
what will be the impact on Mario's life?

00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:17.117
I mean, at the end,
will he be able to work?

00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:18.571
Will he be able to be normal?

00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:21.796
And, you know, as a parent,
especially for the first time,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.238
why is he not going to be better than us?

00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:28.516
And this, indeed, really is tough to say,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.304
but a few months later, we realized that

00:02:31.328 --> 00:02:34.564
we were really feeling like a failure.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:37.585
I mean, the only real product of our life,

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.425
at the end, was a failure.

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:45.351
And you know, it was not a failure
for ourselves in itself,

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:50.089
but it was a failure
that will impact his full life.

00:02:50.113 --> 00:02:51.863
Honestly, we went down.

00:02:51.887 --> 00:02:55.398
I mean we went really
down, but at the end,

00:02:55.422 --> 00:02:57.292
we started to look at him,

00:02:57.316 --> 00:02:59.541
and we said, we have to react.

00:02:59.565 --> 00:03:02.419
So immediately, as Francesca
said, we changed our life.

00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:05.876
We started physiotherapy,
we started the rehabilitation,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.948
and one of the paths
that we were following

00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:10.953
in terms of rehabilitation
is the mirror neurons pilot.

00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:14.744
Basically, we spent months
doing this with Mario.

00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:17.589
You have an object, and we showed him

00:03:17.613 --> 00:03:19.610
how to grab the object.

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:22.194
Now, the theory of mirror
neurons simply says

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:26.366
that in your brains, exactly
now, as you watch me doing this,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.876
you are activating
exactly the same neurons

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.113
as if you do the actions.

00:03:32.137 --> 00:03:36.109
It looks like this is the leading
edge in terms of rehabilitation.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:39.961
But one day we found that Mario

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:43.336
was not looking at our hand.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.910
He was looking at us.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.105
We were his mirror.

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.153
And the problem, as you might feel,

00:03:50.177 --> 00:03:52.598
is that we were down, we were depressed,

00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:54.970
we were looking at him as a problem,

00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:59.475
not as a son, not
from a positive perspective.

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.715
And that day really
changed our perspective.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.035
We realized that we had to become

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:08.602
a better mirror for Mario.

00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:10.690
We restarted from our strengths,

00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:14.393
and at the same time
we restarted from his strengths.

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:17.091
We stopped looking at him as a problem,

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:21.491
and we started to look at him
as an opportunity to improve.

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:24.049
And really, this was the change,

00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:27.208
and from our side, we said,

00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:30.355
"What are our strengths
that we really can bring to Mario?"

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:31.951
And we started from our passions.

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:33.785
I mean, at the end, my wife and myself

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:35.009
are quite different,

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:37.097
but we have many things in common.

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:39.319
We love to travel, we love music,

00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:41.160
we love to be in places like this,

00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:43.245
and we started to bring Mario with us

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:47.943
just to show to him the best
things that we can show to him.

00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:53.144
This short video is from last week.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.749
I am not saying --

00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:56.594
(Applause) —

00:04:56.618 --> 00:04:59.238
I am not saying it's a miracle.
That's not the message,

00:04:59.262 --> 00:05:01.787
because we are just
at the beginning of the path.

00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:05.409
But we want to share
what was the key learning,

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.691
the key learning that Mario drove to us,

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:10.035
and it is to consider
what you have as a gift

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:14.723
and not only what you miss,

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:18.916
and to consider what you
miss just as an opportunity.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.560
And this is the message
that we want to share with you.

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:25.296
This is why we are here.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.211
Mario!

00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:28.974
And this is why --

00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:33.576
(Applause) —

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.798
And this is why

00:05:38.822 --> 00:05:44.284
we decided to share the best
mirror in the world with him.

00:05:44.308 --> 00:05:47.218
And we thank you so much, all of you.

00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:49.341
FF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye.

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:53.178
(Applause)

00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:58.172
FF: Thank you. (Applause)
