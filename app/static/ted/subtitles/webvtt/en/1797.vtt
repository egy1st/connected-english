00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:04.757
I'm five years old, and I am very proud.

00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:08.316
My father has just built the best outhouse

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.906
in our little village in Ukraine.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.455
Inside, it's a smelly,
gaping hole in the ground,

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.461
but outside, it's pearly white formica

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:22.089
and it literally gleams in the sun.

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:25.646
This makes me feel so proud, so important,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.686
that I appoint myself the leader
of my little group of friends

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.466
and I devise missions for us.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.779
So we prowl from house to house

00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:37.146
looking for flies captured in spider webs

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.533
and we set them free.

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:41.841
Four years earlier, when I was one,

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:43.286
after the Chernobyl accident,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.617
the rain came down black,

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.817
and my sister's hair fell out in clumps,

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.374
and I spent nine months in the hospital.

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:51.926
There were no visitors allowed,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.938
so my mother bribed a hospital worker.

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:58.669
She acquired a nurse's uniform,

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:03.014
and she snuck in every night
to sit by my side.

00:01:03.038 --> 00:01:06.074
Five years later,
an unexpected silver lining.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:10.176
Thanks to Chernobyl,
we get asylum in the U.S.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.395
I am six years old, and I don't
cry when we leave home

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:15.446
and we come to America,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.194
because I expect it to be
a place filled with rare

00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:23.374
and wonderful things
like bananas and chocolate

00:01:23.398 --> 00:01:25.815
and Bazooka bubble gum,

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:29.908
Bazooka bubble gum
with the little cartoon wrappers inside,

00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:33.025
Bazooka that we'd get
once a year in Ukraine

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.061
and we'd have to chew
one piece for an entire week.

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:38.867
So the first day we get to New York,

00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.100
my grandmother and I find a penny

00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:44.843
in the floor of the homeless shelter
that my family's staying in.

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:46.378
Only, we don't know
that it's a homeless shelter.

00:01:46.402 --> 00:01:49.469
We think that it's a hotel,
a hotel with lots of rats.

00:01:49.493 --> 00:01:54.051
So we find this penny kind
of fossilized in the floor,

00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:57.047
and we think that a very wealthy
man must have left it there

00:01:57.071 --> 00:01:59.541
because regular people
don't just lose money.

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:02.098
And I hold this penny
in the palm of my hand,

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.760
and it's sticky and rusty,

00:02:04.784 --> 00:02:07.791
but it feels like I'm holding a fortune.

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:10.101
I decide that I'm going
to get my very own piece

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:11.916
of Bazooka bubble gum.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.901
And in that moment, I feel
like a millionaire.

00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:18.211
About a year later, I get
to feel that way again

00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:20.970
when we find a bag full
of stuffed animals in the trash,

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:22.701
and suddenly I have more toys

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.445
than I've ever had in my whole life.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.830
And again, I get that feeling
when we get a knock

00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:29.807
on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn,

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:32.116
and my sister and I find a deliveryman

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.669
with a box of pizza that we didn't order.

00:02:34.693 --> 00:02:37.858
So we take the pizza,
our very first pizza,

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:40.697
and we devour slice after slice

00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:44.086
as the deliveryman stands there
and stares at us from the doorway.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.086
And he tells us to pay,
but we don't speak English.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.514
My mother comes out,
and he asks her for money,

00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:50.872
but she doesn't have enough.

00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:54.224
She walks 50 blocks
to and from work every day

00:02:54.248 --> 00:02:56.893
just to avoid spending money on bus fare.

00:02:56.917 --> 00:02:58.759
Then our neighbor pops her head in,

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:01.349
and she turns red with rage
when she realizes

00:03:01.373 --> 00:03:03.695
that those immigrants from downstairs

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.704
have somehow gotten
their hands on her pizza.

00:03:07.728 --> 00:03:09.260
Everyone's upset.

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:13.101
But the pizza is delicious.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:19.062
It doesn't hit me until years
later just how little we had.

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:21.376
On our 10 year anniversary
of being in the U.S.,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.484
we decided to celebrate
by reserving a room

00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:26.366
at the hotel that we first stayed
in when we got to the U.S.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.785
The man at the front desk
laughs, and he says,

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.667
"You can't reserve a room here.
This is a homeless shelter."

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.804
And we were shocked.

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:37.810
My husband Brian was also
homeless as a kid.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.900
His family lost everything, and at age 11,

00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:43.653
he had to live in motels with his dad,

00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:46.586
motels
that would round up all of their food

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.266
and keep it hostage until they were
able to pay the bill.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.471
And one time, when he finally got his box

00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:56.067
of Frosted Flakes back, it
was crawling with roaches.

00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:57.983
But he did have one thing.

00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:00.627
He had this shoebox that he carried
with him everywhere

00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:03.090
containing nine comic books,

00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:06.236
two G.I. Joes painted
to look like Spider-Man

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.299
and five Gobots. And
this was his treasure.

00:04:09.323 --> 00:04:12.294
This was his own assembly of heroes

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:14.497
that kept him from drugs and gangs

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:17.293
and from giving up on his dreams.

00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:18.341
I'm going to tell you about one more

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:21.132
formerly homeless member of our family.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:22.831
This is Scarlett.

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:25.900
Once upon a time, Scarlet
was used as bait in dog fights.

00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:28.316
She was tied up and thrown into the ring

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.352
for other dogs to attack so they'd get
more aggressive before the fight.

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:36.592
And now, these days, she eats organic food

00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:39.283
and she sleeps on an orthopedic
bed with her name on it,

00:04:39.307 --> 00:04:43.535
but when we pour water
for her in her bowl,

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:47.524
she still looks up and she wags
her tail in gratitude.

00:04:47.548 --> 00:04:50.742
Sometimes Brian and I walk
through the park with Scarlett,

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:53.161
and she rolls through the grass,

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:55.562
and we just look at her

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:57.382
and then we look at each other

00:04:57.406 --> 00:05:01.389
and we feel gratitude.

00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:05.020
We forget about all of our new
middle-class frustrations

00:05:05.044 --> 00:05:06.895
and disappointments,

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.579
and we feel like millionaires.

00:05:09.603 --> 00:05:10.729
Thank you.

00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:14.746
(Applause)
