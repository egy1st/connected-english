00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:02.359
What do we know about the future?

00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:05.424
Difficult question,
simple answer: nothing.

00:00:05.448 --> 00:00:07.915
We cannot predict the future.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.554
We only can create a vision
of the future, how it might be,

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.887
a vision which reveals disruptive
ideas, which is inspiring,

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:18.173
and this is the most important reason

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:21.221
which breaks the chains
of common thinking.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:22.549
There are a lot of people

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:24.764
who created their own vision
about the future,

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:27.955
for instance, this vision here
from the early 20th century.

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:32.015
It says here that this
is the ocean plane of the future.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.628
It takes only one and a half days
to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:39.129
Today, we know that this future
vision didn't come true.

00:00:39.153 --> 00:00:42.061
So this is our largest
airplane which we have,

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.860
the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge,

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:46.408
so a lot of people fit in there

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:48.929
and it's technically completely different

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.140
than the vision I've shown to you.

00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:53.110
I'm working in a team with Airbus,

00:00:53.134 --> 00:00:54.689
and we have created our vision

00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:57.621
about a more sustainable
future of aviation.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:00.106
So sustainability is quite
important for us,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.880
which should incorporate social

00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:04.970
but as well as environmental
and economic values.

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:07.876
So we have created a very
disruptive structure

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.484
which mimics the design
of bone, or a skeleton,

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:13.209
which occurs in nature.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.519
So that's why it looks
maybe a little bit weird,

00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:19.287
especially to the people who deal
with structures in general.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.750
But at least it's just a kind of artwork

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:26.940
to explore our ideas
about a different future.

00:01:26.964 --> 00:01:29.092
What are the main customers of the future?

00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:30.974
So, we have the old, we have the young,

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:33.672
we have the uprising power of women,

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:37.675
and there's one mega-trend
which affects all of us.

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:40.100
These are the future anthropometrics.

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:43.592
So our children are getting
larger, but at the same time

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:46.094
we are growing into different directions.

00:01:46.118 --> 00:01:51.778
So what we need is space
inside the aircraft,

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:53.903
inside a very dense area.

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:55.641
These people have different needs.

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:59.199
So we see a clear need
of active health promotion,

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:01.871
especially in the case of the old people.

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:03.741
We want to be treated as individuals.

00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:09.234
We like to be productive
throughout the entire travel chain,

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:11.531
and what we are doing in the future is

00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:14.711
we want to use the latest
man-machine interface,

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:19.082
and we want to integrate this
and show this in one product.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:22.524
So we combined these needs
with technology's themes.

00:02:22.548 --> 00:02:25.052
So for instance, we are asking ourselves,

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:27.265
how can we create more light?

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.861
How can we bring more natural
light into the airplane?

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:33.235
So this airplane has no
windows anymore, for example.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.968
What about the data
and communication software

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:37.641
which we need in the future?

00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:40.542
My belief is that the airplane
of the future

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.675
will get its own consciousness.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.154
It will be more like a living organism

00:02:45.178 --> 00:02:49.576
than just a collection
of very complex technology.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.698
This will be very different in the future.

00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:53.267
It will communicate directly

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:56.147
with the passenger in its environment.

00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:58.314
And then we are talking
also about materials,

00:02:58.338 --> 00:03:00.234
synthetic biology, for example.

00:03:00.258 --> 00:03:03.949
And my belief is that we will get
more and more

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:07.651
new materials which we can
put into structure later on,

00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:11.797
because structure is one of the key
issues in aircraft design.

00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:15.069
So let's compare the old
world with the new world.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.617
I just want to show you here
what we are doing today.

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:21.316
So this is a bracket of an A380
crew rest compartment.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.013
It takes a lot of weight,

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:26.164
and it follows the classical design rules.

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:29.815
This here is an equal bracket
for the same purpose.

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.964
It follows the design of bone.

00:03:31.988 --> 00:03:34.484
The design process
is completely different.

00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:37.205
At the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos,

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.148
and at the other hand 0.6 kilos.

00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:42.415
So this technology, 3D
printing, and new design rules

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.154
really help us to reduce the weight,

00:03:44.178 --> 00:03:46.602
which is the biggest issue
in aircraft design,

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:49.341
because it's directly linked
to greenhouse gas emissions.

00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:51.161
Push this idea a little bit forward.

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:56.052
So how does nature build its
components and structures?

00:03:56.076 --> 00:03:59.093
So nature is very clever.
It puts all the information

00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:02.290
into these small building
blocks, which we call DNA.

00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:04.866
And nature builds large
skeletons out of it.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.360
So we see a bottom-up approach here,

00:04:07.384 --> 00:04:10.525
because all the information,
as I said, are inside the DNA.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.740
And this is combined
with a top-down approach,

00:04:12.764 --> 00:04:14.837
because what we are doing
in our daily life

00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:17.942
is we train our muscles,
we train our skeleton,

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.942
and it's getting stronger.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.777
And the same approach can be
applied to technology as well.

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:26.163
So our building block is carbon
nanotubes, for example,

00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:30.429
to create a large, rivet-less
skeleton at the end of the day.

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:33.483
How this looks in particular,
you can show it here.

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:35.617
So imagine you have
carbon nanotubes growing

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.054
inside a 3D printer,

00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:40.253
and they are embedded
inside a matrix of plastic,

00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:43.346
and follow the forces
which occur in your component.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.089
And you've got trillions of them.

00:04:45.113 --> 00:04:47.282
So you really align them to wood,

00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:50.451
and you take this wood and make
morphological optimization,

00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:52.410
so you make structures, sub-structures,

00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:56.443
which allows you to transmit
electrical energy or data.

00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:58.515
And now we take this
material, combine this

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.958
with a top-down approach,

00:04:59.982 --> 00:05:03.510
and build bigger and bigger components.

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:06.555
So how might the airplane
of the future look?

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:08.676
So we have very different
seats which adapt

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.462
to the shape of the future passenger,

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:12.173
with the different anthropometrics.

00:05:12.197 --> 00:05:14.719
We have social areas inside the aircraft

00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:17.479
which might turn into a place

00:05:17.503 --> 00:05:19.679
where you can play virtual golf.

00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:22.142
And finally, this bionic structure,

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.303
which is covered by a transparent

00:05:24.327 --> 00:05:28.167
biopolymer membrane,
will really change radically

00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:30.560
how we look at aircrafts in the future.

00:05:30.584 --> 00:05:32.584
So as Jason Silva said,

00:05:32.608 --> 00:05:35.107
if we can imagine it, why not make it so?

00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:36.842
See you in the future. Thank you.

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:41.128
(Applause)
