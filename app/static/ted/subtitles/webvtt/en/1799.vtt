WEBVTT

00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:03.349
This is an ambucycle.

00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:08.388
This is the fastest way
to reach any medical emergency.

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.890
It has everything an ambulance
has except for a bed.

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:16.646
You see the defibrillator.
You see the equipment.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.812
We all saw the tragedy
that happened in Boston.

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:21.892
When I was looking at these pictures,

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:24.882
it brought me back many years to my past

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:26.452
when I was a child.

00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:29.530
I grew up in a small
neighborhood in Jerusalem.

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:33.621
When I was six years old,
I was walking back from school

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:37.356
on a Friday afternoon
with my older brother.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.608
We were passing by a bus stop.

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:43.651
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:48.696
The bus was on fire, and many people
were hurt and killed.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.628
I remembered an old man

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:54.096
yelling to us and crying
to help us get him up.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.559
He just needed someone helping him.

00:00:56.583 --> 00:01:00.093
We were so scared and we just ran away.

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:03.883
Growing up, I decided I wanted
to become a doctor and save lives.

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:06.884
Maybe that was because of what I saw
when I was a child.

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:10.176
When I was 15, I took an EMT course,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.236
and I went to volunteer on an ambulance.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.653
For two years, I volunteered
on an ambulance in Jerusalem.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.505
I helped many people,

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:21.420
but whenever someone really needed help,

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:23.762
I never got there in time.
We never got there.

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:26.271
The traffic is so bad. The
distance, and everything.

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:29.096
We never got there when
somebody really needed us.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.787
One day, we received a call
about a seven-year-old child

00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:33.370
choking from a hot dog.

00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:35.537
Traffic was horrific,
and we were coming from

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:39.148
the other side of town
in the north part of Jerusalem.

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:41.434
When we got there, 20 minutes later,

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:43.952
we started CPR on the kid.

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:47.436
A doctor comes in from a block away,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.632
stop us, checks the kid,
and tells us to stop CPR.

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:56.389
That second he declared this child dead.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:59.386
At that moment, I understood

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.257
that this child died for nothing.

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.812
If this doctor, who lived
one block away from there,

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:07.503
would have come 20 minutes earlier,

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:10.529
not have to wait
until that siren he heard before

00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:11.815
coming from the ambulance,

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.749
if he would have heard
about it way before,

00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:16.482
he would have saved this child.

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.613
He could have run from a block away.

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:20.300
He could have saved this child.

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.985
I said to myself, there
must be a better way.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.934
Together with 15 of my friends --

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.705
we were all EMTs —

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.777
we decided, let's protect
our neighborhood,

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.801
so when something like that happens again,

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:34.215
we will be there running to the scene
a lot before the ambulance.

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.188
So I went over to the manager
of the ambulance company

00:02:37.212 --> 00:02:39.546
and I told him, "Please,
whenever you have a call

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.207
coming into our neighborhood,

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:43.112
we have 15 great guys who are willing

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:45.803
to stop everything they're
doing and run and save lives.

00:02:45.827 --> 00:02:47.231
Just alert us by beeper.

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:49.572
We'll buy these beepers,
just tell your dispatch

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:53.483
to send us the beeper,
and we will run and save lives."

00:02:53.507 --> 00:03:00.460
Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old.
I was a kid.

00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:03.846
And he said to me — I remember
this like yesterday —

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.203
he was a great guy, but he said to me,

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:10.639
"Kid, go to school, or go
open a falafel stand.

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:14.640
We're not really interested
in these kinds of new adventures.

00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:18.255
We're not interested in your help."
And he threw me out of the room.

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.914
"I don't need your help," he said.

00:03:20.938 --> 00:03:24.493
I was a very stubborn kid.

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:27.911
As you see now, I'm walking
around like crazy, meshugenah.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:32.883
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:36.936
So I decided to use the Israeli
very famous technique

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.591
you've probably all heard of, chutzpah.
(Laughter)

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:45.275
And the next day, I went
and I bought two police scanners,

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.889
and I said, "The hell
with you, if you don't want

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:49.840
to give me information, I'll get
the information myself."

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:53.105
And we did turns, who's going
to listen to the radio scanners.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.874
The next day, while I was listening
to the scanners,

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:59.190
I heard about a call coming
in of a 70-year-old man

00:03:59.214 --> 00:04:02.800
hurt by a car only one block away from me

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:05.491
on the main street of my neighborhood.

00:04:05.515 --> 00:04:08.194
I ran there by foot. I had
no medical equipment.

00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:11.144
When I got there, the 70-year-old man

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:14.058
was lying on the floor, blood
was gushing out of his neck.

00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:15.271
He was on Coumadin.

00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:20.265
I knew I had to stop his bleeding
or else he would die.

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.208
I took off my yarmulke,
because I had no medical equipment,

00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:25.661
and with a lot of pressure,
I stopped his bleeding.

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:27.176
He was bleeding from his neck.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.633
When the ambulance arrived
15 minutes later,

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:33.220
I gave them over a patient who was alive.

00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:41.200
(Applause)

00:04:41.224 --> 00:04:43.362
When I went to visit him two days later,

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:45.697
he gave me a hug and was crying

00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:48.719
and thanking me for saving his life.

00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:51.740
At that moment, when I realized
this is the first person

00:04:51.764 --> 00:04:55.050
I ever saved in my life after two years
volunteering in an ambulance,

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:57.742
I knew this is my life's mission.

00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:01.907
So today, 22 years later,
we have United Hatzalah.

00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:08.297
(Applause)

00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:11.369
"Hatzalah" means "rescue,"
for all of you who don't know Hebrew.

00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:13.321
I forgot I'm not in Israel.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:16.256
So we have thousands of volunteers

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.175
who are passionate about saving lives,

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.009
and they're spread all around,
so whenever a call comes in,

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:26.405
they just stop everything
and go and run and save a life.

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:28.962
Our average response time today

00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:32.676
went down to less
than three minutes in Israel.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.322
(Applause)

00:05:36.346 --> 00:05:37.870
I'm talking about heart attacks,

00:05:37.894 --> 00:05:39.502
I'm talking about car accidents,

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:42.376
God forbid bomb attacks,
shootings, whatever it is,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.315
even a woman 3 o'clock in the morning

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.720
falling in her home and needs
someone to help her.

00:05:46.744 --> 00:05:49.084
Three minutes, we'll have
a guy with his pajamas

00:05:49.108 --> 00:05:52.733
running to her house
and helping her get up.

00:05:52.757 --> 00:05:55.805
The reasons why we're so successful
are because of three things.

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:57.627
Thousands of passionate volunteers

00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:59.347
who will leave everything they do

00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:02.258
and run to help people
they don't even know.

00:06:02.282 --> 00:06:04.601
We're not there to replace ambulances.

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:06.205
We're just there

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.255
to get the gap between the ambulance
call until they arrive.

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:17.142
And we save people that otherwise
would not be saved.

00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:20.501
The second reason
is because of our technology.

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:22.525
You know, Israelis are good in technology.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.758
Every one of us has on his phone,
no matter what kind of phone,

00:06:25.782 --> 00:06:28.834
a GPS technology done by NowForce,

00:06:28.858 --> 00:06:30.281
and whenever a call comes in,

00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:32.456
the closest five volunteers get the call,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.354
and they actually get there really quick,

00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:39.078
and navigated by a traffic navigator
to get there and not waste time.

00:06:39.102 --> 00:06:41.277
And this is a great technology
we use all over the country

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:42.867
and reduce the response time.

00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.003
And the third thing are these ambucycles.

00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:48.312
These ambucycles
are an ambulance on two wheels.

00:06:48.336 --> 00:06:50.622
We don't transfer people,
but we stabilize them,

00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:51.863
and we save their lives.

00:06:51.887 --> 00:06:55.030
They never get stuck in traffic.
They could even go on a sidewalk.

00:06:55.054 --> 00:06:57.395
They never, literally,
get stuck in traffic.

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.200
That's why we get there so fast.

00:06:59.224 --> 00:07:01.682
A few years after I started
this organization,

00:07:01.706 --> 00:07:03.427
in a Jewish community,

00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:06.230
two Muslims from east
Jerusalem called me up.

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:08.928
They ask me to meet. They
wanted to meet with me.

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:11.419
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.

00:07:11.443 --> 00:07:13.396
When Muhammad told me his personal story,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.251
how his father, 55 years
old, collapsed at home,

00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:17.507
had a cardiac arrest,

00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:19.927
and it took over an hour
for an ambulance arrive,

00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:22.190
and he saw his father die
in front of his eyes,

00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:24.985
he asked me, "Please start
this in east Jerusalem."

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.810
I said to myself, I saw so
much tragedy, so much hate,

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:32.094
and it's not about saving Jews.
It's not about saving Muslims.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.666
It's not about saving Christians.
It's about saving people.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.079
So I went ahead, full force --

00:07:38.103 --> 00:07:42.670
(Applause) —

00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:46.337
and I started United
Hatzalah in east Jerusalem,

00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:48.156
and that's why the names United

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.236
and Hatzalah match so well.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.088
We started hand in hand
saving Jews and Arabs.

00:07:54.112 --> 00:07:56.351
Arabs were saving Jews.
Jews were saving Arabs.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.352
Something special happened.

00:07:58.376 --> 00:08:01.017
Arabs and Jews, they don't
always get along together,

00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:02.327
but here in this situation,

00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:04.120
the communities, literally,

00:08:04.144 --> 00:08:06.287
it's an unbelievable
situation that happened,

00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:08.881
the diversities, all of a sudden
they had a common interest:

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.323
Let's save lives together.

00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:13.109
Settlers were saving Arabs
and Arabs were saving settlers.

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:15.229
It's an unbelievable
concept that could work

00:08:15.253 --> 00:08:17.984
only when you have such a great cause.

00:08:18.008 --> 00:08:19.857
And these are all volunteers.

00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:20.976
No one is getting money.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.852
They're all doing it
for the purpose of saving lives.

00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:27.137
When my own father
collapsed a few years ago

00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:29.542
from a cardiac arrest,
one of the first volunteers

00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:31.307
to arrive to save my father

00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.903
was one of these Muslim
volunteers from east Jerusalem

00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:37.448
who was in the first
course to join Hatzalah.

00:08:37.472 --> 00:08:38.525
And he saved my father.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:43.032
Could you imagine
how I felt in that moment?

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:46.141
When I started this organization,
I was 17 years old.

00:08:46.165 --> 00:08:49.551
I never imagined that one day
I'd be speaking at TEDMED.

00:08:49.575 --> 00:08:51.433
I never even knew what TEDMED was then.

00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:54.577
I don't think it existed,
but I never imagined,

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:56.982
I never imagined that it's going
to go all around,

00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:58.064
it's going to spread around,

00:08:58.088 --> 00:09:01.132
and this last year we started
in Panama and Brazil.

00:09:01.156 --> 00:09:04.514
All I need is a partner
who is a little meshugenah like me,

00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:07.904
passionate about saving
lives, and willing to do it.

00:09:07.928 --> 00:09:11.413
And I'm actually starting
it in India very soon

00:09:11.437 --> 00:09:15.066
with a friend who I met
in Harvard just a while back.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.934
Hatzalah actually started
in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.212
years before us in Williamsburg,

00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:23.935
and now it's all over the Jewish
community in New York,

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:27.195
even Australia and Mexico
and many other Jewish communities.

00:09:27.219 --> 00:09:28.789
But it could spread everywhere.

00:09:28.813 --> 00:09:31.345
It's very easy to adopt.

00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:33.621
You even saw these volunteers in New York

00:09:33.645 --> 00:09:36.737
saving lives in the World Trade Center.

00:09:36.761 --> 00:09:40.282
Last year alone, we treated
in Israel 207,000 people.

00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:45.005
Forty-two thousand of them were
life-threatening situations.

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:47.182
And we made a difference.

00:09:47.206 --> 00:09:49.930
I guess you could call this
a lifesaving flash mob,

00:09:49.954 --> 00:09:52.353
and it works.

00:09:52.377 --> 00:09:54.800
When I look all around here,

00:09:54.824 --> 00:09:58.191
I see lots of people
who would go an extra mile,

00:09:58.215 --> 00:10:00.912
run an extra mile to save other people,

00:10:00.936 --> 00:10:03.649
no matter who they are,
no matter what religion,

00:10:03.673 --> 00:10:06.565
no matter who, where they come from.

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:08.350
We all want to be heroes.

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:11.736
We just need a good idea, motivation

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.571
and lots of chutzpah,

00:10:13.595 --> 00:10:15.736
and we could save millions of people

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.908
that otherwise would not be saved.

00:10:17.932 --> 00:10:19.593
Thank you very much.

00:10:19.617 --> 00:10:24.587
