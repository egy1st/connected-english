00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It is a thrill to be here at a conference

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that's devoted to "Inspired by Nature" -- you can imagine.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Did you notice this section is foreplay?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and my partner and I have a rowing shell.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
They paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that they literally lift up out of the water,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and started to run along the water next to us,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in a courtship dance -- for miles.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now that is foreplay.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
(Laughter)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I came this close to changing species at that moment.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Obviously, life can teach us something

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But what I'd like to talk about today

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
is what life might teach us in technology and in design.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What's happened since the book came out --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the book was mainly about research in biomimicry --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers --

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
people who make our world -- have started to call and say,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
we want a biologist to sit at the design table

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to help us, in real time, become inspired.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology:

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
using an organism to do your wastewater treatment

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is an old, old technology called "domestication."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And so they still weren't getting it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So we went for a walk on the beach and I said,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
well, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And they said, you know what happens is, mineral --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
just like at your house -- mineral builds up.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
or we have to dig them up.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So if we had some way to stop this scaling --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
what is scaling? What's inside your pipes?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And they said, calcium carbonate.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And they didn't know that.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
They didn't know that what a seashell is,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
crystallize in place to create a shell.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So the same sort of a process, without the proteins,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Why don't they just keep on going?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And I said, well, in the same way

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and then they all sort of leaned in --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And, in fact, there is a product called TPA

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that's mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
That changed everything. From then on,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
you could not get these engineers back in the boat.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The first day they would take a hike,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We're done. You know, I've seen that island.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
After this,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
they were crawling all over. They would snorkel

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
for as long as we would let them snorkel.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
out there that had already solved the problems

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that they had spent their careers trying to solve.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Learning about the natural world is one thing;

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
learning from the natural world -- that's the switch.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
That's the profound switch.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
3.8 billion years of field-testing.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you;

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And the context is the Earth --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It's not slavishly mimicking --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
although Al is trying to get the hairdo going --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
it's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
the genius of the natural world, and learning something from it.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
is that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
are really not very high tech in my estimation

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in the water in Silicon Valley.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So the hardware

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
What's the syllabus?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Three questions, for me, are key.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
How does life make things?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
This is the opposite; this is how we make things.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's called heat, beat and treat --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that's what material scientists call it.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures;

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
How does life make the most of things?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
That's a geranium pollen.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Life adds information to matter.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
In other words: structure.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It gives it information. By adding information to matter,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
it gives it a function that's different than without that structure.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Because life doesn't really deal in things;

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
there are no things in the natural world divorced

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
from their systems.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Really quick syllabus.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
As I'm reading more and more now, and following the story,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and finding what their sort of grand challenges are.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
The two groups are not talking to each other.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
At all.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
One that's exciting to me is self-assembly.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Now, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
it happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
This is Sandia National Labs.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
A guy named Jeff Brinker

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
by simply dipping something into a liquid,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
lifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
force the molecules in the liquid together,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
so that they jigsaw together

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
in the same way as this crystallization works.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Imagine making all of our hard materials that way.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
onto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Here's an interesting one for the IT world:

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
bio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And so silicon, which we make right now --

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips --

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
this is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
This is from Ernst Haeckel's work.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Imagine being able to -- and, again, it's a templated process,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
sort of structure coming out at room temperature.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Imagine being able to make perfect lenses.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that the people at Lucent Technologies have found

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
have no distortion whatsoever.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And there's many of them, all over its entire body.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that work better than ours, actually, to move light,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Here's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way --

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
he's found a catalyst -- and he's found a way to take CO2

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
out of CO2 -- how plant-like.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Solar transformations: the most exciting one.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and in a reversible fuel cell.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum;

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
life does it with a very, very common iron.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And a team has now just been able to mimic

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
That's very exciting for fuel cells --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
to be able to do that without platinum.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
have tubercles on them. And those little bumps

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
actually increase efficiency in, for instance,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Color without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers;

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
to self-assemble products with the last few layers

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
playing with light to create color.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
See that up-close picture?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Water is going to be our big, grand challenge:

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
quenching thirst.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Here are two organisms that pull water.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
does not drink fresh water.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
before it gets into a building, are key technologies.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Separation technologies are going to be extremely important.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
small amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do;

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
they chelate metals out of water.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
to mine waste streams.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Green chemistry is chemistry in water.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
We do chemistry in organic solvents.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
It's not easy, because life uses

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
only a subset of the elements in the periodic table.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And we use all of them, even the toxic ones.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
of the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
is the task of green chemistry.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Timed degradation: packaging that is good

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
they begin to dissolve.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Healing: this is a good one.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
That little guy over there is a tardigrade.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
There is a problem with vaccines around the world

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
not getting to patients. And the reason is

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
that the refrigeration somehow gets broken;

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
what's called the "cold chain" gets broken.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade --

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And he found a way to dry out vaccines --

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
as the tardigrade has within its cells --

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
They can be put in a glove compartment, OK.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Learning from organisms. This is a session about water --

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
learning about organisms that can do without water,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I'm not going to get to 12.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
besides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
while taking care of the place

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
that's going to take care of their offspring.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
When they're involved in foreplay,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
they're thinking about something very, very important --

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
and that's having their genetic material

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
remain, 10,000 generations from now.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And that means finding a way to do what they do

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
That's the biggest design challenge.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
willing to gift us with their best ideas.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Good luck having a conversation with them.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Thank you.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:07.000
(Applause)

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I -- we need to get to 12, but really quickly.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Janine Benyus: Oh really?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
CA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
without seeing 10, 11 and 12.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
JB: OK, put this -- OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
OK, so that's the healing one.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
This is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
and yet they don't collide with one another.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
(Laughter)

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Right. There's a person at Newcastle

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
who has figured out that it's a very large neuron.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And she's actually figuring out how to make

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
a collision-avoidance circuitry

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
based on this very large neuron in the locust.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
This is a huge and important one, number 11.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And that's the growing fertility.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
That means, you know, net fertility farming.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
We should be growing fertility. And, oh yes -- we get food, too.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
to create more and more opportunities for life.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And really, that's what other organisms do as well.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do:

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
they create more and more opportunities for life.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Our farming has done the opposite.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
So, farming based on how a prairie builds soil,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
ranching based on how a native ungulate herd

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
actually increases the health of the range,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
not only cleans the water,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
but creates incredibly sparkling productivity.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
how to enhance or sweeten their places,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
are not around to tell us about it.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
That's the twelfth one.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Life -- and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick --

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
life creates conditions conducive to life.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water;

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
We have to find a way to meet our needs,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
while making of this place an Eden.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
CA: Janine, thank you so much.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
(Applause)
