00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:07.828
(Music)

00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:11.798
["Oedipus Rex"]

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:18.605
["The Lion King"]

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:26.917
["Titus"]

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:43.580
["Frida"]

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:58.225
["The Magic Flute"]

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:06.358
["Across The Universe"]

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.238
(Applause)

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:22.445
Julie Taymor: Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.162
That's a few samples of the theater, opera

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:28.504
and films that I have done
over the last 20 years.

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:30.542
But what I'd like to begin with right now

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.445
is to take you back to a moment

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.910
that I went through in Indonesia,

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:37.047
which is a seminal moment in my life

00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:39.127
and, like all myths,

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:41.382
these stories need to be retold

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:43.881
and told, lest we forget them.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.905
And when I'm in the turbulent
times, as we know,

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.293
that I am right now, through the crucible

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.484
and the fire of transformation,

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:54.102
which is what all of you do, actually.

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:57.226
Anybody who creates knows
there's that point where

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.335
it hasn't quite become
the phoenix or the burnt char.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.433
(Laughter)

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.338
And I am right there on the edge,

00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:09.315
which I'll tell you about, another story.

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:10.768
I want to go back to Indonesia

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:14.452
where I was about 21, 22
years, a long time ago,

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:15.676
on a fellowship.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.606
And I found myself, after two years there

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.955
and performing and learning,
on the island of Bali,

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.782
on the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:28.799
And I was in a village where there was

00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:31.591
an initiation ceremony for the young men,

00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:33.155
a rite of passage.

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.707
Little did I know that it
was mine as well.

00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.166
And as I sat in this temple square

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.166
under this gigantic beringin banyan tree,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.003
in the dark, there was no
electricity, just the full moon,

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:48.059
down in this empty square,

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:50.209
and I heard the most beautiful sounds,

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:52.040
like a Charles Ives concert

00:02:52.064 --> 00:02:54.083
as I listened to the gamelan music

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.132
from all the different villagers that came

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:59.530
for this once-every-five-years ceremony.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:03.125
And I thought I was alone
in the dark under this tree.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.956
And all of a sudden, out of the dark,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.840
from the other end of the square,

00:03:07.864 --> 00:03:11.748
I saw the glint of mirrors
lit by the moon.

00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:15.307
And these 20 old men who I'd seen before

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:20.609
all of a sudden stood up in these
full warrior costumes

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.094
with the headdress and the spears,

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:27.456
and no one was in the square,
and I was hidden in the shadows.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.817
No one was there, and they came out,

00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:33.456
and they did this incredible dance.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.148
"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha."

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:40.321
And they moved their bodies
and they came forward,

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.123
and the lights bounced off these costumes.

00:03:43.147 --> 00:03:46.539
And I've been in theater
since I was 11 years old,

00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:49.753
and performing, creating, and I went,

00:03:49.777 --> 00:03:51.896
"Who are they performing for

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.243
with these elaborate costumes,

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.270
these extraordinary headdresses?"

00:03:56.294 --> 00:04:01.057
And I realized that they were
performing for God,

00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:03.768
whatever that means.

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:07.356
But somehow, it didn't
matter about the publicity.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.607
There was no money involved.

00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:12.827
It wasn't going to be written down.
It was no news.

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:14.973
And there were these incredible artists

00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:18.474
that felt for me like an eternity
as they performed.

00:04:18.498 --> 00:04:20.559
The next moment,

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:24.619
as soon as they finished
and disappeared into the shadows,

00:04:24.643 --> 00:04:27.125
a young man with a propane
lantern came on,

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:29.376
hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.837
The village square was filled
with hundreds of people.

00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:35.375
And they put on an opera all night long.

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:37.635
Human beings needed the light.

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.272
They needed the light to see.

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:43.920
So what I gained and gathered
from this incredible,

00:04:43.944 --> 00:04:46.532
seminal moment in my life
as a young artist

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:49.855
was that you must be true

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.927
to what you believe as an artist
all the way through,

00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:57.466
but you also have to be aware

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.955
that the audience is out there
in our lives at this time,

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.360
and they also need the light.

00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:04.523
And it's this incredible balance

00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:06.272
that I think that we walk

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:09.605
when we are creating something
that is breaking ground,

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.259
that's trying to do something
you've never seen before,

00:05:12.283 --> 00:05:13.945
that imaginary world

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.322
where you actually don't know
where you're going to end up,

00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:20.088
that's the fine line
on the edge of a crater

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:22.718
that I have walked my whole life.

00:05:22.742 --> 00:05:25.266
What I would like to do now is to tell you

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.072
a little bit

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:29.929
about how I work.
Let's take "The Lion King."

00:05:29.953 --> 00:05:32.181
You saw many examples of my work up there,

00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:34.126
but it's one that people know.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.825
I start with the notion of the ideograph.

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.200
An ideograph is like a brush
painting, a Japanese brush painting.

00:05:40.224 --> 00:05:43.709
Three strokes, you get
the whole bamboo forest.

00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:46.240
I go to the concept of "The Lion King"

00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:48.308
and I say, "What is the essence of it?

00:05:48.332 --> 00:05:49.944
What is the abstraction?

00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:53.205
If I were to reduce this entire story

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.946
into one image, what would it be?"

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.900
The circle. The circle. It's so obvious.

00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:02.877
The circle of life. The
circle of Mufasa's mask.

00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:07.417
The circle that, when we come
to Act II and there's a drought,

00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:08.896
how do you express drought?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.055
It's a circle of silk on the floor

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:16.109
that disappears into the hole
in the stage floor.

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:18.738
The circle of life comes in the wheels

00:06:18.762 --> 00:06:21.186
of the gazelles that leap.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.908
And you see the mechanics.

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:26.286
And being a theater person, what I know
and love about the theater

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.981
is that when the audience comes in

00:06:28.005 --> 00:06:29.775
and they suspend their disbelief,

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:32.610
when you see men walking or women walking

00:06:32.634 --> 00:06:34.507
with a platter of grass on their heads,

00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:36.123
you know it's the savanna.

00:06:36.147 --> 00:06:37.667
You don't question that.

00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:40.151
I love the apparent truth of theater.

00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:43.748
I love that people are willing
to fill in the blanks.

00:06:43.772 --> 00:06:45.768
The audience is willing to say,

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:48.768
"Oh, I know that's not a real sun.

00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:51.076
You took pieces of sticks.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.171
You added silk to the bottom.

00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:56.875
You suspended these pieces. You
let it fall flat on the floor.

00:06:56.899 --> 00:07:01.278
And as it rises with the strings,
I see that it's a sun.

00:07:01.302 --> 00:07:05.685
But the beauty of it
is that it's just silk and sticks.

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:10.237
And in a way, that is what makes
it spiritual.

00:07:10.261 --> 00:07:11.682
That's what moves you.

00:07:11.706 --> 00:07:15.898
It's not the actual literal
sunrise that's coming.

00:07:15.922 --> 00:07:17.429
It's the art of it.

00:07:17.453 --> 00:07:22.789
So in the theater, as much
as the story is critical

00:07:22.813 --> 00:07:24.694
and the book and the language,

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:29.345
the telling of the story, how it's told,

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:32.963
the mechanics, the methods that you use,

00:07:32.987 --> 00:07:35.562
is equal to the story itself.

00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:38.900
And I'm one who loves
high tech and low tech.

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:40.699
So I could go from --

00:07:40.723 --> 00:07:43.200
For instance, I'll show you
some "Spider-Man" later,

00:07:43.224 --> 00:07:45.776
these incredible machines
that move people along.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.142
But the fact is, without the dancer

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.895
who knows how to use his body
and swing on those wires,

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:52.682
it's nothing.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:55.591
So now I'm going to show you

00:07:55.615 --> 00:07:59.909
some clips from the other big
project of my life this year,

00:07:59.933 --> 00:08:00.951
"The Tempest."

00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:05.044
It's a movie. I did "The
Tempest" on a stage three times

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:08.281
in the theater since 1984, '86,

00:08:08.305 --> 00:08:10.485
and I love the play.

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:13.011
I did it always with a male Prospero.

00:08:13.035 --> 00:08:14.673
And all of a sudden, I thought,

00:08:14.697 --> 00:08:16.759
"Well, who am I gonna
get to play Prospero?

00:08:16.783 --> 00:08:20.481
Why not Helen Mirren?
She's a great actor. Why not?"

00:08:20.505 --> 00:08:23.741
And this material really did work
for a woman equally as well.

00:08:23.765 --> 00:08:26.836
So now, let's take a look
at some of the images

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.829
from "The Tempest."

00:08:28.853 --> 00:08:33.836
(Music)

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.459
(Video) Prospera: Hast thou, spirit, performed
to the point the tempest that I bade thee?

00:08:49.483 --> 00:08:54.991
Ariel: I boarded the king's ship.
In every cabin, I flamed amazement.

00:08:57.664 --> 00:09:00.596
Prospera: At first sight,
they have changed eyes.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.791
Miranda: Do you love me?

00:09:01.815 --> 00:09:03.167
Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.

00:09:03.191 --> 00:09:05.759
HM: They are both in either's powers.

00:09:05.783 --> 00:09:10.890
Trinculo: Misery acquaints
a man with strange bedfellows.

00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:14.132
(Music)

00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:17.609
Looking for business, governor?

00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:19.681
Caliban: Hast thou not
dropped from heaven?

00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:22.166
Stephano: Out of the moon,
I do assure thee.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.163
Prospera: Caliban!

00:09:24.187 --> 00:09:26.428
Caliban: This island is mine.

00:09:26.452 --> 00:09:29.973
Prospera: For this, be sure,
tonight thou shalt have cramps.

00:09:29.997 --> 00:09:33.482
Antonio: Here lies your brother no
better than the earth he lies upon.

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.281
Sebastian: Draw thy sword.

00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:38.890
And I, the king, shall love thee.

00:09:38.914 --> 00:09:44.300
Prospera: I will plague
them all, even to roaring.

00:09:46.133 --> 00:09:50.706
Ariel: I have made you mad.

00:09:56.874 --> 00:09:59.895
Prospera: We are such stuff
as dreams are made on.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:04.106
and our little life
is rounded with a sleep.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:09.431
(Music)

00:10:09.455 --> 00:10:12.281
JT: Okay.

00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:16.255
(Applause)

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:18.683
So I went from theater,
doing "The Tempest"

00:10:18.707 --> 00:10:21.007
on the stage in a very
low-budget production

00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:22.645
many years ago,

00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:25.090
and I love the play, and I also think

00:10:25.114 --> 00:10:27.114
it's Shakespeare's last play,

00:10:27.138 --> 00:10:30.794
and it really lends itself,
as you can see, to cinema.

00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:33.342
But I'm just going to give
you a little example about

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.247
how one stages it in theater

00:10:35.271 --> 00:10:39.308
and then how one takes
that same idea or story

00:10:39.332 --> 00:10:42.300
and moves it into cinema.

00:10:42.324 --> 00:10:45.396
The ideograph that I talked
to you about before,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.507
what is it for "The Tempest"?

00:10:47.531 --> 00:10:50.333
What, if I were to boil it down,

00:10:50.357 --> 00:10:52.646
would be the one image that I could

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.893
hang my hat on for this?

00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:57.181
And it was the sand castle,

00:10:57.205 --> 00:11:00.321
the idea of nurture versus nature,

00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:02.776
that we build these civilizations --

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.731
she speaks about it at the end,
Helen Mirren's Prospera --

00:11:05.755 --> 00:11:11.204
we build them, but under nature,
under the grand tempest,

00:11:11.228 --> 00:11:16.699
these cloud-capped towers, these
gorgeous palaces will fade

00:11:16.723 --> 00:11:20.922
and there will -- leave not a rack behind.

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:23.551
So in the theater, I started the play,

00:11:23.575 --> 00:11:26.613
it was a black sand rake, white cyc,

00:11:26.637 --> 00:11:29.538
and there was a little girl,
Miranda, on the horizon,

00:11:29.562 --> 00:11:32.206
building a drip castle, a sand castle.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.646
And as she was there
on the edge of that stage,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.007
two stagehands all in black

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:43.511
with watering cans ran along the top

00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:48.138
and started to pour water
on the sand castle,

00:11:48.162 --> 00:11:50.908
and the sand castle
started to drip and sink,

00:11:50.932 --> 00:11:52.307
but before it did,

00:11:52.331 --> 00:11:56.547
the audience saw
the black-clad stagehands.

00:11:56.571 --> 00:12:01.134
The medium was apparent. It was banal.
We saw it.

00:12:01.158 --> 00:12:04.117
But as they started to pour the water,

00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:07.849
the light changed from showing
you the black-clad stagehands

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:11.163
to focusing, this rough magic
that we do in theater,

00:12:11.187 --> 00:12:14.716
it focused right on the water itself.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.938
And all of a sudden,
the audience's perspective changes.

00:12:18.962 --> 00:12:22.444
It becomes something magically large.

00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:25.076
It becomes the rainstorm.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.720
The masked actors,
the puppeteers, they disappear,

00:12:28.744 --> 00:12:31.920
and the audience makes
that leap into this world,

00:12:31.944 --> 00:12:36.243
into this imaginary world of "The
Tempest" actually happening.

00:12:36.267 --> 00:12:37.672
Now the difference

00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:40.275
when I went and did it in the cinema,

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:42.659
I started the actual movie

00:12:42.683 --> 00:12:47.941
with a close-up of a sand
castle, a black sand castle,

00:12:47.965 --> 00:12:49.779
and what cinema can do is,

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:53.235
by using camera, perspective,

00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:55.977
and also long shots and close-ups,

00:12:56.001 --> 00:12:58.296
it started on a close-up
of the sand castle,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.179
and as it pulled away,

00:13:00.203 --> 00:13:03.213
you saw that it was a miniature
sitting in the palm

00:13:03.237 --> 00:13:05.116
of the girl's hands.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.944
And so I could play with the medium,

00:13:06.968 --> 00:13:09.896
and why I move from one medium to another

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.379
is to be able to do this.

00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:13.810
Now I'm going to take you to "Spider-Man."

Circus, rock 'n' roll, drama.

00:15:39.915 --> 00:15:42.733
What the hell are we doing
up there on that stage?

00:15:42.757 --> 00:15:45.395
Well, one last story, very quickly.

00:15:45.419 --> 00:15:48.265
After I was in that village,
I crossed the lake,

00:15:48.289 --> 00:15:51.354
and I saw that the volcano was erupting

00:15:51.378 --> 00:15:53.107
on the other side, Gunung Batur,

00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:56.192
and there was a dead volcano
next to the live volcano.

00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:58.455
I didn't think I'd be
swallowed by the volcano,

00:15:58.479 --> 00:15:59.799
and I am here.

00:15:59.823 --> 00:16:03.736
But it's very easy to climb up, is it not?

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.321
You hold on to the roots,

00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:08.521
you put your foot in the little rocks

00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:11.103
and climb up there,
and you get to the top,

00:16:11.127 --> 00:16:13.393
and I was with a good
friend who was an actor,

00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:15.413
and we said, "Let's go up there.

00:16:15.437 --> 00:16:17.461
Let's see if we can come close to the edge

00:16:17.485 --> 00:16:19.597
of that live volcano."

00:16:19.621 --> 00:16:22.449
And we climbed up and we got
to the very top,

00:16:22.473 --> 00:16:24.954
and we're on the edge, on this precipice,

00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:27.367
Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke

00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:29.304
at the volcano at the other end,

00:16:29.328 --> 00:16:31.146
and I'm up there alone

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.882
on this incredible precipice.

00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:35.503
Did you hear the lyrics?

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:37.829
I'm on the precipice looking down

00:16:37.853 --> 00:16:40.140
into a dead volcano to my left.

00:16:40.164 --> 00:16:43.968
To my right is sheer shale.
It's coming off.

00:16:43.992 --> 00:16:47.736
I'm in thongs and sarongs.
It was many years ago.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.361
And no hiking boots.

00:16:49.385 --> 00:16:53.320
And he's disappeared, this
mad French gypsy actor,

00:16:53.344 --> 00:16:56.624
off in the smoke, and I realize,

00:16:56.648 --> 00:17:00.552
I can't go back the way that I've come.
I can't.

00:17:00.576 --> 00:17:05.233
So I throw away my camera.
I throw away my thongs,

00:17:05.257 --> 00:17:08.462
and I looked at the line
straight in front of me,

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:12.096
and I got down on all fours like a cat,

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:15.117
and I held with my knees to either side

00:17:15.142 --> 00:17:17.511
of this line in front of me,

00:17:17.535 --> 00:17:20.553
for 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.

00:17:20.577 --> 00:17:23.266
The wind was massively blowing,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.695
and the only way I could
get to the other side

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.139
was to look at the line
straight in front of me.

00:17:29.163 --> 00:17:31.142
I know you've all been there.

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:33.115
I'm in the crucible right now.

00:17:33.139 --> 00:17:34.979
It's my trial by fire.

00:17:35.003 --> 00:17:37.309
It's my company's trials by fire.

00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:41.566
We survive because our theme
song is "Rise Above."

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.707
Boy falls from the sky, rise above.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.121
It's right there in the palm
of both of our hands,

00:17:47.145 --> 00:17:48.748
of all of my company's hands.

00:17:48.772 --> 00:17:52.316
I have beautiful collaborators,
and we as creators

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.327
only get there all together.

00:17:54.351 --> 00:17:56.516
I know you understand that.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.941
And you just stay going forward,

00:17:58.965 --> 00:18:01.582
and then you see this extraordinary thing

00:18:01.606 --> 00:18:03.128
in front of your eyes.

00:18:03.152 --> 00:18:04.428
Thank you.

00:18:04.452 --> 00:18:09.899
(Applause)
