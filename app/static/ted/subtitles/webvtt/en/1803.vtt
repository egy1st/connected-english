00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:02.921
Good morning!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.889
Are you awake?

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:08.983
They took my name tag,
but I wanted to ask you,

00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:11.773
did anyone here write their name
on the tag in Arabic?

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.294
Anyone! No one?
All right, no problem.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.492
Once upon a time, not long ago,

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:26.014
I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend,
ordering food.

00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:29.997
So I looked at the waiter and said,

00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:32.959
"Do you have a menu (Arabic)?"

00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:37.443
He looked at me strangely,
thinking that he misheard.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.706
He said, "Sorry? (English)."

00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:43.550
I said,
"The menu (Arabic), please."

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.403
He replied,
"Don't you know what they call it?"

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.008
"I do."

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.618
He said, "No! It's called "menu" (English),
or "menu" (French)."

00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:54.613
Is the French pronunciation correct?

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:57.053
"Come, come, take care of this one!"
said the waiter.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:01.358
He was disgusted when talking to me,
as if he was saying to himself,

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:05.400
"If this was the last girl on Earth,
I wouldn't look at her!"

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.507
What's the meaning
of saying "menu" in Arabic?

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:15.583
Two words made a Lebanese young man
judge a girl as being backward

00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:18.350
and ignorant.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.996
How could she speak that way?

00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:27.031
At that moment, I started thinking.

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:28.107
It made me mad.

00:01:28.152 --> 00:01:29.236
It definitely hurts!

00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:32.391
I'm denied the right to speak
my own language in my own country?

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:34.312
Where could this happen?

00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:37.672
How did we get here?

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:41.504
Well, while we are here,
there are many people like me,

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:45.082
who would reach a stage in their lives,
where they involuntarily give up

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:47.420
everything
that has happened to them in the past,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.559
just so they can say that they're modern

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:51.840
and civilized.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.745
Should I forget all my culture, thoughts,

00:01:54.835 --> 00:01:59.440
intellect and all my memories?

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.995
Childhood stories might be the best memories
we have of the war!

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:08.303
Should I forget everything
I learned in Arabic, just to conform?

00:02:08.423 --> 00:02:11.588
To be one of them?

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:14.022
Where's the logic in that?

00:02:14.132 --> 00:02:17.690
Despite all that,
I tried to understand him.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.946
I didn't want to judge him
with the same cruelty that he judged me.

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:27.712
The Arabic language
doesn't satisfy today's needs.

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:29.694
It's not a language for science,

00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:31.215
research,

00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:33.234
a language we're used to in universities,

00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:35.374
a language we use in the workplace,

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:41.798
a language we rely on if we were to perform
an advanced research project,

00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:44.555
and it definitely isn't a language
we use at the airport.

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:47.360
If we did so,
they'd strip us of our clothes.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.328
Where can I use it, then?
We could all ask this question!

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:55.980
So, you want us to use Arabic.
Where are we to do so?

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.130
This is one reality.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.488
But we have another more important reality
that we ought to think about.

00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:07.807
Arabic is the mother tongue.

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:13.692
Research says that mastery
of other languages

00:03:13.718 --> 00:03:17.214
demands mastery of the mother tongue.

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:24.344
Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite
for creative expression in other languages.

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:25.819
How?

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.899
Gibran Khalil Gibran,

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.390
when he first started writing,
he used Arabic.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.872
All his ideas, imagination and philosophy

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:42.589
were inspired by this little boy
in the village

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.980
where he grew up,
smelling a specific smell,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.361
hearing a specific voice,

00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:47.986
and thinking a specific thought.

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:52.787
So, when he started writing in English,
he had enough baggage.

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:55.185
Even when he wrote in English,

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:58.976
when you read his writings in English,
you smell the same smell,

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:00.871
sense the same feeling.

00:04:01.147 --> 00:04:04.733
You can imagine that that's him
writing in English,

00:04:04.813 --> 00:04:10.077
the same boy who came from the mountain.
From a village on Mount Lebanon.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.091
So, this is an example
no one can argue with.

00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:21.981
Second, it's often said
that if you want to kill a nation,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.841
the only way to kill a nation,

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:26.465
is to kill its language.

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:31.995
This is a reality
that developed societies are aware of.

00:04:32.352 --> 00:04:38.666
The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese,
all these nations are aware of this.

00:04:38.876 --> 00:04:42.712
That's why they legislate
to protect their language.

00:04:42.842 --> 00:04:45.243
They make it sacred.

00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:50.830
That's why they use it in production,
they pay a lot of money to develop it.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.706
Do we know better than them?

00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:55.116
All right,

00:04:55.122 --> 00:04:56.949
we aren't from the developed world,

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.167
this advanced thinking
hasn't reached us yet,

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.901
and we would like to catch up
with the civilized world.

00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:07.224
Countries that were once like us,
but decided to strive for development,

00:05:07.514 --> 00:05:08.950
do research,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.933
and catch up with those countries,

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:13.773
such as Turkey, Malaysia and others,

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:17.604
they carried their language with them
as they were climbing the ladder,

00:05:17.724 --> 00:05:21.011
protected it like a diamond.

00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:22.640
They kept it close to them.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.940
Because if you get any product
from Turkey or elsewhere

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.106
and it's not labeled in Turkish,

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:32.065
then it isn't a local product.

00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:34.778
You wouldn't believe it's a local product.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.640
They'd go back to being consumers,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.153
clueless consumers, like we are
most of the time.

00:05:43.463 --> 00:05:49.334
So, in order for them to innovate and produce,
they had to protect their language.

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:55.521
If I say, "Freedom, sovereignty,
independence (Arabic),"

00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:58.555
what does this remind you of?

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:02.241
It doesn't ring a bell, does it?

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.520
Regardless of the who, how and why.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.658
Language isn't just for conversing,
just words coming out of our mouths.

00:06:13.798 --> 00:06:18.500
Language represents specific stages
in our lives,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.723
and terminology
that is linked to our emotions.

00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:26.155
So when we say,
"Freedom, sovereignty, independence,"

00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:29.565
each one of you draws a specific image
in their own mind,

00:06:29.778 --> 00:06:32.374
there are specific feelings

00:06:32.444 --> 00:06:35.001
of a specific day
in a specific historical period.

00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.425
Language isn't one, two
or three words or letters put together.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.339
It's an idea inside
that relates to how we think,

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:47.003
and how we see each other
and how others see us.

00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:48.707
What is our intellect?

00:06:48.977 --> 00:06:51.499
How do you say
whether this guy understands or not?

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:59.368
So, if I say, "Freedom, sovereignty,
independence (English),"

00:07:00.164 --> 00:07:02.153
or if your son came up to you and said,

00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:06.851
"Dad, have you lived through the period of
the freedom (English) slogan?"

00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:08.651
How would you feel?

00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:13.465
If you don't see a problem,

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:17.144
then I'd better leave,
and stop talking in vain.

00:07:17.334 --> 00:07:22.600
The idea is that these expressions
remind us of a specific thing.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.586
I have a francophone friend
who's married to a French man.

00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:32.163
I asked her once how things were going.

00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:33.789
She said,
"Everything is fine,

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:38.370
but once, I spent a whole night
asking and trying to translate

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.970
the meaning of the word
'toqborni' for him."

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.359
(Laughter)

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:45.495
(Applause)

00:07:50.013 --> 00:07:53.363
The poor woman had mistakenly told him
"toqborni,"

00:07:53.483 --> 00:07:56.335
and then spent the whole night
trying to explain it to him.

00:07:56.335 --> 00:07:59.863
He was puzzled by the thought:
"How could anyone be this cruel?

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:01.779
Does she want to commit suicide?

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:04.585
'Bury me?' (English)"

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:07.533
This is one of the few examples.

00:08:07.623 --> 00:08:10.772
It made us feel that she's unable to tell
that word to her husband,

00:08:10.772 --> 00:08:13.461
since he won't understand,

00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:16.382
and he's right not to;
his way of thinking is different.

00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:20.176
She said to me,
"He listens to Fairuz with me,

00:08:20.446 --> 00:08:24.861
and one night,
I tried to translate for him

00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:28.250
so he can feel what I feel when
I listen to Fairuz."

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.500
The poor woman tried to translate
this for him:

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.695
"From them I extended my hands
and stole you --"

00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:35.830
(Laughter)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.405
And here's the pickle:

00:08:37.405 --> 00:08:41.500
"And because you belong to them,
I returned my hands and left you."

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.616
(Laughter)

00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:44.080
Translate that for me.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:51.674
(Applause)

00:08:51.804 --> 00:08:55.849
So, what have we done to protect
the Arabic language?

00:08:56.129 --> 00:08:59.265
We turned this into a concern
of the civil society,

00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:02.199
and we launched a campaign to preserve
the Arabic language.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.594
Even though many people told me,
"Why do you bother?

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:08.677
Forget about this headache
and go have fun."

00:09:08.717 --> 00:09:10.254
No problem!

00:09:10.434 --> 00:09:13.527
The campaign to preserve Arabic
launched a slogan that says,

00:09:13.527 --> 00:09:16.360
"I talk to you from the East,
but you reply from the West."

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:23.928
We didn't say,
"No! We do not accept this or that."

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:29.053
We didn't adopt this style because
that way, we wouldn't be understood.

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:32.647
And when someone talks to me that way,
I hate the Arabic language.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.279
We say--

00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:37.181
(Applause)

00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:39.653
We want to change our reality,

00:09:39.703 --> 00:09:44.385
and be convinced in a way that reflects
our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life.

00:09:44.655 --> 00:09:49.950
In a way that dresses like us
and thinks like we do.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.823
So, "I talk to you from the East,
but you reply from the West"

00:09:52.823 --> 00:09:54.476
has hit the spot.

00:09:54.476 --> 00:09:58.169
Something very easy,
yet creative and persuasive.

00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:01.677
After that,
we launched another campaign

00:10:02.277 --> 00:10:05.685
with scenes of letters on the ground.

00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:08.104
You've seen an example of it outside,

00:10:08.284 --> 00:10:12.666
a scene of a letter surrounded
by black and yellow tape

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:15.508
with "Don't kill your language!"
written on it.

00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:19.122
Why?
Seriously, don't kill your language.

00:10:19.212 --> 00:10:22.126
We really shouldn't kill our language.

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:27.304
If we were to kill the language,
we'd have to find an identity.

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:29.313
We'd have to find an existence.

00:10:29.383 --> 00:10:31.698
We'd go back to the beginning.

00:10:31.768 --> 00:10:38.260
This is beyond just missing our chance
of being modern and civilized.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:45.200
After that we released photos
of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.133
Photos of "cool" guys and girls.

00:10:48.263 --> 00:10:50.424
We are very cool!

00:10:50.904 --> 00:10:55.198
And to whoever might say,
"Ha! You used an English word!"

00:10:55.278 --> 00:10:59.070
I say,
"No! I adopt the word 'cool.'"

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.865
Let them object however they want,
but give me a word that's nicer

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:05.531
and matches the reality better.

00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:07.565
I will keep on saying "Internet"

00:11:07.565 --> 00:11:10.389
I wouldn't say:
"I'm going to the world wide web"

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.175
(Laughs)

00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:15.446
Because it doesn't fit!
We shouldn't kid ourselves.

00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:19.355
But to reach this point,
we all have to be convinced

00:11:19.885 --> 00:11:22.020
that we shouldn't allow anyone
who is bigger

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.356
or thinks they have any authority over us
when it comes to language,

00:11:25.356 --> 00:11:30.815
to control us or make us think and feel
what they want.

00:11:31.685 --> 00:11:35.443
Creativity is the idea.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.213
So, if we can't reach space
or build a rocket and so on,

00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:40.113
we can be creative.

00:11:40.113 --> 00:11:43.880
At this moment, every one of you
is a creative project.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.468
Creativity in your mother tongue
is the path.

00:11:46.798 --> 00:11:50.244
Let's start from this moment.

00:11:50.534 --> 00:11:52.536
Let's write a novel
or produce a short film.

00:11:52.596 --> 00:11:55.874
A single novel could make us global again.

00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:59.700
It could bring the Arabic language
back to being number one.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.231
So, it's not true that there's no solution;
there is a solution!

00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:08.230
But we have to know that, and be convinced
that a solution exists,

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.229
that we have a duty
to be part of that solution.

00:12:11.929 --> 00:12:14.716
In conclusion, what can you do today?

00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:18.000
Now, tweets, who's tweeting?

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:25.335
Please, I beg of you,
even though my time has finished,

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:30.487
either Arabic, English, French
or Chinese.

00:12:30.577 --> 00:12:36.158
But don't write Arabic
with Latin characters mixed with numbers!

00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:40.358
(Applause)

00:12:40.408 --> 00:12:43.556
It's a disaster!
That's not a language.

00:12:43.866 --> 00:12:47.412
You'd be entering a virtual world
with a virtual language.

00:12:47.562 --> 00:12:50.244
It's not easy to come back
from such a place and rise.

00:12:50.724 --> 00:12:52.806
That's the first thing we can do.

00:12:52.896 --> 00:12:55.499
Second, there are many other things
that we can do.

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:57.904
We're not here today to convince
each other.

00:12:57.904 --> 00:13:01.438
We're here to bring attention
to the necessity of preserving this language.

00:13:01.438 --> 00:13:04.313
Now I will tell you a secret.

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:10.490
A baby first identifies its father

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.557
through language.

00:13:12.557 --> 00:13:17.716
When my daughter is born, I'll tell her,
"This is your father, honey (Arabic)."

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:22.324
I wouldn't say,
"This is your dad, honey (English)."

00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:25.770
And in the supermarket,
I promise my daughter Noor,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.986
that if she says to me,
"Thanks (Arabic),"

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:32.753
I won't say, "Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'"
and hope no one has heard her.

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:35.900
(Applause)

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.877
Let's get rid of this cultural cringe.

00:13:49.297 --> 00:13:52.343
(Applause)
