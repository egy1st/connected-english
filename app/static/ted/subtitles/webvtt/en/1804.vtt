00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.039
I'd like you all

00:00:03.063 --> 00:00:05.707
to ask yourselves a question

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.274
which you may never have
asked yourselves before:

00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:13.637
What is possible with the human voice?

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:21.885
What is possible with the human voice?

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:31.461
(Beatboxing)

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:48.838

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.056
Yeah.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.919
(Applause)

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:27.319
(Boomerang noises)

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:31.192
It was coming straight for me.
I had to. It was, yeah.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:34.304
As you can probably well imagine,

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.903
I was a strange child.

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:43.394
(Laughter)

00:01:43.418 --> 00:01:46.305
Because the thing is,
I was constantly trying

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.439
to extend my repertoire of noises to be

00:01:50.463 --> 00:01:52.999
the very maximum that it could be.

00:01:53.023 --> 00:01:55.357
I was constantly experimenting
with these noises.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.335
And I'm still on that mission.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.141
I'm still trying to find every noise

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:01.440
that I can possibly make.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:03.704
And the thing is, I'm a bit
older and wiser now,

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:05.395
and I know that there's some noises

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.705
I'll never be able to make
because I'm hemmed in

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.103
by my physical body,
and there's things it can't do.

00:02:11.127 --> 00:02:13.318
And there's things that no
one's voice can do.

00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:16.752
For example, no one can do
two notes at the same time.

00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:18.417
You can do two-tone singing,

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.966
which monks can do, which is like...

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:31.859
(Two-tone singing)

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:34.465
But that's cheating.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.331
And it hurts your throat.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:39.542
So there's things you can't
do, and these limitations

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.840
on the human voice have
always really annoyed me,

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:46.104
because beatbox is the best way of getting

00:02:46.128 --> 00:02:49.526
musical ideas out of your head
and into the world,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.418
but they're sketches at best,

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.160
which is what's annoyed me.

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:55.588
If only, if only there was a way

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:58.389
for these ideas to come out unimpeded

00:02:58.413 --> 00:03:03.075
by the restrictions
which my body gives it.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.464
So I've been working with these guys,

00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:09.249
and we've made a machine.

00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:11.596
We've made a system which is basically

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.922
a live production machine,

00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:18.639
a real-time music production machine,

00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:22.574
and it enables me to, using
nothing but my voice,

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:26.876
create music in real time
as I hear it in my head

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.394
unimpeded by any physical restrictions

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:31.500
that my body might place on me.

00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:35.373
And I'm going to show you what it can do.

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:39.259
And before I start making noises with it,

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:41.677
and using it to manipulate my voice,

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:44.606
I want to reiterate that everything
that you're about to hear

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.212
is being made by my voice.

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:51.169
This system has --

00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:53.575
thank you, beautiful assistant --

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.735
this system has no sounds in it itself

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.559
until I start putting sounds in it,

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:04.415
so there's no prerecorded
samples of any kind.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.716
So once this thing really gets going,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.645
and it really starts to mangle
the audio I'm putting into it,

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.599
it becomes not obvious
that it is the human voice,

00:04:12.623 --> 00:04:15.338
but it is, so I'm going to take
you through it bit by bit

00:04:15.362 --> 00:04:17.065
and start nice and simple.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.488
So the polyphony problem:
I've only got one voice.

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:21.652
How do I get around the problem

00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:23.926
of really wanting to have
as many different voices

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.189
going on at the same time.

00:04:25.213 --> 00:04:27.547
The simplest way to do it
is something like this.

00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:33.351
(Beatboxing)

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:35.326
By dancing. It's like this.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.965
(Music)

00:05:07.186 --> 00:05:08.591
Thanks.

00:05:08.615 --> 00:05:10.944
(Applause)

00:05:10.968 --> 00:05:14.190
So that's probably the easiest way.

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:17.556
But if you want to do something
a little bit more immediate,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.216
something that you can't
achieve with live looping,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240
there's other ways to layer your voice up.

00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:23.184
There's things like pitch-shifting,

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:24.863
which are awesome,

00:05:24.887 --> 00:05:26.751
and I'm going to show you
now what that sounds like.

00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:29.360
So I'm going to start
another beat for you, like this.

00:05:29.384 --> 00:05:37.060
(Beatboxing)

00:05:37.084 --> 00:05:38.725
There's always got to be a bit
of a dance at the start,

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.358
because it's just fun, so

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.888
you can clap along if you want.

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:45.431
You don't have to. It's fine.
Check it out.

00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:49.711
I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.

00:05:49.735 --> 00:05:56.310
(Music)

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:03.651
And now, a rockabilly guitar.

00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:19.134
Which is nice. But what if I want
to make, say, a -- (Applause) --

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:21.797
Thanks. What if I want
to make, say, a rock organ?

00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:24.711
Is that possible? Yes, it is,

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:26.895
by recording myself like this.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.863
(Organ sound)

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:34.419
And now I have that, I have that recorded.

00:06:34.443 --> 00:06:35.943
Assign it to a keyboard.

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:39.573
(Music)

00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:41.342
So that's cool.

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:43.330
(Applause)

00:06:43.354 --> 00:06:49.206
But what if I wanted to sound
like the whole of Pink Floyd?

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.975
Impossible, you say. No.

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:54.814
It is possible, and you
can do it very simply

00:06:54.838 --> 00:06:58.782
using this machine. It's really fantastic.
Check it out.

00:06:58.806 --> 00:07:15.779
(Music)

00:07:32.609 --> 00:07:35.949
So every noise you can
hear there is my voice.

00:07:35.973 --> 00:07:40.121
I didn't just trigger something
which sounds like that.

00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:42.241
There's no samples.
There's no synthesizers.

00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:45.165
That is literally all my voice
being manipulated,

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:49.064
and when you get to that point,
you have to ask, don't you,

00:07:49.088 --> 00:07:50.852
what's the point?

00:07:50.876 --> 00:07:54.973
Why do this? (Laughter)

00:07:54.997 --> 00:07:57.712
Because it's cheaper than hiring
the whole of Pink Floyd,

00:07:57.736 --> 00:07:59.428
I suppose, is the easy answer.

00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:03.084
But in actual fact,
I haven't made this machine

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.900
so that I can emulate
things that already exist.

00:08:05.924 --> 00:08:08.161
I've made this so that I can make

00:08:08.185 --> 00:08:09.566
any noise that I can imagine.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.546
So with your permission, I'm going to do

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.827
some things that are in my mind,

00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:16.406
and I hope you enjoy them,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.576
because they're rather unusual,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.549
especially when you're
doing things which are

00:08:21.573 --> 00:08:25.065
as unusual as this, it
can be hard to believe

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:26.944
that it is all my voice, you see.

00:08:26.968 --> 00:08:35.885
(Voice effects)

00:08:40.177 --> 00:08:51.389
(Music)

00:09:01.331 --> 00:09:03.395
Like this.

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:08.976
(Music)

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:38.649
So, loosely defined,

00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:42.499
that is what's possible
with the human voice.

00:10:42.523 --> 00:10:44.523
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:44.547 --> 00:10:49.947
(Applause)
