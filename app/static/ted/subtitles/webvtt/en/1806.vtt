00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:03.620
In an age of global strife
and climate change,

00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:07.106
I'm here to answer
the all important question:

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.201
Why is sex so damn good?

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.178
If you're laughing, you know what I mean.

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.040
Now, before we get to that answer,

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:16.258
let me tell you about Chris Hosmer.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.949
Chris is a great friend of mine
from my university days,

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:21.813
but secretly, I hate him.

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:24.733
Here's why. Back in university,
we had a quick project

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.715
to design some solar-powered clocks.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.269
Here's my clock.

00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:30.746
It uses something called
the dwarf sunflower,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.092
which grows to about 12 inches in height.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.158
Now, as you know, sunflowers

00:00:35.182 --> 00:00:37.394
track the sun
during the course of the day.

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:40.756
So in the morning, you see
which direction the sunflower is facing,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.946
and you mark it on the blank
area in the base.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.897
At noon, you mark the changed
position of the sunflower,

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.269
and in the evening again,
and that's your clock.

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:52.855
Now, I know my clock doesn't
tell you the exact time,

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.583
but it does give you a general
idea using a flower.

00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:58.699
So, in my completely unbiased,
subjective opinion,

00:00:58.723 --> 00:01:00.418
it's brilliant.

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:03.244
However, here's Chris's clock.

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:07.295
It's five magnifying glasses
with a shot glass under each one.

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.216
In each shot glass
is a different scented oil.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.735
In the morning, the sunlight
will shine down

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.394
on the first magnifying glass,

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:16.424
focusing a beam of light
on the shot glass underneath.

00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:18.623
This will warm up the scented oil inside,

00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:21.207
and a particular smell will be emitted.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.279
A couple of hours later,
the sun will shine

00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:26.576
on the next magnifying glass,
and a different smell will be emitted.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.257
So during the course of the day,
five different smells

00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:31.292
are dispersed throughout that environment.

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:34.032
Anyone living in that house
can tell the time

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.504
just by the smell.

00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:38.857
You can see why I hate Chris.

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.501
I thought my idea was pretty good,

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:42.892
but his idea is genius,

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:45.513
and at the time, I knew
his idea was better than mine,

00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:48.335
but I just couldn't explain why.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.865
One thing you have to know
about me is I hate to lose.

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.727
This problem's been bugging me
for well over a decade.

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:59.087
All right, let's get back
to the question of why sex is so good.

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.948
Many years after the solar
powered clocks project,

00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:05.652
a young lady I knew suggested
maybe sex is so good

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:07.592
because of the five senses.

00:02:07.616 --> 00:02:10.401
And when she said this, I had an epiphany.

00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:14.132
So I decided to evaluate different
experiences I had in my life

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:16.620
from the point of view of the five senses.

00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:20.330
To do this, I devised something
called the five senses graph.

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:23.415
Along the y-axis, you have
a scale from zero to 10,

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.762
and along the x-axis, you have,
of course, the five senses.

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:29.346
Anytime I had a memorable
experience in my life,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.341
I would record it on this graph
like a five senses diary.

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:36.533
Here's a quick video
to show you how it works.

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:39.349
(Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop,

00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:41.993
and today, I'm going to show
you what riding motorbikes

00:02:42.017 --> 00:02:45.278
is like from the point of view
of the five senses. Hey!

00:02:45.302 --> 00:02:48.884
Bike designer: This is [unclear],
custom bike designer.

00:02:48.908 --> 00:02:54.707
(Motorcyle revving)

00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:58.011
[Sound]

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:19.087
[Touch]

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.702
[Sight]

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:38.623
[Smell]

00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:45.653
[Taste]

00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:51.938
JL: And that's how the five senses
graph works.

00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:55.287
Now, for a period of three years,
I gathered data,

00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:58.043
not just me but also some of my friends,

00:03:58.067 --> 00:04:00.544
and I used to teach
in university, so I forced my --

00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:03.229
I mean, I asked my students
to do this as well.

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:05.859
So here are some other results.

00:04:05.883 --> 00:04:08.096
The first is for instant noodles.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.156
Now obviously, taste
and smell are quite high,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.275
but notice sound is at three.

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.851
Many people told me a big part

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.873
of the noodle-eating experience
is the slurping noise.

00:04:19.897 --> 00:04:22.255
You know. (Slurps)

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.074
Needless to say, I no longer
dine with these people.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.411
OK, next, clubbing.

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:31.132
OK, here what I found interesting was

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:35.801
that taste is at four,
and many respondents told me

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.540
it's because of the taste of drinks,

00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:41.961
but also, in some cases, kissing is a big
part of the clubbing experience.

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:44.769
These people I still do hang out with.

00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:47.113
All right, and smoking.

00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:52.160
Here I found touch is at [six],
and one of the reasons

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:55.516
is that smokers told me the sensation
of holding a cigarette

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.213
and bringing it up to your lips is a big
part of the smoking experience,

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:01.892
which shows, it's kind of scary to think

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:05.102
how well cigarettes are designed
by the manufacturers.

00:05:05.126 --> 00:05:08.483
OK. Now, what would the perfect
experience

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.962
look like on the five senses graph?

00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:14.483
It would, of course, be
a horizontal line along the top.

00:05:14.507 --> 00:05:17.063
Now you can see, not
even as intense an experience

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:19.296
as riding a motorbike comes close.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.838
In fact, in the years
that I gathered data,

00:05:21.862 --> 00:05:25.076
only one experience came close
to being the perfect one.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.701
That is, of course, sex. Great sex.

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:30.390
Respondents said that great sex

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:34.245
hits all of the five senses
at an extreme level.

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:36.365
Here I'll quote
one of my students who said,

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.602
"Sex is so good, it's good
even when it's bad."

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:43.915
So the five senses
theory does help explain

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:46.032
why sex is so good.

00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:48.881
Now in the middle of all this
five senses work,

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:51.690
I suddenly remembered
the solar-powered clocks project

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:52.767
from my youth.

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:55.759
And I realized this theory
also explains why Chris's clock

00:05:55.783 --> 00:05:57.640
is so much better than mine.

00:05:57.664 --> 00:06:00.769
You see, my clock only focuses on sight,

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:03.207
and a little bit of touch.

00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.190
Here's Chris's clock.

00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:09.839
It's the first clock ever
that uses smell to tell the time.

00:06:09.863 --> 00:06:11.905
In fact, in terms of the five senses,

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:14.918
Chris's clock is a revolution.

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:17.556
And that's what this theory
taught me about my field.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.455
You see, up till now, us designers,

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.461
we've mainly focused on making
things look very pretty,

00:06:22.485 --> 00:06:24.257
and a little bit of touch,

00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:27.436
which means we've ignored
the other three senses.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.906
Chris's clock shows us
that even raising just one

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.306
of those other senses can
make for a brilliant product.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.337
So what if we started using
the five senses theory

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:38.572
in all of our designs?

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:41.297
Here's three quick ideas I came up with.

00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:43.900
This is an iron, you
know, for your clothes,

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:46.669
to which I added a spraying mechanism,

00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.220
so you fill up the vial
with your favorite scent,

00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:51.088
and your clothes will smell nicer,

00:06:51.112 --> 00:06:52.684
but hopefully it should also make

00:06:52.708 --> 00:06:54.692
the ironing experience more enjoyable.

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:57.864
We could call this "the perfumator."

00:06:57.888 --> 00:06:59.349
All right, next.

00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:01.392
So I brush my teeth twice a day,

00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:03.798
and what if we had a toothbrush

00:07:03.822 --> 00:07:05.494
that tastes like candy,

00:07:05.518 --> 00:07:07.969
and when the taste of candy ran out,

00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:10.929
you'd know it's time
to change your toothbrush?

00:07:10.953 --> 00:07:15.508
Finally, I have a thing for the keys
on a flute or a clarinet.

00:07:15.532 --> 00:07:18.934
It's not just the way they look,
but I love the way they feel

00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.164
when you press down on them.

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:23.304
Now, I don't play the flute
or the clarinet,

00:07:23.328 --> 00:07:27.440
so I decided to combine these keys
with an instrument I do play:

00:07:27.464 --> 00:07:30.651
the television remote control.

00:07:30.675 --> 00:07:33.943
Now, when we look at these
three ideas together,

00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:36.863
you'll notice that the five senses theory

00:07:36.887 --> 00:07:39.867
doesn't only change the way
we use these products

00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:42.686
but also the way they look.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.738
So in conclusion, I've found
the five senses theory

00:07:46.762 --> 00:07:49.299
to be a very useful tool in evaluating

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:50.895
different experiences in my life,

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:53.843
and then taking those best experiences

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:56.491
and hopefully incorporating
them into my designs.

00:07:56.515 --> 00:08:00.408
Now, I realize the five senses
isn't the only thing

00:08:00.432 --> 00:08:02.326
that makes life interesting.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.545
There's also the six emotions

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:08.109
and that elusive x-factor.

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:11.859
Maybe that could be
the topic of my next talk.

00:08:11.883 --> 00:08:14.268
Until then, please have fun

00:08:14.292 --> 00:08:16.667
using the five senses in your own lives

00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:18.387
and your own designs.

00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:21.172
Oh, one last thing before I leave.

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:23.482
Here's the experience you
all had while listening

00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:24.731
to the TED Talks.

00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:27.043
However, it would be better
if we could boost up

00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:30.707
a couple of the other senses
like smell and taste.

00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:33.759
And the best way to do that is with

00:08:33.783 --> 00:08:35.412
free candy.

00:08:35.436 --> 00:08:37.155
You guys ready?

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.907
All right.

00:08:40.504 --> 00:08:46.303
(Applause)
