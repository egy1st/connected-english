WEBVTT

00:00:00.802 --> 00:00:04.553
I moved back home 15 years ago

00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:07.417
after a 20-year stay in the United States,

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.781
and Africa called me back.

00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:13.322
And I founded my country's first

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.633
graphic design and new media college.

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:20.559
And I called it the Zimbabwe
Institute of Vigital Arts.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:24.796
The idea, the dream, was really
for a sort of Bauhaus

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.402
sort of school where new
ideas were interrogated

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:32.615
and investigated,

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:35.375
the creation of a new visual language

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.356
based on the African creative heritage.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.781
We offer a two-year diploma

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:47.545
to talented students who have
successfully completed

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:49.725
their high school education.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.662
And typography's a very important
part of the curriculum

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:57.605
and we encourage our students
to look inward for influence.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.971
Here's a poster designed
by one of the students

00:00:59.995 --> 00:01:04.128
under the theme "Education is a right."

00:01:04.152 --> 00:01:08.411
Some logos designed by my students.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.479
Africa has had a long
tradition of writing,

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:14.651
but this is not such a well-known fact,

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:18.584
and I wrote the book "Afrikan
Alphabets" to address that.

00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:22.131
The different types of writing in Africa,

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:24.376
first was proto-writing,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.544
as illustrated by Nsibidi,

00:01:26.568 --> 00:01:29.616
which is the writing
system of a secret society

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.446
of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.316
So it's a special-interest writing system.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.891
The Akan of people of Ghana
and [Cote d'Ivoire]

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:44.936
developed Adinkra symbols
some 400 years ago,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.804
and these are proverbs,
historical sayings,

00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:51.514
objects, animals, plants,

00:01:51.538 --> 00:01:53.522
and my favorite Adinkra system

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.898
is the first one at the top on the left.

00:01:55.922 --> 00:01:56.900
It's called Sankofa.

00:01:56.924 --> 00:02:02.894
It means, "Return and get
it." Learn from the past.

00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:05.695
This pictograph by the Jokwe
people of Angola

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.514
tells the story
of the creation of the world.

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:14.918
At the top is God,
at the bottom is man, mankind,

00:02:14.942 --> 00:02:19.826
and on the left is the sun,
on the right is the moon.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.681
All the paths lead to and from God.

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:28.075
These secret societies
of the Yoruba, Kongo

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.270
and Palo religions

00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:34.007
in Nigeria, Congo and Angola respectively,

00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:37.931
developed this intricate writing system

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:41.700
which is alive and well
today in the New World

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:47.888
in Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti.

00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:51.184
In the rainforests of the Democratic
Republic of Congo,

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:54.075
in the Ituri society,

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.846
the men pound out a cloth
out of a special tree,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.939
and the women, who are also
the praise singers,

00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:03.620
paint interweaving patterns

00:03:03.644 --> 00:03:06.350
that are the same in structure

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:11.005
as the polyphonic structures
that they use in their singing --

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.993
a sort of a musical score, if you may.

00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:17.742
In South Africa, Ndebele women

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:21.100
use these symbols and other
geometric patterns

00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:24.914
to paint their homes in bright colors,

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:27.836
and the Zulu women use the symbols

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.334
in the beads that they weave

00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:32.477
into bracelets and necklaces.

00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.556
Ethiopia has had the longest
tradition of writing,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.875
with the Ethiopic script
that was developed

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:40.837
in the fourth century A.D.

00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:43.351
and is used to write Amharic,

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:46.636
which is spoken by over 24 million people.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.093
King Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum
Kingdom of Cameroon

00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:54.658
developed Shü-mom at the age of 25.

00:03:54.682 --> 00:03:56.745
Shü-mom is a writing system.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.738
It's a syllabary. It's not
exactly an alphabet.

00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:03.053
And here we see
three stages of development

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:07.692
that it went through in 30 years.

00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:13.252
The Vai people of Liberia had
a long tradition of literacy

00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:17.187
before their first contact
with Europeans in the 1800s.

00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:21.769
It's a syllabary and reads
from left to right.

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:25.340
Next door, in Sierra Leone, the Mende

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.363
also developed a syllabary,

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:30.995
but theirs reads from right to left.

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:34.385
Africa has had a long tradition of design,

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.008
a well-defined design sensibility,

00:04:38.032 --> 00:04:40.310
but the problem in Africa has been that,

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:43.008
especially today, designers in Africa

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.542
struggle with all forms of design

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:50.048
because they are more apt to look outward

00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:52.676
for influence and inspiration.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.873
The creative spirit in Africa,
the creative tradition,

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:59.749
is as potent as it has always been,

00:04:59.773 --> 00:05:03.796
if only designers could look within.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.687
This Ethiopic cross illustrates

00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:09.467
what Dr. Ron Eglash has established:

00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:13.356
that Africa has a lot
to contribute to computing

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.732
and mathematics through their intuitive
grasp of fractals.

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:22.799
Africans of antiquity
created civilization,

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.112
and their monuments,
which still stand today,

00:05:26.136 --> 00:05:29.696
are a true testimony of their greatness.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.614
Most probably,
one of humanity's greatest achievements

00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:36.580
is the invention of the alphabet,

00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:39.698
and that has been attributed
to Mesopotamia

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:45.263
with their invention
of cuneiform in 1600 BC,

00:05:45.287 --> 00:05:49.001
followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt,

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:54.470
and that story has been cast
in stone as historical fact.

00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:57.184
That is, until 1998,

00:05:57.208 --> 00:06:02.303
when one Yale professor
John Coleman Darnell

00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:05.693
discovered these inscriptions
in the Thebes desert

00:06:05.717 --> 00:06:09.053
on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt,

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:15.289
and these have been dated
at between 1800 and 1900 B.C.,

00:06:15.313 --> 00:06:18.298
centuries before Mesopotamia.

00:06:18.322 --> 00:06:21.226
Called Wadi el-Hol

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.432
because of the place
that they were discovered,

00:06:24.456 --> 00:06:27.837
these inscriptions --
research is still going on,

00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:30.635
a few of them have been deciphered,

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:33.142
but there is consensus among scholars

00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:38.359
that this is really
humanity's first alphabet.

00:06:38.383 --> 00:06:41.403
Over here, you see a paleographic chart

00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:44.520
that shows what has
been deciphered so far,

00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:47.929
starting with the letter
A, "ālep," at the top,

00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:51.614
and "bêt," in the middle, and so forth.

00:06:51.638 --> 00:06:55.227
It is time that students
of design in Africa

00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:59.444
read the works of titans
like Cheikh Anta Diop,

00:06:59.468 --> 00:07:01.560
Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop,

00:07:01.584 --> 00:07:04.643
whose seminal work on Egypt is vindicated

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:07.776
by this discovery.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.863
The last word goes
to the great Jamaican leader

00:07:10.887 --> 00:07:12.852
Marcus Mosiah Garvey

00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:16.052
and the Akan people of Ghana

00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:18.425
with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa,

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:20.667
which encourages us to go to the past

00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:22.839
so as to inform our present

00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:27.441
and build on a future
for us and our children.

00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:31.682
It is also time that designers in Africa

00:07:31.706 --> 00:07:34.308
stop looking outside.

00:07:34.332 --> 00:07:36.698
They've been looking
outward for a long time,

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:39.010
yet what they were looking for

00:07:39.034 --> 00:07:43.963
has been right there
within grasp, right within them.

00:07:43.987 --> 00:07:45.767
Thank you very much.

00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:50.730
(Applause)
