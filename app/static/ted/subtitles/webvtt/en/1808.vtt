00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:01.836
Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much

00:00:01.836 --> 00:00:04.248
of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing,

00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:06.692
but I thought it would just be nice to recap

00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:10.628
on how Derek got to where he is today.

00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:13.119
It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me,

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.737
but when Derek was born,

00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:17.376
he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.340
He was born three and a half months premature,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.556
and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:26.776
He had to have a lot of oxygen,

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.776
and that affected your eyes, Derek,

00:00:28.776 --> 00:00:30.604
and also the way you understand language

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:33.575
and the way you understand the world.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.642
But that was the end of the bad news,

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:38.648
because when Derek came home from the hospital,

00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:41.830
his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.201
who was going to look after you, Derek,

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:46.849
really for the rest of your childhood.

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:49.425
And Nanny's great insight, really,

00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:52.110
was to think, here's a child who can't see.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.031
Music must be the thing for Derek.

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:59.298
And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled,

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:02.843
to him for his first few years of life.

00:01:02.843 --> 00:01:06.894
And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:09.878
hour after hour every day that made him think

00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:12.896
maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring,

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:15.905
some sort of musical gift.

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.178
Here's a little picture of Derek going up now,

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.852
when you were with your nanny.

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:25.371
Now Nanny's great other insight was to think,

00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:28.706
perhaps we should get Derek something to play,

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:32.342
and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.923
out of the loft, never thinking really

00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:37.281
that anything much would come of it.

00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:40.269
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:41.890
and actually bashed it,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.679
bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.671
But out of all the bashing, after a few months,

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.840
emerged the most fantastic music,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.206
and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek,

00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:59.721
when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:03.321
out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:05.834
That was the great eureka moment.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.404
Now, not being able to see meant, of course,

00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:09.595
that you taught yourself.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:10.919
Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.216
AO: You did teach yourself to play,

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:14.747
and as a consequence,

00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:15.798
playing the piano for you, Derek,

00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:18.275
was a lot of knuckles and karate chops,

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:20.731
and even a bit of nose going on in there.

00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:24.059
And now, here's what Nanny did also do

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.381
was to press the record button on one of those little

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.939
early tape recorders that they had,

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.042
and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:33.454
when you were four years old.

00:02:33.454 --> 00:02:36.152
DP: "Molly Malone (Cockles and Mussels)."

00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:37.214
AO: It wasn't actually "Cockles and Mussels."

00:02:37.214 --> 00:02:39.364
This one is "English Country Garden."

00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:41.629
DP: "English Country Garden."

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:49.888
(Music: "English Country Garden")

00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:20.319
AO: There you are.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.477
(Applause)

00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:29.383
I think that's just fantastic.

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:31.113
You know, there's this little child who can't see,

00:03:31.113 --> 00:03:33.320
can't really understand much about the world,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.026
has no one in the family who plays an instrument,

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:38.327
and yet he taught himself to play that.

00:03:38.327 --> 00:03:39.559
And as you can see from the picture,

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.918
there was quite a lot of body action going on

00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:43.719
while you were playing, Derek.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.289
Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old,

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:52.107
and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest,

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.921
because when you played the piano,

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.838
you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard,

00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:58.246
and also you had this little habit

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.429
of hitting me out of the way.

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.235
So as soon as I tried to get near the piano,

00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:04.383
I was firmly shoved off.

00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:07.067
And having said to your dad, Nic,

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.562
that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused

00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:11.149
as to how I might go about that

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.550
if I wasn't allowed near the piano.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.727
But after a while, I thought, well, the only way

00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:19.828
is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room,

00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:22.972
and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back,

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:25.149
I could just play something very quickly

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.141
for him to learn.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:28.543
And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed

00:04:28.543 --> 00:04:32.523
that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.

00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:35.348
As you can see, there's me in my early,

00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:37.587
pre-marriage days with a brown beard,

00:04:37.587 --> 00:04:41.233
and little Derek concentrating there.

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:43.777
I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.

00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:45.079
(Laughter)

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:49.300
Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.352
had taken the world by storm.

00:04:51.352 --> 00:04:54.370
This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.081
with the Royal Philharmonic Pops.

00:04:56.081 --> 00:05:00.650
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.791
And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much,

00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:05.102
and so there was always a moment of tension

00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:08.063
as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:10.574
and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key,

00:05:10.574 --> 00:05:12.033
and all that kind of thing.

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:14.858
But the orchestra were wowed as well,

00:05:14.858 --> 00:05:18.715
and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:22.052
to play these fantastic pieces.

00:05:22.052 --> 00:05:25.114
Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek?

00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:27.685
And hopefully we can show the audience now

00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:30.737
how it is you do what you do.

00:05:30.737 --> 00:05:32.570
I think that one of the first things that happened

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.847
when you were very little, Derek,

00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:36.183
was that by the time you were two,

00:05:36.183 --> 00:05:41.162
your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.

00:05:41.162 --> 00:05:43.960
And so whenever you heard any note at all --

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.864
if I just play a random note --

00:05:45.864 --> 00:05:48.277
(Piano notes) --

00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:50.183
you knew instantly what it was,

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:54.421
and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.009
Now that's called perfect pitch,

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.246
and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:00.396
in the middle of the piano.

00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:06.424
(Piano notes)

00:06:06.424 --> 00:06:09.850
You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.398
(Applause)

00:06:13.398 --> 00:06:16.424
But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.

00:06:16.424 --> 00:06:17.851
If I just put the microphone down for a bit,

00:06:17.851 --> 00:06:20.571
I'm going to play a cluster of notes.

00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:22.887
Those of you who can see will know how many notes,

00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:23.896
but Derek, of course, can't.

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:26.798
Not only can you say how many notes,

00:06:26.798 --> 00:06:32.222
it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.

00:06:32.222 --> 00:06:39.300
(Chords)

00:06:42.103 --> 00:06:44.921
Well, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic.

00:06:44.921 --> 00:06:49.866
And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds,

00:06:49.866 --> 00:06:52.188
not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing,

00:06:52.188 --> 00:06:54.096
Derek, you can hear every note,

00:06:54.096 --> 00:06:57.352
and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice,

00:06:57.352 --> 00:06:59.310
reproduce those on the keyboard,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.577
that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability.

00:07:03.577 --> 00:07:06.180
Now then.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.748
It's no use having that kind of raw ability

00:07:09.748 --> 00:07:11.509
without the technique,

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:13.431
and luckily, Derek, you decided that,

00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:16.053
once we did start learning, you'd let me help you

00:07:16.053 --> 00:07:17.692
learn all the scale fingerings.

00:07:17.692 --> 00:07:20.639
So for example using your thumb under with C major.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.752
(Piano notes)

00:07:25.752 --> 00:07:29.766
Etc.

00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:35.521
And in the end, you got so quick,

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.395
that things like "Flight of the Bumblebee"

00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:38.625
were no problem, were they?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:39.903
DP: No.

00:07:39.903 --> 00:07:42.532
AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11,

00:07:42.532 --> 00:07:44.504
Derek was playing things like this.

00:07:44.504 --> 00:07:47.586
DP: This.

00:07:47.586 --> 00:08:01.259
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

00:08:55.792 --> 00:08:57.358
(Applause)

00:08:57.358 --> 00:08:59.834
AO: Derek, let's have a bow.

00:09:11.408 --> 00:09:15.480
Well done.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.403
Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek,

00:09:19.403 --> 00:09:21.638
you could not only play "Flight of the Bumblebee"

00:09:21.638 --> 00:09:24.304
in the usual key, but any note I play,

00:09:24.304 --> 00:09:26.297
Derek can play it on.

00:09:26.297 --> 00:09:28.765
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.

00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:30.580
(Piano notes)

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.184
Can you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note?

00:09:32.184 --> 00:09:34.488
DP: "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note.

00:09:34.488 --> 00:09:38.853
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

00:09:40.178 --> 00:09:44.251
AO: Or another one? How about in G minor?

00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.522
DP: G minor.

00:09:46.522 --> 00:09:51.833
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:54.117
AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.

00:09:54.117 --> 00:09:57.899
So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:01.598
that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate,

00:10:01.598 --> 00:10:03.770
all the pieces in the world that are out there.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.197
Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said,

00:10:06.197 --> 00:10:08.014
"Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee'

00:10:08.014 --> 00:10:11.244
in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:14.665
In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra,

00:10:14.665 --> 00:10:16.754
you'd learned the version that you'd learned,

00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:18.983
and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version,

00:10:18.983 --> 00:10:21.461
so while we were waiting in the two hours

00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:23.463
before the rehearsal and the concert,

00:10:23.463 --> 00:10:25.703
Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly

00:10:25.703 --> 00:10:28.180
and then was able to play it with the orchestra.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.640
Fantastic chap.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.099
The other wonderful thing about you is memory.

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:36.935
DP: Memory.
AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do,

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:39.765
we ask the audience to participate, of course,

00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:43.529
by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:45.051
And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave

00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:47.276
because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"

00:10:47.276 --> 00:10:48.288
And I say, "No, it's not brave at all,

00:10:48.288 --> 00:10:50.940
because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.541
you're invited to come and sing it first,

00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:55.027
and then he'll pick it up." (Laughter)

00:10:55.027 --> 00:10:59.742
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.459
But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:07.392
DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose?
AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out.

00:11:07.392 --> 00:11:10.213
Would you like to hear me play?

00:11:10.213 --> 00:11:11.427
(Audience: "Theme of Paganini.")

00:11:11.427 --> 00:11:14.389
AO: Paganini.
DP: "The Theme of Paganini."

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:16.227
(Laughter)

00:11:16.227 --> 00:11:38.138
(Music: "Theme of Paganini")

00:12:51.178 --> 00:13:02.409
(Applause)

00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:08.223
AO: Well done.

00:13:08.223 --> 00:13:10.897
Derek's going to L.A. soon,

00:13:10.897 --> 00:13:14.119
and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I

00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:17.490
will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together,

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.117
which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?

00:13:20.117 --> 00:13:23.468
DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes.

00:13:23.468 --> 00:13:25.930
AO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking,

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.448
but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then.

00:13:28.448 --> 00:13:30.560
(Laughter)

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.434
But in America, they've coined this term,

00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:34.044
"the human iPod" for Derek,

00:13:34.044 --> 00:13:36.400
which I think is just missing the point, really,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.477
because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod.

00:13:39.477 --> 00:13:42.264
You're a fantastic, creative musician,

00:13:42.264 --> 00:13:45.215
and I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really,

00:13:45.215 --> 00:13:47.412
than when we went to Slovenia,

00:13:47.412 --> 00:13:52.809
and someone -- in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in,

00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:56.463
and this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage.

00:13:56.463 --> 00:13:58.998
DP: He played "Chopsticks."
AO: And played "Chopsticks."

00:13:58.998 --> 00:14:00.489
DP: "Chopsticks."

00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:03.853
AO: A bit like this.
DP: Like this. Yes.

00:14:03.853 --> 00:14:04.791
(Piano notes)

00:14:04.791 --> 00:14:06.471
AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.695
He's sitting there.

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:10.973
DP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this.
AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.

00:14:10.973 --> 00:14:12.229
(Music: "Chopsticks")

00:14:12.229 --> 00:14:14.491
DP: Let Derek play it.

00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:16.064
AO: What did you do with it, Derek?

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:17.805
DP: I got to improvise with it, Adam.

00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:21.372
AO: This is Derek the musician.

00:14:21.372 --> 00:14:29.484
(Music: "Chopsticks" improvisation)

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.860
(Applause)

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.636
(Music) (Clapping)

00:15:23.636 --> 00:15:25.777
Keep up with Derek.

00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:33.274
(Music)

00:16:20.017 --> 00:16:26.589
(Applause)

00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:44.579
The TED people will kill me,

00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:46.635
but perhaps there's time for one encore.

00:16:46.635 --> 00:16:50.460
DP: For one encore.
AO: One encore, yes.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.515
So this is one of Derek's heroes.

00:16:52.515 --> 00:16:54.687
It's the great Art Tatum --
DP: Art Tatum.

00:16:54.687 --> 00:16:56.713
AO: -- who also was a pianist who couldn't see,

00:16:56.713 --> 00:16:57.870
and also, I think, like Derek,

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.379
thought that all the world was a piano,

00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:01.339
so whenever Art Tatum plays something,

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:03.974
it sounds like there's three pianos in the room.

00:17:03.974 --> 00:17:09.798
And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on "Tiger Rag."

00:17:09.798 --> 00:17:13.534
DP: "Tiger Rag."

00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:32.702
(Music: "Tiger Rag")

00:19:03.869 --> 00:19:07.869
(Applause)
