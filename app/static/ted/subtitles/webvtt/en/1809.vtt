00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.008
Hi. I am an architect.

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.456
I am the only architect in the world

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:07.772
making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,

00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:10.338
and this exhibition is the first one I did

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:11.846
using paper tubes.

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:16.271
1986, much, much longer before people started talking

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:20.474
about ecological issues and environmental issues,

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:23.764
I just started testing the paper tube

00:00:23.764 --> 00:00:26.499
in order to use this as a building structure.

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.652
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building,

00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:34.150
but this is much stronger than I expected,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.362
and also it's very easy to waterproof,

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.257
and also, because it's industrial material,

00:00:38.257 --> 00:00:40.960
it's also possible to fireproof.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.793
Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.

00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:47.800
This is the first temporary building made out of paper.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.870
There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters],

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.512
there are only 12 tubes with a diameter

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:56.282
of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.

00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:58.902
As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.

00:00:58.902 --> 00:01:01.553
In case you're finished with toilet paper,

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:03.873
you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter)

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:06.265
So it's very useful.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:10.304
Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.923
I was asked to design the building,

00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:15.717
because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:20.205
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes,

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.932
recyclable paper.

00:01:21.932 --> 00:01:24.902
My goal of the design is not when it's completed.

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:26.986
My goal was when the building was demolished,

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.962
because each country makes a lot of pavilions

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:34.062
but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste,

00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:38.743
so my building has to be reused or recycled.

00:01:38.743 --> 00:01:40.846
After, the building was recycled.

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:43.492
So that was the goal of my design.

00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:46.580
Then I was very lucky to win the competition

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.238
to build the second Pompidou Center in France

00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:50.713
in the city of Metz.

00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:52.209
Because I was so poor,

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.376
I wanted to rent an office in Paris,

00:01:54.376 --> 00:01:55.893
but I couldn't afford it,

00:01:55.893 --> 00:01:57.934
so I decided to bring my students to Paris

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:01.450
to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.685
by ourselves.

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:06.014
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints

00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:10.099
to complete the 35-meter-long office.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.133
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:17.004
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.391
Thank you. I had one big problem.

00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:21.745
Because we were part of the exhibition,

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:25.049
even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.252
That was the problem.

00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:30.020
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.974
It's a very popular museum now,

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:35.140
and I created a big monument for the government.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.039
But then I was very disappointed

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.635
at my profession as an architect,

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:43.663
because we are not helping, we are not working for society,

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.907
but we are working for privileged people,

00:02:46.907 --> 00:02:50.099
rich people, government, developers.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.619
They have money and power.

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.416
Those are invisible.

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:58.244
So they hire us to visualize their power and money

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.462
by making monumental architecture.

00:03:00.477 --> 00:03:02.642
That is our profession, even historically it's the same,

00:03:02.642 --> 00:03:04.994
even now we are doing the same.

00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:08.318
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society,

00:03:08.318 --> 00:03:12.305
even though there are so many people

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.212
who lost their houses by natural disasters.

00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:18.255
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:21.240
For example, earthquakes never kill people,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.413
but collapse of the buildings kill people.

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:25.453
That's the responsibility of architects.

00:03:25.453 --> 00:03:27.190
Then people need some temporary housing,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.852
but there are no architects working there

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:32.512
because we are too busy working for privileged people.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:36.391
So I thought, even as architects,

00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:41.147
we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.

00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:42.939
We can make it better.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.972
So that is why I started working in disaster areas.

00:03:46.972 --> 00:03:50.698
1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.

00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:53.430
Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.928
Over two million people became refugees.

00:03:55.928 --> 00:03:59.679
But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.913
organized by the U.N.

00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:05.207
They're so poor, and they are freezing

00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:07.330
with blankets during the rainy season,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.085
In the shelters built by the U.N.,

00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:12.391
they were just providing a plastic sheet,

00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:16.540
and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.306
But over two million people cut trees.

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:21.097
It just became big, heavy deforestation

00:04:21.097 --> 00:04:22.830
and an environmental problem.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.060
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.347
Very expensive, they throw them out for money,

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:30.273
then cutting trees again.

00:04:30.273 --> 00:04:34.294
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:36.454
using these recycled paper tubes

00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:39.387
because this is so cheap and also so strong,

00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:42.134
but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.

00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:45.095
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test

00:04:45.095 --> 00:04:50.801
for the durability and moisture and termites, so on.

00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:55.381
And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan,

00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:57.174
we had a big earthquake.

00:04:57.174 --> 00:04:59.686
Nearly 7,000 people were killed,

00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:02.677
and the city like this Nagata district,

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.995
all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.

00:05:05.995 --> 00:05:09.936
And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees

00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:12.531
suffering and gathering at a Catholic church --

00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:14.450
all the building was totally destroyed.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.951
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests,

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.569
"Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.709
And he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:25.818
After a fire, what are you proposing?"

00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:29.446
So he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:31.328
I started commuting to Kobe,

00:05:31.328 --> 00:05:33.957
and I met the society of Vietnamese people.

00:05:33.957 --> 00:05:36.624
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets

00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:37.905
in the park.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:41.147
So I proposed to rebuild. I raised -- did fundraising.

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:43.703
I made a paper tube shelter for them,

00:05:43.703 --> 00:05:46.661
and in order to make it easy to be built by students

00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:48.244
and also easy to demolish,

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:51.453
I used beer crates as a foundation.

00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:54.043
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose,

00:05:54.043 --> 00:05:56.763
because at that time, the Asahi beer company

00:05:56.763 --> 00:05:58.775
made their plastic beer crates red,

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.189
which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.507
The color coordination is very important.

00:06:03.507 --> 00:06:06.700
And also I still remember, we were expecting

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.055
to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate,

00:06:09.055 --> 00:06:10.949
but it came empty. (Laughter)

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.341
So I remember it was so disappointing.

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.579
So during the summer with my students,

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:18.765
we built over 50 units of the shelters.

00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:21.536
Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.

00:06:21.536 --> 00:06:23.827
He said, "As long as you collect money by yourself,

00:06:23.827 --> 00:06:26.081
bring your students to build, you can do it."

00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:28.564
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.

00:06:28.564 --> 00:06:32.062
It was meant to stay there for three years,

00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:35.360
but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.169
Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake,

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.119
and we proposed to donate this church,

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:44.720
so we dismantled them,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.965
we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:50.589
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:53.080
So this building became a permanent building.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.729
Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.662
Even a building made in paper

00:06:59.662 --> 00:07:03.192
can be permanent as long as people love it.

00:07:03.192 --> 00:07:05.488
Even a concrete building can be very temporary

00:07:05.488 --> 00:07:07.505
if that is made to make money.

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:10.215
In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake,

00:07:10.215 --> 00:07:14.365
I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.

00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:18.219
2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:22.300
In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.981
and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.

00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:31.432
And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China,

00:07:31.432 --> 00:07:34.358
nearly 70,000 people were killed,

00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:37.443
and also especially many of the schools were destroyed

00:07:37.443 --> 00:07:40.893
because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:43.861
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:47.647
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.

00:07:47.647 --> 00:07:50.508
In one month, we completed nine classrooms,

00:07:50.508 --> 00:07:52.160
over 500 square meters.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.632
It's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.

00:07:56.632 --> 00:08:02.096
In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.

00:08:02.096 --> 00:08:04.448
And this is a very interesting photo:

00:08:04.448 --> 00:08:07.165
former Prime Minister Berlusconi

00:08:07.165 --> 00:08:11.583
and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso --

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:15.464
you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.

00:08:15.464 --> 00:08:20.426
And they are very kind, affording my model.

00:08:20.426 --> 00:08:24.825
I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall,

00:08:24.825 --> 00:08:27.269
because L'Aquila is very famous for music

00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:28.694
and all the concert halls were destroyed,

00:08:28.694 --> 00:08:30.826
so musicians were moving out.

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:32.253
So I proposed to the mayor,

00:08:32.253 --> 00:08:34.488
I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.

00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:37.434
He said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it."

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:38.617
And I was very lucky.

00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:40.918
Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit,

00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:43.024
and our former prime minister came,

00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:46.229
so they helped us to collect money,

00:08:46.229 --> 00:08:49.072
and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government

00:08:49.072 --> 00:08:51.959
to rebuild this temporary auditorium.

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:56.679
Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake,

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:58.270
but it's impossible to fly over,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.287
so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country,

00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:04.202
to drive six hours to get to Haiti

00:09:04.202 --> 00:09:07.493
with the local students in Santo Domingo

00:09:07.493 --> 00:09:10.946
to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.

00:09:10.946 --> 00:09:14.559
This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:16.434
After the earthquake and tsunami,

00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:20.221
people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.

00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:22.122
But look at this. There's no privacy.

00:09:22.122 --> 00:09:24.989
People suffer mentally and physically.

00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:28.380
So we went there to build partitions

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.643
with all the student volunteers with paper tubes,

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:35.874
just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.

00:09:35.874 --> 00:09:38.390
However, some of the facility authority

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.437
doesn't want us to do it, because, they said,

00:09:40.437 --> 00:09:43.634
simply, it's become more difficult to control them.

00:09:43.634 --> 00:09:46.116
But it's really necessary to do it.

00:09:46.116 --> 00:09:48.621
They don't have enough flat area to build

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:51.906
standard government single-story housing like this one.

00:09:51.906 --> 00:09:54.156
Look at this. Even civil government is doing

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:58.285
such poor construction of the temporary housing,

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:04.816
so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking,

00:10:04.816 --> 00:10:08.085
so I thought, we have to make multi-story building

00:10:08.085 --> 00:10:11.110
because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:16.040
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.671
Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village

00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:20.991
in Miyagi.

00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:25.377
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].

00:10:25.377 --> 00:10:28.103
I used the shipping container

00:10:28.103 --> 00:10:30.556
and also the students helped us to make

00:10:30.556 --> 00:10:33.354
all the building furniture

00:10:33.354 --> 00:10:35.046
to make them comfortable,

00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:37.321
within the budget of the government

00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:41.230
but also the area of the house is exactly the same,

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.370
but much more comfortable.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.502
Many of the people want to stay here forever.

00:10:45.502 --> 00:10:48.064
I was very happy to hear that.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:52.001
Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:55.848
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened,

00:10:55.848 --> 00:10:57.353
also they had a big earthquake,

00:10:57.353 --> 00:10:59.914
and many Japanese students were also killed,

00:10:59.914 --> 00:11:02.233
and the most important cathedral of the city,

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:05.004
the symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.

00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:09.102
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:11.389
So this is under construction.

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:14.729
And I'd like to keep building monuments

00:11:14.729 --> 00:11:16.959
that are beloved by people.

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:18.398
Thank you very much.

00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:20.334
(Applause)

00:11:20.334 --> 00:11:23.067
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:23.067 --> 00:11:25.824
Thank you very much. (Applause)
