00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:04.833
What I'd like to do today is talk
about one of my favorite subjects,

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:07.759
and that is the neuroscience of sleep.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:11.096
Now, there is a sound --

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.126
(Alarm clock)

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.166
Ah, it worked!

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.768
A sound that is desperately
familiar to most of us,

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:21.132
and of course it's the sound
of the alarm clock.

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:24.323
And what that truly ghastly,
awful sound does

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:29.714
is stop the single most important
behavioral experience

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.708
that we have, and that's sleep.

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:35.986
If you're an average sort of person,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.409
36 percent of your life
will be spent asleep,

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.644
which means that if you live to 90,

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:48.240
then 32 years will have
been spent entirely asleep.

00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:54.186
Now what that 32 years is telling us
is that sleep at some level is important.

00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:57.812
And yet, for most of us,
we don't give sleep a second thought.

00:00:57.836 --> 00:00:59.645
We throw it away.

00:00:59.669 --> 00:01:02.216
We really just don't think about sleep.

00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:06.516
And so what I'd like to do today
is change your views,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.715
change your ideas
and your thoughts about sleep.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.106
And the journey
that I want to take you on,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.548
we need to start by going back in time.

00:01:16.706 --> 00:01:20.291
"Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.585
Any ideas who said that?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.975
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.999
Yes, let me give you a few more quotes.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:34.571
"O sleep, O gentle sleep,
nature's soft nurse,

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:35.920
how have I frighted thee?"

00:01:35.944 --> 00:01:38.517
Shakespeare again, from --
I won't say it --

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:39.915
the Scottish play.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.190
(Laughter)

00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:43.807
From the same time:

00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:48.036
"Sleep is the golden chain
that ties health and our bodies together."

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.239
Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,
another Elizabethan dramatist.

00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:55.654
But if we jump forward 400 years,

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:59.019
the tone about sleep changes somewhat.

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:02.214
This is from Thomas Edison,
from the beginning of the 20th century:

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:05.874
"Sleep is a criminal waste of time
and a heritage from our cave days."

00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:07.081
Bang!

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:09.146
(Laughter)

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:14.765
And if we also jump into the 1980s,
some of you may remember

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.139
that Margaret Thatcher
was reported to have said,

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:18.604
"Sleep is for wimps."

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:21.499
And of course the infamous --
what was his name? --

00:02:21.523 --> 00:02:23.961
the infamous Gordon Gekko
from "Wall Street" said,

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:25.885
"Money never sleeps."

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.116
What do we do in the 20th
century about sleep?

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.481
Well, of course, we use
Thomas Edison's light bulb

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:35.327
to invade the night,
and we occupied the dark,

00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:38.112
and in the process of this occupation,

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:40.717
we've treated sleep as an illness, almost.

00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:43.116
We've treated it as an enemy.

00:02:43.677 --> 00:02:49.044
At most now, I suppose,
we tolerate the need for sleep,

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.235
and at worst perhaps
many of us think of sleep

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.223
as an illness that needs
some sort of a cure.

00:02:54.247 --> 00:02:57.556
And our ignorance about sleep
is really quite profound.

00:02:58.307 --> 00:03:01.644
Why is it? Why do we abandon
sleep in our thoughts?

00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:05.571
Well, it's because you don't do anything
much while you're asleep, it seems.

00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.012
You don't eat. You don't drink.

00:03:09.513 --> 00:03:10.790
And you don't have sex.

00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:12.218
Well, most of us anyway.

00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:14.046
And so, therefore it's --

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.228
Sorry.

00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:18.268
It's a complete waste of time, right?

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:19.665
Wrong.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.488
Actually, sleep is an incredibly
important part of our biology,

00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:26.056
and neuroscientists
are beginning to explain

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.126
why it's so very important.

00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:30.447
So let's move to the brain.

00:03:31.383 --> 00:03:34.774
Now, here we have a brain.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.961
This is donated by a social scientist,

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:43.580
and they said they didn't know what
it was or indeed, how to use it, so --

00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:46.558
(Laughter)

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:47.743
Sorry.

00:03:48.714 --> 00:03:50.294
So I borrowed it.

00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:52.006
I don't think they noticed. OK.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.594
(Laughter)

00:03:54.618 --> 00:03:57.791
The point I'm trying to make
is that when you're asleep,

00:03:57.815 --> 00:03:59.559
this thing doesn't shut down.

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.265
In fact, some areas of the brain
are actually more active

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:04.656
during the sleep state
than during the wake state.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.845
The other thing that's really
important about sleep

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.995
is that it doesn't arise from a single
structure within the brain,

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.176
but is to some extent a network property.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.632
If we flip the brain on its back --

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.644
I love this little bit
of spinal cord here --

00:04:18.668 --> 00:04:21.573
this bit here is the hypothalamus,

00:04:21.597 --> 00:04:25.411
and right under there is a whole raft
of interesting structures,

00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:27.016
not least the biological clock.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.655
The biological clock tells us
when it's good to be up,

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:31.227
when it's good to be asleep,

00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:33.179
and what that structure does is interact

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:36.421
with a whole raft of other areas
within the hypothalamus,

00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:39.265
the lateral hypothalamus,
the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.653
All of those combine,

00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:43.864
and they send projections
down to the brain stem here.

00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:46.865
The brain stem then projects forward

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.934
and bathes the cortex,
this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.392
with neurotransmitters that keep us awake

00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:56.030
and essentially provide us
with our consciousness.

00:04:56.054 --> 00:04:58.770
So sleep arises from a whole raft

00:04:58.794 --> 00:05:00.873
of different interactions
within the brain,

00:05:00.897 --> 00:05:03.066
and essentially,
sleep is turned on and off

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.638
as a result of a range
of interactions in here.

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:07.900
OK. So where have we got to?

00:05:07.924 --> 00:05:11.450
We've said that sleep is complicated

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:16.164
and it takes 32 years of our life.

00:05:16.188 --> 00:05:19.227
But what I haven't explained
is what sleep is about.

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:21.377
So why do we sleep?

00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.695
And it won't surprise
any of you that, of course,

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:25.687
as scientists, we don't have a consensus.

00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:28.985
There are dozens of different ideas
about why we sleep,

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.993
and I'm going to outline three of those.

00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:34.216
The first is sort of the restoration idea,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.086
and it's somewhat intuitive.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.876
Essentially, all the stuff
we've burned up during the day,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.136
we restore, we replace,
we rebuild during the night.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.612
And indeed, as an explanation,
it goes back to Aristotle,

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:47.813
so that's what -- 2,300 years ago.

00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:49.434
It's gone in and out of fashion.

00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:50.903
It's fashionable at the moment

00:05:50.927 --> 00:05:53.320
because what's been shown
is that within the brain,

00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:57.986
a whole raft of genes have been shown
to be turned on only during sleep,

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.309
and those genes are associated
with restoration and metabolic pathways.

00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:05.864
So there's good evidence
for the whole restoration hypothesis.

00:06:06.436 --> 00:06:08.404
What about energy conservation?

00:06:08.428 --> 00:06:11.223
Again, perhaps intuitive.

00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:14.051
You essentially sleep to save calories.

00:06:14.488 --> 00:06:17.934
Now, when you do the sums,
though, it doesn't really pan out.

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:22.278
If you compare an individual
who has slept at night,

00:06:22.302 --> 00:06:26.009
or stayed awake
and hasn't moved very much,

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:30.577
the energy saving of sleeping
is about 110 calories a night.

00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:33.216
Now, that's the equivalent
of a hot dog bun.

00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:37.494
Now, I would say that a hot dog bun

00:06:37.518 --> 00:06:39.311
is kind of a meager return

00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:42.066
for such a complicated
and demanding behavior as sleep.

00:06:42.454 --> 00:06:45.683
So I'm less convinced
by the energy conservation idea.

00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:48.597
But the third idea I'm quite attracted to,

00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:52.076
which is brain processing
and memory consolidation.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.978
What we know is that,
if after you've tried to learn a task,

00:06:56.002 --> 00:06:57.812
and you sleep-deprive individuals,

00:06:57.836 --> 00:07:00.377
the ability to learn that task is smashed.

00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:03.457
It's really hugely attenuated.

00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:06.521
So sleep and memory consolidation
is also very important.

00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:09.046
However, it's not just
the laying down of memory

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.640
and recalling it.

00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:13.000
What's turned out to be really exciting

00:07:13.024 --> 00:07:17.563
is that our ability to come up
with novel solutions to complex problems

00:07:17.587 --> 00:07:20.005
is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.432
In fact, it's been estimated
to give us a threefold advantage.

00:07:23.456 --> 00:07:26.099
Sleeping at night enhances our creativity.

00:07:26.123 --> 00:07:28.979
And what seems to be going on
is that, in the brain,

00:07:29.003 --> 00:07:31.556
those neural connections
that are important,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.757
those synaptic connections
that are important,

00:07:33.781 --> 00:07:35.288
are linked and strengthened,

00:07:35.312 --> 00:07:39.640
while those that are less important
tend to fade away and be less important.

00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:41.369
OK.

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:44.408
So we've had three explanations
for why we might sleep,

00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:48.086
and I think the important thing to realize
is that the details will vary,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.211
and it's probable we sleep
for multiple different reasons.

00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:54.361
But sleep is not an indulgence.

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:59.016
It's not some sort of thing that we can
take on board rather casually.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.883
I think that sleep was once
likened to an upgrade

00:08:02.907 --> 00:08:05.931
from economy to business class,
you know, the equivalent of.

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:09.352
It's not even an upgrade
from economy to first class.

00:08:09.748 --> 00:08:14.865
The critical thing to realize is that
if you don't sleep,

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:16.236
you don't fly.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.907
Essentially, you never get there.

00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:21.518
And what's extraordinary
about much of our society these days

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.591
is that we are desperately sleep-deprived.

00:08:24.615 --> 00:08:26.655
So let's now look at sleep deprivation.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.988
Huge sectors of society
are sleep-deprived,

00:08:30.012 --> 00:08:32.296
and let's look at our sleep-o-meter.

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:36.101
So in the 1950s, good data
suggests that most of us

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:38.713
were getting around eight hours
of sleep a night.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.344
Nowadays, we sleep one and a half
to two hours less every night,

00:08:43.368 --> 00:08:46.843
so we're in the six-and-a-half-hours
every-night league.

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:50.620
For teenagers, it's worse, much worse.

00:08:50.644 --> 00:08:53.602
They need nine hours
for full brain performance,

00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:57.269
and many of them, on a school night,
are only getting five hours of sleep.

00:08:57.293 --> 00:08:58.921
It's simply not enough.

00:08:58.945 --> 00:09:01.989
If we think about other sectors
of society -- the aged;

00:09:02.013 --> 00:09:06.428
if you are aged, then your ability
to sleep in a single block

00:09:06.452 --> 00:09:09.016
is somewhat disrupted,
and many sleep, again,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.452
less than five hours a night.

00:09:10.792 --> 00:09:11.949
Shift work.

00:09:11.973 --> 00:09:13.504
Shift work is extraordinary,

00:09:13.528 --> 00:09:16.012
perhaps 20 percent
of the working population,

00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:20.006
and the body clock does not shift
to the demands of working at night.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.200
It's locked onto the same
light-dark cycle as the rest of us.

00:09:23.224 --> 00:09:25.435
So when the poor old
shift worker is going home

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:27.936
to try and sleep during the day,
desperately tired,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.076
the body clock is saying,
"Wake up. This is the time to be awake."

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.156
So the quality of sleep
that you get as a night shift worker

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.136
is usually very poor,
again in that sort of five-hour region.

00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:41.076
And then, of course, tens of millions
of people suffer from jet lag.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.468
So who here has jet lag?

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:46.341
Well, my goodness gracious.

00:09:46.365 --> 00:09:49.171
Well, thank you very much
indeed for not falling asleep,

00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:51.869
because that's what your brain is craving.

00:09:51.893 --> 00:09:57.207
One of the things that the brain does
is indulge in micro-sleeps,

00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:58.976
this involuntary falling asleep,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.213
and you have essentially
no control over it.

00:10:01.237 --> 00:10:03.996
Now, micro-sleeps can be sort
of somewhat embarrassing,

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.996
but they can also be deadly.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.675
It's been estimated
that 31 percent of drivers

00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:13.981
will fall asleep at the wheel
at least once in their life,

00:10:14.005 --> 00:10:16.171
and in the US, the statistics
are pretty good:

00:10:16.195 --> 00:10:21.392
100,000 accidents on the freeway
have been associated with tiredness,

00:10:21.416 --> 00:10:24.580
loss of vigilance, and falling asleep --
a hundred thousand a year.

00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:25.762
It's extraordinary.

00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:27.851
At another level of terror,

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:31.453
we dip into the tragic
accidents at Chernobyl

00:10:31.477 --> 00:10:33.600
and indeed the space shuttle Challenger,

00:10:33.624 --> 00:10:35.553
which was so tragically lost.

00:10:35.577 --> 00:10:38.978
And in the investigations
that followed those disasters,

00:10:39.002 --> 00:10:41.996
poor judgment as a result
of extended shift work

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.302
and loss of vigilance and tiredness

00:10:44.326 --> 00:10:48.240
was attributed to a big chunk
of those disasters.

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:52.487
When you're tired and you lack sleep,

00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:56.132
you have poor memory,
you have poor creativity,

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.263
you have increased impulsiveness,

00:10:58.287 --> 00:11:00.890
and you have overall poor judgment.

00:11:00.914 --> 00:11:04.001
But my friends,
it's so much worse than that.

00:11:04.025 --> 00:11:06.072
(Laughter)

00:11:06.096 --> 00:11:08.056
If you are a tired brain,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.016
the brain is craving things to wake it up.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.206
So drugs, stimulants.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.900
Caffeine represents
the stimulant of choice

00:11:16.924 --> 00:11:18.504
across much of the Western world.

00:11:18.528 --> 00:11:20.551
Much of the day is fueled by caffeine,

00:11:20.575 --> 00:11:23.589
and if you're a really naughty
tired brain, nicotine.

00:11:23.613 --> 00:11:26.906
Of course, you're fueling the waking state
with these stimulants,

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.366
and then, of course, it gets
to 11 o'clock at night,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.778
and the brain says to itself,

00:11:30.802 --> 00:11:32.964
"Actually, I need
to be asleep fairly shortly.

00:11:32.988 --> 00:11:35.857
What do we do about that
when I'm feeling completely wired?"

00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:38.167
Well, of course,
you then resort to alcohol.

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:41.996
Now alcohol, short-term,
you know, once or twice,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.771
to use to mildly sedate you,
can be very useful.

00:11:44.795 --> 00:11:47.651
It can actually ease the sleep transition.

00:11:47.675 --> 00:11:52.923
But what you must be so aware of
is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.

00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:54.414
A biological mimic for sleep,

00:11:54.438 --> 00:11:55.645
it sedates you.

00:11:55.669 --> 00:11:59.034
So it actually harms
some of the neural processing

00:11:59.058 --> 00:12:01.986
that's going on during memory
consolidation and memory recall.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.174
So it's a short-term acute measure,

00:12:04.198 --> 00:12:05.356
but for goodness sake,

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.390
don't become addicted to alcohol

00:12:07.414 --> 00:12:09.483
as a way of getting to sleep every night.

00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:13.620
Another connection
between loss of sleep is weight gain.

00:12:13.644 --> 00:12:17.239
If you sleep around
about five hours or less every night,

00:12:17.263 --> 00:12:21.108
then you have a 50 percent
likelihood of being obese.

00:12:21.132 --> 00:12:22.855
What's the connection here?

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:27.243
Well, sleep loss seems to give rise
to the release of the hormone ghrelin,

00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:28.424
the hunger hormone.

00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:29.600
Ghrelin is released.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.035
It gets to the brain.

00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:33.842
The brain says, "I need carbohydrates,"

00:12:33.866 --> 00:12:37.469
and what it does is seek out carbohydrates
and particularly sugars.

00:12:37.493 --> 00:12:40.184
So there's a link between tiredness

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:43.778
and the metabolic predisposition
for weight gain: stress.

00:12:43.802 --> 00:12:46.080
Tired people are massively stressed.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.159
And one of the things of stress,
of course, is loss of memory,

00:12:50.183 --> 00:12:54.026
which is what I sort of just then
had a little lapse of.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.121
But stress is so much more.

00:12:57.145 --> 00:13:00.295
So, if you're acutely stressed,
not a great problem,

00:13:00.319 --> 00:13:04.094
but it's sustained stress associated
with sleep loss that's the problem.

00:13:04.118 --> 00:13:08.195
Sustained stress leads
to suppressed immunity.

00:13:08.219 --> 00:13:11.782
And so, tired people tend to have
higher rates of overall infection,

00:13:11.806 --> 00:13:13.458
and there's some very good studies

00:13:13.482 --> 00:13:16.884
showing that shift workers, for example,
have higher rates of cancer.

00:13:16.908 --> 00:13:20.732
Increased levels of stress
throw glucose into the circulation.

00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:24.774
Glucose becomes a dominant part
of the vasculature

00:13:24.798 --> 00:13:27.266
and essentially you become
glucose intolerant.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.213
Therefore, diabetes 2.

00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:35.491
Stress increases cardiovascular disease
as a result of raising blood pressure.

00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:38.808
So there's a whole raft of things
associated with sleep loss

00:13:38.832 --> 00:13:42.455
that are more than just
a mildly impaired brain,

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:45.589
which is where I think most people think
that sleep loss resides.

00:13:45.613 --> 00:13:48.996
So at this point in the talk,
this is a nice time to think,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.210
"Well, do you think on the whole
I'm getting enough sleep?"

00:13:52.234 --> 00:13:53.988
So a quick show of hands.

00:13:54.012 --> 00:13:56.598
Who feels that they're getting
enough sleep here?

00:13:57.067 --> 00:13:59.512
Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive.

00:13:59.536 --> 00:14:02.615
Good. We'll talk more about that later,
about what are your tips.

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:05.035
So most of us, of course,
ask the question,

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:07.366
"How do I know whether
I'm getting enough sleep?"

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.826
Well, it's not rocket science.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.912
If you need an alarm clock to get
you out of bed in the morning,

00:14:11.936 --> 00:14:13.973
if you are taking a long time to get up,

00:14:13.997 --> 00:14:15.528
if you need lots of stimulants,

00:14:15.552 --> 00:14:17.496
if you're grumpy, if you're irritable,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.318
if you're told by your work colleagues
that you're looking tired and irritable,

00:14:21.342 --> 00:14:23.667
chances are you are sleep-deprived.

00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:25.800
Listen to them. Listen to yourself.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:27.267
What do you do?

00:14:27.291 --> 00:14:29.324
Well -- and this is slightly offensive --

00:14:29.348 --> 00:14:30.505
sleep for dummies.

00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:32.649
(Laughter)

00:14:32.673 --> 00:14:35.458
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.

00:14:35.482 --> 00:14:38.986
The first critical thing is make it
as dark as you possibly can,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.851
and also make it slightly cool.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.027
Very important.

00:14:42.051 --> 00:14:44.957
Actually, reduce your amount
of light exposure

00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:47.330
at least half an hour
before you go to bed.

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:50.107
Light increases levels of alertness
and will delay sleep.

00:14:50.131 --> 00:14:52.994
What's the last thing that most of us
do before we go to bed?

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.387
We stand in a massively lit bathroom,

00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:57.506
looking into the mirror
cleaning our teeth.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.085
It's the worst thing we can possibly do
before we go to sleep.

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.812
Turn off those mobile phones.
Turn off those computers.

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:07.552
Turn off all of those things
that are also going to excite the brain.

00:15:08.155 --> 00:15:10.819
Try not to drink caffeine
too late in the day,

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:13.691
ideally not after lunch.

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:17.016
Now, we've set about reducing light
exposure before you go to bed,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.972
but light exposure in the morning

00:15:18.996 --> 00:15:22.287
is very good at setting the biological
clock to the light-dark cycle.

00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:23.970
So seek out morning light.

00:15:23.994 --> 00:15:26.450
Basically, listen to yourself.

00:15:26.474 --> 00:15:27.626
Wind down.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.812
Do those sorts of things

00:15:28.836 --> 00:15:30.858
that you know are going to ease you off

00:15:30.882 --> 00:15:33.560
into the honey-heavy dew of slumber.

00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:35.354
OK.

00:15:35.378 --> 00:15:37.680
That's some facts. What about some myths?

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:38.986
Teenagers are lazy.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.874
No. Poor things.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:44.324
They have a biological predisposition
to go to bed late and get up late,

00:15:44.348 --> 00:15:45.637
so give them a break.

00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:48.541
We need eight hours of sleep a night.

00:15:49.392 --> 00:15:50.548
That's an average.

00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:52.840
Some people need more.
Some people need less.

00:15:52.864 --> 00:15:55.077
And what you need to do
is listen to your body.

00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:57.442
Do you need that much or do you need more?

00:15:57.466 --> 00:15:58.842
Simple as that.

00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:00.986
Old people need less sleep.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.660
Not true.

00:16:02.684 --> 00:16:05.204
The sleep demands of the aged
do not go down.

00:16:05.584 --> 00:16:08.879
Essentially, sleep fragments
and becomes less robust,

00:16:08.903 --> 00:16:11.650
but sleep requirements do not go down.

00:16:11.674 --> 00:16:15.579
And the fourth myth
is early to bed, early to rise

00:16:15.603 --> 00:16:18.246
makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.026
Well, that's wrong
at so many different levels.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.381
(Laughter)

00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:27.920
There is no evidence that getting up early
and going to bed early

00:16:27.944 --> 00:16:29.364
gives you more wealth at all.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:31.996
There's no difference
in socioeconomic status.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.171
In my experience,

00:16:33.195 --> 00:16:36.080
the only difference between morning
people and evening people

00:16:36.104 --> 00:16:38.605
is that those people that get up
in the morning early

00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:39.921
are just horribly smug.

00:16:39.945 --> 00:16:41.216
(Laughter)

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.543
(Applause)

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:45.719
OK.

00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:47.269
So for the last few minutes,

00:16:47.293 --> 00:16:49.166
what I want to do is change gears

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.939
and talk about some really new,
breaking areas of neuroscience,

00:16:52.963 --> 00:16:55.847
which is the association
between mental health,

00:16:55.871 --> 00:16:58.165
mental illness and sleep disruption.

00:16:58.189 --> 00:17:02.289
We've known for 130 years
that in severe mental illness,

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:05.597
there is always, always sleep disruption,

00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:07.079
but it's been largely ignored.

00:17:07.103 --> 00:17:09.927
In the 1970s, when people started
to think about this again,

00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:13.757
they said, "Yes, well, of course you have
sleep disruption in schizophrenia,

00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:15.828
because they're on antipsychotics.

00:17:15.852 --> 00:17:18.864
It's the antipsychotics causing
the sleep problems,"

00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:21.817
ignoring the fact that
for a hundred years previously,

00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:25.822
sleep disruption had been reported
before antipsychotics.

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:27.646
So what's going on?

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.674
Several groups are studying

00:17:30.698 --> 00:17:33.996
conditions like depression,
schizophrenia and bipolar

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.389
and what's going on
in terms of sleep disruption.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.484
We have a big study which we published
last year on schizophrenia,

00:17:40.508 --> 00:17:43.957
and the data were quite extraordinary.

00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:46.933
In those individuals with schizophrenia,

00:17:46.957 --> 00:17:50.850
much of the time, they were awake
during the night phase

00:17:50.874 --> 00:17:53.064
and then they were asleep during the day.

00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:55.627
Other groups showed no 24-hour
patterns whatsoever --

00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:57.596
their sleep was absolutely smashed.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.784
And some had no ability to regulate
their sleep by the light-dark cycle.

00:18:01.808 --> 00:18:05.050
They were getting up later and later
and later and later each night.

00:18:05.074 --> 00:18:06.347
It was smashed.

00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:08.558
So what's going on?

00:18:08.582 --> 00:18:10.106
And the really exciting news

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:15.709
is that mental illness and sleep
are not simply associated,

00:18:15.733 --> 00:18:18.447
but they are physically linked
within the brain.

00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:21.405
The neural networks that predispose
you to normal sleep,

00:18:21.429 --> 00:18:22.690
give you normal sleep,

00:18:22.714 --> 00:18:25.844
and those that give you normal
mental health, are overlapping.

00:18:26.344 --> 00:18:28.003
And what's the evidence for that?

00:18:28.027 --> 00:18:30.940
Well, genes that have been shown

00:18:30.964 --> 00:18:33.894
to be very important
in the generation of normal sleep,

00:18:33.918 --> 00:18:35.661
when mutated, when changed,

00:18:35.685 --> 00:18:39.017
also predispose individuals
to mental health problems.

00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:41.002
And last year, we published a study

00:18:41.026 --> 00:18:44.389
which showed that a gene
that's been linked to schizophrenia,

00:18:44.413 --> 00:18:47.769
when mutated, also smashes the sleep.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:51.116
So we have evidence
of a genuine mechanistic overlap

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.275
between these two important systems.

00:18:53.806 --> 00:18:55.806
Other work flowed from these studies.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.006
The first was that sleep disruption

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.908
actually precedes certain types
of mental illness,

00:19:02.932 --> 00:19:05.344
and we've shown that
in those young individuals

00:19:05.368 --> 00:19:08.753
who are at high risk
of developing bipolar disorder,

00:19:08.777 --> 00:19:11.270
they already have a sleep abnormality

00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:14.788
prior to any clinical
diagnosis of bipolar.

00:19:15.463 --> 00:19:21.188
The other bit of data
was that sleep disruption

00:19:21.212 --> 00:19:25.354
may actually exacerbate, make worse,
the mental illness state.

00:19:25.378 --> 00:19:28.016
My colleague Dan Freeman
has used a range of agents

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.584
which have stabilized sleep
and reduced levels of paranoia

00:19:31.608 --> 00:19:33.856
in those individuals by 50 percent.

00:19:34.189 --> 00:19:35.784
So what have we got?

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:41.070
We've got, in these connections,
some really exciting things.

00:19:41.721 --> 00:19:43.123
In terms of the neuroscience,

00:19:43.147 --> 00:19:44.893
by understanding these two systems,

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:48.217
we're really beginning to understand
how both sleep and mental illness

00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:51.104
are generated and regulated
within the brain.

00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:54.819
The second area
is that if we can use sleep

00:19:54.843 --> 00:19:57.327
and sleep disruption
as an early warning signal,

00:19:57.351 --> 00:19:59.597
then we have the chance of going in.

00:19:59.621 --> 00:20:02.026
If we know these individuals
are vulnerable,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.569
early intervention then becomes possible.

00:20:04.593 --> 00:20:07.164
And the third, which I think
is the most exciting,

00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:09.966
is that we can think
of the sleep centers within the brain

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.346
as a new therapeutic target.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.260
Stabilize sleep in those individuals
who are vulnerable,

00:20:14.284 --> 00:20:16.271
we can certainly make them healthier,

00:20:16.295 --> 00:20:20.986
but also alleviate some of the appalling
symptoms of mental illness.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.372
So let me just finish.

00:20:22.396 --> 00:20:25.663
What I started by saying is:
Take sleep seriously.

00:20:25.687 --> 00:20:28.136
Our attitudes toward sleep
are so very different

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.685
from a pre-industrial age,

00:20:29.709 --> 00:20:31.812
when we were almost wrapped in a duvet.

00:20:31.836 --> 00:20:35.275
We used to understand intuitively
the importance of sleep.

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:38.854
And this isn't some sort
of crystal-waving nonsense.

00:20:38.878 --> 00:20:41.498
This is a pragmatic response
to good health.

00:20:41.522 --> 00:20:44.339
If you have good sleep,
it increases your concentration,

00:20:44.363 --> 00:20:48.348
attention, decision-making,
creativity, social skills, health.

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:52.697
If you get sleep, it reduces
your mood changes, your stress,

00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:54.854
your levels of anger, your impulsivity,

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:57.471
and your tendency to drink and take drugs.

00:20:57.495 --> 00:21:00.330
And we finished by saying

00:21:00.354 --> 00:21:03.480
that an understanding
of the neuroscience of sleep

00:21:03.504 --> 00:21:06.308
is really informing the way we think

00:21:06.332 --> 00:21:08.842
about some of the causes
of mental illness,

00:21:08.866 --> 00:21:10.922
and indeed is providing us new ways

00:21:10.946 --> 00:21:14.405
to treat these incredibly
debilitating conditions.

00:21:15.666 --> 00:21:19.476
Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said,

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.521
"Sleep is God. Go worship."

00:21:21.545 --> 00:21:23.752
And I can only recommend
that you do the same.

00:21:23.776 --> 00:21:25.204
Thank you for your attention.

00:21:25.228 --> 00:21:28.992
