00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:03.770
Ah yes, those university days,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.673
a heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:10.144
and world debating championships,

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:15.397
or, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah."

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:17.389
Didn't get much sexier than the Spence

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:18.853
at university, let me tell you.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:23.239
It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.570
from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.733
literally on the other side of the world.

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.366
And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.011
about Australians are true.

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.433
From the youngest of ages, we display

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.944
a prodigious sporting talent.

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:40.289
On the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:40.946
What you've heard is true.

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:44.770
Australians, we don't mind a bit of a drink,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.520
sometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations. (Laughter)

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.707
This is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973.

00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:56.629
I'm almost five years old. Fair to say,

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.009
I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.889
But I stand before you today

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.335
not as a breakfast radio host,

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:08.241
not as a comedian, but as someone who was, is,

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:11.421
and always will be a mathematician.

00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:13.615
And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:17.375
knows that it bites early and it bites deep.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:20.312
I cast my mind back when I was in second grade

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:22.335
at a beautiful little government-run school

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:26.090
called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.151
and as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher,

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:29.879
Ms. Russell, said to the class,

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:32.344
"Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:34.613
I've got no plans."

00:01:34.613 --> 00:01:37.760
It was an exercise in democratic schooling,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.382
and I am all for democratic schooling, but we were only seven.

00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:44.124
So some of the suggestions we made as to what

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:46.688
we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical,

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:48.962
and after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:51.107
and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism,

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:52.704
"That wouldn't work.

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:56.695
That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole."

00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:58.962
Now I wasn't trying to be smart.

00:01:58.962 --> 00:01:59.797
I wasn't trying to be funny.

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:02.012
I just politely raised my hand,

00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:03.995
and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said,

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.631
in front of my year two classmates, and I quote,

00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:10.194
"But Miss,

00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:13.990
surely if the diagonal of the square

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.201
is less than the diameter of the circle,

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:21.086
well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole."

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:24.104
(Laughter)

00:02:24.104 --> 00:02:28.375
"It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it?"

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.018
And there was that same awkward silence

00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:31.216
from most of my classmates,

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:33.319
until sitting next to me, one of my friends,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.771
one of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:38.114
and punched me really hard in the head.

00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:39.198
(Laughter)

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:41.699
Now what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam,

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:46.248
you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.

00:02:46.248 --> 00:02:48.525
You can keep sitting here with us.

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:50.195
Any more of that sort of talk, you've got to go and sit

00:02:50.195 --> 00:02:53.975
over there with them."

00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:55.577
I thought about it for a nanosecond.

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:59.353
I took one look at the road map of life,

00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:03.181
and I ran off down the street marked "Geek"

00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:08.608
as fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me.

00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:12.336
I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:15.209
I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful.

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.193
It's natural. It's everywhere.

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:20.498
Numbers are the musical notes

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:24.720
with which the symphony of the universe is written.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.003
The great Descartes said something quite similar.

00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:29.713
The universe "is written in the mathematical language."

00:03:29.713 --> 00:03:33.937
And today, I want to show you one of those musical notes,

00:03:33.937 --> 00:03:38.329
a number so beautiful, so massive,

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.902
I think it will blow your mind.

00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:43.649
Today we're going to talk about prime numbers.

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:47.615
Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:49.931
because it's 2 x 3.

00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:53.545
Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7,

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:56.148
but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks,

00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:58.131
or as we call them, factors.

00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:00.621
Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers.

00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:02.632
One is not prime.

00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:05.172
The proof of that is a great party trick

00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:08.076
that admittedly only works at certain parties.

00:04:08.076 --> 00:04:11.066
(Laughter)

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:14.728
Another thing about primes, there is no final biggest prime number.

00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:16.140
They keep going on forever.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.979
We know there are an infinite number of primes

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.929
due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:23.161
Over thousands of years ago, he proved that for us.

00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:24.858
But the third thing about prime numbers,

00:04:24.858 --> 00:04:26.368
mathematicians have always wondered,

00:04:26.368 --> 00:04:28.630
well at any given moment in time,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.433
what is the biggest prime that we know about?

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:35.741
Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime.

00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.888
Don't freak out.

00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:41.889
All you need to know, of all the mathematics

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.374
you've ever learned, unlearned, crammed, forgotten,

00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:48.107
never understood in the first place,

00:04:48.107 --> 00:04:50.492
all you need to know is this:

00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:54.739
When I say 2 ^ 5,

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:57.586
I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other

00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:58.881
all multiplied together,

00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:02.097
2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:05.501
So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4,

00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:07.681
8, 16, 32.

00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:11.195
If you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay?

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.167
So 2 ^ 5,

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:14.879
those five little twos multiplied together.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.142
(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31.

00:05:19.142 --> 00:05:22.453
31 is a prime number, and that five in the power

00:05:22.453 --> 00:05:24.998
is also a prime number.

00:05:24.998 --> 00:05:28.502
And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found

00:05:28.502 --> 00:05:29.738
are of that form:

00:05:29.738 --> 00:05:33.017
two to a prime number, take away one.

00:05:33.017 --> 00:05:35.434
I won't go into great detail as to why,

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:38.185
because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do,

00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:42.396
but suffice to say, a number of that form

00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:45.859
is fairly easy to test for primacy.

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:49.459
A random odd number is a lot harder to test.

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:51.380
But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.219
we realize it's not enough

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.960
just to put in any prime number in the power.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.557
(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047,

00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:01.925
and you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89.

00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:04.051
(Laughter)

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:07.291
But (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1

00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:10.648
(2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers.

00:06:10.648 --> 00:06:13.517
After that point, they thin out a lot.

00:06:13.517 --> 00:06:15.647
And one of the things about the search for massive primes

00:06:15.647 --> 00:06:18.786
that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds

00:06:18.786 --> 00:06:21.303
of all time have gone on this search.

00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:24.040
This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.501
In the 1700s, other mathematicians said

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:29.533
he is simply the master of us all.

00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:32.721
He was so respected, they put him on European currency

00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:35.366
back when that was a compliment.

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:40.346
(Laughter)

00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:43.429
Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime:

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:45.216
(2 ^ 31) - 1.

00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:47.564
It's over two billion.

00:06:47.564 --> 00:06:49.599
He proved it was prime with nothing more

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.387
than a quill, ink, paper and his mind.

00:06:53.387 --> 00:06:54.341
You think that's big.

00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:57.618
We know that (2 ^ 127) - 1

00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:59.212
is a prime number.

00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:00.856
It's an absolute brute.

00:07:00.856 --> 00:07:04.861
Look at it here: 39 digits long,

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:08.224
proven to be prime in 1876

00:07:08.224 --> 00:07:10.288
by a mathematician called Lucas.

00:07:10.288 --> 00:07:12.224
Word up, L-Dog.

00:07:12.224 --> 00:07:13.969
(Laughter)

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:16.363
But one of the great things about the search for massive primes,

00:07:16.363 --> 00:07:17.560
it's not just finding the primes.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.811
Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting.

00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:27.593
Lucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1,

00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:30.269
21 digits long, was not prime.

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:32.698
But he didn't know what the factors were.

00:07:32.698 --> 00:07:34.483
We knew it was like six, but we didn't know

00:07:34.483 --> 00:07:36.904
what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together

00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:38.154
to give us that massive number.

00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:40.195
We didn't know for almost 40 years

00:07:40.195 --> 00:07:43.117
until Frank Nelson Cole came along.

00:07:43.117 --> 00:07:45.495
And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians,

00:07:45.495 --> 00:07:49.291
he walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk,

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.056
and started writing out the powers of two:

00:07:52.056 --> 00:07:55.177
two, four, eight, 16 --

00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:56.833
come on, join in with me, you know how it goes --

00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.699
32, 64, 128, 256,

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:05.355
512, 1,024, 2,048.

00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:07.907
I'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second.

00:08:07.907 --> 00:08:10.677
Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there.

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:12.340
He went on and on

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.009
and calculated 67 powers of two.

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:18.501
He took away one and wrote that number on the board.

00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:22.842
A frisson of excitement went around the room.

00:08:22.842 --> 00:08:25.104
It got even more exciting when he then wrote down

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:29.503
these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format --

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.416
and for the rest of the hour of his talk

00:08:33.416 --> 00:08:38.049
Frank Nelson Cole busted that out.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.223
He had found the prime factors

00:08:40.223 --> 00:08:42.633
of (2 ^ 67) - 1.

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:45.135
The room went berserk --

00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:46.955
(Laughter) --

00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:48.997
as Frank Nelson Cole sat down,

00:08:48.997 --> 00:08:52.344
having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics

00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:55.153
with no words.

00:08:55.153 --> 00:08:57.840
He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.490
It took focus. It took dedication.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.490
It took him, by his estimate,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.461
"three years of Sundays."

00:09:06.461 --> 00:09:08.799
But then in the field of mathematics,

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:11.914
as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED,

00:09:11.914 --> 00:09:16.257
the age of the computer goes along and things explode.

00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:18.694
These are the largest prime numbers we knew

00:09:18.694 --> 00:09:22.101
decade by decade, each one dwarfing the one before

00:09:22.101 --> 00:09:25.301
as computers took over and our power to calculate

00:09:25.301 --> 00:09:27.213
just grew and grew.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.295
This is the largest prime number we knew in 1996,

00:09:30.295 --> 00:09:32.315
a very emotional year for me.

00:09:32.315 --> 00:09:34.250
It was the year I left university.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.875
I was torn between mathematics and media.

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.330
It was a tough decision. I loved university.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.203
My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life.

00:09:43.203 --> 00:09:45.786
(Laughter)

00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:49.413
But I came to a realization about my own ability.

00:09:49.413 --> 00:09:52.930
Put simply, in a room full of randomly selected people,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.805
I'm a maths genius.

00:09:54.805 --> 00:09:56.882
In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds,

00:09:56.882 --> 00:10:00.611
I'm as dumb as a box of hammers.

00:10:00.611 --> 00:10:02.358
My skill is not in the mathematics.

00:10:02.358 --> 00:10:06.250
It is in telling the story of the mathematics.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.436
And during that time, since I've left university,

00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:10.572
these numbers have got bigger and bigger,

00:10:10.572 --> 00:10:12.338
each one dwarfing the last,

00:10:12.338 --> 00:10:17.231
until along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper,

00:10:17.231 --> 00:10:20.590
who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime,

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.895
only to see it snatched away by a rival university.

00:10:23.895 --> 00:10:28.072
And then Curtis Cooper got it back.

00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:33.399
Not years ago, not months ago, days ago.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.043
In an amazing moment of serendipity,

00:10:35.043 --> 00:10:39.195
I had to send TED a new slide

00:10:39.195 --> 00:10:41.205
to show you what this guy had done.

00:10:41.205 --> 00:10:43.855
I still remember -- (Applause) --

00:10:43.855 --> 00:10:45.358
I still remember when it happened.

00:10:45.358 --> 00:10:46.806
I was doing my breakfast radio show.

00:10:46.806 --> 00:10:48.178
I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet:

00:10:48.178 --> 00:10:50.483
"Adam, have you seen the new largest prime number?"

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.897
I shivered --

00:10:51.897 --> 00:10:53.637
(Laughter) --

00:10:53.637 --> 00:10:56.719
contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room,

00:10:56.719 --> 00:10:59.170
and said "Girls, hold the front page.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.630
We're not talking politics today.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.587
We're not talking sport today.

00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:04.917
They found another megaprime."

00:11:04.917 --> 00:11:06.429
The girls just shook their heads,

00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:08.666
put them in their hands, and let me go my own way.

00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:11.242
It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know,

00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:13.571
currently the largest prime number we know,

00:11:13.571 --> 00:11:21.581
is 2 ^ 57,885,161.

00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:24.384
Don't forget to subtract the one.

00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:31.608
This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:35.034
If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file,

00:11:35.034 --> 00:11:37.829
that's 22 meg.

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:39.873
For the slightly less geeky of you,

00:11:39.873 --> 00:11:42.010
think about the Harry Potter novels, okay?

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.360
This is the first Harry Potter novel.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.062
This is all seven Harry Potter novels,

00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:48.424
because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end.

00:11:48.424 --> 00:11:51.943
(Laughter)

00:11:51.943 --> 00:11:54.255
Written out as a book, this number would run

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:58.730
the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:04.269
Here's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime.

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:07.390
If, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday,

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.958
we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second,

00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:17.328
it would have taken five hours to show you that number.

00:12:17.328 --> 00:12:20.294
I was keen to do it, could not convince Bono.

00:12:20.294 --> 00:12:22.897
That's the way it goes.

00:12:22.897 --> 00:12:27.317
This number is 17 and a half thousand slides long,

00:12:27.317 --> 00:12:31.440
and we know it is prime as confidently

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.814
as we know the number seven is prime.

00:12:34.814 --> 00:12:40.500
That fills me with almost sexual excitement.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.683
And who am I kidding when I say almost?

00:12:42.683 --> 00:12:45.245
(Laughter)

00:12:45.245 --> 00:12:46.896
I know what you're thinking:

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:51.875
Adam, we're happy that you're happy,

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.373
but why should we care?

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:57.083
Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful.

00:12:57.083 --> 00:13:00.634
First of all, as I explained, to ask a computer

00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:03.713
"Is that number prime?" to type it in its abbreviated form,

00:13:03.713 --> 00:13:07.915
and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy,

00:13:07.915 --> 00:13:10.236
is a remarkably simple question to ask.

00:13:10.236 --> 00:13:13.249
It's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer,

00:13:13.249 --> 00:13:15.806
and just requires phenomenal grunt.

00:13:15.806 --> 00:13:17.975
Large prime numbers are a great way of testing

00:13:17.975 --> 00:13:20.608
the speed and accuracy of computer chips.

00:13:20.608 --> 00:13:23.409
But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime,

00:13:23.409 --> 00:13:25.334
he wasn't the only guy searching.

00:13:25.334 --> 00:13:26.519
My laptop at home was looking through

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:28.794
four potential candidate primes myself

00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:32.450
as part of a networked computer hunt around the world

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.705
for these large numbers.

00:13:33.705 --> 00:13:35.634
The discovery of that prime is similar to the work

00:13:35.634 --> 00:13:38.836
people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences,

00:13:38.836 --> 00:13:41.908
in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects.

00:13:41.908 --> 00:13:45.150
We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.669
are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia

00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:49.783
but on laptops, desktops,

00:13:49.783 --> 00:13:51.649
in the palms of people's hands

00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:55.062
who are simply helping out for the search.

00:13:55.062 --> 00:13:57.391
But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor

00:13:57.391 --> 00:13:59.328
for the time in which we live,

00:13:59.328 --> 00:14:04.172
when human minds and machines can conquer together.

00:14:04.172 --> 00:14:06.531
We've heard a lot about robots in this TED.

00:14:06.531 --> 00:14:08.141
We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do.

00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:10.663
It is true, you can now download onto your smartphone

00:14:10.663 --> 00:14:14.558
an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess.

00:14:14.558 --> 00:14:16.022
You think that's cool.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.588
Here's a machine doing something cool.

00:14:18.588 --> 00:14:20.774
This is the CubeStormer II.

00:14:20.774 --> 00:14:24.595
It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube.

00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:27.161
Using the power of the smartphone,

00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:34.354
it can examine the cube and solve the cube

00:14:34.354 --> 00:14:37.053
in five seconds.

00:14:37.053 --> 00:14:40.934
(Applause)

00:14:40.934 --> 00:14:44.999
That scares some people. That excites me.

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:48.230
How lucky are we to live in this age

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.523
when mind and machine can work together?

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:53.795
I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity

00:14:53.795 --> 00:14:56.783
as a lower-case "c" celebrity in Australia,

00:14:56.783 --> 00:14:58.788
"What was your highlight of 2012?"

00:14:58.788 --> 00:15:00.250
People were expecting me to talk about

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.918
my beloved Sydney Swans football team.

00:15:02.918 --> 00:15:05.926
In our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football,

00:15:05.926 --> 00:15:08.060
they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.051
I was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.

00:15:11.051 --> 00:15:13.165
It wasn't my highlight of 2012.

00:15:13.165 --> 00:15:15.128
People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show.

00:15:15.128 --> 00:15:17.196
It might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough.

00:15:17.196 --> 00:15:19.251
It might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no.

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.415
It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done.

00:15:21.415 --> 00:15:24.994
No, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly,

00:15:24.994 --> 00:15:28.626
was the discovery of the Higgs boson.

00:15:28.626 --> 00:15:31.302
Give it up for the fundamental particle

00:15:31.302 --> 00:15:34.307
that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass.

00:15:34.307 --> 00:15:35.803
(Applause)

00:15:35.803 --> 00:15:38.616
And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was

00:15:38.616 --> 00:15:40.852
50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team

00:15:40.852 --> 00:15:43.262
considered one of the deepest of all questions:

00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:47.902
How is it that the things that make us up have no mass?

00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:52.361
I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from?

00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:54.175
And he postulated a suggestion

00:15:54.175 --> 00:15:57.845
that there's this infinite, incredibly small field

00:15:57.845 --> 00:15:59.963
stretching throughout the universe,

00:15:59.963 --> 00:16:02.048
and as other particles go through those particles

00:16:02.048 --> 00:16:04.440
and interact, that's where they get their mass.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.897
The rest of the scientific community said,

00:16:06.897 --> 00:16:08.506
"Great idea, Higgsy.

00:16:08.506 --> 00:16:10.192
We've got no idea if we could ever prove it.

00:16:10.192 --> 00:16:12.300
It's beyond our reach."

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.797
And within just 50 years,

00:16:14.797 --> 00:16:20.681
in his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience,

00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:24.313
we had designed the greatest machine ever

00:16:24.313 --> 00:16:27.379
to prove this incredible idea

00:16:27.379 --> 00:16:31.342
that originated just in a human mind.

00:16:31.342 --> 00:16:33.874
That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.

00:16:33.874 --> 00:16:35.960
We thought it might be there,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.380
and we went and found it.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.280
That is the essence of being human.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.954
That is what we are all about.

00:16:45.954 --> 00:16:47.923
Or as my friend Descartes might put it,

00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:49.636
we think,

00:16:49.636 --> 00:16:52.049
therefore we are.

00:16:52.049 --> 00:16:53.440
Thank you.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.041
(Applause)
