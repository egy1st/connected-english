00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.130
I come from Lebanon,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.210
and I believe that running
can change the world.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.070
I know what I have just said
is simply not obvious.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.100
You know, Lebanon as a country
has been once destroyed

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.230
by a long and bloody civil war.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.190
Honestly, I don't know
why they call it civil war

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.190
when there is nothing civil about it.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.170
With Syria to the north,
Israel and Palestine to the south,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.230
and our government
even up till this moment

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.240
is still fragmented and unstable.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.080
For years, the country has been divided
between politics and religion.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.090
However, for one day a year,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.230
we truly stand united,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.240
and that's when the marathon takes place.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.240
I used to be a marathon runner.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.040
Long distance running
was not only good for my well-being

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.040
but it helped me meditate and dream big.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.060
So the longer distances I ran,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.040
the bigger my dreams became.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.080
Until one fateful morning,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.080
and while training, I was hit by a bus.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.230
I nearly died, was in a coma,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.020
stayed at the hospital for two years,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.070
and underwent 36 surgeries
to be able to walk again.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.140
As soon as I came out of my coma,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.180
I realized that I was no longer
the same runner I used to be,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.230
so I decided, if I couldn't run myself,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.070
I wanted to make sure that others could.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.080
So out of my hospital bed,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.080
I asked my husband to start taking notes,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.100
and a few months later,
the marathon was born.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.230
Organizing a marathon
as a reaction to an accident

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.140
may sound strange,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.120
but at that time, even during
my most vulnerable condition,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.120
I needed to dream big.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.110
I needed something
to take me out of my pain,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.170
an objective to look forward to.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.040
I didn't want to pity myself,
nor to be pitied,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.160
and I thought by organizing
such a marathon,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.160
I'll be able to pay back to my community,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.060
build bridges with the outside world,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.230
and invite runners to come to Lebanon

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.130
and run under the umbrella of peace.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.090
Organizing a marathon in Lebanon

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.100
is definitely not like organizing
one in New York.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.130
How do you introduce
the concept of running

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.020
to a nation that is constantly
at the brink of war?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.160
How do you ask those
who were once fighting

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.160
and killing each other

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.150
to come together and run
next to each other?

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.070
More than that, how do you convince people
to run a distance of 26.2 miles

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.150
at a time they were not even familiar
with the word "marathon"?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.130
So we had to start from scratch.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.180
For almost two years,
we went all over the country

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.200
and even visited remote villages.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.210
I personally met with people
from all walks of life --

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.230
mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.000
politicians, militiamen,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.230
people from mosques, churches,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.080
the president of the country,
even housewives.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.060
I learned one thing:

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.140
When you walk the talk,
people believe you.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.170
Many were touched by my personal story,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.030
and they shared their stories in return.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.110
It was honesty and transparency
that brought us together.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.230
We spoke one common language
to each other,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.210
and that was from one human to another.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.040
Once that trust was built,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.010
everybody wanted
to be part of the marathon

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.140
to show the world the true colors
of Lebanon and the Lebanese

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.000
and their desire to live
in peace and harmony.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.140
In October 2003, over 6,000 runners

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.030
from 49 different nationalities

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.010
came to the start line, all determined,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.180
and when the gunfire went off,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.180
this time it was a signal
to run in harmony,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.240
for a change.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.050
The marathon grew.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.060
So did our political problems.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.160
But for every disaster we had,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.230
the marathon found ways
to bring people together.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.020
In 2005, our prime minister
was assassinated,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.070
and the country came
to a complete standstill,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.110
so we organized a five-kilometer
United We Run campaign.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.160
Over 60,000 people came to the start line,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.090
all wearing white T-shirts
with no political slogans.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.090
That was a turning point for the marathon,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.000
where people started
looking at it as a platform

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.050
for peace and unity.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.230
Between 2006 up to 2009,
our country, Lebanon,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.160
went through unstable years,

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.190
invasions, and more assassinations

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.090
that brought us close to a civil war.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.200
The country was divided again,

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.050
so much that our parliament resigned,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.100
we had no president for a year,
and no prime minister.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.190
But we did have a marathon.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.050
(Applause)

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.050
So through the marathon, we learned
that political problems can be overcome.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.230
When the opposition party decided
to shut down part of the city center,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.110
we negotiated alternative routes.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.210
Government protesters
became sideline cheerleaders.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.100
They even hosted juice stations.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.110
(Laughter)

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.000
You know, the marathon
has really become one of its kind.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.210
It gained credibility

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.030
from both the Lebanese
and the international community.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:58.230
Last November 2012, over 33,000 runners
from 85 different nationalities

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.130
came to the start line,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.170
but this time, they challenged
a very stormy and rainy weather.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.170
The streets were flooded,
but people didn't want to miss out

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.040
on the opportunity of being part
of such a national day.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.180
BMA has expanded.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.150
We include everyone:
the young, the elderly,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.150
the disabled, the mentally challenged,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.020
the blind, the elite, the amateur runners,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.090
even moms with their babies.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.080
Themes have included
runs for the environment,

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.240
breast cancer, for the love
of Lebanon, for peace,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
or just simply to run.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:46.130
The first annual all-women-and-girls
race for empowerment,

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.230
which is one of its kind in the region,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.090
has just taken place only a few weeks ago,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.200
with 4,512 women,
including the first lady,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.210
and this is only the beginning.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.220
Thank you.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.110
(Applause)

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.020
BMA has supported charities and volunteers

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.040
who have helped reshape Lebanon,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.160
raising funds for their causes

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.060
and encouraging others to give.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.100
The culture of giving and doing good
has become contagious.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.110
Stereotypes have been broken.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.000
Change-makers and future leaders
have been created.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:37.170
I believe these are the building blocks
for future peace.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:45.180
BMA has become such a respected
event in the region

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.120
that government officials in the region,

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.110
like Iraq, Egypt and Syria,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.090
have asked the organization to help them
structure a similar sporting event.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.110
We are now one of the largest
running events in the Middle East,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.110
but most importantly,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.230
it is a platform for hope and cooperation

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.160
in an ever-fragile
and unstable part of the world.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.150
From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.230
(Applause)

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.220
After 10 years in Lebanon,

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:31.140
from national marathons
or from national events

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.210
to smaller regional races,

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:38.090
we've seen that people want
to run for a better future.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:44.120
After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.110
It is more of a marathon.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.120
Thank you.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.140
(Applause)
