00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:02.285
When I was a young man, I spent six years

00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:04.398
of wild adventure in the tropics

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:06.526
working as an investigative journalist

00:00:06.526 --> 00:00:09.911
in some of the most bewitching parts of the world.

00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:13.110
I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.648
This is why wars get fought.

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:18.875
But I also felt more alive than I've ever done since.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:22.768
And when I came home, I found the scope of my existence

00:00:22.768 --> 00:00:24.751
gradually diminishing

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:29.197
until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge.

00:00:29.197 --> 00:00:31.337
And I found myself sort of

00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:33.394
scratching at the walls of life,

00:00:33.394 --> 00:00:35.432
as if I was trying to find a way out

00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:37.319
into a wider space beyond.

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:41.850
I was, I believe, ecologically bored.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.331
Now, we evolved in rather more challenging times than these,

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:51.157
in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws.

00:00:51.157 --> 00:00:53.753
And we still possess the fear and the courage

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.946
and the aggression required to navigate those times.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:01.630
But in our comfortable, safe, crowded lands,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.613
we have few opportunities to exercise them

00:01:04.613 --> 00:01:07.765
without harming other people.

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:11.903
And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself

00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:14.153
bumping up against.

00:01:14.153 --> 00:01:16.765
To conquer uncertainty,

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:20.083
to know what comes next,

00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:24.653
that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies,

00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:28.253
and having got there, or almost got there,

00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:31.616
we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs.

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:34.618
We've privileged safety over experience

00:01:34.618 --> 00:01:37.122
and we've gained a lot in doing so,

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:40.130
but I think we've lost something too.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.932
Now, I don't romanticize evolutionary time.

00:01:42.932 --> 00:01:46.450
I'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.679
and the outcome of a mortal combat between me

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.592
myopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:55.074
and an enraged giant aurochs

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:57.556
isn't very hard to predict.

00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:00.552
Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for.

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:03.692
I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept.

00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:07.618
I just wanted a richer and rawer life

00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:10.114
than I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed,

00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:13.526
that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world.

00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:19.032
And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:22.637
that I began to understand what I was looking for.

00:02:22.637 --> 00:02:25.291
And as soon as I found that word,

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.319
I realized that I wanted to devote

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.074
much of the rest of my life to it.

00:02:31.074 --> 00:02:34.575
The word is "rewilding,"

00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:37.357
and even though rewilding is a young word,

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.224
it already has several definitions.

00:02:39.224 --> 00:02:43.260
But there are two in particular that fascinate me.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.211
The first one is the mass restoration

00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:49.866
of ecosystems.

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:52.836
One of the most exciting scientific findings

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.606
of the past half century

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:59.352
has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades.

00:02:59.352 --> 00:03:02.530
A trophic cascade is an ecological process

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.905
which starts at the top of the food chain

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:08.200
and tumbles all the way down to the bottom,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.543
and the classic example is what happened

00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:13.354
in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:17.443
when wolves were reintroduced in 1995.

00:03:17.443 --> 00:03:21.878
Now, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals,

00:03:21.878 --> 00:03:24.277
but perhaps we're slightly less aware

00:03:24.277 --> 00:03:28.115
that they give life to many others.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:31.228
It sounds strange, but just follow me for a while.

00:03:31.228 --> 00:03:33.054
Before the wolves turned up,

00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:34.713
they'd been absent for 70 years.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:37.778
The numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,

00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:40.532
had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park,

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:43.623
and despite efforts by humans to control them,

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.318
they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there

00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:49.739
to almost nothing, they'd just grazed it away.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.934
But as soon as the wolves arrived,

00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:53.761
even though they were few in number,

00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:57.660
they started to have the most remarkable effects.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.831
First, of course, they killed some of the deer,

00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.643
but that wasn't the major thing.

00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:03.674
Much more significantly,

00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:06.873
they radically changed the behavior of the deer.

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:09.786
The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:12.009
the places where they could be trapped most easily,

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.748
particularly the valleys and the gorges,

00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:17.937
and immediately those places started to regenerate.

00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:20.336
In some areas, the height of the trees

00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:23.348
quintupled in just six years.

00:04:23.348 --> 00:04:27.415
Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen

00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:29.686
and willow and cottonwood.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.464
And as soon as that happened,

00:04:31.464 --> 00:04:33.622
the birds started moving in.

00:04:33.622 --> 00:04:36.043
The number of songbirds, of migratory birds,

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.117
started to increase greatly.

00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:40.174
The number of beavers started to increase,

00:04:40.174 --> 00:04:42.855
because beavers like to eat the trees.

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:46.083
And beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers.

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:48.962
They create niches for other species.

00:04:48.962 --> 00:04:51.174
And the dams they built in the rivers

00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:54.108
provided habitats for otters and muskrats

00:04:54.108 --> 00:04:58.289
and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians.

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.394
The wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,

00:05:02.394 --> 00:05:04.856
the number of rabbits and mice began to rise,

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.766
which meant more hawks, more weasels,

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.165
more foxes, more badgers.

00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:12.652
Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed

00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:14.888
on the carrion that the wolves had left.

00:05:14.888 --> 00:05:18.597
Bears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,

00:05:18.597 --> 00:05:20.940
partly also because there were more berries

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.252
growing on the regenerating shrubs,

00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:26.483
and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves

00:05:26.483 --> 00:05:30.882
by killing some of the calves of the deer.

00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:34.558
But here's where it gets really interesting.

00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:39.843
The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers.

00:05:39.843 --> 00:05:41.530
They began to meander less.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.153
There was less erosion. The channels narrowed.

00:05:45.153 --> 00:05:47.548
More pools formed, more riffle sections,

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.779
all of which were great for wildlife habitats.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.981
The rivers changed

00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:54.193
in response to the wolves,

00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:57.838
and the reason was that the regenerating forests

00:05:57.838 --> 00:06:01.529
stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.849
so that the rivers became more fixed in their course.

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.576
Similarly, by driving the deer out of some places

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:12.932
and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,

00:06:12.932 --> 00:06:14.345
there was less soil erosion,

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:17.881
because the vegetation stabilized that as well.

00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:21.242
So the wolves, small in number,

00:06:21.242 --> 00:06:24.205
transformed not just the ecosystem

00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:27.307
of the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land,

00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:31.525
but also its physical geography.

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:33.149
Whales in the southern oceans

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:35.652
have similarly wide-ranging effects.

00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:38.519
One of the many post-rational excuses

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:41.509
made by the Japanese government for killing whales

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.643
is that they said, "Well, the number of fish and krill will rise

00:06:44.643 --> 00:06:46.881
and then there'll be more for people to eat."

00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:48.892
Well, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of

00:06:48.892 --> 00:06:50.261
kind of makes sense, doesn't it,

00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:52.385
because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts

00:06:52.385 --> 00:06:54.547
of fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:56.609
there'll be more fish and krill.

00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:59.002
But the opposite happened.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.331
You take the whales away,

00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:03.182
and the number of krill collapses.

00:07:03.182 --> 00:07:05.275
Why would that possibly have happened?

00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:08.415
Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucial

00:07:08.415 --> 00:07:11.728
to sustaining that entire ecosystem,

00:07:11.728 --> 00:07:13.457
and one of the reasons for this

00:07:13.457 --> 00:07:15.557
is that they often feed at depth

00:07:15.557 --> 00:07:17.339
and then they come up to the surface and produce

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:21.525
what biologists politely call large fecal plumes,

00:07:21.525 --> 00:07:25.958
huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.274
up in the photic zone, where there's enough light

00:07:29.274 --> 00:07:32.446
to allow photosynthesis to take place,

00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:35.390
and those great plumes of fertilizer

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.382
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,

00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:39.296
the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain,

00:07:39.296 --> 00:07:41.394
which stimulate the growth of zooplankton,

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:43.691
which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.

00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:45.825
The other thing that whales do is that,

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:48.554
as they're plunging up and down through the water column,

00:07:48.554 --> 00:07:50.922
they're kicking the phytoplankton

00:07:50.922 --> 00:07:52.372
back up towards the surface

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:55.486
where it can continue to survive and reproduce.

00:07:55.486 --> 00:07:58.114
And interestingly, well, we know

00:07:58.114 --> 00:08:01.051
that plant plankton in the oceans

00:08:01.051 --> 00:08:02.858
absorb carbon from the atmosphere --

00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:04.401
the more plant plankton there are,

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.080
the more carbon they absorb --

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.162
and eventually they filter down into the abyss

00:08:09.162 --> 00:08:12.542
and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system.

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:16.843
Well, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,

00:08:16.843 --> 00:08:19.852
they were probably responsible for sequestering

00:08:19.852 --> 00:08:23.645
some tens of millions of tons of carbon

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:26.334
every year from the atmosphere.

00:08:26.334 --> 00:08:29.561
And when you look at it like that, you think,

00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:31.420
wait a minute, here are the wolves

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.437
changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park.

00:08:34.437 --> 00:08:36.296
Here are the whales changing

00:08:36.296 --> 00:08:38.936
the composition of the atmosphere.

00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:41.246
You begin to see that possibly,

00:08:41.246 --> 00:08:44.927
the evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis,

00:08:44.927 --> 00:08:47.514
which conceives of the world as a coherent,

00:08:47.514 --> 00:08:49.444
self-regulating organism,

00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:55.178
is beginning, at the ecosystem level, to accumulate.

00:08:55.178 --> 00:08:57.446
Trophic cascades

00:08:57.446 --> 00:08:59.507
tell us that the natural world

00:08:59.507 --> 00:09:04.253
is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was.

00:09:04.253 --> 00:09:07.985
They tell us that when you take away the large animals,

00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:11.177
you are left with a radically different ecosystem

00:09:11.177 --> 00:09:14.349
to one which retains its large animals.

00:09:14.349 --> 00:09:17.630
And they make, in my view, a powerful case

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.783
for the reintroduction of missing species.

00:09:21.783 --> 00:09:23.859
Rewilding, to me,

00:09:23.859 --> 00:09:27.157
means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.

00:09:27.157 --> 00:09:28.469
It means taking down the fences,

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:30.493
it means blocking the drainage ditches,

00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:33.757
it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea,

00:09:33.757 --> 00:09:37.171
but otherwise stepping back.

00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:40.981
It has no view as to what a right ecosystem

00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:43.682
or a right assemblage of species looks like.

00:09:43.682 --> 00:09:47.461
It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow

00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:52.147
or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.

00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:54.164
It lets nature decide,

00:09:54.164 --> 00:09:57.983
and nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding.

00:09:57.983 --> 00:10:00.258
Now, I mentioned that there are two definitions

00:10:00.258 --> 00:10:02.104
of rewilding that interest me.

00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:03.361
The other one

00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:06.384
is the rewilding of human life.

00:10:06.384 --> 00:10:08.447
And I don't see this as an alternative

00:10:08.447 --> 00:10:10.371
to civilization.

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:13.771
I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology,

00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:17.610
as we're doing now, but at the same time, if we choose,

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.626
have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure

00:10:22.626 --> 00:10:24.209
when we want to because

00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:28.605
there would be wonderful, rewilded habitats.

00:10:28.605 --> 00:10:30.389
And the opportunities for this

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:35.380
are developing more rapidly than you might think possible.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.359
There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States,

00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:42.044
two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared

00:10:42.044 --> 00:10:45.547
has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated,

00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:48.560
particularly from the eastern half of the country.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.217
There's another one which suggests

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:53.680
that 30 million hectares of land in Europe,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.187
an area the size of Poland,

00:10:56.187 --> 00:10:58.018
will be vacated by farmers

00:10:58.018 --> 00:11:01.340
between 2000 and 2030.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.876
Now, faced with opportunities like that,

00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:07.047
does it not seem a little unambitious

00:11:07.047 --> 00:11:10.761
to be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx,

00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:14.360
bears, beavers, bison, boar, moose,

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.185
and all the other species which are already beginning

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:19.449
to move quite rapidly across Europe?

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:21.973
Perhaps we should also start thinking

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:25.962
about the return of some of our lost megafauna.

00:11:25.962 --> 00:11:27.894
What megafauna, you say?

00:11:27.894 --> 00:11:30.463
Well, every continent had one,

00:11:30.463 --> 00:11:31.944
apart from Antarctica.

00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:35.582
When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated,

00:11:35.582 --> 00:11:37.337
the river gravels there were found

00:11:37.337 --> 00:11:40.887
to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus,

00:11:40.887 --> 00:11:44.975
rhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:46.349
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:46.349 --> 00:11:48.545
there were lions in Trafalgar Square

00:11:48.545 --> 00:11:51.751
long before Nelson's Column was built.

00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:54.002
All these species lived here

00:11:54.002 --> 00:11:56.654
in the last interglacial period,

00:11:56.654 --> 00:11:59.515
when temperatures were pretty similar to our own.

00:11:59.515 --> 00:12:01.588
It's not climate, largely,

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:05.135
which has got rid of the world's megafaunas.

00:12:05.135 --> 00:12:07.239
It's pressure from the human population

00:12:07.239 --> 00:12:09.075
hunting and destroying their habitats

00:12:09.075 --> 00:12:11.126
which has done so.

00:12:11.126 --> 00:12:14.914
And even so, you can still see the shadows

00:12:14.914 --> 00:12:17.622
of these great beasts in our current ecosystems.

00:12:17.622 --> 00:12:20.575
Why is it that so many deciduous trees

00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:25.133
are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:27.202
Why is it that they can withstand the loss

00:12:27.202 --> 00:12:28.809
of so much of their bark?

00:12:28.809 --> 00:12:31.752
Why do understory trees,

00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:36.845
which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind

00:12:36.845 --> 00:12:38.576
and have to carry less weight

00:12:38.576 --> 00:12:40.978
than the big canopy trees,

00:12:40.978 --> 00:12:44.097
why are they so much tougher and harder to break

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:48.506
than the canopy trees are?

00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:50.478
Elephants.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.647
They are elephant-adapted.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.935
In Europe, for example,

00:12:54.935 --> 00:12:58.078
they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant,

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:00.366
elephas antiquus, which was a great beast.

00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:02.542
It was related to the Asian elephant,

00:13:02.542 --> 00:13:05.111
but it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.

00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:07.641
It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.

00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:10.458
But why is it that some of our common shrubs

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:13.642
have spines which seem to be over-engineered

00:13:13.642 --> 00:13:16.305
to resist browsing by deer?

00:13:16.305 --> 00:13:18.119
Perhaps because they evolved

00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:21.382
to resist browsing by rhinoceros.

00:13:21.382 --> 00:13:23.306
Isn't it an amazing thought

00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:26.034
that every time you wander into a park

00:13:26.034 --> 00:13:28.881
or down an avenue or through a leafy street,

00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:32.492
you can see the shadows of these great beasts?

00:13:32.492 --> 00:13:36.292
Paleoecology, the study of past ecosystems,

00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:40.350
crucial to an understanding of our own,

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.927
feels like a portal through which you may pass

00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:46.859
into an enchanted kingdom.

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:50.672
And if we really are looking at areas of land

00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:54.917
of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available,

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:57.632
why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna,

00:13:57.632 --> 00:13:59.582
or at least species closely related to those

00:13:59.582 --> 00:14:02.543
which have become extinct everywhere?

00:14:02.543 --> 00:14:04.852
Why shouldn't all of us

00:14:04.852 --> 00:14:07.805
have a Serengeti on our doorsteps?

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.771
And perhaps this is the most important thing

00:14:10.771 --> 00:14:12.246
that rewilding offers us,

00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:15.840
the most important thing that's missing from our lives:

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.957
hope.

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:22.354
In motivating people to love and defend the natural world,

00:14:22.354 --> 00:14:27.164
an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.

00:14:27.164 --> 00:14:29.803
The story rewilding tells us

00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:33.443
is that ecological change need not always proceed

00:14:33.443 --> 00:14:35.906
in one direction.

00:14:35.906 --> 00:14:38.342
It offers us the hope

00:14:38.342 --> 00:14:40.483
that our silent spring

00:14:40.483 --> 00:14:42.814
could be replaced by a raucous summer.

00:14:42.814 --> 00:14:44.034
Thank you.

00:14:44.034 --> 00:14:50.045
(Applause)
