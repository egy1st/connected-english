00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.111
This is Charley Williams.

00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:05.387
He was 94 when this photograph was taken.

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:08.444
In the 1930s, Roosevelt put

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:10.424
thousands and thousands of Americans back to work

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:12.950
by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.365
but he also did something interesting,

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:16.677
which was to hire a few hundred writers

00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:20.638
to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans.

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:22.799
Charley Williams, a poor sharecropper,

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:25.461
wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview,

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:27.889
but Charley had actually been a slave

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:30.447
until he was 22 years old.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.761
And the stories that were captured of his life

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.540
make up one of the crown jewels

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.865
of histories, of human-lived experiences

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.140
filled with ex-slaves.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.240
Anna Deavere Smith famously said that

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.728
there's a literature inside of each of us,

00:00:45.728 --> 00:00:47.991
and three generations later, I was part of a project

00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:49.552
called StoryCorps,

00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:51.544
which set out to capture

00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:53.569
the stories of ordinary Americans

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:56.466
by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces.

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.696
The idea is very, very simple.

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:00.567
You go into these booths, you interview your grandmother

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:02.855
or relative, you leave with a copy of the interview

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:05.642
and an interview goes into the Library of Congress.

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:09.000
It's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.272
one conversation at a time.

00:01:11.272 --> 00:01:13.746
And the question is, who do you want to remember --

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:16.818
if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother?

00:01:16.818 --> 00:01:19.190
What's interesting, in conversations with the founder, Dave Isay,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.338
we always actually talked about this

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:22.588
as a little bit of a subversive project,

00:01:22.588 --> 00:01:23.989
because when you think about it,

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:26.505
it's actually not really about the stories that are being told,

00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:27.811
it's about listening,

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.845
and it's about the questions that you get to ask,

00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:31.923
questions that you may not have permission to

00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:33.193
on any other day.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:38.131
I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.109
[Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments]

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.675
Jesus Melendez: We took off, and as we were ascending,

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:44.318
before we had leveled off,

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:46.747
our level-off point was 45,000 feet,

00:01:46.747 --> 00:01:48.649
so before we had leveled off,

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.934
Pedro began leaving us,

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:53.147
and the beauty about it

00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:56.979
is that I believe that there's something after life.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.273
You can see it in Pedro.

00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:03.849
[Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married 26 years]

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.579
Danny Perasa: See, the thing of it is,

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.282
I always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you,

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:11.174
and I say it so often. I say it to remind you

00:02:11.174 --> 00:02:14.228
that as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me,

00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:18.500
it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.625
and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.938
(Laughter)

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:25.638
[Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz]

00:02:25.638 --> 00:02:28.696
Michael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother,

00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:30.228
and we can leave it there.

00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:32.036
And he saved up and he purchased this,

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:33.921
and he proposed to my mother with this,

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.862
and so I thought that I would give it to you

00:02:35.862 --> 00:02:39.592
so that he could be with us for this also.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.950
So I'm going to share a mic with you right now, Debora.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.767
Where's the right finger?

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:46.540
Debora Brakarz: (Crying)

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.258
MW: Debora, will you please marry me?

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:53.697
DB: Yes. Of course. I love you.

00:02:53.697 --> 00:02:56.358
(Kissing)

00:02:56.358 --> 00:03:00.919
MW: So kids, this is how your mother and I got married,

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.618
in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring.

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:06.752
My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.855
He used to pick people up here every day.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.982
So it seems right.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.621
Jake Barton: So I have to say

00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:15.628
I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.628
because they all make you cry.

00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:20.342
The entire project is predicated on this act of love

00:03:20.342 --> 00:03:21.893
which is listening itself.

00:03:21.893 --> 00:03:24.678
And that motion of building an institution

00:03:24.678 --> 00:03:26.519
out of a moment of conversation and listening

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.371
is actually a lot of what my firm, Local Projects,

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:31.370
is doing with our engagements in general.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.100
So we're a media design firm, and we're working

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.249
with a broad array of different institutions

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.482
building media installations for museums and public spaces.

00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:41.158
Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art,

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:44.238
which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.

00:03:44.238 --> 00:03:46.384
And Gallery One is an interesting project

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:50.576
because it started with this massive, $350 million expansion

00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:52.055
for the Cleveland Museum of Art,

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:54.382
and we actually brought in this piece

00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:56.885
specifically to grow new capacity, new audiences,

00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:59.694
at the same time that the museum itself is growing.

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:01.898
Glenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said,

00:04:01.898 --> 00:04:04.752
"We want visitors to actually cease being visitors.

00:04:04.752 --> 00:04:06.931
Visitors are transient. We want people who live here,

00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:08.604
people who have ownership."

00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:10.389
And so what we're doing is making a broad array

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.087
of different ways for people to actually engage

00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:14.286
with the material inside of these galleries,

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:17.069
so you can still have a traditional gallery experience,

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.577
but if you're interested, you can actually engage

00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:22.378
with any individual artwork and see the original context

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:25.120
from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.835
So, for example, you can click on this individual lion head,

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:31.109
and this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:33.219
Or this individual piece here,

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.734
you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:39.074
you think about this type of a tempera painting.

00:04:39.074 --> 00:04:41.572
This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself.

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:43.417
This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:45.885
of this incredible factory for creativity.

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.717
And it makes you think about literally the hundreds

00:04:47.717 --> 00:04:50.312
or thousands of years of human creativity and how

00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:53.367
each individual artwork stands in for part of that story.

00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:54.658
This is Picasso,

00:04:54.658 --> 00:04:57.636
of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century.

00:04:57.636 --> 00:04:59.937
And so our next interface, which I'll show you,

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:03.120
actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.738
It's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse

00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:09.937
the actual museum's collection using facial recognition.

00:05:09.937 --> 00:05:11.863
So this person's making different faces,

00:05:11.863 --> 00:05:14.270
and it's actually drawing forth different objects

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.510
from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.555
And so you can imagine that, as people are performing

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:24.085
inside of the museum itself, you get this sense

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:25.085
of this emotional connection,

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:27.438
this way in which our face connects with the thousands

00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:29.351
and tens of thousands of years.

00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.546
This is an interface that actually allows you to draw

00:05:31.546 --> 00:05:35.490
and then draws forth objects using those same shapes.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.155
So more and more we're trying to find ways

00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:40.241
for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves,

00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:42.241
to be creative even as they're looking

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.929
at other people's creativity and understanding them.

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:47.250
So in this wall, the collections wall,

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.749
you can actually see all 3,000 artworks all at the same time,

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.625
and you can actually author your own

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.990
individual walking tours of the museum, so you can share them,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.792
and someone can take a tour with the museum director

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.022
or a tour with their little cousin.

00:06:01.022 --> 00:06:02.112
But all the while that we've been working

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.250
on this engagement for Cleveland,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.685
we've also been working in the background

00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:07.686
on really our largest engagement to date,

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:11.270
and that's the 9/11 Memorial and Museum.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.879
So we started in 2006

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.423
as part of a team with Thinc Design

00:06:16.423 --> 00:06:18.920
to create the original master plan for the museum,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.620
and then we've done all the media design

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.207
both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production.

00:06:23.207 --> 00:06:26.077
So the memorial opened in 2011,

00:06:26.077 --> 00:06:28.602
and the museum's going to open next year in 2014.

00:06:28.602 --> 00:06:29.886
And you can see from these images,

00:06:29.886 --> 00:06:33.494
the site is so raw and almost archaeological.

00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:35.468
And of course the event itself is so recent,

00:06:35.468 --> 00:06:38.220
somewhere between history and current events,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.703
it was a huge challenge to imagine

00:06:39.703 --> 00:06:42.653
how do you actually live up to a space like this,

00:06:42.653 --> 00:06:44.847
an event like this, to actually tell that story.

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:46.860
And so what we started with

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.491
was really a new way of thinking about building an institution,

00:06:50.491 --> 00:06:51.998
through a project called Make History,

00:06:51.998 --> 00:06:53.833
which we launched in 2009.

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:56.766
So it's estimated that a third of the world

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:58.446
watched 9/11 live,

00:06:58.446 --> 00:06:59.769
and a third of the world

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:01.248
heard about it within 24 hours,

00:07:01.248 --> 00:07:03.616
making it really by nature of when it happened,

00:07:03.616 --> 00:07:06.816
this unprecedented moment of global awareness.

00:07:06.816 --> 00:07:09.107
And so we launched this to capture the stories

00:07:09.107 --> 00:07:10.210
from all around the world,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.876
through video, through photos,

00:07:11.876 --> 00:07:13.053
through written history,

00:07:13.053 --> 00:07:14.777
and so people's experiences on that day,

00:07:14.777 --> 00:07:16.843
which was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution

00:07:16.843 --> 00:07:19.312
to make its first move this open platform.

00:07:19.312 --> 00:07:22.270
But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.387
really the simplest we've ever made,

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:24.515
where you locate yourself on a map.

00:07:24.515 --> 00:07:27.091
It's in six languages, and you can tell your own story

00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:29.103
about what happened to you on that day.

00:07:29.103 --> 00:07:32.460
And when we started seeing the incredible images

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.908
and stories that came forth

00:07:33.908 --> 00:07:35.177
from all around the world --

00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:37.249
this is obviously part of the landing gear --

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:39.438
we really started to understand

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:41.523
that there was this amazing symmetry

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:43.046
between the event itself,

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.345
between the way that people were telling the stories of the event,

00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:48.641
and how we ourselves needed to tell that story.

00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:50.795
This image in particular really captured

00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:51.976
our attention at the time,

00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:54.464
because it so much sums up that event.

00:07:54.464 --> 00:07:57.071
This is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.

00:07:57.071 --> 00:08:00.200
There's a firefighter that's stuck, actually, in traffic,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.028
and so the firefighters themselves are running

00:08:03.028 --> 00:08:04.637
a mile and a half to the site itself

00:08:04.637 --> 00:08:07.607
with upwards of 70 pounds of gear on their back.

00:08:07.607 --> 00:08:10.400
And we got this amazing email that said,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.238
"While viewing the thousands of photos on the site,

00:08:12.238 --> 00:08:15.211
I unexpectedly found a photo of my son.

00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:18.171
It was a shock emotionally, yet a blessing to find this photo,"

00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:19.492
and he was writing because he said,

00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:21.832
"I'd like to personally thank the photographer

00:08:21.832 --> 00:08:22.981
for posting the photo,

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:25.083
as it meant more than words can describe to me

00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:26.876
to have access to what is probably

00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:31.319
the last photo ever taken of my son."

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.620
And it really made us recognize

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.221
what this institution needed to be

00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:38.591
in order to actually tell that story.

00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:42.387
We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:45.634
objectively in the third person about an event like that,

00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:48.164
when you have the witnesses to history

00:08:48.164 --> 00:08:49.010
who are going to make their way

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.155
through the actual museum itself.

00:08:52.155 --> 00:08:54.028
And so we started imagining the museum,

00:08:54.028 --> 00:08:57.400
along with the creative team at the museum and the curators,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.297
thinking about how the first voice that you would hear

00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:01.906
inside the museum would actually be of other visitors.

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:04.394
And so we created this idea of an opening gallery

00:09:04.394 --> 00:09:05.831
called We Remember.

00:09:05.831 --> 00:09:07.656
And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it,

00:09:07.656 --> 00:09:09.603
but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter

00:09:09.603 --> 00:09:10.866
into that moment in time

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:14.119
and be transported back in history.

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:17.930
(Video) Voice 1: I was in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Voice 2: I was in Cairo, Egypt.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.368
Voice 3: Sur les Champs-Élysées, à Paris.
Voice 4: In college, at U.C. Berkeley.

00:09:21.368 --> 00:09:24.574
Voice 5: I was in Times Square.
Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil.

00:09:24.574 --> 00:09:29.190
(Multiple voices)

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.986
Voice 7: It was probably about 11 o'clock at night.

00:09:31.986 --> 00:09:35.734
Voice 8: I was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning.

00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:36.995
Voice 9: We were actually in a meeting

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:38.722
when someone barged in and said,

00:09:38.722 --> 00:09:42.515
"Oh my God, a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center."

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.690
Voice 10: Trying to frantically get to a radio.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.119
Voice 11: When I heard it over the radio --

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:47.495
Voice 12: Heard it on the radio.

00:09:47.495 --> 00:09:49.245
(Multiple voices)

00:09:49.245 --> 00:09:52.179
Voice 13: I got a call from my father.
Voice 14: The phone rang, it woke me up.

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:54.120
My business partner told me to turn on the television.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.489
Voice 15: So I switched on the television.

00:09:56.489 --> 00:09:58.877
Voice 16: All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing.

00:09:58.877 --> 00:10:01.719
Voice 17: The Twin Towers.
Voice 18: The Twin Towers.

00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:02.816
JB: And you move from there

00:10:02.816 --> 00:10:04.900
into that open, cavernous space.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.785
This is the so-called slurry wall.

00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:09.959
It's the original, excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:12.961
that withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River

00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:14.998
for a full year after the event itself.

00:10:14.998 --> 00:10:18.199
And so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity,

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:20.574
of presence of that moment

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:22.099
into the actual exhibition itself.

00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:24.849
And we tell the stories of being inside the towers

00:10:24.849 --> 00:10:26.383
through that same audio collage,

00:10:26.383 --> 00:10:28.350
so you're hearing people literally talking about

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.274
seeing the planes as they make their way into the building,

00:10:31.274 --> 00:10:33.377
or making their way down the stairwells.

00:10:33.377 --> 00:10:35.624
And as you make your way into the exhibition

00:10:35.624 --> 00:10:37.470
where it talks about the recovery,

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.958
we actually project directly onto these moments

00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.155
of twisted steel all of the experiences from people

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:46.490
who literally excavated on top of the pile itself.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.494
And so you can hear oral histories --

00:10:48.494 --> 00:10:50.965
so people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades

00:10:50.965 --> 00:10:54.150
as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.985
from that moment.

00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:57.839
And as you leave that storytelling moment

00:10:57.839 --> 00:10:59.702
understanding about 9/11,

00:10:59.702 --> 00:11:02.750
we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.522
and actually talk to the individual visitors

00:11:05.522 --> 00:11:08.153
and ask them their own experiences about 9/11.

00:11:08.153 --> 00:11:09.370
And we ask them questions that are actually

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.408
not really answerable, the types of questions

00:11:11.408 --> 00:11:14.904
that 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us.

00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:16.326
And so these are questions like,

00:11:16.326 --> 00:11:19.483
"How can a democracy balance freedom and security?"

00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:23.057
"How could 9/11 have happened?"

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.192
"And how did the world change after 9/11?"

00:11:25.192 --> 00:11:26.723
And so these oral histories,

00:11:26.723 --> 00:11:29.606
which we've actually been capturing already for years,

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.745
are then mixed together with interviews

00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:33.971
that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld,

00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:35.843
Bill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani,

00:11:35.843 --> 00:11:37.963
and you mix together these different players

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:38.994
and these different experiences,

00:11:38.994 --> 00:11:41.360
these different reflection points about 9/11.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.055
And suddenly the institution, once again,

00:11:43.055 --> 00:11:45.396
turns into a listening experience.

00:11:45.396 --> 00:11:47.217
So I'll play you just a short excerpt

00:11:47.217 --> 00:11:49.171
of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices,

00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:50.968
but you really get a sense

00:11:50.968 --> 00:11:54.915
of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event.

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:58.258
(Video) Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience.

00:11:58.258 --> 00:12:02.268
Voice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us.

00:12:02.268 --> 00:12:03.822
Voice 3: And I knew when I saw that,

00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:05.877
people who were there that day who immediately

00:12:05.877 --> 00:12:08.937
went to help people known and unknown to them

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.955
was something that would pull us through.

00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:13.774
Voice 4: All the outpouring of affection and emotion

00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:15.742
that came from our country was something really

00:12:15.742 --> 00:12:18.560
that will forever, ever stay with me.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.306
Voice 5: Still today I pray and think about those

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:21.995
who lost their lives,

00:12:21.995 --> 00:12:24.672
and those who gave their lives to help others,

00:12:24.672 --> 00:12:28.091
but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country,

00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:30.411
the love, the compassIon, the strength,

00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:32.840
and I watched a nation come together

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.399
in the middle of a terrible tragedy.

00:12:38.013 --> 00:12:40.720
JB: And so as people make their way out of the museum,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.808
reflecting on the experience, reflecting on their own thoughts of it,

00:12:43.808 --> 00:12:46.984
they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself,

00:12:46.984 --> 00:12:49.062
because they've gone back up to grade,

00:12:49.062 --> 00:12:51.129
and we actually got involved in the memorial

00:12:51.129 --> 00:12:53.368
after we'd done the museum for a few years.

00:12:53.368 --> 00:12:56.177
The original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad,

00:12:56.177 --> 00:12:58.707
had this image in his mind of all the names appearing

00:12:58.707 --> 00:13:01.103
undifferentiated, almost random,

00:13:01.103 --> 00:13:04.935
really a poetic reflection on top of the nature

00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:06.452
of a terrorism event itself,

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:09.560
but it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.436
certainly for the first responders,

00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:13.566
and there was a negotiation that went forth

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:15.079
and a solution was found

00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:18.442
to actually create not an order in terms of chronology,

00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:19.806
or in terms of alphabetical,

00:13:19.806 --> 00:13:21.952
but through what's called meaningful adjacency.

00:13:21.952 --> 00:13:24.703
So these are groupings of the names themselves

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:27.371
which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order,

00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:30.607
and we, along with Jer Thorp, created an algorithm

00:13:30.607 --> 00:13:32.602
to take massive amounts of data

00:13:32.602 --> 00:13:35.927
to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves.

00:13:35.927 --> 00:13:38.959
So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:41.315
with the names scrambled for privacy,

00:13:41.315 --> 00:13:43.695
but you can see that these blocks of color

00:13:43.695 --> 00:13:45.645
are actually the four different flights,

00:13:45.645 --> 00:13:48.422
the two different towers, the first responders,

00:13:48.422 --> 00:13:50.994
and you can actually see within that different floors,

00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:53.769
and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections

00:13:53.785 --> 00:13:56.959
that were requested by the families themselves.

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:59.340
And so when you go to the memorial,

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.990
you can actually see the overarching organization

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.874
inside of the individual pools themselves.

00:14:04.874 --> 00:14:07.244
You can see the way that the geography of the event

00:14:07.244 --> 00:14:10.127
is reflected inside of the memorial,

00:14:10.127 --> 00:14:11.955
and you can search for an individual name,

00:14:11.955 --> 00:14:14.530
or in this case an employer, Cantor Fitzgerald,

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.926
and see the way in which all of those names,

00:14:16.926 --> 00:14:19.036
those hundreds of names, are actually organized

00:14:19.036 --> 00:14:20.728
onto the memorial itself,

00:14:20.728 --> 00:14:23.346
and use that to navigate the memorial.

00:14:23.346 --> 00:14:25.282
And more importantly, when you're actually at the site

00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:26.761
of the memorial, you can see those connections.

00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:30.381
You can see the relationships between the different names themselves.

00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:33.650
So suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:38.328
group of names springs into reality as an individual life.

00:14:38.328 --> 00:14:40.496
In this case, Harry Ramos,

00:14:40.496 --> 00:14:42.835
who was the head trader at an investment bank,

00:14:42.835 --> 00:14:47.873
who stopped to aid Victor Wald on the 55th floor of the South Tower.

00:14:47.873 --> 00:14:50.558
And Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses,

00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:53.028
"I'm not going to leave you."

00:14:53.028 --> 00:14:58.604
And Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other.

00:14:58.604 --> 00:15:01.806
Three generations ago, we had to actually get people

00:15:01.806 --> 00:15:05.203
to go out and capture the stories for common people.

00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:08.671
Today, of course, there's an unprecedented amount of stories

00:15:08.671 --> 00:15:12.569
for all of us that are being captured for future generations.

00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:16.082
And this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories.

00:15:16.097 --> 00:15:17.021
Thank you very much.

00:15:17.021 --> 00:15:21.878
(Applause)
