00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:05.027
When I was about three or four years old,

00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:08.909
I remember my mum reading a story to me

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.624
and my two big brothers,

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:13.643
and I remember putting up my hands

00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:15.646
to feel the page of the book,

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:19.177
to feel the picture they were discussing.

00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:21.626
And my mum said, "Darling,

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:24.479
remember that you can't see

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:27.525
and you can't feel the picture

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.462
and you can't feel the print on the page."

00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:32.236
And I thought to myself,

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:34.131
"But that's what I want to do.

00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:38.292
I love stories. I want to read."

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:40.554
Little did I know

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:43.073
that I would be part of a technological revolution

00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:46.774
that would make that dream come true.

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:50.191
I was born premature by about 10 weeks,

00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:54.836
which resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago.

00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:57.706
The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia,

00:00:57.706 --> 00:01:01.591
and it's now very rare in the developed world.

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:04.500
Little did I know, lying curled up

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.293
in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:12.121
that I'd been born at the right place

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.686
and the right time,

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:18.570
that I was in a country where I could participate

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.503
in the technological revolution.

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:26.944
There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet,

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:30.168
but those of us who've shared in the technological changes

00:01:30.168 --> 00:01:33.172
mainly come from North America, Europe,

00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:37.597
Japan and other developed parts of the world.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.770
Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.673
and around the world,

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:43.340
but I think they've changed the lives

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.883
of we blind people more than any other group.

00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:50.161
And so I want to tell you about the interaction

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.213
between computer-based adaptive technology

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:57.875
and the many volunteers who helped me over the years

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:01.276
to become the person I am today.

00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:03.910
It's an interaction between volunteers,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.831
passionate inventors and technology,

00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:09.766
and it's a story that many other blind people could tell.

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:14.181
But let me tell you a bit about it today.

00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:18.007
When I was five, I went to school and I learned braille.

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.531
It's an ingenious system of six dots

00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.265
that are punched into paper,

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:25.652
and I can feel them with my fingers.

00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:28.828
In fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report.

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:31.553
I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from.

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:33.109
(Laughter)

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.930
I was pretty good in reading,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.890
but religion and musical appreciation needed more work.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.366
(Laughter)

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:43.453
When you leave the opera house,

00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:46.862
you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts.

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:50.579
Look for it. Have you noticed it?

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.309
I do. I look for it all the time.

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.395
(Laughter)

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:57.734
When I was at school,

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:01.026
the books were transcribed by transcribers,

00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:03.859
voluntary people who punched one dot at a time

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.527
so I'd have volumes to read,

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.986
and that had been going on, mainly by women,

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:10.659
since the late 19th century in this country,

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.143
but it was the only way I could read.

00:03:13.143 --> 00:03:15.537
When I was in high school,

00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:19.343
I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder,

00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:22.732
and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer

00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:24.912
medium of learning.

00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:28.051
I could have family and friends read me material,

00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:30.444
and I could then read it back

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:33.000
as many times as I needed.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.520
And it brought me into contact

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.530
with volunteers and helpers.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.022
For example, when I studied at graduate school

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:43.259
at Queen's University in Canada,

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.342
the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me.

00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:50.147
I gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:51.433
As one of them said to me,

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:54.192
"Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment."

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.653
(Laughter)

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.958
But think of it. These men,

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.905
who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had,

00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:07.181
helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law

00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.600
by their dedicated help.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.961
Well, I went back and became an academic

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.603
at Melbourne's Monash University,

00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:19.113
and for those 25 years,

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:21.926
tape recorders were everything to me.

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:24.377
In fact, in my office in 1990,

00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:28.904
I had 18 miles of tape.

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:35.809
Students, family and friends all read me material.

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.346
Mrs. Lois Doery,

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:40.324
whom I later came to call my surrogate mum,

00:04:40.324 --> 00:04:43.976
read me many thousands of hours onto tape.

00:04:43.976 --> 00:04:46.440
One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.929
was that I was hoping that Lois would be here

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:52.966
so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her.

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:56.715
But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today.

00:04:56.715 --> 00:05:01.303
But I thank you here, Lois, from this platform.

00:05:01.303 --> 00:05:08.291
(Applause)

00:05:13.776 --> 00:05:20.635
I saw my first Apple computer in 1984,

00:05:20.635 --> 00:05:22.160
and I thought to myself,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.128
"This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me."

00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:31.182
How very wrong I was.

00:05:31.182 --> 00:05:35.715
In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born,

00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:38.169
I got my first blind computer,

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.383
and it's actually here.

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:43.318
See it up there?

00:05:43.318 --> 00:05:47.601
And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.

00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:51.919
(Laughter)

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.913
It's a blind computer.

00:05:53.913 --> 00:05:55.813
(Laughter)

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:58.418
It's a Keynote Gold 84k,

00:05:58.418 --> 00:06:02.594
and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:05.495
(Laughter)

00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:10.433
Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter)

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:15.127
I think there's more memory in my watch.

00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:18.147
It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor

00:06:18.147 --> 00:06:20.945
in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:24.747
Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005,

00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:27.605
but his memory lives on in my heart.

00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:29.857
It meant, for the first time,

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:33.188
I could read back what I had typed into it.

00:06:33.188 --> 00:06:35.145
It had a speech synthesizer.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.405
I'd written my first coauthored labor law book

00:06:37.405 --> 00:06:42.231
on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.

00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:46.542
This now allowed me to read back what I'd written

00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:48.220
and to enter the computer world,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.620
even with its 84k of memory.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.008
In 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor,

00:06:57.008 --> 00:06:59.758
worked on building a machine that would scan books

00:06:59.758 --> 00:07:02.289
and read them out in synthetic speech.

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.836
Optical character recognition units then

00:07:04.836 --> 00:07:07.576
only operated usually on one font,

00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:11.920
but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.426
and speech synthesizers,

00:07:13.426 --> 00:07:17.832
he developed a machine that could read any font.

00:07:17.832 --> 00:07:20.963
And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine,

00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:24.937
was launched on the 13th of January, 1976.

00:07:24.937 --> 00:07:28.020
I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.327
in March 1989, and it blew me away,

00:07:31.327 --> 00:07:34.117
and in September 1989,

00:07:34.117 --> 00:07:37.310
the month that my associate professorship

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.282
at Monash University was announced,

00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:43.140
the law school got one, and I could use it.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.173
For the first time, I could read what I wanted to read

00:07:47.173 --> 00:07:48.581
by putting a book on the scanner.

00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:51.297
I didn't have to be nice to people!

00:07:51.297 --> 00:07:53.940
(Laughter)

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.089
I no longer would be censored.

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:59.130
For example, I was too shy then,

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.602
and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody

00:08:01.602 --> 00:08:04.415
to read me out loud sexually explicit material.

00:08:04.415 --> 00:08:08.387
(Laughter)

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:11.875
But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and --

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:17.598
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:21.528 --> 00:08:24.712
Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply

00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:26.996
a program on my laptop.

00:08:26.996 --> 00:08:28.340
That's what it's shrunk to.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.430
And now I can scan the latest novel

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.635
and not wait to get it into talking book libraries.

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:35.896
I can keep up with my friends.

00:08:35.896 --> 00:08:39.136
There are many people who have helped me in my life,

00:08:39.136 --> 00:08:41.767
and many that I haven't met.

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:45.416
One is another American inventor Ted Henter.

00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:47.788
Ted was a motorcycle racer,

00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:52.020
but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.579
which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes.

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:58.375
He then turned to being a waterskier

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:01.887
and was a champion disabled waterskier.

00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:05.134
But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce

00:09:05.134 --> 00:09:09.269
to develop a program that would read out

00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:11.020
what was on the computer screen

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.024
from the Net or from what was on the computer.

00:09:13.024 --> 00:09:16.531
It's called JAWS, Job Access With Speech,

00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:18.535
and it sounds like this.

00:09:18.535 --> 00:09:22.420
(JAWS speaking)

00:09:29.985 --> 00:09:31.748
Ron McCallum: Isn't that slow?

00:09:31.748 --> 00:09:32.718
(Laughter)

00:09:32.718 --> 00:09:34.986
You see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep.

00:09:34.986 --> 00:09:36.195
I slowed it down for you.

00:09:36.195 --> 00:09:39.467
I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.

00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:41.982
Can we play that one?

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:46.737
(JAWS speaking)

00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:57.832
(Laughter)

00:09:57.832 --> 00:09:59.653
RM: You know, when you're marking student essays,

00:09:59.653 --> 00:10:01.570
you want to get through them fairly quickly.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:08.648
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:14.722
This technology that fascinated me in 1987

00:10:14.722 --> 00:10:18.443
is now on my iPhone and on yours as well.

00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:21.977
But, you know, I find reading with machines

00:10:21.977 --> 00:10:24.390
a very lonely process.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.329
I grew up with family, friends, reading to me,

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:32.248
and I loved the warmth and the breath

00:10:32.248 --> 00:10:34.602
and the closeness of people reading.

00:10:34.602 --> 00:10:36.875
Do you love being read to?

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:39.675
And one of my most enduring memories

00:10:39.675 --> 00:10:45.124
is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children

00:10:45.124 --> 00:10:47.520
down near Manly Beach

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.925
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."

00:10:50.925 --> 00:10:53.228
Isn't that a great book?

00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:56.060
I still love being close to someone reading to me.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.821
But I wouldn't give up the technology,

00:10:57.821 --> 00:11:03.111
because it's allowed me to lead a great life.

00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:05.798
Of course, talking books for the blind

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.410
predated all this technology.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.889
After all, the long-playing record was developed

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:12.278
in the early 1930s,

00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:14.967
and now we put talking books on CDs

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:20.530
using the digital access system known as DAISY.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.712
But when I'm reading with synthetic voices,

00:11:23.712 --> 00:11:26.662
I love to come home and read a racy novel

00:11:26.662 --> 00:11:30.612
with a real voice.

00:11:30.612 --> 00:11:32.684
Now there are still barriers

00:11:32.684 --> 00:11:34.677
in front of we people with disabilities.

00:11:34.677 --> 00:11:37.595
Many websites we can't read using JAWS

00:11:37.595 --> 00:11:38.882
and the other technologies.

00:11:38.882 --> 00:11:41.086
Websites are often very visual,

00:11:41.086 --> 00:11:42.533
and there are all these sorts of graphs

00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:45.484
that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled,

00:11:45.484 --> 00:11:49.281
and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3,

00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:54.844
known as W3C, has developed worldwide standards

00:11:54.844 --> 00:11:56.258
for the Internet.

00:11:56.258 --> 00:12:01.688
And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:03.910
to make their sites compatible so that

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.586
we persons without vision can have a level playing field.

00:12:08.586 --> 00:12:12.641
There are other barriers brought about by our laws.

00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:15.190
For example, Australia,

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.682
like about one third of the world's countries,

00:12:17.682 --> 00:12:22.226
has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled

00:12:22.226 --> 00:12:24.398
or read for we blind persons.

00:12:24.398 --> 00:12:27.618
But those books can't travel across borders.

00:12:27.618 --> 00:12:30.400
For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.426
accessible books in Spanish.

00:12:32.426 --> 00:12:34.804
In Argentina, there are 50,000.

00:12:34.804 --> 00:12:36.583
In no other Latin American country

00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:38.660
are there more than a couple of thousand.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.765
But it's not legal to transport the books

00:12:40.765 --> 00:12:43.590
from Spain to Latin America.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.347
There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books

00:12:46.347 --> 00:12:49.223
in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.,

00:12:49.223 --> 00:12:51.912
but they can't be transported to the 60 countries

00:12:51.912 --> 00:12:54.886
in our world where English is the first and the second language.

00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:58.297
And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter.

00:12:58.297 --> 00:13:01.411
Well, because we can't transport books across borders,

00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:03.335
there had to be separate versions read

00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:06.264
in all the different English-speaking countries:

00:13:06.264 --> 00:13:09.315
Britain, United States, Canada, Australia,

00:13:09.315 --> 00:13:11.396
and New Zealand all had to have

00:13:11.396 --> 00:13:14.139
separate readings of Harry Potter.

00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:17.253
And that's why, next month in Morocco,

00:13:17.253 --> 00:13:19.752
a meeting is taking place between all the countries.

00:13:19.752 --> 00:13:21.155
It's something that a group of countries

00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:23.283
and the World Blind Union are advocating,

00:13:23.283 --> 00:13:25.601
a cross-border treaty

00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:28.739
so that if books are available under a copyright exception

00:13:28.739 --> 00:13:30.708
and the other country has a copyright exception,

00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:33.106
we can transport those books across borders

00:13:33.106 --> 00:13:36.322
and give life to people, particularly in developing countries,

00:13:36.322 --> 00:13:40.247
blind people who don't have the books to read.

00:13:40.247 --> 00:13:42.359
I want that to happen.

00:13:42.359 --> 00:13:50.598
(Applause)

00:13:50.598 --> 00:13:53.863
My life has been extraordinarily blessed

00:13:53.863 --> 00:13:56.497
with marriage and children

00:13:56.497 --> 00:13:59.576
and certainly interesting work to do,

00:13:59.576 --> 00:14:02.230
whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School,

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.502
where I served a term as dean,

00:14:03.502 --> 00:14:07.023
or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee

00:14:07.023 --> 00:14:10.163
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva.

00:14:10.163 --> 00:14:15.158
I've indeed been a very fortunate human being.

00:14:15.158 --> 00:14:18.166
I wonder what the future will hold.

00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:21.857
The technology will advance even further,

00:14:21.857 --> 00:14:25.525
but I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago,

00:14:25.525 --> 00:14:27.459
"Remember, darling,

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:31.604
you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers."

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:36.781
I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers,

00:14:36.781 --> 00:14:39.678
volunteer readers and passionate inventors,

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:42.868
has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me

00:14:42.868 --> 00:14:45.872
and for blind people throughout the world.

00:14:45.872 --> 00:14:49.518
I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin,

00:14:49.518 --> 00:14:52.488
who is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides,

00:14:52.488 --> 00:14:56.879
and my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life,

00:14:56.879 --> 00:14:58.237
is coming on to collect me.

00:14:58.237 --> 00:14:59.432
I want to thank her too.

00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:01.432
I think I have to say goodbye now.

00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:03.003
Bless you. Thank you very much.

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:04.727
(Applause)

00:15:04.727 --> 00:15:13.965
Yay! (Applause)

00:15:20.602 --> 00:15:26.571
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (Applause)
