00:00:00.822 --> 00:00:04.257
So over the long course of human history,

00:00:04.257 --> 00:00:06.749
the infectious disease that's killed more humans

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:09.235
than any other is malaria.

00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:12.096
It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos,

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:14.305
and it's probably our oldest scourge.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:18.192
We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.

00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:21.794
And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.

00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:24.245
We've got 300 million cases a year

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:27.237
and over half a million deaths.

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:30.202
Now this really makes no sense.

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.854
We've known how to cure malaria

00:00:32.854 --> 00:00:34.494
since the 1600s.

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:36.791
That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru

00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:39.693
discovered the bark of the cinchona tree,

00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:41.566
and inside that bark was quinine,

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.904
still an effective cure for malaria to this day.

00:00:44.904 --> 00:00:47.805
So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:50.989
We've known how to prevent malaria since 1897.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.262
That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:56.620
discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.812
not bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.

00:01:00.812 --> 00:01:06.095
So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve,

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:10.025
and yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:13.500
are going to die from the bite of a mosquito.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.745
Why is that?

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:16.275
This is a question that's

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.430
personally intrigued me for a long time.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.189
I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.448
visiting my cousins in India every summer,

00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:26.636
and because I had no immunity to the local malarias,

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:30.870
I was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.561
while my cousins, they were allowed to sleep

00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:33.790
out on the terrace and have

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.552
this nice, cool night breeze wafting over them.

00:01:36.552 --> 00:01:40.076
And I really hated the mosquitos for that.

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:43.444
But at the same time, I come from a Jain family,

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:45.758
and Jainism is a religion that espouses

00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:48.896
a very extreme form of nonviolence.

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:52.224
So Jains are not supposed to eat meat.

00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:54.081
We're not supposed to walk on grass,

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.342
because you could, you know,

00:01:55.342 --> 00:01:57.242
inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.019
We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.735
So the fearsome power of this little insect

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:05.714
was apparent to me from a very young age,

00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:08.985
and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist

00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:11.673
trying to understand, why has malaria

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:16.213
been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long?

00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:18.870
And I think there's three main reasons why.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.338
Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason,

00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:24.149
which is probably the biggest reason of all.

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.110
The first reason is certainly scientific.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.425
This little parasite that causes malaria,

00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:31.352
it's probably one of the most complex

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:33.943
and wily pathogens known to humankind.

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:37.283
It lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito

00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:41.685
and half its life inside the warm-blooded human.

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:44.683
These two environments are totally different,

00:02:44.683 --> 00:02:47.699
but not only that, they're both utterly hostile.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.706
So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite,

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:54.667
and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off.

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:58.417
This little creature survives under siege like that,

00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:01.492
but not only does it survive, it has thrived.

00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:05.814
It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know.

00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:07.928
It's a shape-shifter, for one thing.

00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:11.087
Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly,

00:03:11.087 --> 00:03:13.726
the malaria parasite transforms itself like that

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:16.949
seven times in its life cycle.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.206
And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other,

00:03:21.206 --> 00:03:24.270
they have totally different physiology.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.262
So say you came up with some great drug

00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:29.202
that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle.

00:03:29.202 --> 00:03:32.667
It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages.

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:35.530
It can hide in our bodies, undetected,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.894
unbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks,

00:03:37.894 --> 00:03:41.693
for months, for years, in some cases even decades.

00:03:41.693 --> 00:03:46.077
So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle,

00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:49.282
but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite.

00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:51.580
Only about 12 species of mosquitos

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.514
carry most of the world's malaria,

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:55.990
and we know quite a bit about the kinds of

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.915
watery habitats that they specialize in.

00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:01.197
So you might think, then, well, why don't we just

00:04:01.197 --> 00:04:04.353
avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live? Right?

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:06.631
We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live

00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:09.390
and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.620
But say you live in the tropics

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.893
and you walk outside your hut one day

00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:17.915
and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.838
around your home.

00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:23.068
Or say your cow does, or say your pig does,

00:04:23.068 --> 00:04:25.202
and then, say, it rains,

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:27.570
and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.651
That's it. You've created the perfect

00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:33.229
malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door.

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.091
So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects.

00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:38.725
We kind of create places that they love to live

00:04:38.725 --> 00:04:40.724
just by living our own lives.

00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:42.103
So there's a huge scientific challenge,

00:04:42.103 --> 00:04:44.310
but there's a huge economic challenge too.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.245
Malaria occurs in some of the poorest

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.184
and most remote places on Earth,

00:04:48.184 --> 00:04:50.029
and there's a reason for that.

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.729
If you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.882
If you're poor, you're more likely to live

00:04:54.882 --> 00:04:58.951
in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.

00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:01.540
These are places where mosquitos breed.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.140
You're less likely to have door screens or window screens.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.043
You're less likely to have electricity

00:05:07.043 --> 00:05:10.049
and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible,

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:11.282
so you're outside more.

00:05:11.282 --> 00:05:13.614
You're getting bitten by mosquitos more.

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.239
So poverty causes malaria,

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:18.272
but what we also know now is that malaria itself

00:05:18.272 --> 00:05:19.919
causes poverty.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.570
For one thing, it strikes hardest during harvest season,

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.326
so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields

00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:29.235
collecting their crops, they're home sick with a fever.

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:32.096
But it also predisposes people to death

00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:33.881
from all other causes.

00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:35.241
So this has happened historically.

00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:38.623
We've been able to take malaria out of a society.

00:05:38.623 --> 00:05:40.080
Everything else stays the same,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.755
so we still have bad food, bad water, bad sanitation,

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:44.516
all the things that make people sick.

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:46.660
But just if you take malaria out,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.472
deaths from everything else go down.

00:05:50.472 --> 00:05:53.183
And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified

00:05:53.183 --> 00:05:55.368
what this means for a society.

00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:58.122
What it means is, if you have malaria in your society,

00:05:58.122 --> 00:06:00.583
your economic growth is depressed

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:04.553
by 1.3 percent every year,

00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:08.352
year after year after year, just this one disease alone.

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:10.916
So this poses a huge economic challenge,

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:13.100
because say you do come up with your great drug

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.310
or your great vaccine -- how do you deliver it

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.880
in a place where there's no roads,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.073
there's no infrastructure,

00:06:19.073 --> 00:06:22.407
there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold,

00:06:22.407 --> 00:06:25.127
there's no clinics, there's no clinicians

00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:27.661
to deliver these things where they're needed?

00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:31.664
So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria.

00:06:31.664 --> 00:06:34.720
But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.532
there's also a cultural challenge,

00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:39.917
and this is probably the part about malaria

00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:42.218
that people don't like to talk about.

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:44.929
And it's the paradox that the people

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:46.737
who have the most malaria in the world

00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:49.317
tend to care about it the least.

00:06:49.317 --> 00:06:52.729
This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.496
They ask people in malarious parts of the world,

00:06:55.496 --> 00:06:57.552
"What do you think about malaria?"

00:06:57.552 --> 00:07:01.461
And they don't say, "It's a killer disease. We're scared of it."

00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:06.799
They say, "Malaria is a normal problem of life."

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:08.565
And that was certainly my personal experience.

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.584
When I told my relatives in India

00:07:10.584 --> 00:07:12.068
that I was writing a book about malaria,

00:07:12.068 --> 00:07:14.035
they kind of looked at me like

00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:16.736
I told them I was writing a book about warts or something.

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.783
Like, why would you write about something so boring,

00:07:19.783 --> 00:07:21.449
so ordinary? You know?

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.177
And it's simple risk perception, really.

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:26.612
A child in Malawi, for example,

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:31.424
she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two,

00:07:31.424 --> 00:07:33.477
but if she survives,

00:07:33.477 --> 00:07:36.091
she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life,

00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:38.814
but she's much less likely to die of it.

00:07:38.814 --> 00:07:40.766
And so in her lived experience,

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:44.097
malaria is something that comes and goes.

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:46.127
And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria.

00:07:46.127 --> 00:07:49.704
Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own.

00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:52.828
It's just, there's so much malaria

00:07:52.828 --> 00:07:56.599
that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:59.560
add up to this big, huge number.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.553
So I think people in malarious parts of the world

00:08:01.553 --> 00:08:03.075
must think of malaria the way

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:04.734
those of us who live in the temperate world

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.985
think of cold and flu. Right?

00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:10.391
Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies

00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:12.072
and on our own lives,

00:08:12.072 --> 00:08:13.336
but we don't really even take

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:15.878
the most rudimentary precautions against it because

00:08:15.878 --> 00:08:18.599
we consider it normal to get cold and flu

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.836
during cold and flu season.

00:08:20.836 --> 00:08:25.248
And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria,

00:08:25.248 --> 00:08:29.022
because if people think it's normal to have malaria,

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:32.480
then how do you get them to run to the doctor

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.626
to get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription,

00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:37.148
to get it filled, to take the drugs,

00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:40.627
to put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?

00:08:40.627 --> 00:08:45.294
This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease.

00:08:45.294 --> 00:08:46.796
So take all that together.

00:08:46.796 --> 00:08:51.248
We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated,

00:08:51.248 --> 00:08:53.676
it's economically challenging to deal with,

00:08:53.676 --> 00:08:55.321
and it's one for which the people who stand

00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:57.625
to benefit the most care about it the least.

00:08:57.625 --> 00:08:59.713
And that adds up to the biggest problem of all,

00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:02.662
which, of course, is the political problem.

00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:05.520
How do you get a political leader to do anything

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.581
about a problem like this?

00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:12.206
And the answer is, historically, you don't.

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:14.339
Most malarious societies throughout history

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:16.455
have simply lived with the disease.

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.458
So the main attacks on malaria have come

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:21.082
from outside of malarious societies,

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:22.876
from people who aren't constrained

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:25.855
by these rather paralyzing politics.

00:09:25.855 --> 00:09:29.150
But this, I think, introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.570
The first concerted attack against malaria

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.316
started in the 1950s.

00:09:33.316 --> 00:09:36.406
It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department.

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:39.443
And this effort well understood the economic challenge.

00:09:39.443 --> 00:09:42.924
They knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools,

00:09:42.924 --> 00:09:44.699
and they focused on DDT.

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:46.138
They understood the cultural challenge.

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:49.143
In fact, their rather patronizing view was that

00:09:49.143 --> 00:09:52.046
people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all.

00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:55.768
Everything should be done to them and for them.

00:09:55.768 --> 00:09:58.888
But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.

00:09:58.888 --> 00:10:01.215
They had so much faith in their tools

00:10:01.215 --> 00:10:04.206
that they stopped doing malaria research.

00:10:04.206 --> 00:10:06.674
And so when those tools started to fail,

00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:09.374
and public opinion started to turn against those tools,

00:10:09.374 --> 00:10:13.568
they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do.

00:10:13.568 --> 00:10:17.019
The whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back,

00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:18.833
but now it was even worse than before

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:21.594
because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places

00:10:21.594 --> 00:10:24.780
in the most difficult-to-control forms.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.079
One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:33.136
"one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health."

00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:35.643
The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s.

00:10:35.643 --> 00:10:39.355
It's similarly directed and financed primarily

00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:41.503
from outside of malarious societies.

00:10:41.503 --> 00:10:44.007
Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge.

00:10:44.007 --> 00:10:46.228
They are doing tons of malaria research.

00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:48.681
And they understand the economic challenge too.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:52.241
They're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools.

00:10:52.241 --> 00:10:56.133
But now, I think, the dilemma is the cultural challenge.

00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:59.767
The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net.

00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:01.543
It's treated with insecticides.

00:11:01.543 --> 00:11:03.913
This thing has been distributed across the malarious world

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.346
by the millions.

00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:07.578
And when you think about the bed net,

00:11:07.578 --> 00:11:10.137
it's sort of a surgical intervention.

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:12.283
You know, it doesn't really have any value

00:11:12.283 --> 00:11:15.946
to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria.

00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:19.955
And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night.

00:11:19.955 --> 00:11:21.232
They have to sleep under them every night.

00:11:21.232 --> 00:11:23.269
That's the only way they are effective.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:24.622
And they have to do that

00:11:24.622 --> 00:11:27.708
even if the net blocks the breeze,

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:30.853
even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night

00:11:30.853 --> 00:11:32.387
and relieve themselves,

00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:34.636
even if they might have to move all their furnishings

00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:36.103
to put this thing up,

00:11:36.103 --> 00:11:38.956
even if, you know, they might live in a round hut

00:11:38.956 --> 00:11:42.693
in which it's difficult to string up a square net.

00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:47.631
Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease.

00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:49.962
I mean, these are minor inconveniences.

00:11:49.962 --> 00:11:53.801
But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.

00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:58.681
So for them, the calculus must be quite different.

00:11:58.681 --> 00:12:02.599
Imagine, for example, if a bunch of well-meaning Kenyans

00:12:02.599 --> 00:12:04.680
came up to those of us in the temperate world and said,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.502
"You know, you people have a lot of cold and flu.

00:12:07.502 --> 00:12:10.630
We've designed this great, easy-to-use, cheap tool,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.700
we're going to give it to you for free.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.133
It's called a face mask,

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:17.006
and all you need to do is

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:19.416
wear it every day during cold and flu season

00:12:19.416 --> 00:12:22.170
when you go to school and when you go to work."

00:12:22.185 --> 00:12:24.115
Would we do that?

00:12:24.115 --> 00:12:26.251
And I wonder if that's how people

00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:28.317
in the malarious world thought of those nets

00:12:28.317 --> 00:12:30.020
when they first received them?

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.418
Indeed, we know from studies

00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:36.096
that only 20 percent of the bed nets

00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:39.264
that were first distributed were actually used.

00:12:39.264 --> 00:12:40.975
And even that's probably an overestimate,

00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:43.397
because the same people who distributed the nets

00:12:43.397 --> 00:12:44.888
went back and asked the recipients,

00:12:44.888 --> 00:12:47.361
"Oh, did you use that net I gave you?"

00:12:47.361 --> 00:12:49.973
Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you,

00:12:49.973 --> 00:12:52.934
"Oh, did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas?"

00:12:52.934 --> 00:12:54.800
So it's probably an overestimate.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.124
But that's not an insurmountable problem.

00:12:58.124 --> 00:12:59.954
We can do more education,

00:12:59.954 --> 00:13:02.629
we can try to convince these people to use the nets.

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:03.904
And that's what happening now.

00:13:03.904 --> 00:13:05.608
We're throwing a lot more time and money

00:13:05.608 --> 00:13:10.125
into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays

00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:12.538
and school meetings,

00:13:12.538 --> 00:13:14.833
all these things to convince people

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:17.317
to use the nets we gave you.

00:13:17.317 --> 00:13:19.457
And that might work.

00:13:19.457 --> 00:13:22.135
But it takes time. It takes money.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.915
It takes resources. It takes infrastructure.

00:13:24.915 --> 00:13:27.597
It takes all the things that that cheap,

00:13:27.597 --> 00:13:30.376
easy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be.

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:33.780
So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies,

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.318
but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it

00:13:36.318 --> 00:13:39.128
from outside of those societies.

00:13:39.128 --> 00:13:40.915
We end up imposing our own priorities

00:13:40.915 --> 00:13:42.459
on the people of the malarious world.

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:45.253
That's exactly what we did in the 1950s,

00:13:45.253 --> 00:13:47.131
and that effort backfired.

00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:48.762
I would argue today,

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:52.992
when we are distributing tools that we've designed

00:13:52.992 --> 00:13:56.745
and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives,

00:13:56.745 --> 00:14:00.298
we run the risk of making the same mistake again.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.106
That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable,

00:14:02.106 --> 00:14:03.569
because I think it is,

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:05.777
but what if we attacked this disease

00:14:05.777 --> 00:14:09.320
according to the priorities of the people who lived with it?

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.756
Take the example of England and the United States.

00:14:11.756 --> 00:14:14.927
We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years,

00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:17.085
and we got rid of it completely,

00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:20.094
not because we attacked malaria. We didn't.

00:14:20.094 --> 00:14:24.201
We attacked bad roads and bad houses

00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:29.083
and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.

00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:32.400
We attacked the malarious way of life,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:38.120
and by doing that, we slowly built malaria out.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.758
Now attacking the malarious way of life,

00:14:39.758 --> 00:14:43.320
this is something -- these are things people care about today.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.707
And attacking the malarious way of life,

00:14:45.707 --> 00:14:50.466
it's not fast, it's not cheap, it's not easy,

00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:53.534
but I think it's the only lasting way forward.

00:14:53.534 --> 00:14:54.827
Thank you so much.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:15:00.274
