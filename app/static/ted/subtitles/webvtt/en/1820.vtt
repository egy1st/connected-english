00:00:00.713 --> 00:00:02.345
I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals'

00:00:02.345 --> 00:00:04.807
latest and nastiest creations.

00:00:04.807 --> 00:00:07.715
So basically, please don't go and download

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:10.411
any of the viruses that I show you.

00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:13.429
Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like,

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.598
and I thought I'd give you a quick insight

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.276
into my career so far.

00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:20.777
It's a pretty accurate description.

00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:22.433
This is what someone that specializes

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.853
in malware and hacking looks like.

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:28.267
So today, computer viruses and trojans,

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:31.147
designed to do everything from stealing data

00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:33.188
to watching you in your webcam

00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:35.966
to the theft of billions of dollars.

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.161
Some malicious code today goes as far

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:42.304
as targeting power, utilities and infrastructure.

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:44.265
Let me give you a quick snapshot

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:46.879
of what malicious code is capable of today.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.949
Right now, every second, eight new users

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.104
are joining the Internet.

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:59.412
Today, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses.

00:00:59.412 --> 00:01:05.185
We will see 30,000 new infected websites.

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:07.271
And, just to kind of tear down a myth here,

00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:09.759
lots of people think that when you get infected

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.210
with a computer virus, it's because you went to a porn site.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.653
Right? Well, actually, statistically speaking,

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:18.778
if you only visit porn sites, you're safer.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.780
People normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter)

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.342
Actually, about 80 percent of these

00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:26.855
are small business websites getting infected.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:29.140
Today's cybercriminal, what do they look like?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.566
Well, many of you have the image, don't you,

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.742
of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement,

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:36.130
hacking away for notoriety.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.753
But actually today, cybercriminals

00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:41.064
are wonderfully professional and organized.

00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:43.935
In fact, they have product adverts.

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:46.066
You can go online and buy a hacking service

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.215
to knock your business competitor offline.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:49.774
Check out this one I found.

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:51.593
(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,

00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:53.058
and that reason is

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:54.970
because you need your business competitors,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.922
rivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,

00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:00.666
they are to go down.

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:03.526
Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:05.942
If you want your business competitors to go down,

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:07.278
well, they can.

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:10.702
If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.

00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:13.729
Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.084
DDOS service or scheduled attack,

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:19.895
starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:22.799
to 10 to 50 dollars per hour.

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.122
James Lyne: Now, I did actually pay

00:02:24.122 --> 00:02:26.915
one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:30.409
Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.123
Turns out that's not cool.

00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:35.133
But regardless, it's amazing how many products

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:38.245
and services are available now to cybercriminals.

00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:40.721
For example, this testing platform,

00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:42.436
which enables the cybercriminals

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:44.918
to test the quality of their viruses

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:47.370
before they release them on the world.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.327
For a small fee, they can upload it

00:02:49.327 --> 00:02:50.993
and make sure everything is good.

00:02:50.993 --> 00:02:52.526
But it goes further.

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:54.771
Cybercriminals now have crime packs

00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:57.890
with business intelligence reporting dashboards

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.366
to manage the distribution of their malicious code.

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:04.894
This is the market leader in malware distribution,

00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:06.532
the Black Hole Exploit Pack,

00:03:06.532 --> 00:03:10.191
responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:12.165
in the last couple of quarters.

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:15.174
It comes with technical installation guides,

00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:16.219
video setup routines,

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.174
and get this, technical support.

00:03:20.174 --> 00:03:22.562
You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you

00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:26.184
how to set up your illegal hacking server.

00:03:26.184 --> 00:03:30.468
So let me show you what malicious code looks like today.

00:03:30.468 --> 00:03:32.780
What I've got here is two systems,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.470
an attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.772
and a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.

00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:42.501
Now normally, these would be on different sides

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:45.056
of the planet or of the Internet,

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:46.452
but I've put them side by side

00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:49.116
because it makes things much more interesting.

00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:51.171
Now, there are many ways you can get infected.

00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:53.763
You will have come in contact with some of them.

00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:55.859
Maybe some of you have received an email

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.944
that says something like, "Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:02.708
and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.135
because I like your face."

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:08.529
Or funnycats.exe, which rumor has it

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:12.298
was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.

00:04:12.298 --> 00:04:14.728
Now there are many ways you can get infected.

00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:16.715
I want to show you a couple of my favorites.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.375
This is a little USB key.

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:21.532
Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business?

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:25.657
Well, you could try looking really cute.

00:04:25.657 --> 00:04:27.595
Awww.

00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:29.958
Or, in my case, awkward and pathetic.

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.147
So imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,

00:04:34.147 --> 00:04:36.989
looking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:38.888
which I've covered in coffee,

00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:42.275
and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key

00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:44.224
and print me a new one.

00:04:44.224 --> 00:04:47.454
So let's have a look here on my victim computer.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:50.700
What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.190
After a couple of seconds,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.941
things start to happen on the computer on their own,

00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:56.876
usually a bad sign.

00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:58.570
This would, of course, normally happen

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.328
in a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,

00:05:01.328 --> 00:05:02.988
but I've kind of slowed it down

00:05:02.988 --> 00:05:05.818
so you can actually see the attack occurring.

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:08.335
Malware is very boring otherwise.

00:05:08.335 --> 00:05:10.932
So this is writing out the malicious code,

00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:14.729
and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.027
you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.958
Now if I place the mouse cursor over it,

00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.265
this is what we call a command prompt,

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:27.062
and using this we can navigate around the computer.

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:29.221
We can access your documents, your data.

00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:30.722
You can turn on the webcam.

00:05:30.722 --> 00:05:32.351
That can be very embarrassing.

00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:34.074
Or just to really prove a point,

00:05:34.074 --> 00:05:37.195
we can launch programs like my personal favorite,

00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:40.000
the Windows Calculator.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.288
So isn't it amazing how much control

00:05:42.288 --> 00:05:45.183
the attackers can get with such a simple operation?

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:47.114
Let me show you how most malware

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:49.297
is now distributed today.

00:05:49.297 --> 00:05:51.817
What I'm going to do is open up a website

00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:53.133
that I wrote.

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:57.448
It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.

00:05:57.448 --> 00:05:59.642
And it's got a comments section here

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:03.323
where we can submit comments to the website.

00:06:03.323 --> 00:06:06.330
Many of you will have used something a bit like this before.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.277
Unfortunately, when this was implemented,

00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:10.702
the developer was slightly inebriated

00:06:10.702 --> 00:06:11.944
and managed to forget

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:14.933
all of the secure coding practices he had learned.

00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:17.999
So let's imagine that our attacker,

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:21.447
called Evil Hacker just for comedy value,

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.470
inserts something a little nasty.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.169
This is a script.

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.246
It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.

00:06:29.246 --> 00:06:31.571
So I'm going to submit this post,

00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:33.953
and then, on my victim computer,

00:06:33.953 --> 00:06:35.980
I'm going to open up the web browser

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.233
and browse to my website,

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:42.022
www.incrediblyhacked.com.

00:06:42.022 --> 00:06:44.146
Notice that after a couple of seconds,

00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:45.603
I get redirected.

00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:47.580
That website address at the top there,

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.911
which you can just about see, microshaft.com,

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:54.104
the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,

00:06:54.104 --> 00:06:58.128
and up pops fake antivirus.

00:06:58.128 --> 00:07:03.184
This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,

00:07:03.184 --> 00:07:05.549
and it will go through and it will scan the system,

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:07.057
have a look at what its popping up here.

00:07:07.057 --> 00:07:08.805
It creates some very serious alerts.

00:07:08.805 --> 00:07:11.148
Oh look, a child porn proxy server.

00:07:11.148 --> 00:07:13.580
We really should clean that up.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.164
What's really insulting about this is

00:07:15.164 --> 00:07:19.402
not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,

00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:22.225
but when the scan finishes, they tell you

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:25.348
in order to clean up the fake viruses,

00:07:25.348 --> 00:07:28.024
you have to register the product.

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:31.360
Now I liked it better when viruses were free.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.139
(Laughter)

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:36.665
People now pay cybercriminals money

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:38.766
to run viruses,

00:07:38.766 --> 00:07:41.527
which I find utterly bizarre.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:45.063
So anyway, let me change pace a little bit.

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:48.569
Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.224
is a massive challenge,

00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:52.294
and those numbers are only growing

00:07:52.294 --> 00:07:56.173
directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.

00:07:56.173 --> 00:07:58.049
So I want to talk to you briefly

00:07:58.049 --> 00:08:01.099
about a group of hackers we tracked for a year

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.106
and actually found --

00:08:03.106 --> 00:08:05.683
and this is a rare treat in our job.

00:08:05.683 --> 00:08:08.166
Now this was a cross-industry collaboration,

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:10.555
people from Facebook, independent researchers,

00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:12.636
guys from Sophos.

00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:15.291
So here we have a couple of documents

00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:18.117
which our cybercriminals had uploaded

00:08:18.117 --> 00:08:22.494
to a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,

00:08:22.494 --> 00:08:24.703
like many of you might use.

00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:28.095
At the top, you'll notice a section of source code.

00:08:28.095 --> 00:08:31.063
What this would do is send the cybercriminals

00:08:31.063 --> 00:08:36.103
a text message every day telling them how much money

00:08:36.103 --> 00:08:37.769
they'd made that day,

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:41.065
so a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.

00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:43.822
If you look closely, you'll notice a series

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:46.805
of what are Russian telephone numbers.

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:48.284
Now that's obviously interesting,

00:08:48.284 --> 00:08:51.521
because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.

00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:53.636
Down below, highlighted in red,

00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:55.387
in the other section of source code,

00:08:55.387 --> 00:08:58.130
is this bit "leded:leded."

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.419
That's a username,

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:02.278
kind of like you might have on Twitter.

00:09:02.278 --> 00:09:03.509
So let's take this a little further.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:05.767
There are a few other interesting pieces

00:09:05.767 --> 00:09:08.042
the cybercriminals had uploaded.

00:09:08.042 --> 00:09:10.614
Lots of you here will use smartphones

00:09:10.614 --> 00:09:13.261
to take photos and post them from the conference.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.098
An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones

00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:17.765
is that when you take a photo,

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:22.002
it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.

00:09:22.002 --> 00:09:24.445
In fact, I've been spending a lot of time

00:09:24.445 --> 00:09:26.689
on Internet dating sites recently,

00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:29.100
obviously for research purposes,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.621
and I've noticed that about 60 percent

00:09:32.621 --> 00:09:35.444
of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites

00:09:35.444 --> 00:09:39.895
contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,

00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:40.956
which is kind of scary

00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:43.518
because you wouldn't give out your home address

00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:44.967
to lots of strangers,

00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:46.961
but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:50.990
to plus or minus 15 meters.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.224
And our cybercriminals had done the same thing.

00:09:54.224 --> 00:09:57.428
So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.

00:09:57.428 --> 00:10:01.114
We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.

00:10:01.114 --> 00:10:03.509
We used Google.

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:05.734
Using the email address, the telephone number

00:10:05.734 --> 00:10:09.283
and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert

00:10:09.283 --> 00:10:12.952
for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,

00:10:12.952 --> 00:10:18.300
on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.400
One of these was more stereotypical for me.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.389
A little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.

00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:28.935
Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals

00:10:28.935 --> 00:10:30.803
sharing information scarcely.

00:10:30.803 --> 00:10:31.951
Imagine what you could find

00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:33.654
about each of the people in this room.

00:10:33.654 --> 00:10:35.460
A bit more searching through the profile

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.320
and there's a photo of their office.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.368
They were working on the third floor.

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:41.567
And you can also see some photos

00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:42.742
from his business companion

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:47.581
where he has a taste in a certain kind of image.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:51.576
It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:54.593
But this is where our investigation starts to slow down.

00:10:54.593 --> 00:10:58.536
The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.

00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:00.571
And herein is the greatest lesson

00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:05.149
of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.

00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:08.879
Our friends, our families and our colleagues

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:13.568
can break our security even when we do the right things.

00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:16.348
This is MobSoft, one of the companies

00:11:16.348 --> 00:11:18.514
that this cybercriminal gang owned,

00:11:18.514 --> 00:11:20.103
and an interesting thing about MobSoft

00:11:20.103 --> 00:11:22.974
is the 50-percent owner of this

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.921
posted a job advert,

00:11:24.921 --> 00:11:28.301
and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers

00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:30.453
from the code earlier.

00:11:30.453 --> 00:11:32.578
This woman was Maria,

00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:35.458
and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.

00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:38.978
And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings

00:11:38.978 --> 00:11:41.773
and clicked on every option imaginable

00:11:41.773 --> 00:11:45.470
to make herself really, really insecure.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.037
By the end of the investigation,

00:11:47.037 --> 00:11:50.596
where you can read the full 27-page report at that link,

00:11:50.596 --> 00:11:52.630
we had photos of the cybercriminals,

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.525
even the office Christmas party

00:11:55.525 --> 00:11:57.391
when they were out on an outing.

00:11:57.391 --> 00:12:00.640
That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.228
as it turns out.

00:12:02.228 --> 00:12:04.463
Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.

00:12:04.463 --> 00:12:07.400
Let me come back to that in just a minute.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.147
I want to change pace to one last little demonstration,

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:14.116
a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,

00:12:14.116 --> 00:12:17.181
but is interesting in exposing how much information

00:12:17.181 --> 00:12:18.957
we're all giving away,

00:12:18.957 --> 00:12:23.235
and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.

00:12:23.235 --> 00:12:25.685
This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets

00:12:25.685 --> 00:12:29.903
trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately.

00:12:29.903 --> 00:12:31.589
Many of you all know about the concept

00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:33.932
of scanning for wireless networks.

00:12:33.932 --> 00:12:37.333
You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:41.353
and connect to something like TEDAttendees.

00:12:41.353 --> 00:12:43.100
But what you might not know

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.851
is that you're also beaming out a list of networks

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.273
you've previously connected to,

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:54.420
even when you're not using wireless actively.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.147
So I ran a little scan.

00:12:56.147 --> 00:12:59.073
I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals,

00:12:59.073 --> 00:13:01.617
who wouldn't be so concerned by law,

00:13:01.617 --> 00:13:04.204
and here you can see my mobile device.

00:13:04.204 --> 00:13:06.858
Okay? So you can see a list of wireless networks.

00:13:06.858 --> 00:13:11.485
TEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?

00:13:11.485 --> 00:13:14.978
My home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi,

00:13:14.978 --> 00:13:16.743
which I think is a great name.

00:13:16.743 --> 00:13:19.510
Sophos_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.818
Loganwifi, that's in Boston. HiltonLondon.

00:13:22.818 --> 00:13:25.259
CIASurveillanceVan.

00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:26.868
We called it that at one of our conferences

00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:28.604
because we thought that would freak people out,

00:13:28.604 --> 00:13:30.598
which is quite fun.

00:13:30.598 --> 00:13:35.256
This is how geeks party.

00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:37.463
So let's make this a little bit more interesting.

00:13:37.463 --> 00:13:40.001
Let's talk about you.

00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:42.111
Twenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks

00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:45.226
recently and used the wireless network.

00:13:45.226 --> 00:13:46.390
Things get more interesting.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.836
Forty-six percent of you I could link to a business,

00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:51.706
XYZ Employee network.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:55.885
This isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate.

00:13:55.885 --> 00:14:00.354
Seven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently,

00:14:00.354 --> 00:14:04.193
absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe.

00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:08.141
Two hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live.

00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:10.460
Your wireless network name is so unique

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.009
that I was able to pinpoint it

00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:14.676
using data available openly on the Internet

00:14:14.676 --> 00:14:18.924
with no hacking or clever, clever tricks.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:20.744
And I should mention as well that

00:14:20.744 --> 00:14:22.286
some of you do use your names,

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:24.882
"James Lyne's iPhone," for example.

00:14:24.882 --> 00:14:29.240
And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.244
So something for you to think about:

00:14:31.244 --> 00:14:35.157
As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices,

00:14:35.157 --> 00:14:37.474
as we play with these shiny new toys,

00:14:37.474 --> 00:14:41.296
how much are we trading off convenience

00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:44.186
for privacy and security?

00:14:44.186 --> 00:14:46.244
Next time you install something,

00:14:46.244 --> 00:14:48.548
look at the settings and ask yourself,

00:14:48.548 --> 00:14:52.100
"Is this information that I want to share?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.990
Would someone be able to abuse it?"

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.062
We also need to think very carefully

00:14:57.062 --> 00:15:01.203
about how we develop our future talent pool.

00:15:01.203 --> 00:15:04.182
You see, technology's changing at a staggering rate,

00:15:04.182 --> 00:15:07.358
and that 250,000 pieces of malware

00:15:07.358 --> 00:15:10.230
won't stay the same for long.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.428
There's a very concerning trend

00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:15.621
that whilst many people coming out of schools now

00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:20.033
are much more technology-savvy, they know how to use technology,

00:15:20.033 --> 00:15:23.646
fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects

00:15:23.646 --> 00:15:27.970
to know how that technology works under the covers.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.355
In the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003,

00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:36.130
and there are similar statistics all over the world.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:40.206
We also need to think about the legal issues in this area.

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:41.733
The cybercriminals I talked about,

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.872
despite theft of millions of dollars,

00:15:43.872 --> 00:15:45.981
actually still haven't been arrested,

00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:49.540
and at this point possibly never will.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.040
Most laws are national in their implementation,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.039
despite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet

00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:00.145
is borderless and international by definition.

00:16:00.145 --> 00:16:02.978
Countries do not agree, which makes this area

00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:06.595
exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective.

00:16:06.595 --> 00:16:10.955
But my biggest ask is this:

00:16:10.955 --> 00:16:12.597
You see, you're going to leave here

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:16.314
and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news.

00:16:16.314 --> 00:16:18.488
You're going to read about malware doing incredible

00:16:18.488 --> 00:16:21.749
and terrifying, scary things.

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:25.678
However, 99 percent of it works

00:16:25.678 --> 00:16:29.868
because people fail to do the basics.

00:16:29.868 --> 00:16:32.890
So my ask is this: Go online,

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.535
find these simple best practices,

00:16:35.535 --> 00:16:38.089
find out how to update and patch your computer.

00:16:38.089 --> 00:16:39.640
Get a secure password.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.170
Make sure you use a different password

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.521
on each of your sites and services online.

00:16:44.521 --> 00:16:47.764
Find these resources. Apply them.

00:16:47.764 --> 00:16:50.375
The Internet is a fantastic resource

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.440
for business, for political expression,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.771
for art and for learning.

00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:57.953
Help me and the security community

00:16:57.953 --> 00:17:01.421
make life much, much more difficult

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.373
for cybercriminals.

00:17:03.373 --> 00:17:04.701
Thank you.

00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:09.240
(Applause)
