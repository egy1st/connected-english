00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:03.898
Do you think it's possible
to control someone's attention?

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:08.665
Even more than that,
what about predicting human behavior?

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:12.012
I think those are interesting ideas.

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:14.235
For me, that would be
the perfect superpower,

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.592
actually kind of an evil way
of approaching it.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.719
But for myself, in the past,
I've spent the last 20 years

00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:23.221
studying human behavior
from a rather unorthodox way:

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:24.541
picking pockets.

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.717
When we think of misdirection,

00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:29.082
we think of something
as looking off to the side,

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:31.331
when actually the things
right in front of us

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:32.954
are often the hardest to see,

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:35.917
the things that you look at every day
that you're blinded to.

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.692
For example, how many of you still have
your cell phones on you right now?

00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:41.888
Great. Double-check.

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:43.465
Make sure you still have them.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.171
I was doing some shopping before.

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:46.250
(Laughter)

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:48.192
You've looked at them a few times today,

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:49.566
but I'll ask you a question.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.443
Without looking at it directly yet,

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:54.617
can you remember the icon
in the bottom right corner?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.615
Bring them out, check and see
how accurate you were.

00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:03.533
How'd you do?

00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:05.056
Show of hands. Did we get it?

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:08.160
Now that you're done, close them down.

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:09.912
Every phone has something in common.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.919
No matter how you organize the icons,

00:01:11.943 --> 00:01:13.679
you still have a clock on the front.

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:16.735
So, without looking at your phone,
what time was it?

00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:19.536
You just looked at your clock, right?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.711
Interesting idea.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:23.179
Let's take that a step further
with a game of trust.

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:24.353
Close your eyes.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.608
I realize I'm asking you to do
that while you just heard

00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:30.164
there's a pickpocket in the room,
but close your eyes.

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:33.715
Now, you've been watching me
for about 30 seconds.

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.644
With your eyes closed, what am I wearing?

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:39.139
Make your best guess.

00:01:39.163 --> 00:01:41.919
What color is my shirt?
What color is my tie?

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:44.022
Now open your eyes.

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:45.628
Show of hands, were you right?

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:47.927
Interesting, isn't it?

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:51.071
Some of us are a little bit
more perceptive than others, it seems.

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.031
But I have a different theory
about that model of attention.

00:01:54.055 --> 00:01:57.590
They have fancy models of attention,
Posner's trinity model of attention.

00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:00.948
For me, I like to think of it very
simple, like a surveillance system.

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:03.739
It's kind of like you have
all these fancy sensors,

00:02:03.763 --> 00:02:06.097
and inside your brain
is a little security guard.

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:07.895
For me, I like to call him Frank.

00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:10.488
So Frank is sitting at a desk.

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:12.851
He's got lots of cool
information in front of him,

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.725
high-tech equipment, he's got cameras,

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.855
he's got a little phone
that he can pick up, listen to the ears,

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.020
all these senses, all these perceptions.

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:22.899
But attention is what steers
your perceptions,

00:02:22.923 --> 00:02:24.693
it's what controls your reality.

00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:26.552
It's the gateway to the mind.

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:29.387
If you don't attend to something,
you can't be aware of it.

00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:32.898
But ironically, you can attend
to something without being aware of it.

00:02:32.922 --> 00:02:34.564
For example, the cocktail effect:

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:37.068
You're in a party, having
conversations with someone,

00:02:37.092 --> 00:02:38.775
and yet you can recognize your name

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.952
without realizing
you were listening to that.

00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:44.026
Now, for my job, I have to play
with techniques to exploit this,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.895
to play with your attention
as a limited resource.

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.030
So if I could control
how you spend your attention,

00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:53.063
if I could maybe steal your attention
through a distraction.

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:55.847
Now, instead of doing it like misdirection

00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:57.395
and throwing it off to the side,

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.879
instead, what I choose
to focus on is Frank,

00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:02.450
to be able to play with the Frank
inside your head,

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.625
your security guard,

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.456
and get you, instead of focusing
on your external senses,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.341
just to go internal for a second.

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:12.551
So if I ask you to access
a memory, like, what is that?

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:14.528
What just happened? Do you have a wallet?

00:03:14.552 --> 00:03:16.791
Do you have an American Express
in your wallet?

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:18.983
And when I do that,
your Frank turns around.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.136
He accesses the file.
He has to rewind the tape.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.359
What's interesting is,
he can't rewind the tape

00:03:24.383 --> 00:03:26.913
at the same time that he's trying
to process new data.

00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:28.765
This sounds like a good theory,

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.540
but I could talk for a long time,
tell you lots of things,

00:03:31.564 --> 00:03:33.270
and a portion of them may be true,

00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:36.354
but I think it's better if I tried
to show that to you here live.

00:03:36.378 --> 00:03:38.917
If I come down, I'm going
to do a bit of shopping.

00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:40.455
Just hold still where you are.

00:03:43.503 --> 00:03:46.187
Hello, how are you?
It's lovely to see you.

00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:47.362
Wonderful job onstage.

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:49.450
Lovely watch, it doesn't
come off very well.

00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:50.878
Do you have a ring as well?

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.248
Good. Just taking inventory.
You're like a buffet.

00:03:53.272 --> 00:03:55.741
Hard to tell where to start,
so many great things.

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:57.425
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.362
Hi, sir, could you stand up, please?
Just right where you are.

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.406
You're married,
you follow directions well.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.580
Nice to meet you, sir.

00:04:03.604 --> 00:04:06.326
You don't have a lot in your pockets.
Anything down here?

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.058
Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go.
You're doing well.

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:11.542
Hi, sir, how are you?

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:13.771
Good to see you, sir.
You have a ring, a watch.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.872
Do you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't.

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:18.679
AR: Well, we'll find one for you.
Come on up this way, Joe.

00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:21.774
Give Joe a round of applause.
Come on up, Joe. Let's play a game.

00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:24.561
(Applause)

00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:27.917
AR: Pardon me.

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.627
I don't think I need this clicker anymore.

00:04:30.651 --> 00:04:32.579
Thank you very much. I appreciate that.

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:35.413
Come on up to the stage, Joe.
Let's play a little game now.

00:04:35.437 --> 00:04:37.108
Anything in your front pockets?

00:04:37.132 --> 00:04:38.283
J: Money.

00:04:38.307 --> 00:04:40.536
AR: Money! All right, let's try that.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.702
Can you stand right over this way for me?

00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:44.677
Turn around and, let's see,

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.717
if I give you something
that belongs to me,

00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:48.928
this is just something I have,

00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:50.107
a poker chip.

00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:51.409
Hold out your hand for me.

00:04:52.044 --> 00:04:53.194
Watch it closely.

00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:54.901
This is a task for you to focus on.

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.574
You have your money in your front pocket?

00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:58.749
J: Yup.
AR: Good.

00:04:58.773 --> 00:05:02.465
I won't put my hand in your pocket.
I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:04.222
Once a guy had a hole in his pocket,

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:06.159
and that was rather traumatizing for me.

00:05:06.183 --> 00:05:08.196
I wanted his wallet,
he gave me his number.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.379
Big miscommunication.

00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:10.404
(Laughter)

00:05:10.428 --> 00:05:12.586
Let's do this simply.
Squeeze your hand tight.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.531
Do you feel the poker chip in your hand?

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:15.705
J: I do.

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.028
AR: Would you be surprised
if I took it? Say yes.

00:05:18.052 --> 00:05:19.203
J: Very.
AR: Good.

00:05:19.227 --> 00:05:21.010
Open your hand. Thank you very much.

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:22.734
I'll cheat if you give me a chance.

00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:24.822
Make it harder for me. Just use your hand.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:26.817
Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.

00:05:26.841 --> 00:05:29.015
Did you see it go? Joe: No.

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.849
AR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.

00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:33.991
While we're focused on the hand,
it's sitting on your shoulder.

00:05:35.055 --> 00:05:36.542
Go ahead and take it off.

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.014
Now, let's try that again.

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:39.944
Hold your hand out flat. Open it up.

00:05:39.968 --> 00:05:42.785
Put your hand up a little bit higher,
but watch it close.

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.934
If I did it slowly,
it'd be on your shoulder.

00:05:45.983 --> 00:05:47.399
(Laughter)

00:05:47.423 --> 00:05:49.995
Joe, we're going to keep doing
this till you catch it.

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:52.193
You'll get it eventually.
I have faith in you.

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:54.307
Squeeze firm.
You're human, you're not slow.

00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:55.629
It's back on your shoulder.

00:05:56.241 --> 00:05:58.439
You were focused on your hand, distracted.

00:05:58.463 --> 00:06:01.329
While you were watching,
I couldn't get your watch off.

00:06:01.353 --> 00:06:03.592
Yet you had something inside your pocket.

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:04.990
Do you remember what it was?

00:06:05.418 --> 00:06:06.569
J: Money.

00:06:06.593 --> 00:06:08.637
AR: Check your pocket. Is it still there?

00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:09.662
(Laughter)

00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:11.632
Oh, there it was. Put it away.

00:06:11.656 --> 00:06:12.807
We're just shopping.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.519
This trick's more about the timing.

00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:16.685
I'm going to try to push it
inside your hand.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.879
Put your other hand on top, would you?

00:06:18.903 --> 00:06:20.672
It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:23.201
Looks a lot like the watch
I was wearing, doesn't it?

00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:24.526
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.916
J: That's pretty good.
AR: Oh, thanks.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.202
(Applause)

00:06:29.226 --> 00:06:32.106
But it's only a start.
Let's try it a little bit differently.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.480
Hold your hands together.
Your other hand on top.

00:06:34.504 --> 00:06:36.276
If you're watching this little token,

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.248
this obviously has become
a little target, like a red herring.

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:42.049
If we watch this kind of close,
it looks like it goes away.

00:06:42.073 --> 00:06:43.649
It's not back on your shoulder.

00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:46.245
It falls out of the air,
lands right back in the hand.

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:47.498
Did you see it go?

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:51.670
Yeah, funny. We've got a little guy.
He's union, works up there all day.

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:54.845
If I do it slowly it goes straight away,
it lands by your pocket.

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:56.122
Is it in this pocket, sir?

00:06:56.146 --> 00:06:58.599
Don't reach in your pocket.
That's a different show.

00:06:58.623 --> 00:06:59.693
(Squeaking)

00:06:59.717 --> 00:07:02.061
That's rather strange.
They have shots for that.

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:04.576
Can I show them? Rather bizarre.
Is this yours, sir?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.653
I have no idea how that works.
We'll send that over there.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.050
I need help with this one.

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:10.343
Step over this way for me.

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:13.215
Don't run away. You had something
down by your pants pocket.

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:15.492
I was checking mine.
I couldn't find everything,

00:07:15.516 --> 00:07:17.290
but I noticed you had something here.

00:07:17.314 --> 00:07:19.188
Can I feel the outside for a moment?

00:07:19.212 --> 00:07:21.974
Down here I noticed this.
Is this something of yours, sir?

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.010
I have no idea. That's a shrimp.

00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:26.136
J: Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.184
AR: You've entertained
all of these people in a wonderful way,

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:30.358
better than you know.

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:33.401
So we'd love to give you this
lovely watch as a gift.

00:07:33.425 --> 00:07:34.426
(Laughter)

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.948
Hopefully it matches his taste.

00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:37.635
We have a couple of other things,

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:38.916
a little bit of cash.

00:07:39.373 --> 00:07:40.858
And we have a few other things,

00:07:40.882 --> 00:07:42.048
these all belong to you,

00:07:42.072 --> 00:07:44.750
along with a big round of applause
from all your friends.

00:07:44.774 --> 00:07:45.781
(Applause)

00:07:45.805 --> 00:07:47.011
Joe, thank you very much.

00:07:47.035 --> 00:07:49.968
(Applause)

00:07:51.913 --> 00:07:53.093
(Applause ends)

00:07:53.934 --> 00:07:56.584
So, same question I asked you before,

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:58.936
but this time you don't have
to close your eyes.

00:07:59.866 --> 00:08:01.141
What am I wearing?

00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:02.762
Audience: Oh!

00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:04.715
(Laughter)

00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:07.538
(Hesitant applause)

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:10.950
(Applause ends)

00:08:10.974 --> 00:08:12.875
Attention is a powerful thing.

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:15.384
Like I said, it shapes your reality.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.295
So, I guess I'd like to pose
that question to you.

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.461
If you could control somebody's attention,

00:08:20.485 --> 00:08:21.756
what would you do with it?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.759
Thank you.

00:08:23.783 --> 00:08:29.992
(Applause)
