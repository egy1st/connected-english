00:00:00.883 --> 00:00:04.863
This is our life with bees,

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:08.586
and this is our life without bees.

00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:11.054
Bees are the most important pollinators

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.863
of our fruits and vegetables and flowers

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:17.522
and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:20.210
More than one third of the world's crop production

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.992
is dependent on bee pollination.

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:25.829
But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.746
pollinating our food intentionally.

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:31.617
They're out there because they need to eat.

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:34.336
Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:35.665
from pollen

00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:38.601
and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.366
They're flower-feeders,

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.300
and as they move from flower to flower,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.771
basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,

00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:50.226
they end up providing this valuable pollination service.

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:52.746
In parts of the world where there are no bees,

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:55.652
or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:59.858
people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:03.542
These people are moving pollen from flower to flower

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:05.441
with a paintbrush.

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:07.887
Now this business of hand pollination

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:09.973
is actually not that uncommon.

00:01:09.973 --> 00:01:13.325
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:15.982
with a hand-held vibrator.

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:19.926
Now this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter)

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:25.206
Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:26.986
is held very securely within

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.486
the male part of the flower, the anther,

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:32.860
and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.546
So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:39.669
that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:42.261
and they do this by shaking their flight muscles

00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:46.813
at a frequency similar to the musical note C.

00:01:46.813 --> 00:01:49.399
So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.446
and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:55.185
and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body,

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:57.682
and she takes it home as food.

00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:00.523
Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies

00:02:00.523 --> 00:02:03.054
inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.417
because they get much more efficient pollination

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:06.912
when it's done naturally

00:02:06.912 --> 00:02:10.474
and they get better quality tomatoes.

00:02:10.474 --> 00:02:14.061
So there's other, maybe more personal reasons,

00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:15.484
to care about bees.

00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:19.656
There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world,

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:22.662
and they're absolutely gorgeous.

00:02:22.662 --> 00:02:25.281
These bees spend the majority of their life cycle

00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:28.101
hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem

00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.801
and very few of these beautiful species

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:34.234
have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.

00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:37.854
Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative

00:02:37.854 --> 00:02:41.023
for the other 19,900-plus species

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:43.664
because there's something about honeybees

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:46.513
that draws people into their world.

00:02:46.513 --> 00:02:48.960
Humans have been drawn to honeybees

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.676
since early recorded history,

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:52.152
mostly to harvest their honey,

00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:55.611
which is an amazing natural sweetener.

00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:57.399
I got drawn into the honeybee world

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:59.484
completely by a fluke.

00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:01.806
I was 18 years old and bored,

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.668
and I picked up a book in the library on bees

00:03:04.668 --> 00:03:06.910
and I spent the night reading it.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.837
I had never thought about insects

00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:10.560
living in complex societies.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.962
It was like the best of science fiction come true.

00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:16.856
And even stranger, there were these people,

00:03:16.856 --> 00:03:20.847
these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,

00:03:20.847 --> 00:03:24.150
and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.635
So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:30.832
a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.

00:03:30.832 --> 00:03:34.239
And I was permanently hooked.

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.553
Honeybees can be considered a super-organism,

00:03:37.553 --> 00:03:39.709
where the colony is the organism

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.441
and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000

00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:45.369
individual bee organisms.

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.701
Now this society has no central authority.

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.297
Nobody's in charge.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:52.642
So how they come to collective decisions,

00:03:52.642 --> 00:03:55.622
and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,

00:03:55.622 --> 00:03:58.104
how they communicate where the flowers are,

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:02.268
all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.

00:04:02.268 --> 00:04:06.036
My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years,

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:07.981
is their system of healthcare.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.466
So bees have social healthcare.

00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:15.736
So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:18.075
For example, we study hygiene,

00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:20.961
where some bees are able to locate and weed out

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:24.128
sick individuals from the nest, from the colony,

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:26.592
and it keeps the colony healthy.

00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:30.019
And more recently, we've been studying resins

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.128
that bees collect from plants.

00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:35.311
So bees fly to some plants and they scrape

00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:37.967
these very, very sticky resins off the leaves,

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:39.545
and they take them back to the nest

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.411
where they cement them into the nest architecture

00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:44.936
where we call it propolis.

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:49.558
We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.

00:04:49.558 --> 00:04:51.502
It's a natural antibiotic.

00:04:51.502 --> 00:04:54.681
It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs

00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:56.283
within the colony,

00:04:56.283 --> 00:05:00.246
and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:03.537
Humans have known about the power of propolis

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:05.184
since biblical times.

00:05:05.184 --> 00:05:08.534
We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies

00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:10.586
for human medicine,

00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:14.250
but we didn't know how good it was for the bees.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.303
So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses

00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:20.992
that have kept them healthy and thriving

00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:25.249
for over 50 million years.

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:28.598
So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies

00:05:28.598 --> 00:05:30.397
were reported to be dying en masse,

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:32.369
first in the United States,

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:36.182
it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.

00:05:36.182 --> 00:05:39.668
In our collective conscience, in a really primal way,

00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:42.854
we know we can't afford to lose bees.

00:05:42.854 --> 00:05:45.969
So what's going on?

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.058
Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.540
and I'll go through each of these.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.393
The bottom line is,

00:05:54.393 --> 00:05:58.445
bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape

00:05:58.445 --> 00:06:01.934
and a dysfunctional food system.

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:03.926
Now we have the best data on honeybees,

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:05.782
so I'll use them as an example.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:09.275
In the United States, bees in fact have been

00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:12.139
in decline since World War II.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.413
We have half the number of managed hives

00:06:14.413 --> 00:06:17.427
in the United States now compared to 1945.

00:06:17.427 --> 00:06:21.078
We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.

00:06:21.078 --> 00:06:23.824
And the reason is, after World War II,

00:06:23.824 --> 00:06:27.152
we changed our farming practices.

00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:29.991
We stopped planting cover crops.

00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:32.734
We stopped planting clover and alfalfa,

00:06:32.734 --> 00:06:36.580
which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.184
and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.

00:06:40.184 --> 00:06:45.728
Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.

00:06:45.728 --> 00:06:49.182
And after World War II, we started using herbicides

00:06:49.182 --> 00:06:51.679
to kill off the weeds in our farms.

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:54.460
Many of these weeds are flowering plants

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.393
that bees require for their survival.

00:06:57.393 --> 00:07:02.964
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.529
Now we talk about food deserts,

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:09.779
places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:13.822
The very farms that used to sustain bees

00:07:13.822 --> 00:07:16.578
are now agricultural food deserts,

00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:19.001
dominated by one or two plant species

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.590
like corn and soybeans.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.495
Since World War II, we have been systematically

00:07:24.495 --> 00:07:27.394
eliminating many of the flowering plants

00:07:27.394 --> 00:07:30.946
that bees need for their survival.

00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:33.844
And these monocultures extend even to crops

00:07:33.844 --> 00:07:36.391
that are good for bees, like almonds.

00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:40.377
Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:43.388
hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,

00:07:43.388 --> 00:07:47.320
and also because the pollen in an almond blossom

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.500
is really high in protein. It's really good for bees.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.497
Now, the scale of almond monoculture

00:07:55.497 --> 00:07:58.049
demands that most of our nation's bees,

00:07:58.049 --> 00:08:00.785
over 1.5 million hives of bees,

00:08:00.785 --> 00:08:03.777
be transported across the nation

00:08:03.777 --> 00:08:06.128
to pollinate this one crop.

00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:08.773
And they're trucked in in semi-loads,

00:08:08.773 --> 00:08:11.103
and they must be trucked out,

00:08:11.103 --> 00:08:13.842
because after bloom, the almond orchards

00:08:13.842 --> 00:08:19.052
are a vast and flowerless landscape.

00:08:19.052 --> 00:08:21.518
Bees have been dying over the last 50 years,

00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:25.323
and we're planting more crops that need them.

00:08:25.323 --> 00:08:29.507
There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production

00:08:29.507 --> 00:08:33.311
that requires bee pollination.

00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.337
And then there's pesticides.

00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:39.681
After World War II, we started using pesticides

00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:42.245
on a large scale, and this became necessary

00:08:42.245 --> 00:08:46.039
because of the monocultures that put out a feast

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:48.332
for crop pests.

00:08:48.332 --> 00:08:51.273
Recently, researchers from Penn State University

00:08:51.273 --> 00:08:54.570
have started looking at the pesticide residue

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.120
in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.711
and they've found that every batch of pollen

00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:03.718
that a honeybee collects

00:09:03.718 --> 00:09:07.505
has at least six detectable pesticides in it,

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:11.548
and this includes every class of insecticides,

00:09:11.548 --> 00:09:14.391
herbicides, fungicides,

00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:17.971
and even inert and unlabeled ingredients

00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:20.543
that are part of the pesticide formulation

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:24.765
that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:30.407
This small bee is holding up a large mirror.

00:09:30.407 --> 00:09:34.855
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans?

00:09:34.855 --> 00:09:37.835
One of these class of insecticides,

00:09:37.835 --> 00:09:39.210
the neonicontinoids,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.470
is making headlines around the world right now.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.916
You've probably heard about it.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.974
This is a new class of insecticides.

00:09:44.974 --> 00:09:48.133
It moves through the plant so that a crop pest,

00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:49.576
a leaf-eating insect,

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:50.810
would take a bite of the plant

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.150
and get a lethal dose and die.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.973
If one of these neonics, we call them,

00:09:56.973 --> 00:09:59.427
is applied in a high concentration,

00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:01.689
such as in this ground application,

00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:04.157
enough of the compound moves through the plant

00:10:04.157 --> 00:10:06.369
and gets into the pollen and the nectar,

00:10:06.369 --> 00:10:08.473
where a bee can consume, in this case,

00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:11.491
a high dose of this neurotoxin

00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:15.640
that makes the bee twitch and die.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.813
In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,

00:10:18.813 --> 00:10:22.756
it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide,

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:25.747
and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant

00:10:25.747 --> 00:10:27.715
and gets into the pollen and nectar,

00:10:27.715 --> 00:10:30.258
and if a bee consumes this lower dose,

00:10:30.258 --> 00:10:31.600
either nothing happens

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.188
or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented

00:10:35.188 --> 00:10:38.900
and she may not find her way home.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.032
And on top of everything else, bees have

00:10:41.032 --> 00:10:43.300
their own set of diseases and parasites.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.160
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.465
It's called varroa destructor.

00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:49.569
It's aptly named.

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:52.181
It's this big, blood-sucking parasite

00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:54.555
that compromises the bee's immune system

00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:57.326
and circulates viruses.

00:10:57.326 --> 00:11:00.255
Let me put this all together for you.

00:11:00.255 --> 00:11:02.922
I don't know what it feels like to a bee

00:11:02.922 --> 00:11:05.623
to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:08.762
and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,

00:11:08.762 --> 00:11:13.890
but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.122
and I know how difficult it is for me to get

00:11:17.122 --> 00:11:19.911
to the grocery store to get good nutrition.

00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:22.957
But what if I lived in a food desert?

00:11:22.957 --> 00:11:25.452
And what if I had to travel a long distance

00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:27.325
to get to the grocery store,

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:30.199
and I finally got my weak body out there

00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:32.343
and I consumed, in my food,

00:11:32.343 --> 00:11:35.144
enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,

00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:37.900
that I couldn't find my way home?

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.087
And this is what we mean by multiple

00:11:41.087 --> 00:11:44.790
and interacting causes of death.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.979
And it's not just our honeybees.

00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:49.854
All of our beautiful wild species of bees

00:11:49.854 --> 00:11:54.025
are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:57.576
These bees are providing backup for our honeybees.

00:11:57.576 --> 00:11:59.626
They're providing the pollination insurance

00:11:59.626 --> 00:12:01.244
alongside our honeybees.

00:12:01.244 --> 00:12:03.667
We need all of our bees.

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:06.208
So what are we going to do?

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.622
What are we going to do about this big bee bummer

00:12:08.622 --> 00:12:10.885
that we've created?

00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:14.702
It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.

00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:18.285
Every one of you out there can help bees

00:12:18.285 --> 00:12:22.750
in two very direct and easy ways.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.705
Plant bee-friendly flowers,

00:12:25.705 --> 00:12:27.838
and don't contaminate these flowers,

00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:30.500
this bee food, with pesticides.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.834
So go online and search for flowers

00:12:33.834 --> 00:12:37.246
that are native to your area and plant them.

00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:39.369
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep.

00:12:39.369 --> 00:12:41.943
Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns,

00:12:41.943 --> 00:12:43.473
in your boulevards.

00:12:43.473 --> 00:12:47.086
Campaign to have them planted in public gardens,

00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:49.667
community spaces, meadows.

00:12:49.667 --> 00:12:51.416
Set aside farmland.

00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:54.116
We need a beautiful diversity of flowers

00:12:54.116 --> 00:12:56.287
that blooms over the entire growing season,

00:12:56.287 --> 00:12:58.181
from spring to fall.

00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:01.879
We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:05.333
but also for migrating butterflies and birds

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:07.309
and other wildlife.

00:13:07.309 --> 00:13:10.749
And we need to think carefully about putting back in

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:13.934
cover crops to nourish our soil

00:13:13.934 --> 00:13:16.955
and nourish our bees.

00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:20.218
And we need to diversify our farms.

00:13:20.218 --> 00:13:24.000
We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.856
to disrupt the agricultural food desert

00:13:27.856 --> 00:13:31.146
and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system

00:13:31.146 --> 00:13:33.377
that we've created.

00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:36.761
So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure

00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:39.779
to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers --

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:42.807
but when bees have access to good nutrition,

00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:44.993
we have access to good nutrition

00:13:44.993 --> 00:13:47.408
through their pollination services.

00:13:47.408 --> 00:13:49.944
And when bees have access to good nutrition,

00:13:49.944 --> 00:13:53.543
they're better able to engage their own natural defenses,

00:13:53.543 --> 00:13:54.961
their healthcare,

00:13:54.961 --> 00:13:59.059
that they have relied on for millions of years.

00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:03.908
So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,

00:14:03.908 --> 00:14:08.358
is that every one of us needs to behave

00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:13.138
a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,

00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:16.170
where each of our individual actions

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.276
can contribute to a grand solution,

00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:20.963
an emergent property,

00:14:20.963 --> 00:14:22.944
that's much greater than the mere sum

00:14:22.944 --> 00:14:25.689
of our individual actions.

00:14:25.689 --> 00:14:30.839
So let the small act of planting flowers

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:34.166
and keeping them free of pesticides

00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:38.381
be the driver of large-scale change.

00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:41.417
On behalf of the bees, thank you.

00:14:41.417 --> 00:14:45.540
(Applause)

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.508
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question.

00:14:49.508 --> 00:14:52.664
The latest numbers on the die-off of bees,

00:14:52.664 --> 00:14:54.892
is there any sign of things bottoming out?

00:14:54.892 --> 00:14:57.671
What's your hope/depression level on this?

00:14:57.671 --> 00:14:58.285
Maria Spivak: Yeah.

00:14:58.285 --> 00:15:00.238
At least in the United States,

00:15:00.238 --> 00:15:02.590
an average of 30 percent of all bee hives

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.717
are lost every winter.

00:15:04.717 --> 00:15:06.522
About 20 years ago,

00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:08.858
we were at a 15-percent loss.

00:15:08.858 --> 00:15:10.979
So it's getting precarious.

00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:13.586
CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's --
MS: Yes, thirty percent a year.

00:15:13.586 --> 00:15:17.140
CA: Thirty percent a year.
MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.790
and so they can maintain the same number,

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.111
they can recuperate some of their loss.

00:15:22.111 --> 00:15:23.729
We're kind of at a tipping point.

00:15:23.729 --> 00:15:26.598
We can't really afford to lose that many more.

00:15:26.598 --> 00:15:28.418
We need to be really appreciative

00:15:28.418 --> 00:15:31.771
of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers.

00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:32.921
CA: Thank you.

00:15:32.921 --> 00:15:38.291
(Applause)
