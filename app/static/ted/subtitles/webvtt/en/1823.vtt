00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:03.623
Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist,

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:05.731
and we both study complex networks.

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:07.566
And we met a couple years ago when we discovered

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.566
that we had both given a short TED Talk

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.869
about the ecology of war,

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.316
and we realized that we were connected

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:16.134
by the ideas we shared before we ever met.

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:17.690
And then we thought, you know, there are thousands

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.804
of other talks out there, especially TEDx Talks,

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:22.015
that are popping up all over the world.

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:22.938
How are they connected,

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:24.948
and what does that global conversation look like?

00:00:24.948 --> 00:00:27.758
So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that.

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:31.525
Sean Gourley: Exactly. So we took 24,000 TEDx Talks

00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:34.571
from around the world, 147 different countries,

00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:36.694
and we took these talks and we wanted to find

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.734
the mathematical structures that underly

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:40.456
the ideas behind them.

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:41.826
And we wanted to do that so we could see how

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.879
they connected with each other.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.555
And so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff,

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:46.511
you need a lot of data.

00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:50.197
So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube,

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:51.965
and we can go down and basically pull

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:54.232
all the open information from YouTube,

00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:56.581
all the comments, all the views, who's watching it,

00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.360
where are they watching it, what are they saying in the comments.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.652
But we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation,

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:04.780
we can pull the entire transcript,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.460
and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.566
So we can take their transcript

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.664
and actually do some pretty cool things.

00:01:11.664 --> 00:01:13.824
We can take natural language processing algorithms

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.453
to kind of read through with a computer, line by line,

00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:18.812
extracting key concepts from this.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.337
And we take those key concepts and they sort of form

00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:24.902
this mathematical structure of an idea.

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:26.659
And we call that the meme-ome.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.810
And the meme-ome, you know, quite simply,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.236
is the mathematics that underlies an idea,

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:33.168
and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it,

00:01:33.168 --> 00:01:35.149
which I want to share with you now.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.339
So each idea has its own meme-ome,

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:39.290
and each idea is unique with that,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.778
but of course, ideas, they borrow from each other,

00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:42.962
they kind of steal sometimes,

00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:44.789
and they certainly build on each other,

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.405
and we can go through mathematically

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:48.245
and take the meme-ome from one talk

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:50.699
and compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk,

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:52.672
and if there's a similarity between the two of them,

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:55.922
we can create a link and represent that as a graph,

00:01:55.922 --> 00:01:58.316
just like Eric and I are connected.

00:01:58.316 --> 00:01:59.710
So that's theory, that's great.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.236
Let's see how it works in actual practice.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:05.024
So what we've got here now is the global footprint

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.317
of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years

00:02:07.317 --> 00:02:08.867
exploding out around the world

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:12.196
from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner.

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:16.031
And what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these,

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.565
and we started to see where the connections occurred,

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:20.102
where they connected with each other.

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:21.976
Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:23.551
connected over into Europe.

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.963
We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine

00:02:25.963 --> 00:02:28.218
radiating outwards from the Middle East.

00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:29.516
And we've got something a little broader

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.672
like big data with a truly global footprint

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.851
reminiscent of a conversation

00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.867
that is happening everywhere.

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:38.040
So from this, we kind of run up against the limits

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.570
of what we can actually do with a geographic projection,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.622
but luckily, computer technology allows us to go out

00:02:42.622 --> 00:02:44.168
into multidimensional space.

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:46.043
So we can take in our network projection

00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:47.793
and apply a physics engine to this,

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.678
and the similar talks kind of smash together,

00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:51.682
and the different ones fly apart,

00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:53.754
and what we're left with is something quite beautiful.

00:02:53.754 --> 00:02:56.711
EB: So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk,

00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:59.300
they're linked if they share similar ideas,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.384
and that comes from a machine reading

00:03:01.384 --> 00:03:03.451
of entire talk transcripts,

00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:05.682
and then all these topics that pop out,

00:03:05.682 --> 00:03:07.472
they're not from tags and keywords.

00:03:07.472 --> 00:03:09.197
They come from the network structure

00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:11.365
of interconnected ideas. Keep going.

00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.387
SG: Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that,

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:14.862
but he's going to slow me down.

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:16.896
We've got education connected to storytelling

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.539
triangulated next to social media.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.014
You've got, of course, the human brain right next to healthcare,

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:22.400
which you might expect,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.795
but also you've got video games, which is sort of adjacent,

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:27.535
as those two spaces interface with each other.

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:29.070
But I want to take you into one cluster

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.938
that's particularly important to me, and that's the environment.

00:03:31.938 --> 00:03:33.431
And I want to kind of zoom in on that

00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:35.794
and see if we can get a little more resolution.

00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:38.141
So as we go in here, what we start to see,

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.645
apply the physics engine again,

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:41.321
we see what's one conversation

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.881
is actually composed of many smaller ones.

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:45.810
The structure starts to emerge

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.880
where we see a kind of fractal behavior

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.499
of the words and the language that we use

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.201
to describe the things that are important to us

00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:52.634
all around this world.

00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:54.966
So you've got food economy and local food at the top,

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:57.685
you've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste.

00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:00.316
What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations,

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:02.617
each connected to each other through the ideas

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:03.918
and the language they share,

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:06.368
creating a broader concept of the environment.

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:07.900
And of course, from here, we can go

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.434
and zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at?

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:13.779
And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion.

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.453
This is their kind of resonance

00:04:15.453 --> 00:04:17.859
for the conversation around the environment.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.758
If we split along gender lines,

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:21.745
we can see females resonating heavily

00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:25.390
with food economy, but also out there in hope and optimism.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.872
And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here,

00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:29.634
and I'll throw to Eric for the next part.

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:31.236
EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here,

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:32.774
you cannot get this kind of perspective

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:36.134
from a simple tag search on YouTube.

00:04:36.134 --> 00:04:40.322
Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.856
out of environment, and look at all the talks together.

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:45.783
Now often, when we're faced with this amount of content,

00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:48.214
we do a couple of things to simplify it.

00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:49.528
We might just say, well,

00:04:49.528 --> 00:04:52.357
what are the most popular talks out there?

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:53.754
And a few rise to the surface.

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:55.582
There's a talk about gratitude.

00:04:55.582 --> 00:04:58.926
There's another one about personal health and nutrition.

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:01.855
And of course, there's got to be one about porn, right?

00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:05.089
And so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year.

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.611
What's trending now? What's the popular talk now?

00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:10.932
And we can see that the new, emerging, top trending topic

00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:13.598
is about digital privacy.

00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:15.291
So this is great. It simplifies things.

00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:17.118
But there's so much creative content

00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:19.039
that's just buried at the bottom.

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.357
And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface

00:05:22.357 --> 00:05:24.815
that's maybe really creative and interesting?

00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.746
Well, we can go back to the network structure of ideas

00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:29.176
to do that.

00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:31.290
Remember, it's that network structure

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.558
that is creating these emergent topics,

00:05:33.558 --> 00:05:35.073
and let's say we could take two of them,

00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:38.120
like cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.689
that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines.

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.964
And that's -- Essentially, this kind of creative remix

00:05:42.964 --> 00:05:44.804
is one of the hallmarks of innovation.

00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:46.410
Well here's one by Jessica Green

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.789
about the microbial ecology of buildings.

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.799
It's literally defining a new field.

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.902
And we could go back to those topics and say, well,

00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:55.670
what talks are central to those conversations?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.360
In the cities cluster, one of the most central

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.312
was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities,

00:06:01.312 --> 00:06:03.032
and in the genetics cluster,

00:06:03.032 --> 00:06:06.225
we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter.

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:09.578
These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline.

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:11.421
We could go the other direction and say, well,

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.693
what are talks that are broadly synthesizing

00:06:13.693 --> 00:06:15.141
a lot of different kinds of fields.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.674
We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this.

00:06:17.674 --> 00:06:20.410
Like, a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence,

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.590
very synthetic.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.668
And then, of course, there are talks that are so unique

00:06:23.668 --> 00:06:26.758
they're kind of out in the stratosphere, in their own special place,

00:06:26.758 --> 00:06:29.272
and we call that the Colleen Flanagan index.

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:32.306
And if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist,

00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:33.849
and I asked her, "Well, what's it like out there

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.521
in the stratosphere of our idea space?"

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:38.776
And apparently it smells like bacon.

00:06:38.776 --> 00:06:40.567
I wouldn't know.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.815
So we're using these network motifs

00:06:42.815 --> 00:06:44.001
to find talks that are unique,

00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.711
ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields,

00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:48.370
ones that are central to their topic,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.744
and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.846
Okay? We never would have found those with our obsession

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:56.159
with what's trending now.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.045
And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity,

00:06:59.045 --> 00:07:02.005
or the patterns of how things are connected.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.630
SG: So that's exactly right.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.109
We've got ourselves in a world

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.153
that's massively complex,

00:07:08.153 --> 00:07:11.020
and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.806
so we can navigate through it.

00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:15.144
And those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful,

00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:18.620
are also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.186
because we can realize that their complexity is not random.

00:07:21.186 --> 00:07:23.140
It has mathematical structure,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.943
and we can use that mathematical structure

00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:27.157
to go and explore things like the world of ideas

00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:30.157
to see what's being said, to see what's not being said,

00:07:30.157 --> 00:07:31.564
and to be a little bit more human

00:07:31.564 --> 00:07:33.431
and, hopefully, a little smarter.

00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:34.397
Thank you.

00:07:34.397 --> 00:07:38.617
(Applause)
