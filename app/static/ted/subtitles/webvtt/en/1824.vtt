00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:03.156
When my father and I started a company

00:00:03.156 --> 00:00:06.432
to 3D print human tissues and organs,

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:09.788
some people initially thought we were a little crazy.

00:00:09.788 --> 00:00:12.479
But since then, much progress has been made,

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.686
both in our lab and other labs around the world.

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:18.953
And given this, we started getting questions like,

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:21.680
"If you can grow human body parts,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.060
can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.502
When someone first suggested this to me,

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:32.456
quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.559
but what I soon came to realize

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.805
was that this is not so crazy after all.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.774
What's crazy is what we do today.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.963
I'm convinced that in 30 years,

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:44.685
when we look back on today

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:48.295
and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals

00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:51.198
to make our hamburgers and our handbags,

00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:53.380
we'll see this as being wasteful

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.670
and indeed crazy.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.782
Did you know that today we maintain

00:00:58.782 --> 00:01:02.123
a global herd of 60 billion animals

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:07.699
to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:09.769
And over the next few decades,

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.529
as the world's population expands to 10 billion,

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:14.174
this will need to nearly double

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.759
to 100 billion animals.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.368
But maintaining this herd

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:20.667
takes a major toll on our planet.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:24.286
Animals are not just raw materials.

00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:25.909
They're living beings,

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.827
and already our livestock

00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:30.406
is one of the largest users of land,

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:31.758
fresh water,

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.491
and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.120
which drive climate change.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.450
On top of this,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.674
when you get so many animals so close together,

00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:43.144
it creates a breeding ground for disease

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:46.727
and opportunities for harm and abuse.

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:49.257
Clearly, we cannot continue on this path

00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:53.080
which puts the environment, public health,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.522
and food security at risk.

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:59.088
There is another way, because essentially,

00:01:59.088 --> 00:02:03.374
animal products are just collections of tissues,

00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:05.798
and right now we breed and raise

00:02:05.798 --> 00:02:07.727
highly complex animals

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.418
only to create products

00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:12.133
that are made of relatively simple tissues.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:15.343
What if, instead of starting with a complex

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.465
and sentient animal,

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:21.013
we started with what the tissues are made of,

00:02:21.013 --> 00:02:23.559
the basic unit of life,

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.040
the cell?

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.760
This is biofabrication, where cells themselves

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.386
can be used to grow biological products

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:34.278
like tissues and organs.

00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:35.976
Already in medicine,

00:02:35.976 --> 00:02:38.179
biofabrication techniques have been used

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.615
to grow sophisticated body parts,

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:45.513
like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone,

00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:48.747
that have been successfully implanted into patients.

00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:52.855
And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be

00:02:52.855 --> 00:02:57.621
a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.

00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:03.431
And we should begin by reimagining leather.

00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.701
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:12.604
It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.

00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:14.505
Growing leather is also technically simpler

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:17.280
than growing other animal products like meat.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.390
It mainly uses one cell type,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.515
and it is largely two-dimensional.

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:26.683
It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.

00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:29.781
Until biofabrication is better understood,

00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:31.966
it is clear that, initially at least,

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:36.017
more people would be willing to wear novel materials

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:38.652
than would be willing to eat novel foods,

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:40.603
no matter how delicious.

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:43.710
In this sense, leather is a gateway material,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.782
a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:50.666
If we can succeed here,

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:53.942
it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.706
closer on the horizon.

00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:59.171
Now how do we do it?

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.443
To grow leather, we begin by taking cells

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:05.275
from an animal, through a simple biopsy.

00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:07.283
The animal could be a cow,

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:09.980
lamb, or even something more exotic.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.032
This process does no harm,

00:04:12.032 --> 00:04:14.934
and Daisy the cow can live a happy life.

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.669
We then isolate the skin cells

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.538
and multiply them in a cell culture medium.

00:04:19.538 --> 00:04:20.711
This takes millions of cells

00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.830
and expands them into billions.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.444
And we then coax these cells to produce collagen,

00:04:26.444 --> 00:04:27.871
as they would naturally.

00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:30.200
This collagen is the stuff between cells.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.693
It's natural connective tissue.

00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:34.253
It's the extracellular matrix,

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:37.462
but in leather, it's the main building block.

00:04:37.462 --> 00:04:41.175
And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:43.152
and we spread them out to form sheets,

00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.594
and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another,

00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:50.123
like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets,

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.977
which we then let mature.

00:04:51.977 --> 00:04:55.189
And finally, we take this multilayered skin

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.112
and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process,

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:01.288
we create leather.

00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:03.482
And so I'm very excited to show you,

00:05:03.482 --> 00:05:05.631
for the first time,

00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:09.641
the first batch of our cultured leather,

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:11.204
fresh from the lab.

00:05:11.204 --> 00:05:14.783
This is real, genuine leather,

00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:18.306
without the animal sacrifice.

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:21.484
It can have all the characteristics of leather

00:05:21.484 --> 00:05:24.969
because it is made of the same cells,

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.918
and better yet,

00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:30.793
there is no hair to remove,

00:05:30.793 --> 00:05:33.326
no scars or insect's bites,

00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:34.766
and no waste.

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:38.190
This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.276
a handbag or a car seat.

00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:44.492
It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:47.307
or an alligator.

00:05:47.322 --> 00:05:49.876
And because we make this material,

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:52.158
we grow this leather from the ground up,

00:05:52.158 --> 00:05:55.191
we can control its properties in very interesting ways.

00:05:55.191 --> 00:05:57.726
This piece of leather

00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:01.244
is a mere seven tissue layers thick,

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:05.047
and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.

00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:14.214
And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.

00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:17.224
You don't have that kind of fine control

00:06:17.224 --> 00:06:19.513
with conventional leather.

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:22.758
And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities,

00:06:22.758 --> 00:06:26.523
like softness, breathability,

00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:31.720
durability, elasticity and even things like pattern.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.891
We can mimic nature,

00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.179
but in some ways also improve upon it.

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:41.177
This type of leather can do what today's leather does,

00:06:41.177 --> 00:06:44.618
but with imagination, probably much more.

00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:48.847
What could the future of animal products look like?

00:06:48.847 --> 00:06:51.206
It need not look like this,

00:06:51.206 --> 00:06:53.939
which is actually the state of the art today.

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:56.931
Rather, it could be much more like this.

00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:59.164
Already, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures

00:06:59.164 --> 00:07:01.929
for thousands of years, beginning with products

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:04.558
like wine, beer and yogurt.

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:07.892
And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved,

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:10.153
and today we prepare cultured food

00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:12.471
in beautiful, sterile facilities like this.

00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:15.671
A brewery is essentially a bioreactor.

00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:18.440
It is where cell culture takes place.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.985
Imagine that in this facility,

00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:22.731
instead of brewing beer,

00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.312
we were brewing leather

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:28.009
or meat.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:30.654
Imagine touring this facility,

00:07:30.654 --> 00:07:34.385
learning about how the leather or meat is cultured,

00:07:34.385 --> 00:07:37.146
seeing the process from beginning to end,

00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:38.542
and even trying some.

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:41.648
It's clean, open and educational,

00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:44.068
and this is in contrast to the hidden,

00:07:44.068 --> 00:07:46.146
guarded and remote factories

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:49.627
where leather and meat is produced today.

00:07:49.627 --> 00:07:52.454
Perhaps biofabrication

00:07:52.454 --> 00:07:56.734
is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.

00:07:56.734 --> 00:07:59.187
It's environmentally responsible,

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:02.349
efficient and humane.

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:04.543
It allows us to be creative.

00:08:04.543 --> 00:08:07.763
We can design new materials, new products,

00:08:07.763 --> 00:08:10.962
and new facilities.

00:08:10.962 --> 00:08:14.802
We need to move past just killing animals

00:08:14.802 --> 00:08:16.635
as a resource

00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:22.556
to something more civilized and evolved.

00:08:22.556 --> 00:08:25.241
Perhaps we are ready for something

00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:30.826
literally and figuratively more cultured.

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:32.207
Thank you.

00:08:32.207 --> 00:08:38.177
(Applause)
