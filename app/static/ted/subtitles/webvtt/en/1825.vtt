00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:04.140
Democracy is in trouble, no question about that,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.382
and it comes in part from a deep dilemma

00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:10.070
in which it is embedded.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.817
It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions

00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:17.342
we face that have to do with global pandemics,

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:19.451
a cross-border problem;

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:22.874
with HIV, a transnational problem;

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:24.949
with markets and immigration,

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.503
something that goes beyond national borders;

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:29.776
with terrorism, with war,

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:32.423
all now cross-border problems.

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:36.178
In fact, we live in a 21st-century world

00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:38.383
of interdependence,

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:41.906
and brutal interdependent problems,

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:47.550
and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.738
we are faced with political institutions

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:54.191
designed 400 years ago,

00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:58.669
autonomous, sovereign nation-states

00:00:58.669 --> 00:01:01.231
with jurisdictions and territories

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:02.990
separate from one another,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.923
each claiming to be able to solve the problem

00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:07.996
of its own people.

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:11.292
Twenty-first-century, transnational world

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:13.034
of problems and challenges,

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:17.010
17th-century world of political institutions.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.390
In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.236
And like many others, I've been thinking about

00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:28.704
what can one do about this, this asymmetry

00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:30.697
between 21st-century challenges

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:34.752
and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:38.251
political institutions like nation-states.

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:39.955
And my suggestion is

00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:43.576
that we change the subject,

00:01:43.576 --> 00:01:47.688
that we stop talking about nations,

00:01:47.688 --> 00:01:49.104
about bordered states,

00:01:49.104 --> 00:01:53.071
and we start talking about cities.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.429
Because I think you will find, when we talk about cities,

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.486
we are talking about the political institutions

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.307
in which civilization and culture were born.

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:06.472
We are talking about the cradle of democracy.

00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:09.030
We are talking about the venues in which

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.243
those public spaces where we come together

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:16.310
to create democracy, and at the same time

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.273
protest those who would take our freedom, take place.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.907
Think of some great names:

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:26.600
the Place de la Bastille,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.567
Zuccotti Park,

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.733
Tahrir Square,

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:35.039
Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul,

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.399
or, yes,

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.191
Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:41.897
(Applause)

00:02:41.897 --> 00:02:44.823
Those are the public spaces

00:02:44.823 --> 00:02:48.188
where we announce ourselves as citizens,

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:51.634
as participants, as people with the right

00:02:51.634 --> 00:02:55.909
to write our own narratives.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.587
Cities are not only the oldest of institutions,

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:00.555
they're the most enduring.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.727
If you think about it,

00:03:02.727 --> 00:03:06.696
Constantinople, Istanbul, much older than Turkey.

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:09.806
Alexandria, much older than Egypt.

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:13.756
Rome, far older than Italy.

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:17.364
Cities endure the ages.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:22.147
They are the places where we are born,

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:26.483
grow up, are educated, work, marry,

00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:31.342
pray, play, get old, and in time, die.

00:03:31.342 --> 00:03:33.470
They are home.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.526
Very different than nation-states,

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:36.867
which are abstractions.

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:40.989
We pay taxes, we vote occasionally,

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.364
we watch the men and women we choose rule

00:03:44.364 --> 00:03:47.588
rule more or less without us.

00:03:47.588 --> 00:03:51.896
Not so in those homes known as our towns

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:53.695
and cities where we live.

00:03:53.695 --> 00:03:58.744
Moreover, today, more than half of the world's population

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:00.751
live in cities.

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.723
In the developed world, it's about 78 percent.

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:06.718
More than three out of four people

00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:10.758
live in urban institutions, urban places,

00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:12.366
in cities today.

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:15.142
So cities are where the action is.

00:04:15.142 --> 00:04:18.258
Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world,

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.839
man is a political animal.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.866
I say we are an urban animal.

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:29.731
We are an urban species, at home in our cities.

00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:31.883
So to come back to the dilemma,

00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:34.401
if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned

00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:38.185
political nation-states unable to govern the world,

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:41.199
respond to the global challenges that we face

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.359
like climate change,

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:49.401
then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world,

00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:52.610
for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.495
to engage in global governance.

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.326
When I say if mayors ruled the world,

00:05:00.326 --> 00:05:02.594
when I first came up with that phrase,

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:06.500
it occurred to me that actually, they already do.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.298
There are scores of international, inter-city,

00:05:11.298 --> 00:05:15.560
cross-border institutions, networks of cities

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.605
in which cities are already, quite quietly,

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:21.432
below the horizon, working together

00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:24.129
to deal with climate change, to deal with security,

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.517
to deal with immigration,

00:05:25.517 --> 00:05:27.176
to deal with all of those tough,

00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:29.982
interdependent problems that we face.

00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:33.438
They have strange names:

00:05:33.438 --> 00:05:36.808
UCLG,

00:05:36.808 --> 00:05:41.434
United Cities and Local Governments;

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:43.234
ICLEI,

00:05:43.234 --> 00:05:48.750
the International Council for Local Environmental Issues.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.960
And the list goes on:

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.507
Citynet in Asia; City Protocol, a new organization

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:56.992
out of Barcelona that is using the web

00:05:56.992 --> 00:06:00.069
to share best practices among countries.

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.485
And then all the things we know a little better,

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:02.776
the U.S. Conference of Mayors,

00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:04.812
the Mexican Conference of Mayors,

00:06:04.812 --> 00:06:08.378
the European Conference of Mayors.

00:06:08.378 --> 00:06:13.361
Mayors are where this is happening.

00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:15.890
And so the question is,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.644
how can we create a world

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:21.259
in which mayors and the citizens they represent

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.725
play a more prominent role?

00:06:23.725 --> 00:06:26.675
Well, to understand that,

00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:30.473
we need to understand why cities are special,

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.368
why mayors are so different

00:06:32.368 --> 00:06:33.856
than prime ministers and presidents,

00:06:33.856 --> 00:06:38.204
because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister

00:06:38.204 --> 00:06:42.483
are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.

00:06:42.483 --> 00:06:44.891
To be a prime minister or a president,

00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:47.050
you have to have an ideology,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.112
you have to have a meta-narrative,

00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:51.634
you have to have a theory of how things work,

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:53.669
you have to belong to a party.

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:55.226
Independents, on the whole,

00:06:55.226 --> 00:06:56.976
don't get elected to office.

00:06:56.976 --> 00:06:59.209
But mayors are just the opposite.

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:03.658
Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.

00:07:03.658 --> 00:07:05.621
Their job is to get things done, and if they don't,

00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:08.340
they're out of a job.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.078
Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said,

00:07:11.078 --> 00:07:14.660
we could never get away here in Philadelphia

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.970
with the stuff that goes on in Washington,

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.985
the paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.

00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:26.444
Why? Because potholes have to get filled,

00:07:26.444 --> 00:07:28.343
because the trains have to run,

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:31.292
because kids have to be able to get to school.

00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:32.588
And that's what we have to do,

00:07:32.588 --> 00:07:35.527
and to do that is about pragmatism

00:07:35.527 --> 00:07:37.499
in that deep, American sense,

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.429
reaching outcomes.

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:45.538
Washington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals,

00:07:45.538 --> 00:07:48.850
are anything but pragmatic,

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.769
but real city mayors have to be pragmatists.

00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:53.493
They have to get things done,

00:07:53.493 --> 00:07:56.890
they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.254
and draw their cities together.

00:07:59.254 --> 00:08:01.924
We saw this a couple of decades ago

00:08:01.924 --> 00:08:04.999
when Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:07.104
in the '80s and the '90s,

00:08:07.104 --> 00:08:10.407
was besieged one day in his office

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:15.070
by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.905
Christian prelates, rabbis, imams.

00:08:17.905 --> 00:08:19.404
They were arguing with one another

00:08:19.404 --> 00:08:21.530
about access to the holy sites.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.309
And the squabble went on and on,

00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:25.151
and Kollek listened and listened,

00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:29.453
and he finally said, "Gentlemen,

00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:31.609
spare me your sermons,

00:08:31.609 --> 00:08:34.653
and I will fix your sewers."

00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:35.674
(Laughter)

00:08:35.674 --> 00:08:37.738
That's what mayors do.

00:08:37.738 --> 00:08:41.158
They fix sewers, they get the trains running.

00:08:41.158 --> 00:08:43.706
There isn't a left or a right way of doing.

00:08:43.706 --> 00:08:48.183
Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.

00:08:48.183 --> 00:08:50.058
Strange term, but in some ways, he is.

00:08:50.058 --> 00:08:52.491
He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist.

00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:53.980
He rides to work on a bike,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.827
but at the same time, he's in some ways a conservative.

00:08:56.827 --> 00:09:00.067
Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat,

00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:00.885
then he was a Republican,

00:09:00.885 --> 00:09:02.722
and finally he was an Independent, and said

00:09:02.722 --> 00:09:05.143
the party label just gets in the way.

00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:08.258
Luzhkov, 20 years mayor in Moscow,

00:09:08.258 --> 00:09:11.718
though he helped found a party, United Party with Putin,

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:15.014
in fact refused to be defined by the party

00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:18.304
and finally, in fact, lost his job not under Brezhnev,

00:09:18.304 --> 00:09:21.177
not under Gorbachev, but under Putin,

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:25.330
who wanted a more faithful party follower.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.444
So mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers.

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:30.817
They get things done.

00:09:30.817 --> 00:09:32.226
But the second thing about mayors

00:09:32.226 --> 00:09:36.407
is they are also what I like to call homeboys,

00:09:36.407 --> 00:09:39.047
or to include the women mayors, homies.

00:09:39.047 --> 00:09:41.710
They're from the neighborhood.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.517
They're part of the neighborhood. They're known.

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:45.792
Ed Koch used to wander around New York City

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:48.308
saying, "How am I doing?"

00:09:48.308 --> 00:09:49.963
Imagine David Cameron

00:09:49.963 --> 00:09:51.913
wandering around the United Kingdom

00:09:51.913 --> 00:09:54.391
asking, "How am I doing?" He wouldn't like the answer.

00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:57.109
Or Putin. Or any national leader.

00:09:57.109 --> 00:09:59.121
He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers

00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:00.997
and they knew him.

00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:04.863
Mayors are usually from the places they govern.

00:10:04.863 --> 00:10:07.667
It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:09.481
You can run for the Senate out of a different state,

00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:12.407
but it's hard to do that as a mayor.

00:10:12.407 --> 00:10:15.491
And as a result, mayors and city councillors

00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:17.228
and local authorities

00:10:17.228 --> 00:10:19.479
have a much higher trust level,

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:22.007
and this is the third feature about mayors,

00:10:22.007 --> 00:10:24.380
than national governing officials.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.965
In the United States, we know the pathetic figures:

00:10:27.965 --> 00:10:32.424
18 percent of Americans approve of Congress

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:33.926
and what they do.

00:10:33.926 --> 00:10:37.525
And even with a relatively popular president like Obama,

00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:40.621
the figures for the Presidency run about 40, 45,

00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:42.406
sometimes 50 percent at best.

00:10:42.406 --> 00:10:45.575
The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.

00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:49.025
But when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor,

00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:51.201
do you trust your mayor?"

00:10:51.201 --> 00:10:56.354
the rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent,

00:10:56.354 --> 00:10:58.499
because they're from the neighborhood,

00:10:58.499 --> 00:11:01.416
because the people they work with are their neighbors,

00:11:01.416 --> 00:11:04.833
because, like Mayor Booker in Newark,

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:08.032
a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work

00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:10.786
and go in and pull people out of a burning building --

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:13.124
that happened to Mayor Booker --

00:11:13.124 --> 00:11:16.065
or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work

00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:17.397
because he sees it.

00:11:17.397 --> 00:11:19.780
No head of state would be permitted

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.632
by their security details to do it,

00:11:21.632 --> 00:11:23.850
nor be in a position to do it.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.389
That's the difference, and the difference

00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:27.554
has to do with the character of cities themselves,

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:34.175
because cities are profoundly multicultural,

00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:38.510
open, participatory, democratic,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.164
able to work with one another.

00:11:41.164 --> 00:11:43.990
When states face each other,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.280
China and the U.S., they face each other like this.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.883
When cities interact, they interact like this.

00:11:52.883 --> 00:11:56.190
China and the U.S., despite the recent

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.801
meta-meeting in California,

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:03.566
are locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry

00:12:03.566 --> 00:12:04.807
for number one.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.784
We heard more about who will be number one.

00:12:07.784 --> 00:12:09.935
Cities don't worry about number one.

00:12:09.935 --> 00:12:12.118
They have to work together, and they do work together.

00:12:12.118 --> 00:12:15.729
They work together in climate change, for example.

00:12:15.729 --> 00:12:19.235
Organizations like the C40, like ICLEI, which I mentioned,

00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:21.119
have been working together

00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:23.309
many, many years before Copenhagen.

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:25.830
In Copenhagen, four or five years ago,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.224
184 nations came together to explain to one another

00:12:29.224 --> 00:12:31.469
why their sovereignty didn't permit them

00:12:31.469 --> 00:12:35.771
to deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change,

00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:39.047
but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited

00:12:39.047 --> 00:12:40.769
200 mayors to attend.

00:12:40.769 --> 00:12:43.829
They came, they stayed, and they found ways

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:46.920
and are still finding ways to work together,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.369
city-to-city, and through inter-city organizations.

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:54.146
Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities,

00:12:54.146 --> 00:12:56.030
which means cities are in a position

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.238
to solve the carbon problem, or most of it,

00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:02.026
whether or not the states of which they are a part

00:13:02.026 --> 00:13:04.084
make agreements with one another.

00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:05.332
And they are doing it.

00:13:05.332 --> 00:13:07.632
Los Angeles cleaned up its port,

00:13:07.632 --> 00:13:10.207
which was 40 percent of carbon emissions,

00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:13.988
and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon.

00:13:13.988 --> 00:13:16.972
New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings,

00:13:16.972 --> 00:13:20.156
make them better insulated in the winter,

00:13:20.156 --> 00:13:22.099
to not leak energy in the summer,

00:13:22.099 --> 00:13:25.046
not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact.

00:13:25.046 --> 00:13:26.940
Bogota, where Mayor Mockus,

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.176
when he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:35.628
that saved energy, that allowed surface buses

00:13:35.628 --> 00:13:37.163
to run in effect like subways,

00:13:37.163 --> 00:13:39.079
express buses with corridors.

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:42.365
It helped unemployment, because people could get across town,

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:46.221
and it had a profound impact on climate as well as

00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:47.292
many other things there.

00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:50.146
Singapore, as it developed its high-rises

00:13:50.146 --> 00:13:51.851
and its remarkable public housing,

00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:55.344
also developed an island of parks,

00:13:55.344 --> 00:13:57.060
and if you go there, you'll see how much of it

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.601
is green land and park land.

00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:01.109
Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.

00:14:01.109 --> 00:14:02.694
They are doing it together.

00:14:02.694 --> 00:14:06.352
They are sharing what they do,

00:14:06.352 --> 00:14:10.321
and they are making a difference by shared best practices.

00:14:10.321 --> 00:14:11.953
Bike shares, many of you have heard of it,

00:14:11.953 --> 00:14:14.256
started 20 or 30 years ago in Latin America.

00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:16.600
Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.891
Pedestrian zones, congestion fees,

00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:23.601
emission limits in cities like California cities have,

00:14:23.601 --> 00:14:25.905
there's lots and lots that cities can do

00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:35.265
even when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act.

00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:39.233
So what's the bottom line here?

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:42.980
The bottom line is, we still live politically

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.195
in a world of borders, a world of boundaries,

00:14:45.195 --> 00:14:46.793
a world of walls,

00:14:46.793 --> 00:14:52.953
a world where states refuse to act together.

00:14:52.953 --> 00:14:56.746
Yet we know that the reality we experience

00:14:56.746 --> 00:15:00.943
day to day is a world without borders,

00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:03.417
a world of diseases without borders

00:15:03.417 --> 00:15:05.717
and doctors without borders,

00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:10.289
maladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières,

00:15:10.289 --> 00:15:16.360
of economics and technology without borders,

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.476
of education without borders,

00:15:18.476 --> 00:15:21.706
of terrorism and war without borders.

00:15:21.706 --> 00:15:24.920
That is the real world, and unless we find a way

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.350
to globalize democracy or democratize globalization,

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.718
we will increasingly not only risk

00:15:34.718 --> 00:15:38.799
the failure to address all of these transnational problems,

00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:42.518
but we will risk losing democracy itself,

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:47.144
locked up in the old nation-state box,

00:15:47.144 --> 00:15:52.837
unable to address global problems democratically.

00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:55.831
So where does that leave us?

00:15:55.831 --> 00:15:58.842
I'll tell you. The road to global democracy

00:15:58.842 --> 00:16:00.813
doesn't run through states.

00:16:00.813 --> 00:16:03.375
It runs through cities.

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:08.175
Democracy was born in the ancient polis.

00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:13.683
I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.

00:16:13.683 --> 00:16:17.627
In that journey from polis to cosmopolis,

00:16:17.627 --> 00:16:19.898
we can rediscover the power

00:16:19.898 --> 00:16:22.021
of democracy on a global level.

00:16:22.021 --> 00:16:26.043
We can create not a League of Nations, which failed,

00:16:26.043 --> 00:16:27.431
but a League of Cities,

00:16:27.431 --> 00:16:30.543
not a United or a dis-United Nations,

00:16:30.543 --> 00:16:32.801
but United Cities of the World.

00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:36.888
We can create a global parliament of mayors.

00:16:36.888 --> 00:16:40.984
That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world,

00:16:40.984 --> 00:16:43.666
but it's also on the table in City Halls

00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:46.394
in Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam,

00:16:46.394 --> 00:16:48.433
in Hamburg, and in New York.

00:16:48.433 --> 00:16:51.291
Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually

00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:54.450
constitute a global parliament of mayors,

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.330
and I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.476
is a parliament of citizens

00:16:59.476 --> 00:17:03.371
and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us,

00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:06.502
of you and of me.

00:17:06.502 --> 00:17:11.292
If ever there were citizens without borders,

00:17:11.292 --> 00:17:13.435
I think it's the citizens of TED

00:17:13.435 --> 00:17:16.626
who show the promise to be those citizens without borders.

00:17:16.626 --> 00:17:21.556
I am ready to reach out and embrace

00:17:21.556 --> 00:17:23.882
a new global democracy,

00:17:23.882 --> 00:17:26.981
to take back our democracy.

00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:29.119
And the only question is,

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:31.178
are you?

00:17:31.178 --> 00:17:33.161
Thank you so much, my fellow citizens.

00:17:33.161 --> 00:17:44.351
(Applause)

00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:48.117
Thank you. (Applause)
