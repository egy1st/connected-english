00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.841
I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:08.404
involving a man named Steve Titus.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:11.433
Titus was a restaurant manager.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.523
He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,

00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:17.418
he was engaged to Gretchen,

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:20.366
about to be married, she was the love of his life.

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.650
And one night, the couple went out

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.655
for a romantic restaurant meal.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:27.303
They were on their way home,

00:00:27.303 --> 00:00:30.253
and they were pulled over by a police officer.

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:33.570
You see, Titus' car sort of resembled

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.457
a car that was driven earlier in the evening

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:40.863
by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,

00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:44.457
and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.

00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:47.035
So the police took a picture of Titus,

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:49.802
they put it in a photo lineup,

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:51.962
they later showed it to the victim,

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:54.122
and she pointed to Titus' photo.

00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:57.743
She said, "That one's the closest."

00:00:57.743 --> 00:01:01.631
The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,

00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:04.972
and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:07.068
the rape victim got on the stand

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:11.410
and said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man."

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.336
And Titus was convicted.

00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:16.310
He proclaimed his innocence,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.892
his family screamed at the jury,

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:21.763
his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:25.158
and Titus is taken away to jail.

00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:28.616
So what would you do at this point?

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:30.252
What would you do?

00:01:30.252 --> 00:01:34.020
Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.052
and yet he got an idea.

00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:38.483
He called up the local newspaper,

00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:41.870
he got the interest of an investigative journalist,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.606
and that journalist actually found the real rapist,

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.959
a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.251
a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes

00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:54.583
in that area,

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:57.757
and when this information was given to the judge,

00:01:57.757 --> 00:02:00.693
the judge set Titus free.

00:02:00.693 --> 00:02:04.724
And really, that's where this case should have ended.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:05.847
It should have been over.

00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:08.367
Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:12.203
a year of accusation and trial, but over.

00:02:12.203 --> 00:02:14.250
It didn't end that way.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.928
Titus was so bitter.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.508
He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:21.351
He lost his fiancée.

00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:24.257
She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.

00:02:24.257 --> 00:02:26.403
He lost his entire savings,

00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:29.261
and so he decided to file a lawsuit

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:31.542
against the police and others whom he felt

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:33.861
were responsible for his suffering.

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:38.574
And that's when I really started working on this case,

00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:40.535
trying to figure out

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.609
how did that victim go from

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.137
"That one's the closest"

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:48.887
to "I'm absolutely positive that's the guy."

00:02:48.887 --> 00:02:52.166
Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:55.200
He spent every waking moment thinking about it,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.351
and just days before he was to have his day in court,

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:01.570
he woke up in the morning,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.378
doubled over in pain,

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:06.072
and died of a stress-related heart attack.

00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:09.259
He was 35 years old.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:14.069
So I was asked to work on Titus' case

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.584
because I'm a psychological scientist.

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:20.411
I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.

00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:23.800
And if I meet somebody on an airplane --

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.896
this happened on the way over to Scotland --

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:27.726
if I meet somebody on an airplane,

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:30.771
and we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?"

00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:32.222
and I say "I study memory,"

00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:35.602
they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names,

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:38.401
or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:40.481
or some kind of memory problem,

00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.697
but I have to tell them

00:03:42.697 --> 00:03:46.202
I don't study when people forget.

00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:49.204
I study the opposite: when they remember,

00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:51.957
when they remember things that didn't happen

00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:53.922
or remember things that were different

00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:55.947
from the way they really were.

00:03:55.947 --> 00:04:00.683
I study false memories.

00:04:00.683 --> 00:04:04.990
Unhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.295
to be convicted based on somebody's false memory.

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:12.603
In one project in the United States,

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:14.855
information has been gathered

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:18.789
on 300 innocent people,

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.684
300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do.

00:04:22.684 --> 00:04:27.984
They spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes,

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:30.411
and now DNA testing has proven

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:33.327
that they are actually innocent.

00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:35.848
And when those cases have been analyzed,

00:04:35.848 --> 00:04:37.989
three quarters of them

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:43.600
are due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.863
Well, why?

00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:48.314
Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people

00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:50.598
and the jurors who convicted Titus,

00:04:50.598 --> 00:04:52.839
many people believe that memory

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:54.486
works like a recording device.

00:04:54.486 --> 00:04:56.743
You just record the information,

00:04:56.743 --> 00:04:59.390
then you call it up and play it back

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.817
when you want to answer questions or identify images.

00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:04.980
But decades of work in psychology

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.133
has shown that this just isn't true.

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:10.563
Our memories are constructive.

00:05:10.563 --> 00:05:12.132
They're reconstructive.

00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:15.613
Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page:

00:05:15.613 --> 00:05:20.726
You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:25.975
I first started studying this constructive memory process

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:28.390
in the 1970s.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.813
I did my experiments that involved showing people

00:05:32.813 --> 00:05:35.318
simulated crimes and accidents

00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:38.836
and asking them questions about what they remember.

00:05:38.836 --> 00:05:42.775
In one study, we showed people a simulated accident

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.053
and we asked people,

00:05:44.053 --> 00:05:46.917
how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:48.551
And we asked other people,

00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:52.240
how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.242
And if we asked the leading "smashed" question,

00:05:55.242 --> 00:05:58.527
the witnesses told us the cars were going faster,

00:05:58.527 --> 00:06:02.524
and moreover, that leading "smashed" question

00:06:02.524 --> 00:06:05.384
caused people to be more likely to tell us

00:06:05.384 --> 00:06:08.451
that they saw broken glass in the accident scene

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.230
when there wasn't any broken glass at all.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.119
In another study, we showed a simulated accident

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:18.779
where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign,

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:23.711
and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign,

00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:27.560
many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.017
at the intersection, not a stop sign.

00:06:31.017 --> 00:06:33.206
And you might be thinking, well, you know,

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:34.529
these are filmed events,

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.457
they are not particularly stressful.

00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:39.191
Would the same kind of mistakes be made

00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:42.142
with a really stressful event?

00:06:42.142 --> 00:06:45.233
In a study we published just a few months ago,

00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:47.537
we have an answer to this question,

00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:50.301
because what was unusual about this study

00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:55.933
is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.

00:06:55.933 --> 00:06:58.162
The subjects in this study

00:06:58.162 --> 00:07:00.672
were members of the U.S. military

00:07:00.672 --> 00:07:05.097
who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise

00:07:05.097 --> 00:07:07.879
to teach them what it's going to be like for them

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.797
if they are ever captured as prisoners of war.

00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:14.227
And as part of this training exercise,

00:07:14.227 --> 00:07:17.756
these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive,

00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:22.842
hostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:25.659
and later on they have to try to identify

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:28.682
the person who conducted that interrogation.

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:32.505
And when we feed them suggestive information

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:35.283
that insinuates it's a different person,

00:07:35.283 --> 00:07:39.320
many of them misidentify their interrogator,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.155
often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely

00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:46.259
resemble the real interrogator.

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:48.560
And so what these studies are showing

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.420
is that when you feed people misinformation

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.800
about some experience that they may have had,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.455
you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.

00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:03.655
Well out there in the real world,

00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:06.546
misinformation is everywhere.

00:08:06.546 --> 00:08:07.906
We get misinformation

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:10.822
not only if we're questioned in a leading way,

00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:13.269
but if we talk to other witnesses

00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:16.302
who might consciously or inadvertently feed us

00:08:16.302 --> 00:08:18.439
some erroneous information,

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:23.169
or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.962
all of these provide the opportunity

00:08:25.962 --> 00:08:30.312
for this kind of contamination of our memory.

00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:34.100
In the 1990s, we began to see

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.783
an even more extreme kind of memory problem.

00:08:38.783 --> 00:08:41.879
Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:44.793
maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --

00:08:44.793 --> 00:08:47.546
and they were coming out of therapy

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:50.207
with a different problem.

00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:53.908
Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.891
sometimes in satanic rituals,

00:08:55.891 --> 00:09:00.588
sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.

00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:03.142
One woman came out of psychotherapy

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:05.570
believing that she'd endured years

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.472
of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy

00:09:09.472 --> 00:09:12.038
and that the baby was cut from her belly.

00:09:12.038 --> 00:09:14.397
But there were no physical scars

00:09:14.397 --> 00:09:16.423
or any kind of physical evidence

00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:19.304
that could have supported her story.

00:09:19.304 --> 00:09:22.312
And when I began looking into these cases,

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.762
I was wondering,

00:09:23.762 --> 00:09:26.090
where do these bizarre memories come from?

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.477
And what I found is that most of these situations

00:09:30.477 --> 00:09:35.968
involved some particular form of psychotherapy.

00:09:35.968 --> 00:09:37.567
And so I asked,

00:09:37.567 --> 00:09:40.955
were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.839
like the imagination exercises

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.896
or dream interpretation,

00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:48.028
or in some cases hypnosis,

00:09:48.028 --> 00:09:51.846
or in some cases exposure to false information --

00:09:51.846 --> 00:09:54.633
were these leading these patients

00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:57.310
to develop these very bizarre,

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.241
unlikely memories?

00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:02.400
And I designed some experiments

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.425
to try to study the processes that were being used

00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:10.498
in this psychotherapy so I could study

00:10:10.498 --> 00:10:14.049
the development of these very rich false memories.

00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:16.457
In one of the first studies we did,

00:10:16.457 --> 00:10:18.810
we used suggestion,

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.873
a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,

00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:24.983
we used this kind of suggestion

00:10:24.983 --> 00:10:26.835
and planted a false memory

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.912
that when you were a kid, five or six years old,

00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:32.163
you were lost in a shopping mall.

00:10:32.163 --> 00:10:34.663
You were frightened. You were crying.

00:10:34.663 --> 00:10:37.177
You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person

00:10:37.177 --> 00:10:39.029
and reunited with the family.

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:41.637
And we succeeded in planting this memory

00:10:41.637 --> 00:10:45.743
in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.

00:10:45.743 --> 00:10:47.748
And you might be thinking, well,

00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:50.094
that's not particularly stressful.

00:10:50.094 --> 00:10:53.463
But we and other investigators have planted

00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:56.221
rich false memories of things that were

00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:59.136
much more unusual and much more stressful.

00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:01.675
So in a study done in Tennessee,

00:11:01.675 --> 00:11:04.091
researchers planted the false memory

00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:06.665
that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:09.172
and had to be rescued by a life guard.

00:11:09.172 --> 00:11:11.475
And in a study done in Canada,

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:13.999
researchers planted the false memory

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:15.227
that when you were a kid,

00:11:15.227 --> 00:11:18.957
something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal

00:11:18.957 --> 00:11:20.339
happened to you,

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:23.761
succeeding with about half of their subjects.

00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:26.113
And in a study done in Italy,

00:11:26.113 --> 00:11:28.771
researchers planted the false memory,

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:33.983
when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.

00:11:33.983 --> 00:11:36.190
I do want to add that it might seem

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.929
like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects

00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:41.529
in the name of science,

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:46.167
but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:48.142
by research ethics boards

00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:50.484
that have made the decision

00:11:50.484 --> 00:11:53.557
that the temporary discomfort that some

00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:56.641
of these subjects might experience in these studies

00:11:56.641 --> 00:12:00.541
is outweighed by the importance of this problem

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:03.648
for understanding memory processes

00:12:03.648 --> 00:12:06.994
and the abuse of memory that is going on

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:10.287
in some places in the world.

00:12:10.287 --> 00:12:13.325
Well, to my surprise,

00:12:13.325 --> 00:12:16.754
when I published this work and began to speak out

00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:20.649
against this particular brand of psychotherapy,

00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:24.629
it created some pretty bad problems for me:

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:29.530
hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.206
who felt under attack,

00:12:31.206 --> 00:12:34.734
and by the patients whom they had influenced.

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:37.671
I had sometimes armed guards at speeches

00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:39.576
that I was invited to give,

00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:43.793
people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.

00:12:43.793 --> 00:12:45.774
But probably the worst

00:12:45.774 --> 00:12:48.541
was I suspected that a woman

00:12:48.541 --> 00:12:50.965
was innocent of abuse

00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:53.801
that was being claimed by her grown daughter.

00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:57.218
She accused her mother of sexual abuse

00:12:57.218 --> 00:12:59.077
based on a repressed memory.

00:12:59.077 --> 00:13:01.960
And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.394
to be filmed and presented in public places.

00:13:05.394 --> 00:13:07.903
I was suspicious of this story,

00:13:07.903 --> 00:13:10.203
and so I started to investigate,

00:13:10.203 --> 00:13:14.686
and eventually found information that convinced me

00:13:14.686 --> 00:13:16.975
that this mother was innocent.

00:13:16.975 --> 00:13:19.936
I published an exposé on the case,

00:13:19.936 --> 00:13:23.380
and a little while later, the accusing daughter

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.901
filed a lawsuit.

00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:27.256
Even though I'd never mentioned her name,

00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:31.618
she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.

00:13:31.618 --> 00:13:34.341
And I went through nearly five years

00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:40.893
of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,

00:13:40.893 --> 00:13:44.567
but finally, finally, it was over and I could really

00:13:44.567 --> 00:13:46.991
get back to my work.

00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:49.476
In the process, however, I became part

00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:52.130
of a disturbing trend in America

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.237
where scientists are being sued

00:13:54.237 --> 00:13:58.836
for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.

00:13:58.836 --> 00:14:02.194
When I got back to my work, I asked this question:

00:14:02.194 --> 00:14:04.592
if I plant a false memory in your mind,

00:14:04.592 --> 00:14:06.436
does it have repercussions?

00:14:06.436 --> 00:14:08.395
Does it affect your later thoughts,

00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:10.496
your later behaviors?

00:14:10.496 --> 00:14:12.523
Our first study planted a false memory

00:14:12.523 --> 00:14:15.849
that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:

00:14:15.849 --> 00:14:18.848
hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.

00:14:18.848 --> 00:14:22.038
And we found that once we planted this false memory,

00:14:22.038 --> 00:14:24.489
people didn't want to eat the foods as much

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.749
at an outdoor picnic.

00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:30.622
The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.

00:14:30.622 --> 00:14:32.980
If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.001
involving a healthy food like asparagus,

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:39.476
we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.

00:14:39.476 --> 00:14:41.850
And so what these studies are showing

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.965
is that you can plant false memories

00:14:43.965 --> 00:14:45.378
and they have repercussions

00:14:45.378 --> 00:14:50.463
that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.

00:14:50.463 --> 00:14:52.887
Well, along with this ability

00:14:52.887 --> 00:14:55.810
to plant memories and control behavior

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.991
obviously come some important ethical issues,

00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:03.050
like, when should we use this mind technology?

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.730
And should we ever ban its use?

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.513
Therapists can't ethically plant false memories

00:15:09.513 --> 00:15:11.100
in the mind of their patients

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.664
even if it would help the patient,

00:15:13.664 --> 00:15:15.286
but there's nothing to stop a parent

00:15:15.286 --> 00:15:19.735
from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:22.340
And when I suggested this publicly,

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.686
it created an outcry again.

00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:29.719
"There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children."

00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:31.964
Hello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:41.461
I mean, another way to think about this is,

00:15:41.461 --> 00:15:43.494
which would you rather have,

00:15:43.494 --> 00:15:46.523
a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,

00:15:46.523 --> 00:15:48.055
all the things that go with it,

00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:51.071
or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?

00:15:51.071 --> 00:15:54.462
I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.

00:15:54.462 --> 00:15:58.439
But maybe my work has made me different from most people.

00:15:58.439 --> 00:16:00.518
Most people cherish their memories,

00:16:00.518 --> 00:16:02.672
know that they represent their identity,

00:16:02.672 --> 00:16:04.697
who they are, where they came from.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:07.555
And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.

00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:09.760
But I know from my work

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.241
how much fiction is already in there.

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.973
If I've learned anything from these decades

00:16:16.973 --> 00:16:19.383
of working on these problems, it's this:

00:16:19.383 --> 00:16:21.594
just because somebody tells you something

00:16:21.594 --> 00:16:23.169
and they say it with confidence,

00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:25.849
just because they say it with lots of detail,

00:16:25.849 --> 00:16:28.608
just because they express emotion when they say it,

00:16:28.608 --> 00:16:31.810
it doesn't mean that it really happened.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.675
We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.

00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:39.223
We need independent corroboration.

00:16:39.223 --> 00:16:42.313
Such a discovery has made me more tolerant

00:16:42.313 --> 00:16:44.452
of the everyday memory mistakes

00:16:44.452 --> 00:16:47.366
that my friends and family members make.

00:16:47.366 --> 00:16:51.900
Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus,

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.476
the man whose whole future was snatched away

00:16:55.476 --> 00:16:57.714
by a false memory.

00:16:57.714 --> 00:17:00.530
But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind,

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.166
we'd do well to,

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:06.037
that memory, like liberty,

00:17:06.037 --> 00:17:09.731
is a fragile thing.

00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:12.669
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:15.397
Thank you. (Applause)

00:17:15.397 --> 00:17:19.116
Thanks very much. (Applause)
