WEBVTT

00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:03.190
We are going to take a quick voyage

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.697
over the cognitive history of the 20th century,

00:00:06.697 --> 00:00:08.486
because during that century,

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:11.400
our minds have altered dramatically.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.724
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:16.798
have altered because the roads are better

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:19.153
and because of technology.

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:21.122
And our minds have altered, too.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:25.066
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.465
and analyzed that world primarily in terms

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.698
of how much it would benefit them

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:35.290
to people who confront a very complex world,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.499
and it's a world where we've had to develop

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:40.994
new mental habits, new habits of mind.

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:42.991
And these include things like

00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:47.005
clothing that concrete world with classification,

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.927
introducing abstractions that we try to make

00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:52.123
logically consistent,

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:54.953
and also taking the hypothetical seriously,

00:00:54.953 --> 00:00:57.203
that is, wondering about what might have been

00:00:57.203 --> 00:00:59.595
rather than what is.

00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:03.147
Now, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:06.907
through massive I.Q. gains over time,

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:09.276
and these have been truly massive.

00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:13.687
That is, we don't just get a few more questions right

00:01:13.687 --> 00:01:15.160
on I.Q. tests.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.619
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.867
than each succeeding generation

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:23.777
back to the time that they were invented.

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:27.075
Indeed, if you score the people a century ago

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:28.623
against modern norms,

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:31.994
they would have an average I.Q. of 70.

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:34.719
If you score us against their norms,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.318
we would have an average I.Q. of 130.

00:01:38.318 --> 00:01:41.675
Now this has raised all sorts of questions.

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:43.580
Were our immediate ancestors

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.815
on the verge of mental retardation?

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:50.890
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.922
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted?

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:58.158
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.

00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:01.278
Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative

00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:05.331
that's much more illuminating than either of those,

00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:07.953
and to put this into perspective,

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:10.858
let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:13.693
and found a ruined civilization.

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:16.100
And this Martian was an archaeologist,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.987
and they found scores, target scores,

00:02:18.987 --> 00:02:21.910
that people had used for shooting.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.413
And first they looked at 1865,

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:26.484
and they found that in a minute,

00:02:26.484 --> 00:02:30.193
people had only put one bullet in the bullseye.

00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:32.510
And then they found, in 1898,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.294
that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:41.521
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.

00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:45.376
And initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.

00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:47.973
They would say, look, these tests were designed

00:02:47.973 --> 00:02:51.571
to find out how much people were steady of hand,

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:54.346
how keen their eyesight was,

00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:56.684
whether they had control of their weapon.

00:02:56.684 --> 00:02:59.705
How could these performances have escalated

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:01.887
to this enormous degree?

00:03:01.887 --> 00:03:04.162
Well we now know, of course, the answer.

00:03:04.162 --> 00:03:06.974
If that Martian looked at battlefields,

00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:09.798
they would find that people had only muskets

00:03:09.798 --> 00:03:11.862
at the time of the Civil War

00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:13.669
and that they had repeating rifles

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.854
at the time of the Spanish-American War,

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:18.590
and then they had machine guns

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.405
by the time of World War I.

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:23.956
And, in other words, it was the equipment

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:26.123
that was in the hands of the average soldier

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:29.186
that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye

00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:31.359
or steadiness of hand.

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.679
Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.172
that we have picked up over those hundred years,

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:42.235
and I think again that another thinker will help us here,

00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:44.370
and that's Luria.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.514
Luria looked at people

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:50.167
just before they entered the scientific age,

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:52.164
and he found that these people

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:55.821
were resistant to classifying the concrete world.

00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:56.875
They wanted to break it up

00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:59.465
into little bits that they could use.

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:01.755
He found that they were resistant

00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:05.256
to deducing the hypothetical,

00:04:05.256 --> 00:04:07.933
to speculating about what might be,

00:04:07.933 --> 00:04:10.570
and he found finally that they didn't deal well

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.967
with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.

00:04:14.967 --> 00:04:18.107
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:20.473
He talked to the head man of a person

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:22.305
in rural Russia.

00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:24.779
They'd only had, as people had in 1900,

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.960
about four years of schooling.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.320
And he asked that particular person,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.790
what do crows and fish have in common?

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.857
And the fellow said, "Absolutely nothing.

00:04:35.857 --> 00:04:38.850
You know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.176
A crow can peck at a fish.

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:44.027
A fish can't do anything to a crow."

00:04:44.027 --> 00:04:47.253
And Luria said, "But aren't they both animals?"

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:48.663
And he said, "Of course not.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.650
One's a fish.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.422
The other is a bird."

00:04:52.422 --> 00:04:54.444
And he was interested, effectively,

00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:58.112
in what he could do with those concrete objects.

00:04:58.112 --> 00:05:00.990
And then Luria went to another person,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.173
and he said to them,

00:05:03.173 --> 00:05:05.869
"There are no camels in Germany.

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:08.280
Hamburg is a city in Germany.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.823
Are there camels in Hamburg?"

00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:11.714
And the fellow said,

00:05:11.714 --> 00:05:15.933
"Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:19.827
And Luria said, "But what do my words imply?"

00:05:19.827 --> 00:05:22.104
And he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village,

00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:24.673
and there's no room for camels."

00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:26.936
In other words, he was unwilling to treat this

00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:29.733
as anything but a concrete problem,

00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:32.291
and he was used to camels being in villages,

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:36.224
and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical,

00:05:36.224 --> 00:05:41.131
to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.

00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:43.944
A third interview was conducted

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:46.928
with someone about the North Pole.

00:05:46.928 --> 00:05:51.033
And Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow.

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:54.988
Wherever there is always snow, the bears are white.

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:58.267
What color are the bears at the North Pole?"

00:05:58.267 --> 00:06:00.669
And the response was, "Such a thing

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.979
is to be settled by testimony.

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.803
If a wise person came from the North Pole

00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:07.654
and told me the bears were white,

00:06:07.654 --> 00:06:09.133
I might believe him,

00:06:09.133 --> 00:06:13.338
but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."

00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:16.322
Now you see again, this person has rejected

00:06:16.322 --> 00:06:18.517
going beyond the concrete world

00:06:18.517 --> 00:06:21.690
and analyzing it through everyday experience,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.556
and it was important to that person

00:06:23.556 --> 00:06:25.118
what color bears were --

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:27.399
that is, they had to hunt bears.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.808
They weren't willing to engage in this.

00:06:29.808 --> 00:06:31.645
One of them said to Luria,

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:35.145
"How can we solve things that aren't real problems?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.036
None of these problems are real.

00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:39.679
How can we address them?"

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:43.224
Now, these three categories --

00:06:43.224 --> 00:06:44.715
classification,

00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:46.856
using logic on abstractions,

00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:49.625
taking the hypothetical seriously --

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:52.063
how much difference do they make in the real world

00:06:52.063 --> 00:06:53.956
beyond the testing room?

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:56.926
And let me give you a few illustrations.

00:06:56.926 --> 00:07:00.315
First, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:03.712
That is, we've gone from four to eight years of education

00:07:03.712 --> 00:07:06.489
to 12 years of formal education,

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:08.390
and 52 percent of Americans

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.210
have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.242
Now, not only do we have much more education,

00:07:16.242 --> 00:07:18.935
and much of that education is scientific,

00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:22.945
and you can't do science without classifying the world.

00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:26.804
You can't do science without proposing hypotheses.

00:07:26.804 --> 00:07:30.978
You can't do science without making it logically consistent.

00:07:30.978 --> 00:07:34.788
And even down in grade school, things have changed.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.722
In 1910, they looked at the examinations

00:07:37.722 --> 00:07:41.542
that the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds,

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:43.148
and they found that they were all

00:07:43.148 --> 00:07:46.583
for socially valued concrete information.

00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:47.914
They were things like,

00:07:47.914 --> 00:07:50.801
what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states

00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:53.175
that existed at that time?

00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:54.753
When they looked at the exams

00:07:54.753 --> 00:07:57.900
that the state of Ohio gave in 1990,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.286
they were all about abstractions.

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:01.879
They were things like,

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:07.013
why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?

00:08:07.013 --> 00:08:08.577
And you were supposed to think, well,

00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:11.791
the state legislature was rural-controlled,

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.889
and they hated the big city,

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:16.482
so rather than putting the capital in a big city,

00:08:16.482 --> 00:08:17.920
they put it in a county seat.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.656
They put it in Albany rather than New York.

00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:23.712
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.647
And so forth.

00:08:25.647 --> 00:08:28.078
So the tenor of education has changed.

00:08:28.078 --> 00:08:32.112
We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously,

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:35.690
to use abstractions, and to link them logically.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.071
What about employment?

00:08:38.071 --> 00:08:41.971
Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans

00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:45.513
practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.

00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:49.568
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.

00:08:49.568 --> 00:08:52.431
Today, 35 percent of Americans

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:55.750
practice cognitively demanding professions,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.376
not only to the professions proper like lawyer

00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:00.925
or doctor or scientist or lecturer,

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:02.743
but many, many sub-professions

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:04.684
having to do with being a technician,

00:09:04.684 --> 00:09:06.709
a computer programmer.

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:11.033
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:13.963
And we can only meet the terms of employment

00:09:13.963 --> 00:09:16.460
in the modern world by being cognitively

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.721
far more flexible.

00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:21.944
And it's not just that we have many more people

00:09:21.944 --> 00:09:24.934
in cognitively demanding professions.

00:09:24.934 --> 00:09:27.337
The professions have been upgraded.

00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:29.448
Compare the doctor in 1900,

00:09:29.448 --> 00:09:32.497
who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve,

00:09:32.497 --> 00:09:35.305
with the modern general practitioner or specialist,

00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:37.984
with years of scientific training.

00:09:37.984 --> 00:09:40.253
Compare the banker in 1900,

00:09:40.253 --> 00:09:42.666
who really just needed a good accountant

00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:45.842
and to know who was trustworthy in the local community

00:09:45.842 --> 00:09:48.133
for paying back their mortgage.

00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:51.362
Well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees

00:09:51.362 --> 00:09:53.128
may have been morally remiss,

00:09:53.128 --> 00:09:56.267
but they were cognitively very agile.

00:09:56.267 --> 00:10:00.878
They went far beyond that 1900 banker.

00:10:00.878 --> 00:10:03.045
They had to look at computer projections

00:10:03.045 --> 00:10:05.045
for the housing market.

00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:08.950
They had to get complicated CDO-squared

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.400
in order to bundle debt together

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.159
and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset.

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:18.259
They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies

00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:19.370
to give it a AAA,

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.604
though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.

00:10:23.604 --> 00:10:25.633
And they also, of course, had to get people

00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:28.320
to accept these so-called assets

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.820
and pay money for them

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.407
even though they were highly vulnerable.

00:10:32.407 --> 00:10:33.997
Or take a farmer today.

00:10:33.997 --> 00:10:37.277
I take the farm manager of today as very different

00:10:37.277 --> 00:10:39.768
from the farmer of 1900.

00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:41.606
So it hasn't just been the spread

00:10:41.606 --> 00:10:44.797
of cognitively demanding professions.

00:10:44.797 --> 00:10:47.177
It's also been the upgrading of tasks

00:10:47.177 --> 00:10:49.744
like lawyer and doctor and what have you

00:10:49.744 --> 00:10:53.521
that have made demands on our cognitive faculties.

00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:56.680
But I've talked about education and employment.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.019
Some of the habits of mind that we have developed

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:01.626
over the 20th century

00:11:01.626 --> 00:11:04.221
have paid off in unexpected areas.

00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:06.492
I'm primarily a moral philosopher.

00:11:06.492 --> 00:11:10.180
I merely have a holiday in psychology,

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.588
and what interests me in general is moral debate.

00:11:14.588 --> 00:11:17.319
Now over the last century,

00:11:17.319 --> 00:11:19.669
in developed nations like America,

00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:21.650
moral debate has escalated

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.989
because we take the hypothetical seriously,

00:11:24.989 --> 00:11:28.204
and we also take universals seriously

00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:31.000
and look for logical connections.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.735
When I came home in 1955 from university

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:37.042
at the time of Martin Luther King,

00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:39.364
a lot of people came home at that time

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:43.114
and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents.

00:11:43.114 --> 00:11:46.342
My father was born in 1885,

00:11:46.342 --> 00:11:48.905
and he was mildly racially biased.

00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:51.008
As an Irishman, he hated the English so much

00:11:51.008 --> 00:11:53.329
he didn't have much emotion for anyone else.

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:56.600
(Laughter)

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.108
But he did have a sense that black people were inferior.

00:12:01.108 --> 00:12:03.956
And when we said to our parents and grandparents,

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:08.449
"How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?"

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:12.070
they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.572
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning --

00:12:14.572 --> 00:12:16.974
(Laughter) --

00:12:16.974 --> 00:12:18.204
that turned black?

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:21.720
In other words, they were fixed in the concrete

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.233
mores and attitudes they had inherited.

00:12:25.233 --> 00:12:28.244
They would not take the hypothetical seriously,

00:12:28.244 --> 00:12:29.728
and without the hypothetical,

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:33.747
it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.

00:12:33.747 --> 00:12:36.382
You have to say, imagine you were

00:12:36.382 --> 00:12:41.967
in Iran, and imagine that your relatives

00:12:41.967 --> 00:12:44.667
all suffered from collateral damage

00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:46.613
even though they had done no wrong.

00:12:46.613 --> 00:12:48.674
How would you feel about that?

00:12:48.674 --> 00:12:51.394
And if someone of the older generation says,

00:12:51.394 --> 00:12:53.324
well, our government takes care of us,

00:12:53.324 --> 00:12:56.267
and it's up to their government to take care of them,

00:12:56.267 --> 00:13:00.335
they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.

00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:03.702
Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped,

00:13:03.702 --> 00:13:06.912
and he feels he's honor-bound to kill her.

00:13:06.912 --> 00:13:09.272
Well, he's treating his mores

00:13:09.272 --> 00:13:13.172
as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited,

00:13:13.172 --> 00:13:15.817
and they're unmovable in any way by logic.

00:13:15.817 --> 00:13:18.393
They're just inherited mores.

00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:20.594
Today we would say something like,

00:13:20.594 --> 00:13:24.171
well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.

00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:25.844
Would you deserve to be killed?

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:28.739
And he would say, well that's not in the Koran.

00:13:28.739 --> 00:13:32.761
That's not one of the principles I've got.

00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:35.602
Well you, today, universalize your principles.

00:13:35.602 --> 00:13:39.159
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.

00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:41.432
If you have a principle such as,

00:13:41.432 --> 00:13:45.078
people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something,

00:13:45.078 --> 00:13:47.174
then to exclude black people

00:13:47.174 --> 00:13:49.672
you've got to make exceptions, don't you?

00:13:49.672 --> 00:13:52.660
You have to say, well, blackness of skin,

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.283
you couldn't suffer just for that.

00:13:55.283 --> 00:13:58.546
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.713
And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we,

00:14:01.713 --> 00:14:04.629
and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:08.423
when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.

00:14:08.423 --> 00:14:11.848
And you can get moral argument off the ground, then,

00:14:11.848 --> 00:14:16.402
because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.

00:14:16.402 --> 00:14:18.339
You're treating them as universals,

00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:21.118
to be rendered consistent by logic.

00:14:21.118 --> 00:14:24.248
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?

00:14:24.248 --> 00:14:28.258
That's what initially got me going on cognitive history.

00:14:28.258 --> 00:14:30.143
If you look at the I.Q. test,

00:14:30.143 --> 00:14:34.128
you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.

00:14:34.128 --> 00:14:36.731
The similarities subtest of the Wechsler

00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:39.000
is about classification,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.080
and we have made enormous gains

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.190
on that classification subtest.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.471
There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery

00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:50.567
that are about using logic on abstractions.

00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:54.041
Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices,

00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:56.579
and it's all about analogies.

00:14:56.579 --> 00:15:00.435
And in 1900, people could do simple analogies.

00:15:00.435 --> 00:15:04.780
That is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.356
What are dogs like?

00:15:06.356 --> 00:15:08.448
They would say wolves.

00:15:08.448 --> 00:15:11.992
But by 1960, people could attack Raven's

00:15:11.992 --> 00:15:14.642
on a much more sophisticated level.

00:15:14.642 --> 00:15:19.149
If you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle,

00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:21.385
what follows two circles?

00:15:21.385 --> 00:15:23.672
They could say a semicircle.

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:25.850
Just as a triangle is half of a square,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.568
a semicircle is half of a circle.

00:15:28.568 --> 00:15:32.161
By 2010, college graduates, if you said

00:15:32.161 --> 00:15:35.396
two circles followed by a semicircle,

00:15:35.396 --> 00:15:38.186
two sixteens followed by what,

00:15:38.186 --> 00:15:41.922
they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.

00:15:41.922 --> 00:15:44.788
That is, they had moved so far from the concrete world

00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:47.081
that they could even ignore

00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:51.604
the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.

00:15:51.604 --> 00:15:54.768
Now, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.

00:15:54.768 --> 00:15:57.640
We haven't made progress on all fronts.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.404
One of the ways in which we would like to deal

00:16:00.404 --> 00:16:02.602
with the sophistication of the modern world

00:16:02.602 --> 00:16:04.638
is through politics,

00:16:04.638 --> 00:16:07.973
and sadly you can have humane moral principles,

00:16:07.973 --> 00:16:12.393
you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions,

00:16:12.393 --> 00:16:15.323
and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries,

00:16:15.323 --> 00:16:17.750
you can't do politics.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.770
We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans,

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.645
that they read less history and less literature

00:16:23.645 --> 00:16:26.255
and less material about foreign lands,

00:16:26.255 --> 00:16:27.950
and they're essentially ahistorical.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.067
They live in the bubble of the present.

00:16:30.067 --> 00:16:32.923
They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.

00:16:32.923 --> 00:16:37.106
They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II.

00:16:37.106 --> 00:16:39.727
Think how different America would be

00:16:39.727 --> 00:16:43.323
if every American knew that this is the fifth time

00:16:43.323 --> 00:16:47.417
Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order,

00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:50.781
and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened

00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:53.106
on those four previous occasions.

00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:54.056
(Laughter)

00:16:54.056 --> 00:16:56.004
And that is, they had barely left,

00:16:56.004 --> 00:16:58.336
and there wasn't a trace in the sand.

00:16:58.336 --> 00:17:01.544
Or imagine how different things would be

00:17:01.544 --> 00:17:04.300
if most Americans knew that we had been lied

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.225
into four of our last six wars.

00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:10.159
You know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine,

00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:12.417
the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel

00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:15.050
but was loaded with munitions,

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:19.128
the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet,

00:17:19.128 --> 00:17:22.696
and, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda

00:17:22.696 --> 00:17:24.605
and had nothing to do with it,

00:17:24.605 --> 00:17:28.408
and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people

00:17:28.408 --> 00:17:29.952
that they were brothers in arms,

00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:33.831
when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.

00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:37.300
But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.818
The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves

00:17:41.818 --> 00:17:45.471
in ordinary people that we have now realized,

00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:47.535
and the aristocracy was convinced

00:17:47.535 --> 00:17:49.714
that the average person couldn't make it,

00:17:49.714 --> 00:17:52.680
that they could never share their mindset

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.286
or their cognitive abilities.

00:17:55.286 --> 00:17:57.000
Lord Curzon once said

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.264
he saw people bathing in the North Sea,

00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:00.927
and he said, "Why did no one tell me

00:18:00.927 --> 00:18:03.903
what white bodies the lower orders have?"

00:18:03.903 --> 00:18:06.254
As if they were a reptile.

00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:09.304
Well, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling]

00:18:09.304 --> 00:18:13.014
[Kipling] said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady

00:18:13.014 --> 00:18:16.223
are sisters underneath the skin."

00:18:16.223 --> 00:18:20.223
(Applause)
