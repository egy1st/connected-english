00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.215
So I'm going to talk about trust,

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:04.495
and I'm going to start by reminding you

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:08.576
of the standard views that people have about trust.

00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:10.815
I think these are so commonplace,

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.103
they've become clichÃ©s of our society.

00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:15.129
And I think there are three.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.961
One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:21.869
very widely believed.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.376
The second is an aim: we should have more trust.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:31.866
And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:36.204
I think that the claim, the aim and the task

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:38.374
are all misconceived.

00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:40.023
So what I'm going to try to tell you today

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:44.713
is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:49.340
which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.106
First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:57.907
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,

00:00:57.907 --> 00:00:59.681
I don't know the answer.

00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:03.490
I'm inclined to think it may have declined

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.996
in some activities or some institutions

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:08.800
and it might have grown in others.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.744
I don't have an overview.

00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:15.081
But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,

00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:17.449
and the opinion polls are supposedly

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:21.401
the source of a belief that trust has declined.

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:25.258
When you actually look at opinion polls across time,

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:27.056
there's not much evidence for that.

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:29.646
That's to say, the people who were mistrusted

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:31.257
20 years ago,

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:35.810
principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.180
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.625
are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:44.529
The rest of us are in between,

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:47.599
and by the way, the average person in the street

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.623
is almost exactly midway.

00:01:49.623 --> 00:01:51.856
But is that good evidence?

00:01:51.856 --> 00:01:56.012
What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.

00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:57.579
What else can they record?

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.120
So they're looking at the generic attitudes

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.659
that people report when you ask them certain questions.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.589
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.221
Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?

00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:14.118
Do you trust fishmongers?

00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:16.750
Do you trust elementary school teachers?"

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.341
you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:23.555
And that would be a perfectly sensible response.

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:28.680
And you might say, when you understood the answer to that,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.120
"Well, I trust some of them, but not others."

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.038
That's a perfectly rational thing.

00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:37.160
In short, in our real lives,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.810
we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.386
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:47.882
that we will have in every instance of a certain type

00:02:47.882 --> 00:02:51.797
of official or office-holder or type of person

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:53.742
is going to be uniform.

00:02:53.742 --> 00:02:57.465
I might, for example, say that I certainly trust

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:59.910
a certain elementary school teacher I know

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.536
to teach the reception class to read,

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:06.184
but in no way to drive the school minibus.

00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:09.285
I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:12.562
I might trust my most loquacious friend

00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:14.654
to keep a conversation going

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:24.313
but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.

00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:25.562
Simple.

00:03:25.562 --> 00:03:30.468
So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives

00:03:30.468 --> 00:03:32.584
of the way that trust is differentiated,

00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:35.835
why do we sort of drop all that intelligence

00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:39.458
when we think about trust more abstractly?

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:42.202
I think the polls are very bad guides

00:03:42.202 --> 00:03:45.259
to the level of trust that actually exists,

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.831
because they try to obliterate the good judgment

00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:52.238
that goes into placing trust.

00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:54.430
Secondly, what about the aim?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.050
The aim is to have more trust.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.379
Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.326
It's not what I would aim at.

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:05.789
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.806
but not in the untrustworthy.

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:15.348
In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.

00:04:15.348 --> 00:04:18.960
And I think, of those people who, for example,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.661
placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:26.300
who then made off with them,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.630
and I think of them, and I think, well, yes,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.493
too much trust.

00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:34.350
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.344
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:40.811
is the proper aim.

00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:44.274
Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,

00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:47.418
that means that what matters in the first place

00:04:47.418 --> 00:04:50.559
is not trust but trustworthiness.

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.477
It's judging how trustworthy people are

00:04:53.477 --> 00:04:55.406
in particular respects.

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:58.754
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.

00:04:58.754 --> 00:05:03.966
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?

00:05:03.966 --> 00:05:06.038
And if we find that a person is competent

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.774
in the relevant matters,

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:09.695
and reliable and honest,

00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:11.989
we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:14.200
because they'll be trustworthy.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.866
But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.

00:05:17.866 --> 00:05:20.110
I have friends who are competent and honest,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.897
but I would not trust them to post a letter,

00:05:21.897 --> 00:05:24.469
because they're forgetful.

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.141
I have friends who are very confident

00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:29.104
they can do certain things,

00:05:29.104 --> 00:05:33.512
but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.

00:05:33.512 --> 00:05:36.167
And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:39.801
who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.

00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:40.641
(Laughter)

00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:44.028
If so, I haven't yet spotted it.

00:05:44.028 --> 00:05:46.322
But that's what we're looking for:

00:05:46.322 --> 00:05:48.520
trustworthiness before trust.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.428
Trust is the response.

00:05:50.428 --> 00:05:52.768
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.

00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:54.499
And, of course, it's difficult.

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.848
Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct

00:05:57.848 --> 00:06:01.121
systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions

00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:03.217
and professionals and officials and so on

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:07.823
that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.

00:06:07.823 --> 00:06:11.095
A lot of these systems have the converse effect.

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:12.971
They don't work as they're supposed to.

00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:17.386
I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,

00:06:17.386 --> 00:06:19.718
"Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer

00:06:19.718 --> 00:06:23.219
to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.990
And all over our public life, our institutional life,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.840
we find that problem,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.253
that the system of accountability

00:06:31.253 --> 00:06:33.582
that is meant to secure trustworthiness

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:36.332
and evidence of trustworthiness

00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:38.196
is actually doing the opposite.

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:42.833
It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:45.146
like midwives, from doing them

00:06:45.146 --> 00:06:48.104
by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.

00:06:48.104 --> 00:06:50.838
You can all give your own examples there.

00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:52.748
So so much for the aim.

00:06:52.748 --> 00:06:55.638
The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,

00:06:55.638 --> 00:06:57.797
and that is going to be different

00:06:57.797 --> 00:06:59.746
if we are trying to be trustworthy

00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:02.772
and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,

00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:05.676
and if we are trying to judge whether other people

00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:08.848
or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.

00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:13.222
It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,

00:07:13.222 --> 00:07:18.084
attitudes, don't do adequately here.

00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:21.649
Now thirdly, the task.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:25.221
Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,

00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:26.960
also gets things backwards.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.815
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.

00:07:31.815 --> 00:07:34.268
Well, we can do that for ourselves.

00:07:34.268 --> 00:07:36.666
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.

00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:40.298
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.

00:07:40.298 --> 00:07:43.502
But trust, in the end, is distinctive

00:07:43.502 --> 00:07:46.262
because it's given by other people.

00:07:46.262 --> 00:07:49.439
You can't rebuild what other people give you.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:52.166
You have to give them the basis

00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:55.349
for giving you their trust.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:58.541
So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.

00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:00.925
And that, of course, is because you can't fool

00:08:00.925 --> 00:08:04.511
all of the people all of the time, usually.

00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:09.157
But you also have to provide usable evidence

00:08:09.157 --> 00:08:10.711
that you are trustworthy.

00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:12.253
How to do it?

00:08:12.253 --> 00:08:15.463
Well every day, all over the place, it's being done

00:08:15.463 --> 00:08:18.477
by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,

00:08:18.477 --> 00:08:20.317
quite effectively.

00:08:20.317 --> 00:08:23.830
Let me give you a simple commercial example.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.720
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.972
and they don't ask any questions.

00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:31.733
They take them back and give me the money

00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:34.365
or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:36.554
That's super. I trust them

00:08:36.554 --> 00:08:39.885
because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:41.878
I think there's a big lesson in that.

00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:44.932
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,

00:08:44.932 --> 00:08:48.835
then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy

00:08:48.835 --> 00:08:51.853
and you have confidence in what you are saying.

00:08:51.853 --> 00:08:54.025
So in the end, I think what we are aiming for

00:08:54.025 --> 00:08:57.565
is not very difficult to discern.

00:08:57.565 --> 00:09:01.770
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.645
and can judge when and how the other person

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:06.933
is trustworthy.

00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:10.791
So the moral of all this is,

00:09:10.791 --> 00:09:13.945
we need to think much less about trust,

00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:17.480
let alone about attitudes of trust

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.166
detected or mis-detected by opinion polls,

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:23.780
much more about being trustworthy,

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.685
and how you give people adequate, useful

00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:30.429
and simple evidence that you're trustworthy.

00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:31.490
Thanks.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.834
(Applause)
