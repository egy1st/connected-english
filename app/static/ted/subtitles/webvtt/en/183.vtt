00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.976
There's an ancient and universal concept
that words have power,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.334
that spells exist,

00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:09.055
and that if we could only
pronounce the right words,

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.908
then -- whoosh! -- you know,
an avalanche would come

00:00:11.932 --> 00:00:13.937
and wipe out the hobbits, right?

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.948
So this is a very attractive idea,

00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:18.599
because we're very lazy,
like the Sorcerer's Apprentice,

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:20.694
or the world's greatest
computer programmer.

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:22.628
This idea has a lot of traction with us.

00:00:22.652 --> 00:00:24.790
We love the idea that words,
when pronounced,

00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:26.632
are little more than pure information,

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:28.915
but they evoke physical action
in the real world

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.098
that helps us do work.

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:32.530
So, of course, with lots
of programmable computers

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:33.705
and robots around,

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.561
this is an easy thing to picture.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:37.650
How many of you know
what I'm talking about?

00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:38.825
Raise your right hand.

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:40.852
How many don't know
what I'm talking about?

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:42.027
Raise your left hand.

00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:44.930
So that's great. So that was too easy.

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:48.073
You guys have very insecure computers, OK?

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:51.725
So now the thing is,
this is a different kind of spell.

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.106
This is a computer program
made of zeros and ones.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.988
It can be pronounced on a computer,
does something like this.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.022
The important thing is we can write it
in a high-level language.

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:02.008
A computer magician can write this thing.

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:05.246
It can be compiled into zeros and ones
and pronounced by a computer.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.269
And that's what makes computers powerful,

00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:09.553
these high-level languages
that can be compiled.

00:01:09.577 --> 00:01:12.433
And so, I'm here to tell you,
you don't need a computer

00:01:12.457 --> 00:01:14.351
to actually have a spell.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:16.660
In fact, what you can do
at the molecular level

00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:18.658
is that if you encode information --

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:20.872
you encode a spell
or program as molecules --

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:24.515
then physics can actually directly
interpret that information

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:25.690
and run a program.

00:01:25.714 --> 00:01:27.146
It's what happens in proteins.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.791
When this amino-acid sequence
gets pronounced as atoms,

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:32.035
these little letters
are sticky for each other.

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:35.943
It collapses into a three-dimensional
shape that turns it into a nanomachine

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:37.537
that actually cuts DNA.

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.314
The interesting thing
is that if you change the sequence,

00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:42.346
you change the three-dimensional folding.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.330
You get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:47.616
These are the kind of molecular programs
we want to be able to write.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.026
The problem is, we don't know

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.179
the machine language of proteins
or have a compiler for proteins.

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:54.069
So I've joined a growing band of people

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:56.307
that try to make
molecular spells using DNA.

00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:58.935
We use DNA because it's cheaper,
it's easier to handle,

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.030
it's something
we understand really well --

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.137
so well, in fact, that we think
we can actually write

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.574
programming languages for DNA
and have molecular compilers.

00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:09.179
So then, we think we can do that.

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:12.688
One of my first questions doing this was:

00:02:12.712 --> 00:02:15.483
How can you make an arbitrary shape
or pattern out of DNA?

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:17.718
I decided to use a type of DNA origami,

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:19.447
where you take a long strand of DNA

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:22.280
and fold it into whatever shape
or pattern you might want.

00:02:22.304 --> 00:02:23.467
So here's a shape.

00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:26.851
I actually spent about a year in my home
in my underwear, coding,

00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:29.027
like Linus [Torvalds],
in that picture before.

00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:32.596
This program takes a shape
and spits out 250 DNA sequences.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.817
These short DNA sequences
are what are going to fold the long strand

00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:37.610
into this shape that we want to make.

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:39.881
So you send an e-mail
with these sequences in it

00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:41.057
to a company,

00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:43.760
and the company pronounces them
on a DNA synthesizer,

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:46.274
a machine about the size of a photocopier.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.274
And they take your e-mail,

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:51.659
and every letter in your e-mail,
they replace with a 30-atom cluster --

00:02:51.683 --> 00:02:54.089
one for each letter, A, T, C and G in DNA.

00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:56.124
They string them up in the right sequence,

00:02:56.148 --> 00:02:58.309
and then they send them
back to you via FedEx.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.774
So you get 250 of these
in the mail in little tubes.

00:03:00.798 --> 00:03:03.241
I mix them together,
add a little bit of salt water,

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:05.801
and then add this long strand
I was telling you about,

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:07.285
that I've stolen from a virus.

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:08.532
And then what happens is,

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:10.710
you heat this whole thing up
to about boiling.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:12.796
You cool it down to room temperature,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.982
and as you do, those short strands
do the following thing:

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:19.402
each one of them binds
that long strand in one place,

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:22.974
and then has a second half that binds
that long strand in a distant place,

00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:25.267
and brings those two parts
of the long strand

00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:27.336
close together so they stick together.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.047
So the net effect
of all 250 of these strands

00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:34.398
is to fold the long strand
into the shape you're looking for.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.814
It'll approximate that shape.

00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:37.667
We do this for real, in the test tube.

00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:40.659
In each little drop of water,
you get 50 billion of these guys.

00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:42.998
With a microscope,
you can see them on a surface.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:46.137
The neat thing is if you change
the sequence and change the spell,

00:03:46.161 --> 00:03:48.092
just change the sequence of the staples,

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:50.918
you can make a molecule
that looks like this.

00:03:50.942 --> 00:03:53.952
And, you know, he likes
to hang out with his buddies.

00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:55.862
A lot of them are actually pretty good.

00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:58.768
If you change the spell again,
you change the sequence again,

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:01.098
you get really nice,
130-nanometer triangles.

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:02.485
If you do it again,

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.720
you can get arbitrary patterns.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:09.141
So on a rectangle, you can paint
patterns of North and South America,

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.346
or the words, "DNA."

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.383
So that's DNA origami. That's one way.

00:04:13.407 --> 00:04:17.350
There are many ways
of casting molecular spells using DNA.

00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:19.116
What we really want to do in the end

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.976
is learn how to program self-assembly
so we can build anything, right?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.390
We want to be able to build
technological artifacts

00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:27.075
that are maybe good for the world.

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.030
We want to learn how to build
biological artifacts,

00:04:30.054 --> 00:04:31.775
like people and whales and trees.

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:34.821
And if it's the case that we can reach
that level of complexity,

00:04:34.845 --> 00:04:38.105
if our ability to program molecules
gets to be that good,

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.913
then that will truly be magic.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.040
Thank you very much.

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:43.214
(Applause)
