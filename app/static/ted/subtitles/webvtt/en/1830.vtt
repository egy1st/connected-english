00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:03.101
For a long time in my life,

00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:07.692
I felt like I'd been living two different lives.

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:11.097
There's the life that everyone sees,

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:14.804
and then there's the life that only I see.

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.324
And in the life that everyone sees,

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:19.798
who I am is a friend,

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:22.353
a son, a brother,

00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:25.979
a stand-up comedian and a teenager.

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.820
That's the life everyone sees.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.346
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me,

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:31.185
that's what they would tell you.

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:33.183
And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:35.993
And if you were to ask me to describe myself,

00:00:35.993 --> 00:00:38.915
I'd probably say some of those same things.

00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:42.476
And I wouldn't be lying,

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:46.006
but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either,

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:47.533
because the truth is,

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.705
that's just the life everyone else sees.

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:54.468
In the life that only I see, who I am,

00:00:54.468 --> 00:00:56.395
who I really am,

00:00:56.395 --> 00:01:00.830
is someone who struggles intensely with depression.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.507
I have for the last six years of my life,

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:08.626
and I continue to every day.

00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:11.123
Now, for someone who has never experienced depression

00:01:11.123 --> 00:01:12.325
or doesn't really know what that means,

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:13.708
that might surprise them to hear,

00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:15.613
because there's this pretty popular misconception

00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:18.360
that depression is just being sad

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.848
when something in your life goes wrong,

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:22.490
when you break up with your girlfriend,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.881
when you lose a loved one,

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:25.632
when you don't get the job you wanted.

00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:27.619
But that's sadness. That's a natural thing.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.531
That's a natural human emotion.

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:33.729
Real depression isn't being sad

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.358
when something in your life goes wrong.

00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:38.144
Real depression is being sad

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:41.413
when everything in your life is going right.

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:43.898
That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from.

00:01:43.898 --> 00:01:46.023
And to be totally honest,

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:48.837
that's hard for me to stand up here and say.

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:50.558
It's hard for me to talk about,

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:53.321
and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about,

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.689
so much so that no one's talking about it.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.083
And no one's talking about depression, but we need to be,

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.825
because right now it's a massive problem.

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:03.495
It's a massive problem.

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:05.297
But we don't see it on social media, right?

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.385
We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:09.207
We don't see it on the news, because it's not happy,

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:10.836
it's not fun, it's not light.

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:14.431
And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.

00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:18.190
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this:

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.913
every 30 seconds,

00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:22.117
every 30 seconds, somewhere,

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:24.310
someone in the world takes their own life

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.387
because of depression,

00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:27.627
and it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away,

00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:29.157
it might be two continents away, but it's happening,

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:31.727
and it's happening every single day.

00:02:31.727 --> 00:02:34.691
And we have a tendency, as a society,

00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:39.937
to look at that and go, "So what?"

00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:44.592
So what? We look at that, and we go, "That's your problem.

00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:46.995
That's their problem."

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:48.847
We say we're sad and we say we're sorry,

00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:50.224
but we also say, "So what?"

00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:54.907
Well, two years ago it was my problem,

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.964
because I sat on the edge of my bed

00:02:58.964 --> 00:03:02.324
where I'd sat a million times before

00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:05.140
and I was suicidal.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.066
I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface,

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.308
you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.

00:03:11.308 --> 00:03:13.424
You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team,

00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:15.485
the drama and theater student of the year,

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:16.444
the English student of the year,

00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:18.272
someone who was consistently on the honor roll

00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:21.945
and consistently at every party.

00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:23.586
So you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:26.297
I wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.

00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:27.736
You would be wrong. So I sat there that night

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:31.774
beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:33.762
and I thought about taking my own life

00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:37.114
and I came this close to doing it.

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:38.796
I came this close to doing it.

00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:41.924
And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones,

00:03:41.924 --> 00:03:44.059
one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.320
and look down but not jump,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.325
one of the lucky ones who survives.

00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:50.722
Well, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story,

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:53.127
and my story is this:

00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:56.480
In four simple words, I suffer from depression.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.910
I suffer from depression,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.230
and for a long time, I think,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.826
I was living two totally different lives,

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:10.687
where one person was always afraid of the other.

00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:12.786
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was,

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:16.028
that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was,

00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:18.453
that beneath my smile, there was struggle,

00:04:18.453 --> 00:04:20.416
and beneath my light, there was dark,

00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:24.793
and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain.

00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:27.430
See, some people might fear girls not liking them back.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.519
Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:34.212
But for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:36.904
I feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability,

00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:39.126
and that fear made me feel

00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:41.483
like I was forced into a corner,

00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:44.513
like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out,

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:48.306
and so I thought about that way every single day.

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:49.753
I thought about it every single day,

00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:51.424
and if I'm being totally honest, standing here

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:54.797
I've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness,

00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:56.731
that's the struggle, that's depression,

00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:57.950
and depression isn't chicken pox.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.668
You don't beat it once and it's gone forever.

00:04:59.668 --> 00:05:02.431
It's something you live with. It's something you live in.

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:06.003
It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore.

00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:08.264
It's the feelings you can't seem to escape,

00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:13.337
the scariest part is that after a while,

00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:16.217
you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you,

00:05:16.217 --> 00:05:18.504
and what you really fear the most

00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:21.360
isn't the suffering inside of you.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.876
It's the stigma inside of others,

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:25.157
it's the shame, it's the embarrassment,

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.610
it's the disapproving look on a friend's face,

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.074
it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak,

00:05:31.074 --> 00:05:32.475
it's the comments that you're crazy.

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:34.575
That's what keeps you from getting help.

00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:37.569
That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.904
It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it,

00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:41.766
and you hold it in and you hide it,

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:43.442
and even though it's keeping you in bed every day

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:46.382
and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it,

00:05:46.382 --> 00:05:48.545
you hide it, because the stigma in our society

00:05:48.545 --> 00:05:51.460
around depression is very real.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.662
It's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this:

00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:56.471
Would you rather make your next Facebook status

00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:58.217
say you're having a tough time getting out of bed

00:05:58.217 --> 00:06:00.366
because you hurt your back

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:02.358
or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning

00:06:02.358 --> 00:06:04.458
because you're depressed?

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:06.742
That's the stigma, because unfortunately,

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:09.210
we live in a world where if you break your arm,

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.884
everyone runs over to sign your cast,

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:14.700
but if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.200
That's the stigma.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.166
We are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:25.268
other than our brains. And that's ignorance.

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:27.280
That's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.844
a world that doesn't understand depression,

00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:31.350
that doesn't understand mental health.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.303
And that's ironic to me, because depression

00:06:33.303 --> 00:06:35.813
is one of the best documented problems we have in the world,

00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:37.858
yet it's one of the least discussed.

00:06:37.858 --> 00:06:40.294
We just push it aside and put it in a corner

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:43.881
and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself.

00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:47.223
Well, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to,

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.114
because that's wishful thinking,

00:06:49.114 --> 00:06:51.887
and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination,

00:06:51.887 --> 00:06:56.816
and we can't procrastinate on something this important.

00:06:56.816 --> 00:07:00.207
The first step in solving any problem

00:07:00.207 --> 00:07:01.690
is recognizing there is one.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.448
Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect

00:07:04.448 --> 00:07:07.633
to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.

00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:11.412
And I don't know what the solution is.

00:07:11.412 --> 00:07:13.873
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think,

00:07:13.873 --> 00:07:15.881
I think it has to start here.

00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:18.280
It has to start with me, it has to start with you,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.698
it has to start with the people who are suffering,

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:23.115
the ones who are hidden in the shadows.

00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:25.115
We need to speak up and shatter the silence.

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:27.434
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in,

00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:30.609
because if there's one thing that I've come to realize,

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:34.185
if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem,

00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:37.224
it's not in building a world

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:40.973
where we eliminate the ignorance of others.

00:07:40.973 --> 00:07:44.259
It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves,

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:45.460
where we're okay with who we are,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.960
because when we get honest,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.756
we see that we all struggle and we all suffer.

00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:51.708
Whether it's with this, whether it's with something else,

00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:54.535
we all know what it is to hurt.

00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:56.373
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart,

00:07:56.373 --> 00:07:59.067
and we all know how important it is to heal.

00:07:59.067 --> 00:08:02.461
But right now, depression is society's deep cut

00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:05.022
that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.

00:08:05.022 --> 00:08:09.526
Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.

00:08:09.526 --> 00:08:13.337
Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.

00:08:13.337 --> 00:08:15.999
And know that you're sick, you're not weak,

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:17.935
and it's an issue, not an identity,

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:20.688
because when you get past the fear and the ridicule

00:08:20.688 --> 00:08:22.485
and the judgment and the stigma of others,

00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:25.471
you can see depression for what it really is,

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.710
and that's just a part of life,

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.438
just a part of life, and as much as I hate,

00:08:31.438 --> 00:08:33.917
as much as I hate some of the places,

00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:37.013
some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to,

00:08:37.013 --> 00:08:39.548
in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.

00:08:39.548 --> 00:08:41.360
Because yeah, it's put me in the valleys,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.792
but only to show me there's peaks,

00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:44.391
and yeah it's dragged me through the dark

00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:46.977
but only to remind me there is light.

00:08:46.977 --> 00:08:50.720
My pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.979
has given me perspective, and my hurt,

00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:55.474
my hurt has forced me to have hope,

00:08:55.474 --> 00:08:58.005
have hope and to have faith, faith in myself,

00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:00.550
faith in others, faith that it can get better,

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.628
that we can change this, that we can speak up

00:09:02.628 --> 00:09:05.386
and speak out and fight back against ignorance,

00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:07.975
fight back against intolerance,

00:09:07.975 --> 00:09:09.990
and more than anything,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.716
learn to love ourselves,

00:09:12.716 --> 00:09:14.895
learn to accept ourselves for who we are,

00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:18.990
the people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.602
Because the world I believe in is one

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:24.770
where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.851
The world I believe in is one where we're measured

00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:31.367
by our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.

00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:35.591
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye

00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:37.353
and say, "I'm going through hell,"

00:09:37.353 --> 00:09:40.930
and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.632
and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people.

00:09:44.632 --> 00:09:47.062
We're people, and we struggle and we suffer

00:09:47.062 --> 00:09:49.790
and we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.909
means never showing any weakness, then I'm here

00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:55.155
to tell you you're wrong.

00:09:55.155 --> 00:09:59.052
You're wrong, because it's the opposite.

00:09:59.052 --> 00:10:01.736
We're people, and we have problems.

00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:03.407
We're not perfect, and that's okay.

00:10:03.407 --> 00:10:05.621
So we need to stop the ignorance,

00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:08.699
stop the intolerance, stop the stigma,

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:13.273
and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos,

00:10:13.273 --> 00:10:17.812
take a look at the truth, and start talking,

00:10:17.812 --> 00:10:22.536
because the only way we're going to beat a problem

00:10:22.536 --> 00:10:25.870
that people are battling alone

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.633
is by standing strong together,

00:10:29.633 --> 00:10:33.397
by standing strong together.

00:10:33.397 --> 00:10:36.376
And I believe that we can.

00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:38.295
I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.

00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:40.702
This is a dream come true. Thank you. (Applause)

00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:42.960
Thank you. (Applause)
