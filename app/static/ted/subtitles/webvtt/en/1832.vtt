00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:02.276
I think it's safe to say

00:00:02.276 --> 00:00:06.260
that all humans will be intimate with death

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.100
at least once in their lives.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.117
But what if that intimacy began

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:13.406
long before you faced your own transition

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:16.200
from life into death?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.129
What would life be like

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:21.725
if the dead literally lived alongside you?

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:23.651
In my husband's homeland

00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:26.331
in the highlands of Sulawesi island

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:28.358
in eastern Indonesia,

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:30.827
there is a community of people that experience death

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:33.448
not as a singular event

00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:37.200
but as a gradual social process.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.997
In Tana Toraja,

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:42.035
the most important social moments in people's lives,

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:45.381
the focal points of social and cultural interaction

00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:50.096
are not weddings or births or even family dinners,

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:52.590
but funerals.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.919
So these funerals are characterized

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:56.830
by elaborate rituals

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.345
that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.482
based on the amount of animals --

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:07.476
pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo --

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:10.159
that are sacrificed and distributed

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.926
in the name of the deceased.

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:16.663
So this cultural complex surrounding death,

00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:20.291
the ritual enactment of the end of life,

00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:22.871
has made death the most visible

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:27.700
and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.128
Lasting anywhere from a few days

00:01:30.128 --> 00:01:31.968
to a few weeks,

00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:35.110
funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.152
where commemorating someone who's died

00:01:38.152 --> 00:01:40.743
is not so much a private sadness

00:01:40.743 --> 00:01:45.811
but more of a publicly shared transition.

00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:48.212
And it's a transition that's just as much

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:50.414
about the identity of the living

00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:54.227
as it is about remembrance of the dead.

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:56.721
So every year, thousands of visitors

00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:59.285
come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were,

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.349
this culture of death,

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.935
and for many people these grandiose ceremonies

00:02:04.935 --> 00:02:07.693
and the length of the ceremonies

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.437
are somehow incommensurable

00:02:10.437 --> 00:02:15.360
with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.274
So even as we share death as a universal experience,

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:25.416
it's not experienced the same way the world over.

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:27.684
And as an anthropologist,

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:30.146
I see these differences in experience

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:34.895
being rooted in the cultural and social world

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:40.071
through which we define the phenomena around us.

00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:44.956
So where we see an unquestionable reality,

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:49.879
death as an irrefutable biological condition,

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.184
Torajans see the expired corporeal form

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:56.996
as part of a larger social genesis.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:03:01.792
So again, the physical cessation of life

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:04.741
is not the same as death.

00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:08.324
In fact, a member of society is only truly dead

00:03:08.324 --> 00:03:11.758
when the extended family can agree upon

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.102
and marshal the resources necessary

00:03:14.102 --> 00:03:15.888
to hold a funeral ceremony

00:03:15.888 --> 00:03:19.540
that is considered appropriate in terms of resources

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.235
for the status of the deceased.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.507
And this ceremony has to take place

00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:26.669
in front of the eyes of the whole community

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.276
with everyone's participation.

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:32.146
So after a person's physical death,

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:34.885
their body is placed in a special room

00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:37.941
in the traditional residence, which is called the tongkonan.

00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:40.089
And the tongkonan is symbolic

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:44.191
not only of the family's identity

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:47.888
but also of the human life cycle from birth to death.

00:03:47.888 --> 00:03:49.787
So essentially, the shape of the building

00:03:49.787 --> 00:03:51.831
that you're born into is the shape

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:53.725
of the structure which carries you

00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:57.421
to your ancestral resting place.

00:03:57.421 --> 00:03:59.701
Until the funeral ceremony,

00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:04.648
which can be held years after a person's physical death,

00:04:04.648 --> 00:04:10.363
the deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person,

00:04:10.363 --> 00:04:14.706
or "to mama," a person who is asleep,

00:04:14.706 --> 00:04:18.489
and they continue to be a member of the household.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.848
They are symbolically fed and cared for,

00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:23.730
and the family at this time

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.643
will begin a number of ritual injunctions,

00:04:26.643 --> 00:04:29.605
which communicates to the wider community around them

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:32.427
that one of their members is undergoing the transition

00:04:32.427 --> 00:04:35.462
from this life into the afterlife

00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:37.722
known as Puya.

00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:40.444
So I know what some of you must be thinking right now.

00:04:40.444 --> 00:04:43.220
Is she really saying that these people live

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.288
with the bodies of their dead relatives?

00:04:46.288 --> 00:04:49.360
And that's exactly what I'm saying.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.840
But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.378
we have to this idea of proximity to bodies,

00:04:56.378 --> 00:04:58.512
proximity to death,

00:04:58.512 --> 00:05:01.032
or how this notion just does not fit

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:04.284
into our very biological or medical

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:07.088
sort of definition of death,

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:10.175
I like to think about what the Torajan way

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:14.931
of viewing death encompasses of the human experience

00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:19.964
that the medical definition leaves out.

00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:23.705
I think that Torajans socially recognize

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:26.835
and culturally express

00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:29.297
what many of us feel to be true

00:05:29.297 --> 00:05:31.721
despite the widespread acceptance

00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:36.468
of the biomedical definition of death,

00:05:36.468 --> 00:05:40.363
and that is that our relationships with other humans,

00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:43.869
their impact on our social reality,

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:46.345
doesn't cease with the termination

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:50.326
of the physical processes of the body,

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:52.969
that there's a period of transition

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.190
as the relationship between the living and the dead

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.043
is transformed but not ended.

00:06:02.043 --> 00:06:06.881
So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship

00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:08.723
by lavishing love and attention

00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:11.993
on the most visible symbol of that relationship,

00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:13.770
the human body.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.594
So my husband has fond memories

00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:19.140
of talking to and playing with

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.601
and generally being around his deceased grandfather,

00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:25.876
and for him there is nothing unnatural about this.

00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:28.805
This is a natural part of the process

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:32.274
as the family comes to terms with the transition

00:06:32.274 --> 00:06:34.966
in their relationship to the deceased,

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:37.455
and this is the transition from relating to the deceased

00:06:37.455 --> 00:06:39.725
as a person who's living

00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:41.627
to relating to the deceased

00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:43.453
as a person who's an ancestor.

00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:45.638
And here you can see these wooden effigies

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:46.841
of the ancestors,

00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:48.432
so these are people who have already been buried,

00:06:48.432 --> 00:06:49.898
already had a funeral ceremony.

00:06:49.898 --> 00:06:52.808
These are called tau tau.

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:55.328
So the funeral ceremony itself

00:06:55.328 --> 00:06:59.224
embodies this relational perspective on death.

00:06:59.224 --> 00:07:03.607
It ritualizes the impact of death on families

00:07:03.607 --> 00:07:05.830
and communities.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.998
And it's also a moment of self-awareness.

00:07:08.998 --> 00:07:12.127
It's a moment when people think about who they are,

00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:15.632
their place in society,

00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:17.935
and their role in the life cycle

00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:22.128
in accordance with Torajan cosmology.

00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:23.782
There's a saying in Toraja

00:07:23.782 --> 00:07:26.916
that all people will become grandparents,

00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:29.297
and what this means is that after death,

00:07:29.297 --> 00:07:32.146
we all become part of the ancestral line

00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:35.954
that anchors us between the past and the present

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:40.943
and will define who our loved ones are into the future.

00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:43.732
So essentially, we all become grandparents

00:07:43.732 --> 00:07:46.146
to the generations of human children

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:49.160
that come after us.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.389
And this metaphor of membership

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:53.519
in the greater human family

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:55.364
is the way that children also describe

00:07:55.364 --> 00:07:56.942
the money that they invest

00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:58.913
in these sacrificial buffaloes

00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:00.955
that are thought to carry people's soul

00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:03.125
from here to the afterlife,

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:04.711
and children will explain

00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:07.290
that they will invest the money in this

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.717
because they want to repay their parents

00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:12.962
the debt for all of the years their parents spent

00:08:12.962 --> 00:08:15.476
investing and caring for them.

00:08:15.476 --> 00:08:18.186
But the sacrifice of buffalo

00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:20.873
and the ritual display of wealth

00:08:20.873 --> 00:08:23.928
also exhibits the status of the deceased,

00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:27.220
and, by extension, the deceased's family.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.348
So at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed

00:08:31.348 --> 00:08:33.661
but also transformed

00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:36.301
in a ritual drama that highlights

00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:40.079
the most salient feature about death in this place:

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:45.345
its impact on life and the relationships of the living.

00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:48.160
So all of this focus on death

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.796
doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:53.472
to the ideal of a long life.

00:08:53.472 --> 00:08:55.541
They engage in many practices

00:08:55.541 --> 00:08:57.669
thought to confer good health

00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:00.533
and survival to an advanced age.

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:02.700
But they don't put much stock

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.699
in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness

00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:10.354
or in old age.

00:09:10.354 --> 00:09:12.217
It's said in Toraja that everybody has

00:09:12.217 --> 00:09:14.954
sort of a predetermined amount of life.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.932
It's called the sunga'.

00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:20.000
And like a thread, it should be allowed to unspool

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.940
to its natural end.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.488
So by having death as a part

00:09:25.488 --> 00:09:29.657
of the cultural and social fabric of life,

00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:32.630
people's everyday decisions about their health

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.931
and healthcare are affected.

00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:39.058
The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan,

00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:41.130
Nenet Katcha,

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:46.783
is now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell.

00:09:46.783 --> 00:09:48.885
And there are increasing signs

00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:53.528
that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya.

00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:58.459
And his death will be greatly mourned.

00:09:58.459 --> 00:10:00.675
But I know that my husband's family

00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:02.893
looks forward to the moment

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:06.550
when they can ritually display

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.283
what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives,

00:10:11.283 --> 00:10:13.021
when they can ritually recount

00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:15.036
his life's narrative,

00:10:15.036 --> 00:10:16.800
weaving his story

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.822
into the history of their community.

00:10:20.822 --> 00:10:24.654
His story is their story.

00:10:24.654 --> 00:10:30.426
His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves.

00:10:30.426 --> 00:10:34.211
And it's a story that has no discernible beginning,

00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:36.832
no foreseeable end.

00:10:36.832 --> 00:10:38.768
It's a story that goes on

00:10:38.768 --> 00:10:43.420
long after his body no longer does.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.940
People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.660
by participating in a culture

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.331
where the physical manifestations of death

00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:55.110
greet us at every turn.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.340
But I see something profoundly transformative

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.755
in experiencing death as a social process

00:11:01.755 --> 00:11:05.011
and not just a biological one.

00:11:05.011 --> 00:11:09.075
In reality, the relationship between the living and the dead

00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:12.365
has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system,

00:11:12.365 --> 00:11:14.908
where decisions about how long to stretch

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:18.181
the thread of life are made based on our emotional

00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:20.806
and social ties with the people around us,

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:25.925
not just on medicine's ability to prolong life.

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:28.650
We, like the Torajans,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.445
base our decisions about life

00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:35.093
on the meanings and the definitions

00:11:35.093 --> 00:11:37.357
that we ascribe to death.

00:11:37.357 --> 00:11:40.900
So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.132
should run out and adopt the traditions

00:11:43.132 --> 00:11:44.754
of the Torajans.

00:11:44.754 --> 00:11:46.346
It might be a little bit difficult

00:11:46.346 --> 00:11:49.680
to put into play in the United States.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.561
But I want to ask what we can gain

00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:56.000
from seeing physical death not only as a biological process

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.492
but as part of the greater human story.

00:12:00.492 --> 00:12:03.023
What would it be like to look on

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:06.472
the expired human form with love

00:12:06.472 --> 00:12:10.196
because it's so intimately a part of who we all are?

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:13.083
If we could expand our definition of death

00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:15.494
to encompass life,

00:12:15.494 --> 00:12:19.408
we could experience death as part of life

00:12:19.408 --> 00:12:21.670
and perhaps face death

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.133
with something other than fear.

00:12:26.133 --> 00:12:29.076
Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges

00:12:29.076 --> 00:12:31.929
that are facing the U.S. healthcare system,

00:12:31.929 --> 00:12:34.355
particularly in the end-of-life care,

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:37.385
is as simple as a shift in perspective,

00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:39.402
and the shift in perspective in this case

00:12:39.402 --> 00:12:45.030
would be to look at the social life of every death.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.515
It might help us recognize that the way we limit

00:12:48.515 --> 00:12:50.191
our conversation about death

00:12:50.191 --> 00:12:53.226
to something that's medical or biological

00:12:53.226 --> 00:12:57.049
is reflective of a larger culture that we all share

00:12:57.049 --> 00:13:02.699
of avoiding death, being afraid of talking about it.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:07.139
If we could entertain and value

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:10.262
other kinds of knowledge about life,

00:13:10.262 --> 00:13:13.936
including other definitions of death,

00:13:13.936 --> 00:13:16.138
it has the potential to change the discussions

00:13:16.138 --> 00:13:19.885
that we have about the end of life.

00:13:19.885 --> 00:13:23.978
It could change the way that we die,

00:13:23.978 --> 00:13:25.990
but more importantly,

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:33.092
it could transform the way that we live.

00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:37.101
