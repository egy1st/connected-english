WEBVTT

00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:03.081
So my name is Amy Webb,

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:05.778
and a few years ago
I found myself at the end

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:08.414
of yet another fantastic relationship

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:11.526
that came burning down
in a spectacular fashion.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.778
And I thought, what's wrong with me?

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:16.860
I don't understand
why this keeps happening.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.930
So I asked everybody in my life
what they thought.

00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:24.359
I turned to my grandmother,
who always had plenty of advice,

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.351
and she said, "Stop being so picky.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:28.729
You've got to date around.

00:00:28.753 --> 00:00:30.107
And most importantly,

00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:33.730
true love will find you
when you least expect it."

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:36.031
Now as it turns out,

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.588
I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:39.887
as you'll soon find.

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:45.077
I am constantly swimming
in numbers, formulas and charts.

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:47.477
I also have a very tight-knit family,

00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:49.488
and I'm very, very close with my sister,

00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:52.964
and as a result, I wanted to have
the same type of family when I grew up.

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:54.861
So I'm at the end of this bad breakup,

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.088
I'm 30 years old,

00:00:56.112 --> 00:00:59.815
I figure I'm probably going to have
to date somebody for about six months

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.657
before I'm ready to get monogamous

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:03.460
and before we can sort of cohabitate,

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:06.409
and we have to do that
for a while before we can get engaged.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.402
And if I want to start having children
by the time I'm 35,

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:12.603
that meant that I would have
had to have been on my way to marriage

00:01:12.627 --> 00:01:13.789
five years ago.

00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:15.583
So that wasn't going to work.

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:19.330
If my strategy was to least-expect
my way into true love,

00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:22.249
then the variable that I had
to deal with was serendipity.

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.017
In short, I was trying to figure out

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.929
what's the probability
of my finding Mr. Right?

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.182
Well, at the time I was living
in the city of Philadelphia,

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:33.301
and it's a big city, and I figured,

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:36.292
in this entire place,
there are lots of possibilities.

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:38.636
So again, I started doing some math.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.370
Population of Philadelphia:
it has 1.5 million people.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.109
I figure about half of that are men,

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.703
so that takes the number down to 750,000.

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:49.912
I'm looking for a guy
between the ages of 30 and 36,

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:52.467
which was only four percent
of the population,

00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:55.068
so now I'm dealing
with the possibility of 30,000 men.

00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:57.093
I was looking for somebody who was Jewish,

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.341
because I am and that was important to me.

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:01.880
That's only 2.3 percent of the population.

00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:06.029
I figure I'm attracted to maybe
one out of 10 of those men,

00:02:06.053 --> 00:02:10.866
and there was no way I was going to deal
with somebody who was an avid golfer.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.926
So that basically meant
there were 35 men for me

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.154
that I could possibly date

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:18.846
in the entire city of Philadelphia.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.537
In the meantime,
my very large Jewish family

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:26.339
was already all married
and well on their way

00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:28.250
to having lots and lots of children,

00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:30.751
and I felt like I was
under tremendous peer pressure

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.227
to get my life going already.

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:34.946
So I have two possible
strategies at this point

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.204
I'm sort of figuring out.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:38.504
One, I can take my grandmother's advice

00:02:38.528 --> 00:02:40.760
and sort of least-expect my way

00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:44.975
into maybe bumping into the one
out of 35 possible men

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:49.172
in the entire 1.5-million-person
city of Philadelphia,

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:51.785
or I could try online dating.

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:54.342
Now, I like the idea of online dating,

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:56.343
because it's predicated on an algorithm,

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:58.492
and that's really just
a simple way of saying

00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:00.808
I've got a problem,
I'm going to use some data,

00:03:00.832 --> 00:03:03.213
run it through a system
and get to a solution.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.585
So online dating is the second
most popular way

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.243
that people now meet each other,

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:10.553
but as it turns out,
algorithms have been around

00:03:10.577 --> 00:03:13.838
for thousands of years
in almost every culture.

00:03:13.862 --> 00:03:17.335
In fact, in Judaism,
there were matchmakers a long time ago,

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.046
and though they didn't have
an explicit algorithm per se,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.085
they definitely were running
through formulas in their heads,

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.052
like, is the girl going to like the boy?

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:26.792
Are the families going to get along?

00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:28.245
What's the rabbi going to say?

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.656
Are they going to start
having children right away?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.306
The matchmaker would sort
of think through all of this,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.028
put two people together,
and that would be the end of it.

00:03:36.052 --> 00:03:37.794
So in my case, I thought,

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:42.131
well, will data and an algorithm
lead me to my Prince Charming?

00:03:42.563 --> 00:03:43.995
So I decided to sign on.

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.845
Now, there was one small catch.

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:48.476
As I'm signing on to the various
dating websites,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.771
as it happens, I was really, really busy.

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.509
But that actually
wasn't the biggest problem.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.553
The biggest problem is that I hate
filling out questionnaires of any kind,

00:03:57.577 --> 00:04:01.956
and I certainly don't like questionnaires
that are like Cosmo quizzes.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.454
So I just copied
and pasted from my résumé.

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:09.911
(Laughter)

00:04:09.935 --> 00:04:12.559
So in the descriptive part up top,

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:14.885
I said that I was
an award-winning journalist

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.515
and a future thinker.

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.877
When I was asked about fun activities
and my ideal date,

00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:24.087
I said monetization
and fluency in Japanese.

00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:25.804
I talked a lot about JavaScript.

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:27.051
(Laughter)

00:04:27.075 --> 00:04:33.202
So obviously this was not the best way
to put my most sexy foot forward.

00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:38.227
But the real failure was that
there were plenty of men for me to date.

00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:40.688
These algorithms had a sea full of men

00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:43.394
that wanted to take me out
on lots of dates --

00:04:43.418 --> 00:04:46.346
what turned out to be truly awful dates.

00:04:47.256 --> 00:04:49.481
There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.128
The algorithm matched us up
because we share a love of gadgets,

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:57.197
we share a love of math
and data and '80s music,

00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:59.170
and so I agreed to go out with him.

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:01.827
So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out

00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:03.921
to one of Philadelphia's
white-table-cloth,

00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:05.628
extremely expensive restaurants.

00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:07.691
And we went in, and right off the bat,

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:10.951
our conversation really
wasn't taking flight,

00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:12.780
but he was ordering a lot of food.

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:15.233
In fact, he didn't even bother
looking at the menu.

00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:19.132
He was ordering multiple appetizers,
multiple entrées, for me as well,

00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:22.014
and suddenly there are piles
and piles of food on our table,

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:24.092
also lots and lots of bottles of wine.

00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:26.273
So we're nearing the end
of our conversation

00:05:26.297 --> 00:05:28.194
and the end of dinner, and I've decided

00:05:28.218 --> 00:05:31.328
Steve the I.T. guy and I are really
just not meant for each other,

00:05:31.352 --> 00:05:32.915
but we'll part ways as friends,

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.364
when he gets up to go to the bathroom,

00:05:35.388 --> 00:05:38.515
and in the meantime,
the bill comes to our table.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.564
And listen, I'm a modern woman.

00:05:41.588 --> 00:05:43.929
I am totally down with splitting the bill.

00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:47.081
But then Steve the I.T. guy
didn't come back.

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:48.191
(Gasping)

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:51.596
And that was my entire month's rent.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.954
(Audience gasps)

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:56.227
So needless to say,
I was not having a good night.

00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:59.928
So I run home, I call
my mother, I call my sister,

00:05:59.952 --> 00:06:04.126
and as I do, at the end of each one
of these terrible, terrible dates,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.822
I regale them with the details.

00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:08.378
And they say to me,

00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:09.997
"Stop complaining."

00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:11.956
(Laughter)

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.773
"You're just being too picky."

00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:17.486
So I said, fine, from here on out
I'm only going on dates

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.213
where I know there's Wi-Fi,
and I'm bringing my laptop.

00:06:20.237 --> 00:06:21.872
I'm going to shove it into my bag,

00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:23.729
I'm going to have this email template,

00:06:23.753 --> 00:06:26.182
and I'm going to fill it out
and collect information

00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:28.622
on all these different
data points during the date

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:30.504
to prove to everybody that empirically,

00:06:30.528 --> 00:06:32.105
these dates really are terrible.

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:33.152
(Laughter)

00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:37.270
So I started tracking things like
really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;

00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:39.449
bad vocabulary;

00:06:39.473 --> 00:06:42.504
the number of times a man
forced me to high-five him.

00:06:42.528 --> 00:06:44.678
(Laughter)

00:06:44.702 --> 00:06:49.068
So I started to crunch some numbers,

00:06:49.092 --> 00:06:51.743
and that allowed me
to make some correlations.

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:54.367
So as it turns out,

00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:59.465
for some reason, men who drink Scotch
reference kinky sex immediately.

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:01.602
(Laughter)

00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:05.866
Well, it turns out
that these probably weren't bad guys.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.776
There were just bad for me.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.451
And as it happens, the algorithms
that were setting us up,

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:12.856
they weren't bad either.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.149
These algorithms were doing exactly
what they were designed to do,

00:07:16.173 --> 00:07:18.764
which was to take
our user-generated information,

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:20.268
in my case, my résumé,

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:23.295
and match it up
with other people's information.

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.986
See, the real problem here is that,

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.954
while the algorithms work just fine,

00:07:26.978 --> 00:07:28.209
you and I don't,

00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:30.346
when confronted with blank windows

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.871
where we're supposed to input
our information online.

00:07:32.895 --> 00:07:34.546
Very few of us have the ability

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.022
to be totally and brutally
honest with ourselves.

00:07:38.046 --> 00:07:40.618
The other problem
is that these websites are asking us

00:07:40.642 --> 00:07:43.496
questions like, are you
a dog person or a cat person?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.481
Do you like horror films or romance films?

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:48.235
I'm not looking for a pen pal.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.145
I'm looking for a husband. Right?

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.560
So there's a certain amount
of superficiality in that data.

00:07:53.584 --> 00:07:56.130
So I said fine, I've got a new plan.

00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:58.535
I'm going to keep using
these online dating sites,

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:01.020
but I'm going to treat them as databases,

00:08:01.044 --> 00:08:03.709
and rather than waiting
for an algorithm to set me up,

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.987
I think I'm going to try
reverse-engineering this entire system.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.401
So knowing that there was superficial data

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:12.949
that was being used
to match me up with other people,

00:08:12.973 --> 00:08:15.400
I decided instead to ask my own questions.

00:08:15.424 --> 00:08:17.154
What was every single possible thing

00:08:17.178 --> 00:08:19.815
that I could think of
that I was looking for in a mate?

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.742
So I started writing

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:24.458
and writing and writing,

00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:29.277
and at the end, I had amassed
72 different data points.

00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:31.555
I wanted somebody was Jew-ish,

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:33.152
so I was looking for somebody

00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:35.906
who had the same background
and thoughts on our culture,

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.270
but wasn't going to force me to go to shul
every Friday and Saturday.

00:08:39.743 --> 00:08:41.363
I wanted somebody who worked hard,

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:43.435
because work for me
is extremely important,

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:45.011
but not too hard.

00:08:45.035 --> 00:08:46.543
For me, the hobbies that I have

00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:49.408
are really just new work projects
that I've launched.

00:08:49.432 --> 00:08:52.492
I also wanted somebody
who not only wanted two children,

00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:55.678
but was going to have the same
attitude toward parenting that I do,

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.765
so somebody who was going
to be totally okay

00:08:57.789 --> 00:09:01.143
with forcing our child to start
taking piano lessons at age three,

00:09:01.167 --> 00:09:05.912
and also maybe computer science classes
if we could wrangle it.

00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:08.619
So things like that,
but I also wanted somebody

00:09:08.643 --> 00:09:11.560
who would go to far-flung,
exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.

00:09:12.148 --> 00:09:15.686
I also wanted somebody who would weigh
20 pounds more than me at all times,

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.092
regardless of what I weighed.

00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:19.203
(Laughter)

00:09:19.227 --> 00:09:22.115
So I now have
these 72 different data points,

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:24.350
which, to be fair, is a lot.

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:27.501
So what I did was, I went through
and I prioritized that list.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:31.318
I broke it into a top tier
and a second tier of points,

00:09:31.342 --> 00:09:34.543
and I ranked everything starting at 100

00:09:34.567 --> 00:09:36.793
and going all the way down to 91,

00:09:36.817 --> 00:09:40.223
and listing things like I was looking
for somebody who was really smart,

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:42.010
who would challenge and stimulate me,

00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:45.756
and balancing that with a second tier
and a second set of points.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.011
These things were also important to me
but not necessarily deal-breakers.

00:09:50.035 --> 00:09:51.582
(Laughter)

00:09:52.127 --> 00:09:55.207
So once I had all this done,
I then built a scoring system,

00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:59.712
because what I wanted to do
was to sort of mathematically calculate

00:09:59.736 --> 00:10:02.218
whether or not I thought
the guy that I found online

00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:03.633
would be a match with me.

00:10:03.657 --> 00:10:06.164
I figured there would be
a minimum of 700 points

00:10:06.188 --> 00:10:09.788
before I would agree to email somebody
or respond to an email message.

00:10:09.812 --> 00:10:12.003
For 900 points,
I'd agree to go out on a date,

00:10:12.027 --> 00:10:14.684
and I wouldn't even consider
any kind of relationship

00:10:14.708 --> 00:10:17.747
before somebody had crossed
the 1,500 point threshold.

00:10:18.683 --> 00:10:21.531
Well, as it turns out,
this worked pretty well.

00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:23.469
So I go back online now.

00:10:23.493 --> 00:10:26.095
I found Jewishdoc57

00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:29.032
who's incredibly good-looking,
incredibly well-spoken,

00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:30.750
he had hiked Mt. Fuji,

00:10:30.774 --> 00:10:32.680
he had walked along the Great Wall.

00:10:32.704 --> 00:10:33.855
He likes to travel

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:36.005
as long as it doesn't involve
a cruise ship.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:37.542
And I thought,

00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:38.717
I've done it!

00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:40.276
I've cracked the code.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.363
I have just found
the Jewish Prince Charming

00:10:44.387 --> 00:10:45.959
of my family's dreams.

00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:48.105
There was only one problem:

00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:50.986
He didn't like me back.

00:10:51.887 --> 00:10:54.949
And I guess the one variable
that I haven't considered

00:10:54.973 --> 00:10:56.383
is the competition.

00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:59.743
Who are all of the other women
on these dating sites?

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:04.028
I found SmileyGirl1978.

00:11:04.584 --> 00:11:07.308
She said she was a "Fun girl
who is Happy and Outgoing."

00:11:07.332 --> 00:11:08.938
She listed her job as "teacher."

00:11:08.962 --> 00:11:11.356
She said she is
"silly, nice and friendly."

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.414
She likes to make people laugh "alot."

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:15.376
At this moment I knew,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.485
clicking profile after profile
that looked like this,

00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:21.003
that I needed to do some market research.

00:11:21.483 --> 00:11:23.754
So I created 10 fake male profiles.

00:11:23.778 --> 00:11:26.698
Now, before I lose all of you --

00:11:26.722 --> 00:11:29.930
(Laughter) --

00:11:29.954 --> 00:11:34.176
understand that I did this
strictly to gather data

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.924
about everybody else in the system.

00:11:35.948 --> 00:11:40.235
I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style
relationships with anybody.

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:42.132
I really was just scraping their data.

00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:44.100
But I didn't want everybody's data.

00:11:44.124 --> 00:11:47.547
I only wanted data on the women
who were going to be attracted

00:11:47.571 --> 00:11:50.269
to the type of man that I really,
really wanted to marry.

00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:54.376
When I released these men into the wild,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.678
I did follow some rules.

00:11:55.702 --> 00:11:57.818
So I didn't reach out to any woman first.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.795
I just waited to see
who these profiles were going to attract,

00:12:00.819 --> 00:12:04.110
and mainly what I was looking at
was two different data sets.

00:12:04.134 --> 00:12:05.896
So I was looking at qualitative data,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.597
so what was the humor, the tone,

00:12:07.621 --> 00:12:09.241
the voice, the communication style

00:12:09.265 --> 00:12:11.009
that these women shared in common?

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:12.319
And also quantitative data,

00:12:12.343 --> 00:12:14.630
so what was the average length
of their profile,

00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:17.023
how much time was spent between messages?

00:12:17.047 --> 00:12:20.471
What I was trying to get at here was
that I figured, in person,

00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:23.946
I would be just as competitive
as a SmileyGirl1978.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.367
I wanted to figure out how to maximize
my own profile online.

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:30.513
Well, one month later,

00:12:30.537 --> 00:12:34.266
I had a lot of data,
and I was able to do another analysis.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.146
And as it turns out,
content matters a lot.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.121
So smart people tend to write a lot --

00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:43.470
3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words
about themselves,

00:12:43.494 --> 00:12:45.797
which may all be very, very interesting.

00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:48.701
The challenge here, though,
is that the popular men and women

00:12:48.725 --> 00:12:51.922
are sticking to 97 words on average

00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:53.866
that are written very, very well,

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.534
even though it may not seem
like it all the time.

00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:58.897
The other hallmark
of the people who do this well

00:12:58.921 --> 00:13:01.024
is that they're using
non-specific language.

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:02.350
So in my case,

00:13:02.374 --> 00:13:05.960
"The English Patient"
is my most favorite movie ever,

00:13:05.984 --> 00:13:09.133
but it doesn't work
to use that in a profile,

00:13:09.157 --> 00:13:11.111
because that's a superficial data point,

00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:12.327
and somebody may disagree

00:13:12.351 --> 00:13:14.094
and decide they don't want to go out

00:13:14.118 --> 00:13:17.082
because they didn't like
sitting through the three-hour movie.

00:13:17.106 --> 00:13:19.086
Also, optimistic language matters a lot.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.322
So this is a word cloud

00:13:20.346 --> 00:13:22.782
highlighting the most popular
words that were used

00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:24.114
by the most popular women,

00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:26.511
words like "fun" and "girl" and "love."

00:13:26.828 --> 00:13:30.368
And what I realized was not
that I had to dumb down my own profile.

00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:31.900
Remember, I'm somebody who said

00:13:31.924 --> 00:13:34.943
that I speak fluent Japanese
and I know JavaScript

00:13:34.967 --> 00:13:36.688
and I was okay with that.

00:13:36.712 --> 00:13:39.470
The difference is that it's about being
more approachable

00:13:39.494 --> 00:13:43.021
and helping people understand
the best way to reach out to you.

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:46.065
And as it turns out, timing
is also really, really important.

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:49.337
Just because you have access
to somebody's mobile phone number

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.093
or their instant message account

00:13:51.117 --> 00:13:54.032
and it's 2 o'clock in the morning
and you happen to be awake,

00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:57.371
doesn't mean that that's a good time
to communicate with those people.

00:13:57.395 --> 00:13:59.338
The popular women on these online sites

00:13:59.362 --> 00:14:02.829
spend an average of 23 hours
in between each communication.

00:14:03.265 --> 00:14:07.547
And that's what we would normally do
in the usual process of courtship.

00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:08.757
And finally --

00:14:09.592 --> 00:14:11.147
there were the photos.

00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:14.196
All of the women who were popular
showed some skin.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.422
They all looked really great,

00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:19.324
which turned out to be in sharp contrast

00:14:19.348 --> 00:14:20.848
to what I had uploaded.

00:14:20.872 --> 00:14:22.610
(Laughter)

00:14:22.634 --> 00:14:24.340
Once I had all of this information,

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.477
I was able to create a super profile,

00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:28.502
so it was still me,

00:14:28.526 --> 00:14:31.494
but it was me optimized now
for this ecosystem.

00:14:32.431 --> 00:14:36.391
And as it turns out,
I did a really good job.

00:14:37.134 --> 00:14:40.166
I was the most popular person online.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.685
(Laughter)

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:46.899
(Applause)

00:14:46.923 --> 00:14:50.386
And as it turns out, lots and lots
of men wanted to date me.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.211
So I call my mom, I call my sister,
I call my grandmother.

00:14:53.235 --> 00:14:55.364
I'm telling them about this fabulous news,

00:14:55.388 --> 00:14:58.617
and they say, "This is wonderful!
How soon are you going out?"

00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:01.323
I said, "Actually, I'm not going
to go out with anybody."

00:15:01.347 --> 00:15:03.221
Because remember, in my scoring system,

00:15:03.245 --> 00:15:05.741
they have to reach a minimum
threshold of 700 points,

00:15:05.765 --> 00:15:07.304
and none of them have done that.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.407
They said, "What?
You're still being too damn picky."

00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:13.965
Well, not too long after that,
I found this guy, Thevenin,

00:15:13.989 --> 00:15:16.980
and he said that he was culturally Jewish,

00:15:17.004 --> 00:15:20.520
he said that his job
was an arctic baby seal hunter,

00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:22.320
which I thought was very clever.

00:15:22.344 --> 00:15:25.197
He talked in detail about travel.

00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:27.888
He made a lot of really
interesting cultural references.

00:15:27.912 --> 00:15:30.654
He looked and talked exactly
like what I wanted,

00:15:30.678 --> 00:15:33.812
and immediately, he scored 850 points.

00:15:33.836 --> 00:15:35.500
It was enough for a date.

00:15:35.524 --> 00:15:37.616
Three weeks later, we met up in person

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.120
for what turned out to be
a 14-hour-long conversation

00:15:41.144 --> 00:15:43.191
that went from coffee shop to restaurant

00:15:43.215 --> 00:15:45.372
to another coffee shop
to another restaurant,

00:15:45.396 --> 00:15:47.920
and when he dropped me back off
at my house that night

00:15:47.944 --> 00:15:49.095
I re-scored him --

00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:50.285
[1,050 points!]

00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:51.582
Thought, you know what,

00:15:51.606 --> 00:15:54.166
this entire time,
I haven't been picky enough.

00:15:54.849 --> 00:15:56.555
Well, a year and a half after that,

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:59.102
we were non-cruise ship traveling

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:01.187
through Petra, Jordan,

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.696
when he got down on his knee and proposed.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.159
A year after that, we were married,

00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:09.062
and about a year and a half after that,

00:16:09.086 --> 00:16:11.306
our daughter, Petra, was born.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.742
Audience: Oh!

00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:15.640
(Applause)

00:16:15.664 --> 00:16:16.996
[What it means...]

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:21.066
Obviously, I'm having
a fabulous life, so --

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.626
(Laughter)

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.122
The question is, what does
all of this mean for you?

00:16:25.146 --> 00:16:28.970
Well, as it turns out,
there is an algorithm for love.

00:16:28.994 --> 00:16:32.295
It's just not the ones
that we're being presented with online.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.976
In fact, it's something
that you write yourself.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.334
So whether you're looking
for a husband or a wife

00:16:37.358 --> 00:16:39.215
or you're trying to find your passion

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:41.001
or you're trying to start a business,

00:16:41.025 --> 00:16:43.879
all you have to really do
is figure out your own framework

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:45.663
and play by your own rules,

00:16:45.687 --> 00:16:47.948
and feel free to be as picky as you want.

00:16:48.327 --> 00:16:49.763
Well, on my wedding day,

00:16:49.787 --> 00:16:52.026
I had a conversation again
with my grandmother,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.466
and she said, "All right,
maybe I was wrong.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.905
It looks like you did come up
with a really, really great system.

00:16:57.929 --> 00:16:59.659
Now, your matzah balls ...

00:17:01.072 --> 00:17:02.953
