WEBVTT

00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:05.263
So, we used to solve big problems.

00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:08.783
On July 21st, 1969,

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:12.370
Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.927
and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.

00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:18.657
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone,

00:00:18.657 --> 00:00:20.943
but their presence on the moon's gray surface

00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:26.074
was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.

00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:28.118
The Apollo program was the greatest

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:29.855
peacetime mobilization

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:31.793
in the history of the United States.

00:00:31.793 --> 00:00:33.289
To get to the moon, NASA spent

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.028
around 180 billion dollars in today's money,

00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:39.564
or four percent of the federal budget.

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:42.868
Apollo employed around 400,000 people

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:45.706
and demanded the collaboration of 20,000

00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:49.402
companies, universities and government agencies.

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:53.346
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:56.947
But before the Apollo program ended,

00:00:56.947 --> 00:00:59.176
24 men flew to the moon.

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:02.250
Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.603
following the death of Armstrong last year,

00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:06.689
is now the most senior.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.674
So why did they go?

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:10.591
They didn't bring much back:

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:13.250
841 pounds of old rocks,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.705
and something all 24 later emphasized --

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:20.567
a new sense of the smallness

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:23.510
and the fragility of our common home.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.590
Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.566
because President Kennedy wanted to show

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:32.673
the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.

00:01:32.673 --> 00:01:37.145
But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:39.043
provide a better clue.

00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:41.566
(Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:44.510
Why choose this as our goal?

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.433
And they may well ask,

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:49.012
why climb the highest mountain?

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:53.028
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?

00:01:53.028 --> 00:01:55.212
Why does Rice play Texas?

00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:57.823
We choose to go to the moon.

00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:00.400
We choose to go to the moon.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.670
(Applause)

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.584
We choose to go to the moon in this decade,

00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:10.231
and do the other things,

00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:14.560
not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.730
Jason Pontin: To contemporaries,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.983
Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East

00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:21.198
in the Cold War.

00:02:21.198 --> 00:02:23.203
At the time, the strongest emotion

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:24.928
was of wonder

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:28.527
at the transcendent powers of technology.

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:33.946
They went because it was a big thing to do.

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:36.466
Landing on the moon occurred in the context

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:39.631
of a long series of technological triumphs.

00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:42.144
The first half of the 20th century produced

00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:44.280
the assembly line and the airplane,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.554
penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.

00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:48.856
In the middle years of the century,

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:52.548
polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:54.545
Technology itself seemed to possess

00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:57.129
what Alvin Toffler in 1970

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.963
called "accelerative thrust."

00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:01.807
For most of human history,

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:04.095
we could go no faster than a horse

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:06.196
or a boat with a sail,

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:08.597
but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10

00:03:08.597 --> 00:03:12.480
flew at 25,000 miles an hour.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.380
Since 1970, no human beings

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.262
have been back to the moon.

00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:19.481
No one has traveled faster than the crew

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.087
of Apollo 10,

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:24.859
and blithe optimism about technology's powers

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.761
has evaporated

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:30.332
as big problems we had imagined technology would solve,

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:32.635
such as going to Mars,

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:35.966
creating clean energy, curing cancer,

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.775
or feeding the world have come to seem

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:41.464
intractably hard.

00:03:41.464 --> 00:03:45.173
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.

00:03:45.173 --> 00:03:47.222
I was five years old,

00:03:47.222 --> 00:03:49.590
and my mother told me not to stare

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.725
at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.

00:03:52.725 --> 00:03:55.166
I vaguely knew this was to be the last

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:56.704
of the moon missions,

00:03:56.704 --> 00:04:00.470
but I was absolutely certain there would be

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.780
Mars colonies in my lifetime.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.343
So "Something happened

00:04:06.343 --> 00:04:10.526
to our capacity to solve big problems with technology"

00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:12.918
has become a commonplace.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.308
You hear it all the time.

00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:17.720
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.688
It feels as if technologists have diverted us

00:04:21.688 --> 00:04:24.373
and enriched themselves with trivial toys,

00:04:24.373 --> 00:04:27.878
with things like iPhones and apps and social media,

00:04:27.878 --> 00:04:31.497
or algorithms that speed automated trading.

00:04:31.497 --> 00:04:33.891
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.

00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:36.972
They've expanded and enriched our lives.

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:41.673
But they don't solve humanity's big problems.

00:04:41.673 --> 00:04:42.886
What happened?

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:47.800
So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.245
which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies

00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:53.547
than it did in the years when it financed

00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:56.705
Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.

00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:59.265
Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame,

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.182
in particular the incentives that venture capitalists

00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:03.762
offer to entrepreneurs.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.878
Silicon Valley says that venture investing

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:09.741
shifted away from funding transformational ideas

00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:12.680
and towards funding incremental problems

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.728
or even fake problems.

00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:17.479
But I don't think that explanation is good enough.

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.363
It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:24.013
Even when venture capitalists were at their most

00:05:24.013 --> 00:05:26.852
risk-happy, they preferred small investments,

00:05:26.852 --> 00:05:30.716
tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.

00:05:30.716 --> 00:05:33.035
V.C.s have always struggled

00:05:33.035 --> 00:05:36.110
to invest profitably in technologies such as energy

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.304
whose capital requirements are huge

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:41.012
and whose development is long and lengthy,

00:05:41.012 --> 00:05:44.169
and V.C.s have never, never funded the development

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.167
of technologies meant to solve big problems

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:49.861
that possess no immediate commercial value.

00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:52.073
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems

00:05:52.073 --> 00:05:56.155
are more complicated and more profound.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:59.142
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:01.560
We could go to Mars if we want.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.427
NASA even has the outline of a plan.

00:06:04.427 --> 00:06:07.916
But going to Mars would follow a political decision

00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:11.270
with popular appeal, and that will never happen.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.012
We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks

00:06:14.012 --> 00:06:15.961
there are more important things

00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:18.248
to do here on Earth.

00:06:18.248 --> 00:06:21.292
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems

00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:23.796
because our political systems fail.

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.894
Today, less than two percent

00:06:25.894 --> 00:06:27.581
of the world's energy consumption

00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:29.747
derives from advanced, renewable sources

00:06:29.747 --> 00:06:32.625
such as solar, wind and biofuels,

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.207
less than two percent,

00:06:34.207 --> 00:06:36.311
and the reason is purely economic.

00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:38.504
Coal and natural gas are cheaper

00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:40.249
than solar and wind,

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.768
and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:45.449
We want alternative energy sources

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.450
that can compete on price. None exist.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.155
Now, technologists, business leaders

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:53.651
and economists all basically agree

00:06:53.651 --> 00:06:57.152
on what national policies and international treaties

00:06:57.152 --> 00:07:00.436
would spur the development of alternative energy:

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:03.151
mostly, a significant increase in energy

00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:04.568
research and development,

00:07:04.568 --> 00:07:07.363
and some kind of price on carbon.

00:07:07.363 --> 00:07:10.567
But there's no hope in the present political climate

00:07:10.567 --> 00:07:12.960
that we will see U.S. energy policy

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.727
or international treaties that reflect that consensus.

00:07:17.727 --> 00:07:22.211
Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological

00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:24.110
turn out not to be so.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.328
Famines were long understood to be caused

00:07:27.328 --> 00:07:29.736
by failures in food supply.

00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:31.991
But 30 years of research have taught us

00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:34.659
that famines are political crises

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:38.173
that catastrophically affect food distribution.

00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:41.136
Technology can improve things like crop yields

00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:45.379
or systems for storing and transporting food,

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:50.624
but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.

00:07:50.624 --> 00:07:54.139
Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:57.605
because we don't really understand the problem.

00:07:57.605 --> 00:08:02.549
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:03.962
but we soon discovered

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:06.495
there are many kinds of cancer,

00:08:06.495 --> 00:08:10.061
most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,

00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:12.271
and it is only in the last 10 years

00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:14.818
that effective, viable therapies

00:08:14.818 --> 00:08:16.875
have come to seem real.

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:19.925
Hard problems are hard.

00:08:19.925 --> 00:08:24.407
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.

00:08:24.407 --> 00:08:28.123
We can, we must, but these four elements

00:08:28.123 --> 00:08:29.878
must all be present:

00:08:29.878 --> 00:08:31.822
Political leaders and the public

00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:33.564
must care to solve a problem;

00:08:33.564 --> 00:08:36.735
institutions must support its solution;

00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:39.810
It must really be a technological problem;

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.661
and we must understand it.

00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:45.108
The Apollo mission,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.845
which has become a kind of metaphor

00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:51.029
for technology's capacity to solve big problems,

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:53.240
met these criteria.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.667
But it is an irreproducible model for the future.

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:58.491
It is not 1961.

00:08:58.491 --> 00:09:02.582
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,

00:09:02.582 --> 00:09:04.941
no politician like John Kennedy

00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:08.132
who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,

00:09:08.132 --> 00:09:11.477
and no popular science fictional mythology

00:09:11.477 --> 00:09:14.583
such as exploring the solar system.

00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:16.985
Most of all, going to the moon

00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:18.847
turned out to be easy.

00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:20.895
It was just three days away.

00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:23.780
And arguably it wasn't even solving

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.384
much of a problem.

00:09:26.384 --> 00:09:30.464
We are left alone with our day,

00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:35.941
and the solutions of the future will be harder won.

00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:38.726
God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.

00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:39.880
Thank you very much.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.880
(Applause)
