00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.686
Here's a question we need to rethink together:

00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:08.127
What should be the role of money

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:11.613
and markets in our societies?

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:14.107
Today, there are very few things

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:16.795
that money can't buy.

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:18.452
If you're sentenced to a jail term

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.903
in Santa Barbara, California,

00:00:20.903 --> 00:00:22.255
you should know

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.970
that if you don't like the standard accommodations,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.313
you can buy a prison cell upgrade.

00:00:29.313 --> 00:00:32.159
It's true. For how much, do you think?

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.100
What would you guess?

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.805
Five hundred dollars?

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:39.140
It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.164
Eighty-two dollars a night.

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:43.536
Eighty-two dollars a night.

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:45.736
If you go to an amusement park

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:48.428
and don't want to stand in the long lines

00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:49.884
for the popular rides,

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:52.771
there is now a solution.

00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:57.035
In many theme parks, you can pay extra

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:58.649
to jump to the head of the line.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.164
They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.

00:01:03.164 --> 00:01:06.753
And this isn't only happening in amusement parks.

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:09.969
In Washington, D.C., long lines,

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.909
queues sometimes form

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.778
for important Congressional hearings.

00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:19.283
Now some people don't like to wait in long queues,

00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:21.788
maybe overnight, even in the rain.

00:01:21.788 --> 00:01:23.785
So now, for lobbyists and others

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:25.591
who are very keen to attend these hearings

00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:28.310
but don't like to wait, there are companies,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.353
line-standing companies,

00:01:30.353 --> 00:01:32.216
and you can go to them.

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:34.105
You can pay them a certain amount of money,

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:37.370
they hire homeless people and others who need a job

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.653
to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,

00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:43.521
and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:46.400
can take his or her place at the head of the line

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.145
and a seat in the front of the room.

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:52.224
Paid line standing.

00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:55.806
It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms

00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:58.480
and market thinking and market solutions,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.112
in bigger arenas.

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:03.783
Take the way we fight our wars.

00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:06.850
Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.895
there were more private military contractors on the ground

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:14.715
than there were U.S. military troops?

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:17.834
Now this isn't because we had a public debate

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:20.811
about whether we wanted to outsource war

00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:22.982
to private companies,

00:02:22.982 --> 00:02:25.689
but this is what has happened.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.117
Over the past three decades,

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:32.215
we have lived through a quiet revolution.

00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:37.182
We've drifted almost without realizing it

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:40.430
from having a market economy

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.397
to becoming market societies.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:47.982
The difference is this: A market economy is a tool,

00:02:47.982 --> 00:02:49.644
a valuable and effective tool,

00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:52.702
for organizing productive activity,

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:55.760
but a market society is a place where

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.608
almost everything is up for sale.

00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:02.060
It's a way of life, in which market thinking

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.781
and market values begin to dominate

00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:08.305
every aspect of life:

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:13.040
personal relations, family life, health, education,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.339
politics, law, civic life.

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:21.830
Now, why worry? Why worry about our becoming

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.376
market societies?

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:27.480
For two reasons, I think.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.161
One of them has to do with inequality.

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:35.494
The more things money can buy,

00:03:35.494 --> 00:03:39.788
the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:42.645
If the only thing that money determined

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:48.334
was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:52.686
then inequality wouldn't matter very much.

00:03:52.686 --> 00:03:56.113
But when money comes increasingly to govern

00:03:56.113 --> 00:04:00.950
access to the essentials of the good life --

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.876
decent health care, access to the best education,

00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:09.746
political voice and influence in campaigns --

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:13.326
when money comes to govern all of those things,

00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:15.876
inequality matters a great deal.

00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:18.131
And so the marketization of everything

00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.701
sharpens the sting of inequality

00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:23.885
and its social and civic consequence.

00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:26.871
That's one reason to worry.

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:29.108
There's a second reason

00:04:29.108 --> 00:04:33.007
apart from the worry about inequality,

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:35.326
and it's this:

00:04:35.326 --> 00:04:39.250
with some social goods and practices,

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.716
when market thinking and market values enter,

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:47.488
they may change the meaning of those practices

00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:50.837
and crowd out attitudes and norms

00:04:50.837 --> 00:04:52.786
worth caring about.

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:55.410
I'd like to take an example

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.136
of a controversial use of a market mechanism,

00:04:59.136 --> 00:05:03.881
a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.

00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:07.046
Many schools struggle with the challenge

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:09.585
of motivating kids, especially kids

00:05:09.585 --> 00:05:13.540
from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.579
to do well in school, to apply themselves.

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:20.067
Some economists have proposed a market solution:

00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:24.126
Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades

00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:26.500
or high test scores

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.451
or for reading books.

00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:30.233
They've tried this, actually.

00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:31.518
They've done some experiments

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:34.949
in some major American cities.

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.596
In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,

00:05:38.596 --> 00:05:42.307
they've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:44.499
35 dollars for a B.

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:47.673
In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers

00:05:47.673 --> 00:05:52.093
eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.

00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:55.012
So let's see what -- Some people are in favor,

00:05:55.012 --> 00:05:58.402
some people are opposed to this cash incentive

00:05:58.402 --> 00:06:00.100
to motivate achievement.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.737
Let's see what people here think about it.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:07.245
Imagine that you are the head of a major school system,

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:10.230
and someone comes to you with this proposal.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.867
And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:14.733
You don't have to take it out of your budget.

00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:16.015
How many would be in favor

00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:19.609
and how many would be opposed to giving it a try?

00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:21.205
Let's see by a show of hands.

00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:24.799
First, how many think it might at least be worth a try

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:28.695
to see if it would work? Raise your hand.

00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:31.426
And how many would be opposed? How many would --

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:34.240
So the majority here are opposed,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.222
but a sizable minority are in favor.

00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:38.791
Let's have a discussion.

00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:41.834
Let's start with those of you who object,

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:44.715
who would rule it out even before trying.

00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:46.336
What would be your reason?

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:50.208
Who will get our discussion started? Yes?

00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:52.106
Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike,

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:54.873
and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,

00:06:54.873 --> 00:07:00.021
so in the respect that children, if they would like to read,

00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:02.138
you just take this incentive away

00:07:02.138 --> 00:07:05.590
in just paying them, so it just changes behavior.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.008
Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away.

00:07:09.008 --> 00:07:13.243
What is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?

00:07:13.243 --> 00:07:14.933
HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:16.610
should be to learn.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.753
MS: To learn.
HM: To get to know the world.

00:07:19.753 --> 00:07:22.647
And then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?

00:07:22.647 --> 00:07:24.394
Then they stop reading?

00:07:24.394 --> 00:07:27.394
MS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors,

00:07:27.394 --> 00:07:29.742
who thinks it's worth trying this.

00:07:29.742 --> 00:07:31.714
Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus,

00:07:31.714 --> 00:07:35.844
and you said worth a try, so why not try it

00:07:35.844 --> 00:07:39.967
and do the experiment and measure things?

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:42.140
MS: And measure. And what would you measure?

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.861
You'd measure how many --

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:45.705
EL: How many books they read

00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:48.395
and how many books they continued to read

00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:50.110
after you stopped paying them.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.467
MS: Oh, after you stopped paying.

00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:53.821
All right, what about that?

00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:55.798
HM: To be frank, I just think

00:07:55.798 --> 00:08:00.431
this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.

00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:06.903
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.106
MS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion

00:08:09.106 --> 00:08:11.226
is the following question:

00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:15.477
Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt

00:08:15.477 --> 00:08:18.666
or crowd out the higher motivation,

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:23.460
the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey,

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.547
which is to learn to love to learn and to read

00:08:27.547 --> 00:08:29.550
for their own sakes?

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.647
And people disagree about what the effect will be,

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.304
but that seems to be the question,

00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:38.340
that somehow a market mechanism

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.201
or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson,

00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:46.808
and if it does, what will become of these children later?

00:08:46.808 --> 00:08:50.181
I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.

00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:54.699
The cash for good grades has had very mixed results,

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:57.846
for the most part has not resulted in higher grades.

00:08:57.846 --> 00:09:00.217
The two dollars for each book

00:09:00.217 --> 00:09:03.518
did lead those kids to read more books.

00:09:03.518 --> 00:09:06.162
It also led them to read shorter books.

00:09:06.162 --> 00:09:10.340
(Laughter)

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.990
But the real question is,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.562
what will become of these kids later?

00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:16.676
Will they have learned that reading is a chore,

00:09:16.676 --> 00:09:19.648
a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry,

00:09:19.648 --> 00:09:24.265
or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially

00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:29.011
but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?

00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:33.832
Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings out

00:09:33.832 --> 00:09:37.650
is something that many economists overlook.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.746
Economists often assume

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.370
that markets are inert,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.736
that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.

00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:49.840
Market exchange, they assume,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.300
doesn't change the meaning or value

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.583
of the goods being exchanged.

00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:55.159
This may be true enough

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:57.576
if we're talking about material goods.

00:09:57.576 --> 00:10:00.082
If you sell me a flat screen television

00:10:00.082 --> 00:10:02.260
or give me one as a gift,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.620
it will be the same good.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.106
It will work the same either way.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.882
But the same may not be true

00:10:08.882 --> 00:10:11.214
if we're talking about nonmaterial goods

00:10:11.214 --> 00:10:15.164
and social practices such as teaching and learning

00:10:15.164 --> 00:10:18.896
or engaging together in civic life.

00:10:18.896 --> 00:10:22.317
In those domains, bringing market mechanisms

00:10:22.317 --> 00:10:26.235
and cash incentives may undermine

00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:30.555
or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes

00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:32.914
worth caring about.

00:10:32.914 --> 00:10:35.138
Once we see

00:10:35.138 --> 00:10:38.849
that markets and commerce,

00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:42.510
when extended beyond the material domain,

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.960
can change the character of the goods themselves,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.521
can change the meaning of the social practices,

00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:53.985
as in the example of teaching and learning,

00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:58.631
we have to ask where markets belong

00:10:58.631 --> 00:11:00.562
and where they don't,

00:11:00.562 --> 00:11:02.935
where they may actually undermine

00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:05.938
values and attitudes worth caring about.

00:11:05.938 --> 00:11:09.200
But to have this debate,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.698
we have to do something we're not very good at,

00:11:12.698 --> 00:11:16.180
and that is to reason together in public

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.420
about the value and the meaning

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.424
of the social practices we prize,

00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:25.929
from our bodies to family life

00:11:25.929 --> 00:11:27.882
to personal relations to health

00:11:27.882 --> 00:11:31.595
to teaching and learning to civic life.

00:11:31.595 --> 00:11:34.579
Now these are controversial questions,

00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:37.339
and so we tend to shrink from them.

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:40.259
In fact, during the past three decades,

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:42.756
when market reasoning and market thinking

00:11:42.756 --> 00:11:46.244
have gathered force and gained prestige,

00:11:46.244 --> 00:11:49.726
our public discourse during this time

00:11:49.726 --> 00:11:51.961
has become hollowed out,

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:55.667
empty of larger moral meaning.

00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:58.879
For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:02.406
But once we see that markets

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:04.579
change the character of goods,

00:12:04.579 --> 00:12:09.146
we have to debate among ourselves

00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:11.483
these bigger questions

00:12:11.483 --> 00:12:13.443
about how to value goods.

00:12:13.443 --> 00:12:16.438
One of the most corrosive effects

00:12:16.438 --> 00:12:19.225
of putting a price on everything

00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:21.594
is on commonality,

00:12:21.594 --> 00:12:24.772
the sense that we are all in it together.

00:12:24.772 --> 00:12:29.495
Against the background of rising inequality,

00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:33.362
marketizing every aspect of life

00:12:33.362 --> 00:12:38.913
leads to a condition where those who are affluent

00:12:38.913 --> 00:12:40.763
and those who are of modest means

00:12:40.763 --> 00:12:45.145
increasingly live separate lives.

00:12:45.145 --> 00:12:48.364
We live and work and shop and play

00:12:48.364 --> 00:12:50.095
in different places.

00:12:50.095 --> 00:12:53.211
Our children go to different schools.

00:12:53.211 --> 00:12:55.760
This isn't good for democracy,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.683
nor is it a satisfying way to live,

00:12:58.683 --> 00:13:01.963
even for those of us who can afford

00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:04.718
to buy our way to the head of the line.

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:06.491
Here's why.

00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:11.420
Democracy does not require perfect equality,

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.183
but what it does require

00:13:13.183 --> 00:13:16.811
is that citizens share in a common life.

00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:19.440
What matters is that people

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.209
of different social backgrounds

00:13:21.209 --> 00:13:22.933
and different walks of life

00:13:22.933 --> 00:13:25.217
encounter one another,

00:13:25.217 --> 00:13:27.240
bump up against one another

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.730
in the ordinary course of life,

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.454
because this is what teaches us

00:13:33.454 --> 00:13:37.126
to negotiate and to abide our differences.

00:13:37.126 --> 00:13:41.340
And this is how we come to care for the common good.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.690
And so, in the end, the question of markets

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.830
is not mainly an economic question.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.918
It's really a question of how we want to live together.

00:13:52.918 --> 00:13:57.458
Do we want a society where everything is up for sale,

00:13:57.458 --> 00:14:00.970
or are there certain moral and civic goods

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.899
that markets do not honor

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:05.693
and money cannot buy?

00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:07.155
Thank you very much.

00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:12.340
(Applause)
