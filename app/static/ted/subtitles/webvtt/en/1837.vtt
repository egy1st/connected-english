00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:02.085
I think we're all aware

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:05.058
that the world today is full of problems.

00:00:05.058 --> 00:00:07.153
We've been hearing them

00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:11.443
today and yesterday and every day for decades.

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:15.487
Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems.

00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:18.843
Poor nutrition, access to water,

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:21.880
climate change, deforestation,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.124
lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:28.100
not enough healthcare, pollution.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.845
There's problem after problem,

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:32.376
and I think what really separates this time

00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:36.500
from any time I can remember in my brief time

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.935
on Earth is the awareness of these problems.

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:41.501
We're all very aware.

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:43.529
Why are we having so much trouble

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.360
dealing with these problems?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.400
That's the question I've been struggling with,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.569
coming from my very different perspective.

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.652
I'm not a social problem guy.

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:58.414
I'm a guy that works with business,

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:01.704
helps business make money.

00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:04.938
God forbid.

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:07.992
So why are we having so many problems

00:01:07.992 --> 00:01:11.135
with these social problems,

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:13.192
and really is there any role for business,

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:16.725
and if so, what is that role?

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:19.584
I think that in order to address that question,

00:01:19.584 --> 00:01:23.450
we have to step back and think about

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.105
how we've understood and pondered

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:29.103
both the problems and the solutions

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:33.267
to these great social challenges that we face.

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:36.101
Now, I think many have seen business

00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:38.976
as the problem, or at least one of the problems,

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:41.728
in many of the social challenges we face.

00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:43.134
You know, think of the fast food industry,

00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:45.109
the drug industry, the banking industry.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.288
You know, this is a low point

00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:50.279
in the respect for business.

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:51.989
Business is not seen as the solution.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.730
It's seen as the problem now, for most people.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.704
And rightly so, in many cases.

00:01:57.704 --> 00:01:59.983
There's a lot of bad actors out there

00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:02.160
that have done the wrong thing,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.961
that actually have made the problem worse.

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.424
So this perspective is perhaps justified.

00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:10.014
How have we tended to see the solutions

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:12.350
to these social problems,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.512
these many issues that we face in society?

00:02:15.512 --> 00:02:17.144
Well, we've tended to see the solutions

00:02:17.144 --> 00:02:19.296
in terms of NGOs,

00:02:19.296 --> 00:02:21.302
in terms of government,

00:02:21.302 --> 00:02:23.439
in terms of philanthropy.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.873
Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entity

00:02:25.873 --> 00:02:30.630
of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.136
and social organizations.

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:35.960
This is a unique, new organizational form

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.153
that we've seen grown up.

00:02:37.153 --> 00:02:40.560
Enormous innovation, enormous energy,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.295
enormous talent now has been mobilized

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:45.415
through this structure

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:50.268
to try to deal with all of these challenges.

00:02:50.268 --> 00:02:54.525
And many of us here are deeply involved in that.

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:56.034
I'm a business school professor,

00:02:56.034 --> 00:03:00.049
but I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.938
Whenever I got interested and became aware

00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:05.998
of a societal problem, that was what I did,

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:07.876
form a nonprofit.

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:10.939
That was the way we've thought about how to deal

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:11.948
with these issues.

00:03:11.948 --> 00:03:16.400
Even a business school professor has thought about it that way.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.235
But I think at this moment,

00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:21.004
we've been at this for quite a while.

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:23.856
We've been aware of these problems for decades.

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:25.766
We have decades of experience

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:30.091
with our NGOs and with our government entities,

00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:31.920
and there's an awkward reality.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.862
The awkward reality is we're not making

00:03:33.862 --> 00:03:36.446
fast enough progress.

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:39.170
We're not winning.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.254
These problems still seem very daunting

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.460
and very intractable,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.160
and any solutions we're achieving

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.100
are small solutions.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.982
We're making incremental progress.

00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:53.704
What's the fundamental problem we have

00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:56.782
in dealing with these social problems?

00:03:56.782 --> 00:04:00.814
If we cut all the complexity away,

00:04:00.814 --> 00:04:04.193
we have the problem of scale.

00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:07.304
We can't scale.

00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:10.231
We can make progress. We can show benefits.

00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:13.559
We can show results. We can make things better.

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:17.837
We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good.

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:20.191
We can't scale.

00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:25.157
We can't make a large-scale impact on these problems.

00:04:25.157 --> 00:04:26.991
Why is that?

00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:30.581
Because we don't have the resources.

00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:32.292
And that's really clear now.

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:35.174
And that's clearer now than it's been for decades.

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:38.726
There's simply not enough money

00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:42.117
to deal with any of these problems at scale

00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:44.442
using the current model.

00:04:44.442 --> 00:04:47.512
There's not enough tax revenue,

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:51.558
there's not enough philanthropic donations,

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:54.006
to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now.

00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:59.171
We've got to confront that reality.

00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:02.230
And the scarcity of resources

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.257
for dealing with these problems is only growing,

00:05:06.257 --> 00:05:09.807
certainly in the advanced world today,

00:05:09.807 --> 00:05:14.186
with all the fiscal problems we face.

00:05:14.186 --> 00:05:18.431
So if it's fundamentally a resource problem,

00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:22.476
where are the resources in society?

00:05:22.476 --> 00:05:24.861
How are those resources really created,

00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:26.568
the resources we're going to need to deal

00:05:26.568 --> 00:05:30.208
with all these societal challenges?

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:33.324
Well there, I think the answer is very clear:

00:05:33.324 --> 00:05:37.010
They're in business.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.621
All wealth is actually created by business.

00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:45.347
Business creates wealth

00:05:45.347 --> 00:05:50.393
when it meets needs at a profit.

00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:52.857
That's how all wealth is created.

00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:55.230
It's meeting needs at a profit

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.642
that leads to taxes

00:05:57.642 --> 00:05:59.311
and that leads to incomes

00:05:59.311 --> 00:06:01.578
and that leads to charitable donations.

00:06:01.578 --> 00:06:04.829
That's where all the resources come from.

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:07.287
Only business can actually create resources.

00:06:07.287 --> 00:06:09.241
Other institutions can utilize them

00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:10.466
to do important work,

00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:13.650
but only business can create them.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.171
And business creates them

00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:23.049
when it's able to meet a need at a profit.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.433
The resources are overwhelmingly

00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:28.322
generated by business.

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:33.625
The question then is, how do we tap into this?

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:36.000
How do we tap into this?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.947
Business generates those resources

00:06:38.947 --> 00:06:43.616
when it makes a profit.

00:06:43.616 --> 00:06:46.990
That profit is that small difference

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.836
between the price and the cost it takes to produce

00:06:51.836 --> 00:06:54.153
whatever solution business has created

00:06:54.153 --> 00:06:57.376
to whatever problem they're trying to solve.

00:06:57.376 --> 00:07:04.136
But that profit is the magic.

00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:08.890
Why? Because that profit allows whatever solution

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.109
we've created

00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:15.299
to be infinitely scalable.

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:17.900
Because if we can make a profit,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.424
we can do it for 10, 100, a million,

00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:24.716
100 million, a billion.

00:07:24.716 --> 00:07:29.436
The solution becomes self-sustaining.

00:07:29.436 --> 00:07:32.035
That's what business does

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:35.645
when it makes a profit.

00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:38.029
Now what does this all have to do

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:41.097
with social problems?

00:07:41.097 --> 00:07:44.379
Well, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:49.928
and redeploy it into social problems.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.194
Business should give more.

00:07:51.194 --> 00:07:52.618
Business should be more responsible.

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:55.068
And that's been the path that we've been on

00:07:55.068 --> 00:07:57.754
in business.

00:07:57.754 --> 00:07:59.618
But again, this path that we've been on

00:07:59.618 --> 00:08:03.958
is not getting us where we need to go.

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.106
Now, I started out as a strategy professor,

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.612
and I'm still a strategy professor.

00:08:08.612 --> 00:08:09.971
I'm proud of that.

00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:11.497
But I've also, over the years,

00:08:11.497 --> 00:08:14.153
worked more and more on social issues.

00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:17.420
I've worked on healthcare, the environment,

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.992
economic development, reducing poverty,

00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:25.337
and as I worked more and more in the social field,

00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:26.899
I started seeing something

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:30.169
that had a profound impact on me

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:33.755
and my whole life, in a way.

00:08:33.755 --> 00:08:37.544
The conventional wisdom in economics

00:08:37.544 --> 00:08:41.412
and the view in business has historically been

00:08:41.412 --> 00:08:45.369
that actually, there's a tradeoff

00:08:45.369 --> 00:08:50.377
between social performance and economic performance.

00:08:50.377 --> 00:08:51.861
The conventional wisdom has been

00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:54.931
that business actually makes a profit

00:08:54.931 --> 00:08:56.724
by causing a social problem.

00:08:56.724 --> 00:08:58.906
The classic example is pollution.

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:01.682
If business pollutes, it makes more money

00:09:01.682 --> 00:09:06.323
than if it tried to reduce that pollution.

00:09:06.323 --> 00:09:08.214
Reducing pollution is expensive,

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:13.697
therefore businesses don't want to do it.

00:09:13.697 --> 00:09:16.642
It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment.

00:09:16.642 --> 00:09:19.380
It's too expensive to have a safe working environment,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.686
therefore business makes more money

00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:22.526
if they don't have a safe working environment.

00:09:22.526 --> 00:09:26.023
That's been the conventional wisdom.

00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:28.836
A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.379
They resisted environmental improvement.

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:36.813
They resisted workplace improvement.

00:09:36.813 --> 00:09:40.359
That thinking has led to, I think,

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:41.879
much of the behavior

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:43.815
that we have come to criticize in business,

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:46.335
that I come to criticize in business.

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:49.868
But the more deeply I got into all these social issues,

00:09:49.868 --> 00:09:52.880
one after another,

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.326
and actually, the more I tried to address them

00:09:55.326 --> 00:09:57.442
myself, personally, in a few cases,

00:09:57.442 --> 00:10:00.171
through nonprofits that I was involved with,

00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:03.109
the more I found actually that the reality

00:10:03.109 --> 00:10:05.643
is the opposite.

00:10:05.643 --> 00:10:06.889
Business does not profit

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:08.591
from causing social problems,

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:12.965
actually not in any fundamental sense.

00:10:12.965 --> 00:10:15.158
That's a very simplistic view.

00:10:15.158 --> 00:10:17.866
The deeper we get into these issues,

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:19.711
the more we start to understand

00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:21.612
that actually business profits

00:10:21.612 --> 00:10:23.608
from solving from social problems.

00:10:23.608 --> 00:10:26.152
That's where the real profit comes.

00:10:26.152 --> 00:10:28.993
Let's take pollution.

00:10:28.993 --> 00:10:31.209
We've learned today that actually

00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:33.616
reducing pollution and emissions

00:10:33.616 --> 00:10:37.122
is generating profit.

00:10:37.122 --> 00:10:39.190
It saves money.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.888
It makes the business more productive and efficient.

00:10:40.888 --> 00:10:42.285
It doesn't waste resources.

00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:44.928
Having a safer working environment actually,

00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:46.416
and avoiding accidents,

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:47.788
it makes the business more profitable,

00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:50.996
because it's a sign of good processes.

00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:55.027
Accidents are expensive and costly.

00:10:55.027 --> 00:10:57.631
Issue by issue by issue, we start to learn

00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:00.597
that actually there's no trade-off

00:11:00.597 --> 00:11:04.193
between social progress

00:11:04.193 --> 00:11:07.194
and economic efficiency

00:11:07.194 --> 00:11:09.287
in any fundamental sense.

00:11:09.287 --> 00:11:10.646
Another issue is health.

00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:13.215
I mean, what we've found is actually

00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:15.097
health of employees is something

00:11:15.097 --> 00:11:16.490
that business should treasure,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.818
because that health allows those employees

00:11:18.818 --> 00:11:20.227
to be more productive and come to work

00:11:20.227 --> 00:11:22.543
and not be absent.

00:11:22.543 --> 00:11:25.967
The deeper work, the new work, the new thinking

00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:30.151
on the interface between business and social problems

00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:33.069
is actually showing that there's a fundamental,

00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:34.988
deep synergy,

00:11:34.988 --> 00:11:38.916
particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run.

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:40.754
In the very short run, you can sometimes

00:11:40.754 --> 00:11:42.855
fool yourself into thinking

00:11:42.855 --> 00:11:45.150
that there's fundamentally opposing goals,

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.963
but in the long run, ultimately, we're learning

00:11:47.963 --> 00:11:52.159
in field after field that this is simply not true.

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:55.449
So how could we tap into

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:58.171
the power of business

00:11:58.171 --> 00:12:00.374
to address the fundamental problems

00:12:00.374 --> 00:12:02.807
that we face?

00:12:02.807 --> 00:12:05.407
Imagine if we could do that, because if we could do it,

00:12:05.407 --> 00:12:07.447
we could scale.

00:12:07.447 --> 00:12:09.856
We could tap into this enormous resource pool

00:12:09.856 --> 00:12:12.754
and this organizational capacity.

00:12:12.754 --> 00:12:18.244
And guess what? That's happening now, finally,

00:12:18.244 --> 00:12:22.257
partly because of people like you

00:12:22.257 --> 00:12:24.205
who have raised these issues now

00:12:24.205 --> 00:12:27.320
for year after year and decade after decade.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.728
We see organizations like Dow Chemical

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:31.646
leading the revolution away from trans fat

00:12:31.646 --> 00:12:34.778
and saturated fat with innovative new products.

00:12:34.778 --> 00:12:36.731
This is an example of Jain Irrigation.

00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:39.282
This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology

00:12:39.282 --> 00:12:41.951
to thousands and millions of farmers,

00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:45.002
reducing substantially the use of water.

00:12:45.002 --> 00:12:48.323
We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria

00:12:48.323 --> 00:12:49.806
that's figured out how to avoid

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:51.685
tearing down old growth forest

00:12:51.685 --> 00:12:54.461
and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield

00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:56.451
per hectare of pulp

00:12:56.451 --> 00:12:58.419
and making much more paper than you could make

00:12:58.419 --> 00:13:00.528
by cutting down those old trees.

00:13:00.528 --> 00:13:03.408
You see companies like Cisco that are training

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:07.564
so far four million people in I.T. skills

00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:09.507
to actually, yes, be responsible,

00:13:09.507 --> 00:13:11.938
but help expand the opportunity

00:13:11.938 --> 00:13:14.211
to disseminate I.T. technology

00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:15.513
and grow the whole business.

00:13:15.513 --> 00:13:20.134
There's a fundamental opportunity for business today

00:13:20.134 --> 00:13:24.190
to impact and address these social problems,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.514
and this opportunity

00:13:25.514 --> 00:13:28.782
is the largest business opportunity

00:13:28.782 --> 00:13:32.448
we see in business.

00:13:32.448 --> 00:13:34.654
And the question is, how can we get business

00:13:34.654 --> 00:13:38.082
thinking to adapt this issue of shared value?

00:13:38.082 --> 00:13:39.891
This is what I call shared value:

00:13:39.891 --> 00:13:43.646
addressing a social issue with a business model.

00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:45.570
That's shared value.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.399
Shared value is capitalism,

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:49.961
but it's a higher kind of capitalism.

00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:53.321
It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,

00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:56.734
meeting important needs,

00:13:56.734 --> 00:13:59.557
not incrementally competing for

00:13:59.557 --> 00:14:02.820
trivial differences in product attributes

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.553
and market share.

00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:06.772
Shared value is when we can create social value

00:14:06.772 --> 00:14:09.375
and economic value simultaneously.

00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:11.885
It's finding those opportunities

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:14.950
that will unleash the greatest possibility we have

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.941
to actually address these social problems

00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:18.974
because we can scale.

00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:22.530
We can address shared value at multiple levels.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.695
It's real. It's happening.

00:14:25.695 --> 00:14:28.588
But in order to get this solution working,

00:14:28.588 --> 00:14:32.716
we have to now change how business sees itself,

00:14:32.716 --> 00:14:35.230
and this is thankfully underway.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.706
Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom

00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:40.554
that they shouldn't worry about social problems,

00:14:40.554 --> 00:14:42.596
that this was sort of something on the side,

00:14:42.596 --> 00:14:45.177
that somebody else was doing it.

00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:46.753
We're now seeing companies

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:49.229
embrace this idea.

00:14:49.229 --> 00:14:51.418
But we also have to recognize business

00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:54.162
is not going to do this as effectively

00:14:54.162 --> 00:14:56.022
as if we have NGOs and government

00:14:56.022 --> 00:14:59.053
working in partnership with business.

00:14:59.053 --> 00:15:02.061
The new NGOs that are really moving the needle

00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:04.244
are the ones that have found these partnerships,

00:15:04.244 --> 00:15:06.061
that have found these ways to collaborate.

00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:08.534
The governments that are making the most progress

00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:10.148
are the governments that have found ways

00:15:10.148 --> 00:15:13.799
to enable shared value in business

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:16.920
rather than see government as the only player

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.934
that has to call the shots.

00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:22.406
And government has many ways in which it could impact

00:15:22.406 --> 00:15:24.720
the willingness and the ability of companies

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.714
to compete in this way.

00:15:26.714 --> 00:15:29.663
I think if we can get business seeing itself differently,

00:15:29.663 --> 00:15:32.206
and if we can get others seeing business differently,

00:15:32.206 --> 00:15:35.011
we can change the world.

00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:38.216
I know it. I'm seeing it.

00:15:38.216 --> 00:15:40.166
I'm feeling it.

00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:41.861
Young people, I think,

00:15:41.861 --> 00:15:45.041
my Harvard Business School students, are getting it.

00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:49.363
If we can break down this sort of divide,

00:15:49.363 --> 00:15:52.373
this unease, this tension,

00:15:52.373 --> 00:15:54.303
this sense that we're not

00:15:54.303 --> 00:15:56.543
fundamentally collaborating here

00:15:56.543 --> 00:15:58.893
in driving these social problems,

00:15:58.893 --> 00:16:00.997
we can break this down,

00:16:00.997 --> 00:16:02.997
and we finally, I think,

00:16:02.997 --> 00:16:05.629
can have solutions.

00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:08.429
Thank you.

00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:11.151
(Applause)
