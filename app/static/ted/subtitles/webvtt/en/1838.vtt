00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:03.096
The work of a transportation commissioner

00:00:03.096 --> 00:00:06.590
isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.764
It involves the design of cities

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:11.160
and the design of city streets.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.131
Streets are some of the most valuable resources

00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.909
that a city has, and yet it's an asset

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.765
that's largely hidden in plain sight.

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:21.346
And the lesson from New York

00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:23.004
over the past six years

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.300
is that you can update this asset.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.998
You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively,

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:31.736
it can provide immediate benefits,

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:34.337
and it can be quite popular.

00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:37.829
You just need to look at them a little differently.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.577
This is important because we live in an urban age.

00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:43.656
For the first time in history,

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.421
most people live in cities,

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.984
and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years,

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:52.885
the population is going to double on the planet.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:57.328
So the design of cities is a key issue for our future.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:00:58.913
Mayor Bloomberg recognized this

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:02.152
when he launched PlaNYC in 2007.

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:04.865
The plan recognized that cities

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.987
are in a global marketplace,

00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:09.712
and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:13.015
and to attract the million more people

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:14.615
that are expected to move here,

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:17.866
we need to focus on the quality of life

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:21.534
and the efficiency of our infrastructure.

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:23.177
For many cities, our streets have been

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:27.286
in a kind of suspended animation for generations.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:30.862
This is a picture of Times Square in the '50s,

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:34.841
and despite all of the technological innovation,

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:37.290
cultural changes, political changes,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.545
this is Times Square in 2008.

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:43.918
Not much has changed in those 50 years.

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:46.981
So we worked hard to refocus our agenda,

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.596
to maximize efficient mobility,

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:53.177
providing more room for buses, more room for bikes,

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:56.236
more room for people to enjoy the city,

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:58.471
and to make our streets as safe as they can be

00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.579
for everybody that uses them.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.067
We set out a clear action plan

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:06.763
with goals and benchmarks.

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:08.981
Having goals is important,

00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:13.102
because if you want to change and steer the ship

00:02:13.102 --> 00:02:15.725
of a big city in a new direction,

00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:19.921
you need to know where you're going and why.

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.174
The design of a street can tell you everything

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:24.523
about what's expected on it.

00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:28.524
In this case, it's expected that you shelter in place.

00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.461
The design of this street is really

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:33.121
to maximize the movement of cars

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:34.849
moving as quickly as possible

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.672
from point A to point B,

00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:38.564
and it misses all the other ways

00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:40.991
that a street is used.

00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:43.942
When we started out, we did some early surveys

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:45.987
about how our streets were used,

00:02:45.987 --> 00:02:47.983
and we found that New York City was largely

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:50.114
a city without seats.

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:52.498
Pictures like this, people perched

00:02:52.498 --> 00:02:56.671
on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city.

00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.959
(Laughter)

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.435
It's not great for parents with kids.

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:04.671
It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers.

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:07.712
It's probably not good for the fire hydrants.

00:03:07.712 --> 00:03:10.764
Certainly not good for the police department.

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:13.773
So we worked hard to change that balance,

00:03:13.773 --> 00:03:17.108
and probably the best example of our new approach

00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:18.743
is in Times Square.

00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:22.573
Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day

00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:24.283
walk through Times Square,

00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:26.773
and people had tried for years to make changes.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.161
They changed signals, they changed lanes,

00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:32.064
everything they could do to make Times Square work better.

00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:34.986
It was dangerous, hard to cross the street.

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:36.707
It was chaotic.

00:03:36.707 --> 00:03:39.489
And so, none of those approaches worked,

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.538
so we took a different approach, a bigger approach,

00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:43.207
looked at our street differently.

00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:46.780
And so we did a six-month pilot.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.036
We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street

00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:53.570
and created two and a half acres

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.346
of new pedestrian space.

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:59.513
And the temporary materials are an important part

00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:02.938
of the program, because we were able to show

00:04:02.938 --> 00:04:04.307
how it worked.

00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:07.286
And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.

00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:09.122
So it was all about the data.

00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:12.295
So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility,

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:14.648
if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it,

00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:17.379
and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul,

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.269
we could put it back the way that it was,

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.530
because these were temporary materials.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.439
And that was a very big part of the buy-in,

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.582
much less anxiety when you think that something

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:27.453
can be put back.

00:04:27.453 --> 00:04:29.607
But the results were overwhelming.

00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:32.527
Traffic moved better. It was much safer.

00:04:32.527 --> 00:04:34.934
Five new flagship stores opened.

00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:36.807
It's been a total home run.

00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:39.390
Times Square is now one of the top 10

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.021
retail locations on the planet.

00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:44.455
And this is an important lesson,

00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:47.553
because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:52.078
between moving traffic and creating public space.

00:04:52.078 --> 00:04:54.893
Every project has its surprises,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:57.546
and one of the big surprises with Times Square

00:04:57.546 --> 00:05:01.226
was how quickly people flocked to the space.

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:03.284
We put out the orange barrels,

00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:06.892
and people just materialized immediately into the street.

00:05:06.892 --> 00:05:08.933
It was like a Star Trek episode, you know?

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:11.262
They weren't there before, and then zzzzzt!

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:12.640
All the people arrived.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.398
Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.542
And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us,

00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:22.058
because the street furniture had not yet arrived.

00:05:22.058 --> 00:05:24.680
So we went to a hardware store

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.027
and bought hundreds of lawn chairs,

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:30.219
and we put those lawn chairs out on the street.

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.115
And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town.

00:05:34.115 --> 00:05:36.999
It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars.

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.358
It was about those lawn chairs.

00:05:38.358 --> 00:05:39.874
"What did you think about the lawn chairs?"

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.566
"Do you like the color of the lawn chairs?"

00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:45.332
So if you've got a big, controversial project,

00:05:45.332 --> 00:05:47.043
think about lawn chairs.

00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:49.953
(Laughter)

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:52.450
This is the final design for Times Square,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.990
and it will create a level surface,

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.674
sidewalk to sidewalk,

00:05:56.674 --> 00:05:58.902
beautiful pavers that have studs in them

00:05:58.902 --> 00:06:00.940
to reflect the light from the billboards,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.653
creating a great new energy on the street,

00:06:03.653 --> 00:06:05.770
and we think it's going to really create

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.928
a great place, a new crossroads of the world

00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:09.451
that is worthy of its name.

00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:10.952
And we will be cutting the ribbon on this,

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:14.554
the first phase, this December.

00:06:14.554 --> 00:06:17.011
With all of our projects, our public space projects,

00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:19.224
we work closely with local businesses

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:20.755
and local merchant groups

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:24.071
who maintain the spaces, move the furniture,

00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:25.492
take care of the plants.

00:06:25.492 --> 00:06:27.511
This is in front of Macy's, and they were

00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:29.625
a big supporter of this new approach,

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:34.472
because they understood that more people on foot

00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:36.453
is better for business.

00:06:36.453 --> 00:06:39.123
And we've done these projects all across the city

00:06:39.123 --> 00:06:40.735
in all kinds of neighborhoods.

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:42.861
This is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.953
and you can see the short leg that was there,

00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:47.203
used for cars, that's not really needed.

00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:50.792
So what we did is we painted over the street,

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:54.123
put down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle

00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:56.118
to the storefronts on Grand Avenue,

00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:58.116
created a great new public space,

00:06:58.116 --> 00:07:00.130
and it's been great for businesses

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.713
along Grand Avenue.

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.869
We did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn,

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:07.297
and this is one of our first projects that we did,

00:07:07.297 --> 00:07:09.892
and we took an underutilized,

00:07:09.892 --> 00:07:12.573
pretty dingy-looking parking lot

00:07:12.573 --> 00:07:15.825
and used some paint and planters

00:07:15.825 --> 00:07:18.711
to transform it over a weekend.

00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.669
And in the three years since we've implemented the project,

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.423
retail sales have increased 172 percent.

00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:31.295
And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood.

00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.444
We've moved very, very quickly

00:07:33.444 --> 00:07:35.693
with paint and temporary materials.

00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:36.950
Instead of waiting

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.773
through years of planning studies

00:07:39.773 --> 00:07:42.151
and computer models to get something done,

00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:44.886
we've done it with paint and temporary materials.

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:47.236
And the proof is not in a computer model.

00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:50.201
It is in the real-world performance of the street.

00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:53.197
You can have fun with paint.

00:07:53.197 --> 00:07:57.430
All told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.205
in all five boroughs across the city.

00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:05.011
We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes

00:08:05.011 --> 00:08:09.007
and turned them into new pedestrian space.

00:08:09.007 --> 00:08:12.448
I think one of the successes is in its emulation.

00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:13.989
You're seeing this kind of approach,

00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:15.544
since we've painted Times Square,

00:08:15.544 --> 00:08:18.574
you've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago,

00:08:18.574 --> 00:08:21.073
in San Francisco, in Mexico City,

00:08:21.073 --> 00:08:22.636
Buenos Aires, you name it.

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:24.985
This is actually in Los Angeles,

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:28.608
and they actually copied even the green dots

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.633
that we had on the streets.

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:32.743
But I can't underscore enough

00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:35.320
how much more quickly this enables you to move

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.442
over traditional construction methods.

00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:40.602
We also brought this quick-acting approach

00:08:40.602 --> 00:08:42.150
to our cycling program,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.666
and in six years turned cycling

00:08:44.666 --> 00:08:47.905
into a real transportation option in New York.

00:08:47.905 --> 00:08:49.602
I think it's fair to say --

00:08:49.602 --> 00:08:54.841
(Applause) --

00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:58.305
it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike,

00:08:58.305 --> 00:08:59.863
and now New York has become

00:08:59.863 --> 00:09:03.908
one of the cycling capitals in the United States.

00:09:03.908 --> 00:09:07.904
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected

00:09:07.904 --> 00:09:10.339
network of lanes.

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:12.700
You can see the map in 2007.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.894
This is how it looked in 2013

00:09:14.894 --> 00:09:19.490
after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.507
I love this because it looks so easy.

00:09:21.507 --> 00:09:25.406
You just click it, and they're there.

00:09:25.406 --> 00:09:28.417
We also brought new designs to the street.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:31.754
We created the first parking-protected bike lane

00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:33.326
in the United States.

00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:34.853
(Applause)

00:09:34.853 --> 00:09:38.124
We protected bikers by floating parking lanes,

00:09:38.124 --> 00:09:39.637
and it's been great.

00:09:39.637 --> 00:09:41.364
Bike volumes have spiked.

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:43.998
Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers,

00:09:43.998 --> 00:09:45.789
are all down 50 percent.

00:09:45.789 --> 00:09:49.052
And we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes,

00:09:49.052 --> 00:09:50.591
and now you're seeing them pop up

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.460
all over the country.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.317
And you can see here that this strategy has worked.

00:09:55.317 --> 00:09:56.969
The blue line is the number of cyclists,

00:09:56.969 --> 00:09:57.973
soaring.

00:09:57.973 --> 00:09:59.916
The green line is the number of bike lanes.

00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:02.412
And the yellow line is the number of injuries,

00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:04.897
which has remained essentially flat.

00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:07.765
After this big expansion, you've seen

00:10:07.765 --> 00:10:09.615
no net increase in injuries,

00:10:09.615 --> 00:10:12.271
and so there is something to that axiom

00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.518
that there is safety in numbers.

00:10:15.518 --> 00:10:18.650
Not everybody liked the new bike lanes,

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.922
and there was a lawsuit and somewhat

00:10:20.922 --> 00:10:23.894
of a media frenzy a couple years ago.

00:10:23.894 --> 00:10:26.141
One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:28.595
that we have on Prospect Park West

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:30.483
"the most contested piece of land

00:10:30.483 --> 00:10:32.455
outside of the Gaza Strip."

00:10:32.455 --> 00:10:35.834
(Laughter)

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.754
And this is what we had done.

00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:42.760
So if you dig below the headlines, though,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.653
you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press,

00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:47.901
far ahead of the politicians.

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:50.089
In fact, I think most politicians would be happy

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:52.240
to have those kind of poll numbers.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.318
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes.

00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:57.297
This summer, we launched Citi Bike,

00:10:57.297 --> 00:10:59.880
the largest bike share program in the United States,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.764
with 6,000 bikes

00:11:01.764 --> 00:11:05.326
and 330 stations located next to one another.

00:11:05.326 --> 00:11:07.334
Since we've launched the program,

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.002
three million trips have been taken.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.771
People have ridden seven million miles.

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:14.633
That's 280 times around the globe.

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.704
And so with this little blue key,

00:11:16.704 --> 00:11:19.337
you can unlock the keys to the city

00:11:19.337 --> 00:11:21.893
and this brand new transportation option.

00:11:21.893 --> 00:11:24.252
And daily usage just continues to soar.

00:11:24.252 --> 00:11:26.997
What has happened is the average daily ridership

00:11:26.997 --> 00:11:29.703
on the streets of New York is 36,000 people.

00:11:29.703 --> 00:11:32.735
The high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August.

00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:36.624
Yesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City.

00:11:36.624 --> 00:11:38.586
The bikes are being used six times a day.

00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:41.367
And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.722
that are on the streets.

00:11:42.722 --> 00:11:45.096
In the past, it looked like the guy on the left,

00:11:45.096 --> 00:11:48.101
ninja-clad bike messenger.

00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:51.938
And today, cyclists look

00:11:51.938 --> 00:11:54.109
like New York City looks.

00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:57.291
It's diverse -- young, old, black, white,

00:11:57.291 --> 00:12:00.309
women, kids, all getting on a bike.

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:03.326
It's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around.

00:12:03.326 --> 00:12:05.416
Quite radical.

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:08.558
We've also brought this approach to our buses,

00:12:08.558 --> 00:12:11.995
and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America,

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:13.436
the slowest bus speeds.

00:12:13.436 --> 00:12:14.515
As everybody knows,

00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:16.917
you can walk across town faster

00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:18.137
than you can take the bus.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.939
And so we focused on the most congested areas

00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:22.364
of New York City,

00:12:22.364 --> 00:12:25.295
built out six bus rapid transit lines,

00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:28.588
57 miles of new speedy bus lanes.

00:12:28.588 --> 00:12:31.318
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:33.704
We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out

00:12:33.704 --> 00:12:35.830
because they get ticketed by a camera

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.343
if they use that lane,

00:12:37.343 --> 00:12:40.985
and it's been a huge success.

00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:43.025
I think one of my very favorite moments

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:45.311
as transportation commissioner was the day

00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:46.808
that we launched Citi Bike,

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.858
and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue

00:12:49.858 --> 00:12:51.218
in my protected bike lane,

00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:53.594
and I looked over and I saw pedestrians

00:12:53.594 --> 00:12:56.222
standing safely on the pedestrian islands,

00:12:56.222 --> 00:12:58.586
and the traffic was flowing,

00:12:58.586 --> 00:13:00.536
birds were singing --

00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:01.891
(Laughter) --

00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.977
the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.

00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:08.675
It was just fantastic.

00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:11.546
And this is how it looked six years ago.

00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:14.990
And so, I think that the lesson that we have

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.469
from New York is that it's possible

00:13:18.469 --> 00:13:21.177
to change your streets quickly,

00:13:21.177 --> 00:13:25.171
it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.525
and it can be quite popular.

00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:30.804
You just need to reimagine your streets.

00:13:30.804 --> 00:13:32.869
They're hidden in plain sight.

00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:34.267
Thank you.

00:13:34.267 --> 00:13:38.960
(Applause)
