WEBVTT

00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:02.402
"Iran is Israel's best friend,

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:05.111
and we do not intend to change our position

00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:08.591
in relation to Tehran."

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:10.314
Believe it or not, this is a quote

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:12.513
from an Israeli prime minister,

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.957
but it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:17.150
from the era of the Shah.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.568
It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin.

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:22.054
The year is 1987.

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:23.975
Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive,

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:25.913
and much like Ahmadinejad today,

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:28.813
he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel.

00:00:28.813 --> 00:00:31.692
Yet, Rabin referred to Iran

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:34.942
as a geostrategic friend.

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:37.638
Today, when we hear the threats of war

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:39.044
and the high rhetoric,

00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:40.675
we're oftentimes led to believe

00:00:40.675 --> 00:00:43.958
that this is yet another one of those unsolvable

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.833
Middle Eastern conflicts

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:49.561
with roots as old as the region itself.

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:53.450
Nothing could be further from the truth,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.482
and I hope today to show you why that is.

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:59.820
The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.300
throughout history has actually been quite positive,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.700
starting in 539 B.C.,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.589
when King Cyrus the Great of Persia

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:10.283
liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity.

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:12.754
A third of the Jewish population

00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:14.320
stayed in Babylonia.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.570
They're today's Iraqi Jews.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.676
A third migrated to Persia.

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:21.752
They're today's Iranian Jews,

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:24.783
still 25,000 of them living in Iran,

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:26.695
making them the largest Jewish community

00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:29.943
in the Middle East outside of Israel itself.

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:32.574
And a third returned to historic Palestine,

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:35.625
did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:40.774
financed, incidentally, by Persian tax money.

00:01:40.774 --> 00:01:42.860
But even in modern times,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.305
relations have been close at times.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.106
Rabin's statement was a reflection

00:01:48.106 --> 00:01:52.064
of decades of security and intelligence collaboration

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:54.600
between the two, which in turn

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.597
was born out of perception of common threats.

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:01.412
Both states feared the Soviet Union

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:06.559
and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.800
And, in addition, the Israeli doctrine of the periphery,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.092
the idea that Israel's security was best achieved

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:18.170
by creating alliances with the non-Arab states

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.076
in the periphery of the region

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:24.965
in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity.

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.433
Now, from the Shah's perspective, though,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:31.087
he wanted to keep this as secret as possible,

00:02:31.087 --> 00:02:33.335
so when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance,

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:35.227
traveled to Iran in the '70s,

00:02:35.227 --> 00:02:36.675
he usually wore a wig

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:39.086
so that no one would recognize him.

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:41.521
The Iranians built a special tarmac

00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:44.773
at the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal,

00:02:44.773 --> 00:02:47.078
so that no one would notice the large number

00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:52.499
of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran.

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.686
Now, did all of this end with the Islamic revolution

00:02:55.686 --> 00:02:58.639
in 1979?

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.706
In spite of the very clear anti-Israeli ideology

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:05.099
of the new regime, the geopolitical logic

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.703
for their collaboration lived on,

00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:10.515
because they still had common threats.

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:13.544
And when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980,

00:03:13.544 --> 00:03:16.034
Israel feared an Iraqi victory

00:03:16.034 --> 00:03:18.785
and actively helped Iran by selling it arms

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:21.037
and providing it with spare parts

00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:23.197
for Iran's American weaponry

00:03:23.197 --> 00:03:26.913
at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable

00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:29.415
because of an American arms embargo

00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:32.403
that Israel was more than happy to violate.

00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:35.161
In fact, back in the 1980s,

00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:37.970
it was Israel that lobbied Washington

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.079
to talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran,

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.703
and not pay attention to Iran's anti-Israeli ideology.

00:03:47.703 --> 00:03:49.642
And this, of course, climaxed

00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:54.293
in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.

00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:56.293
But with the end of the Cold War

00:03:56.293 --> 00:04:00.731
came also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace.

00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.091
Suddenly, the two common threats

00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:06.144
that had pushed them closer together throughout decades,

00:04:06.144 --> 00:04:08.590
more or less evaporated.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.552
The Soviet Union collapsed,

00:04:10.552 --> 00:04:12.244
Iraq was defeated,

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:14.325
and a new environment was created in the region

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:16.665
in which both of them felt more secure,

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:19.585
but they were also now left unchecked.

00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:22.700
Without Iraq balancing Iran,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.878
Iran could now become a threat,

00:04:24.878 --> 00:04:27.410
some in Israel argued.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.355
In fact, the current dynamic

00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:32.447
that you see between Iran and Israel

00:04:32.447 --> 00:04:34.542
has its roots more so

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:37.195
in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.984
after the Cold War

00:04:38.984 --> 00:04:41.484
than in the events of 1979,

00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:44.181
because at this point, Iran and Israel

00:04:44.181 --> 00:04:48.069
emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region,

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.312
and rather than viewing each other

00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:51.788
as potential security partners,

00:04:51.788 --> 00:04:54.000
they increasingly came to view each other

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.558
as rivals and competitors.

00:04:57.558 --> 00:04:59.359
So Israel, who in the 1980s

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:02.884
lobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations

00:05:02.884 --> 00:05:06.267
now feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement,

00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:07.561
thinking that it would come

00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:11.223
at Israel's security interests' expense,

00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:13.355
and instead sought to put Iran

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.889
in increased isolation.

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.817
Ironically, this was happening at a time

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:20.884
when Iran was more interested

00:05:20.884 --> 00:05:23.034
in peacemaking with Washington

00:05:23.034 --> 00:05:26.469
than to see to Israel's destruction.

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.309
Iran had put itself in isolation

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:30.176
because of its radicalism,

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:33.095
and after having helped the United States indirectly

00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:35.367
in the war against Iraq in 1991,

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:37.323
the Iranians were hoping

00:05:37.323 --> 00:05:41.225
that they would be rewarded by being included

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:45.955
in the post-war security architecture of the region.

00:05:45.955 --> 00:05:49.507
But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach,

00:05:49.507 --> 00:05:51.943
as it would a decade later in Afghanistan,

00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:56.138
and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation,

00:05:56.138 --> 00:05:59.372
and it is at this point, around 1993, '94,

00:05:59.372 --> 00:06:02.084
that Iran begins to translate

00:06:02.084 --> 00:06:04.311
its anti-Israeli ideology

00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.706
into operational policy.

00:06:06.706 --> 00:06:08.985
The Iranians believed that whatever they did,

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.295
even if they moderated their policies,

00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:14.597
the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation,

00:06:14.597 --> 00:06:18.251
and the only way Iran could compel Washington

00:06:18.251 --> 00:06:21.547
to change its position was by imposing a cost

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:24.860
on the U.S. if it didn't.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.950
The easiest target was the peace process,

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.327
and now the Iranian ideological bark

00:06:31.327 --> 00:06:35.566
was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite,

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:39.543
and Iran began supporting extensively

00:06:39.543 --> 00:06:42.242
Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously

00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:45.633
had shunned.

00:06:45.633 --> 00:06:48.848
In some ways, this sounds paradoxical,

00:06:48.848 --> 00:06:50.968
but according to Martin Indyk

00:06:50.968 --> 00:06:52.841
of the Clinton administration,

00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:55.740
the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.281
because the more peace there would be

00:06:57.281 --> 00:06:59.444
between Israel and Palestine,

00:06:59.444 --> 00:07:02.807
the U.S. believed, the more Iran would get isolated.

00:07:02.807 --> 00:07:05.943
The more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be.

00:07:05.943 --> 00:07:08.391
So according to Indyk, and these are his words,

00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:11.579
the Iranians had an interest to do us in

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.246
on the peace process

00:07:13.246 --> 00:07:16.958
in order to defeat our policy of containment.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.324
To defeat our policy of containment,

00:07:19.324 --> 00:07:23.310
not about ideology.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.015
But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement,

00:07:27.015 --> 00:07:30.278
all sides have reached out to each other.

00:07:30.278 --> 00:07:33.547
Netanyahu, when he got elected in 1996,

00:07:33.547 --> 00:07:35.343
reached out to the Iranians to see

00:07:35.343 --> 00:07:37.046
if there were any ways that

00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:40.235
the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected.

00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.705
Tehran was not interested.

00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:45.670
A few years later, the Iranians sent

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.129
a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration,

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:53.137
a proposal that revealed that there was some potential

00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:57.000
of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.260
The Bush administration did not even respond.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.080
All sides have never missed an opportunity

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.147
to miss an opportunity.

00:08:08.897 --> 00:08:13.569
But this is not an ancient conflict.

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:16.528
This is not even an ideological conflict.

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:19.322
The ebbs and flows of hostility

00:08:19.322 --> 00:08:22.598
have not shifted with ideological zeal,

00:08:22.598 --> 00:08:25.200
but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.531
When Iran and Israel's security imperatives

00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.233
dictated collaboration, they did so

00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:33.809
in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.725
When Iran's ideological impulses collided

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.955
with its strategic interests,

00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:42.618
the strategic interests always prevailed.

00:08:42.618 --> 00:08:45.611
This is good news, because it means

00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:48.197
that neither war nor enmity

00:08:48.197 --> 00:08:51.867
is a foregone conclusion.

00:08:51.867 --> 00:08:54.422
But some want war.

00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:57.626
Some believe or say that it's 1938,

00:08:57.626 --> 00:08:59.538
Iran is Germany,

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:02.704
and Ahmadinejad is Hitler.

00:09:02.704 --> 00:09:04.569
If we accept this to be true,

00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:07.921
that indeed it is 1938, Iran is Germany,

00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.328
Ahmadinejad is Hitler,

00:09:10.328 --> 00:09:13.163
then the question we have to ask ourself is,

00:09:13.163 --> 00:09:16.976
who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain?

00:09:16.976 --> 00:09:19.842
Who will risk peace?

00:09:19.842 --> 00:09:22.456
This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed

00:09:22.456 --> 00:09:25.216
at eliminating diplomacy,

00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:27.628
and when you eliminate diplomacy,

00:09:27.628 --> 00:09:30.717
you make war inevitable.

00:09:30.717 --> 00:09:33.832
In an ideological conflict, there can be no truce,

00:09:33.832 --> 00:09:35.997
no draw, no compromise,

00:09:35.997 --> 00:09:39.279
only victory or defeat.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:42.469
But rather than making war inevitable

00:09:42.469 --> 00:09:45.673
by viewing this as ideological,

00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:47.712
we would be wise to seek ways

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.700
to make peace possible.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.196
Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon,

00:09:54.196 --> 00:09:56.186
only a few decades old

00:09:56.186 --> 00:09:58.812
in a history of 2,500 years,

00:09:58.812 --> 00:10:02.799
and precisely because its roots are geopolitical,

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:05.639
it means that solutions can be found,

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.326
compromises can be struck,

00:10:08.326 --> 00:10:11.145
however difficult it yet may be.

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:15.137
After all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said,

00:10:15.137 --> 00:10:18.123
"You don't make peace with your friends.

00:10:18.123 --> 00:10:20.503
You make it with your enemies."

00:10:20.503 --> 00:10:21.938
Thank you.

00:10:21.938 --> 00:10:27.020
(Applause)
