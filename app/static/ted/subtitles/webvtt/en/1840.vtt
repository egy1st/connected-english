WEBVTT

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.538
I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases,

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.932
and following my training,

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:10.854
I moved to Somalia

00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:12.898
from San Francisco.

00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:14.513
And my goodbye greeting

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.366
from the chief of infectious diseases

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.462
at San Francisco General was,

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:22.145
"Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:26.193
But I landed in a refugee situation

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.266
that had a million refugees in 40 camps,

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.793
and there were six of us doctors.

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:35.109
There were many epidemics there.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.722
My responsibilities were largely related to

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:39.463
tuberculosis,

00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:43.329
and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.392
So it was the spread of tuberculosis

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:47.439
and the spread of cholera

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:52.640
that I was responsible for inhibiting.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.281
And in order to do this work, we, of course,

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:57.981
because of the limitation in health workers,

00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.747
had to recruit refugees to be a specialized

00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:04.506
new category of health worker.

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:07.734
Following three years of work in Somalia,

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.344
I got picked up by the World Health Organization,

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:13.391
and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:16.264
My primary responsibility was Uganda,

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:19.267
but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:22.354
and Zaire, now Congo,

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:25.922
Tanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.

00:01:25.922 --> 00:01:28.383
And my last assignment there was to run a unit

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:30.268
called intervention development,

00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:33.984
which was responsible for designing interventions.

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:36.959
After 10 years of working overseas,

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.682
I was exhausted.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:40.880
I really had very little left.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.292
I had been traveling to one country after another.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:48.756
I was emotionally feeling very isolated.

00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:50.894
I wanted to come home.

00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:52.930
I'd seen a lot of death,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.880
in particular epidemic death,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.828
and epidemic death has a different feel to it.

00:01:58.828 --> 00:02:02.436
It's full of panic and fear,

00:02:02.436 --> 00:02:06.232
and I'd heard the women wailing and crying

00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:08.540
in the desert.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.933
And I wanted to come home and take a break

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.972
and maybe start over.

00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:16.824
I was not aware of any epidemic problems

00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:18.461
in America.

00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:21.748
In fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America.

00:02:21.748 --> 00:02:23.828
In fact -- seriously.

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:26.670
And in fact I would visit friends of mine,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.759
and I noticed that they had water

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.772
that came right into their homes.

00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:33.647
How many of you have such a situation?

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:34.815
(Laughter)

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:37.426
And some of them, many of them actually,

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.541
had water that came into more than one room.

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:42.788
And I noticed that they would move

00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:44.795
this little thermoregulatory device

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:47.070
to change the temperature in their home

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.921
by one degree or two degrees.

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:51.602
And now I do that.

00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:55.855
And I really didn't know what I would do,

00:02:55.855 --> 00:02:58.400
but friends of mine began telling me

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.380
about children shooting other children with guns.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.195
And I asked the question,

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:06.153
what are you doing about it?

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:08.261
What are you in America doing about it?

00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:10.673
And there were two essential explanations

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:12.922
or ideas that were prevalent.

00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:14.976
And one was punishment.

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:17.149
And this I had heard about before.

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.793
We who had worked in behavior

00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:23.177
knew that punishment was something that was discussed

00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:26.014
but also that it was highly overvalued.

00:03:26.014 --> 00:03:28.358
It was not a main driver of behavior,

00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:32.248
nor was it a main driver of behavior change.

00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:34.298
And besides that, it reminded me

00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:36.800
of ancient epidemics

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.870
that were previously completely misunderstood

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.444
because the science hadn't been there before,

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:44.830
epidemics of plague

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.742
or typhus or leprosy,

00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:50.479
where the prevalent ideas were that there were

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.121
bad people or bad humors or bad air,

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:56.730
and widows were dragged around the moat,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.177
and dungeons were part of the solution.

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:02.330
The other explanation or, in a way,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.104
the solution suggested,

00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:07.104
is please fix all of these things:

00:04:07.104 --> 00:04:10.436
the schools, the community, the homes, the families,

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:11.962
everything.

00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.775
And I'd heard this before as well.

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:16.510
I'd called this the "everything" theory,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.178
or EOE: Everything On Earth.

00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:20.789
But we'd also realized

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.426
in treating other processes and problems

00:04:24.426 --> 00:04:27.341
that sometimes you don't need to treat everything.

00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:29.525
And so the sense that I had

00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:32.123
was there was a giant gap here.

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:34.869
The problem of violence was stuck,

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:37.135
and this has historically been the case

00:04:37.135 --> 00:04:38.297
in many other issues.

00:04:38.297 --> 00:04:39.875
Diarrheal diseases had been stuck.

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:41.354
Malaria had been stuck.

00:04:41.354 --> 00:04:43.824
Frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.

00:04:43.824 --> 00:04:47.114
It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like,

00:04:47.114 --> 00:04:50.420
but there was a sense that we would have to do

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.673
something with new categories of workers

00:04:52.673 --> 00:04:54.941
and something having to do with behavior change

00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:59.050
and something having to do with public education.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.117
But I began to ask questions

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:03.655
and search out the usual things

00:05:03.655 --> 00:05:05.607
that I had been exploring before,

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:07.140
like, what do the maps look like?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.590
What do the graphs look like?

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.629
What does the data look like?

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.025
And the maps of violence

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:14.987
in most U.S. cities

00:05:14.987 --> 00:05:16.979
looked like this.

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.643
There was clustering.

00:05:18.643 --> 00:05:21.981
This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also

00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:23.724
in infectious epidemics,

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:25.716
for example cholera.

00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:28.083
And then we looked at the maps,

00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:30.797
and the maps showed this typical wave

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.590
upon wave upon wave,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.945
because all epidemics

00:05:33.945 --> 00:05:36.519
are combinations of many epidemics.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.623
And it also looked like infectious epidemics.

00:05:39.623 --> 00:05:41.236
And then we asked the question,

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:44.778
well what really predicts a case of violence?

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:47.023
And it turns out that the greatest predictor

00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:50.331
of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.

00:05:50.331 --> 00:05:53.561
Which also sounds like, if there is a case of flu,

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.461
someone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold,

00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:58.901
or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis

00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.953
is having been exposed to tuberculosis.

00:06:01.953 --> 00:06:04.685
And so we see that violence is, in a way,

00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:07.844
behaving like a contagious disease.

00:06:07.844 --> 00:06:09.394
We're aware of this anyway

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:11.330
even in our common experiences

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.140
or our newspaper stories

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.264
of the spread of violence from fights

00:06:16.264 --> 00:06:19.715
or in gang wars or in civil wars

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:21.973
or even in genocides.

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:24.545
And so there's good news about this, though,

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:27.350
because there's a way to reverse epidemics,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.356
and there's really only three things that are done

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.224
to reverse epidemics,

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.864
and the first of it is interrupting transmission.

00:06:33.864 --> 00:06:35.790
In order to interrupt transmission,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.340
you need to detect and find first cases.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.354
In other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody

00:06:42.354 --> 00:06:45.602
who has active T.B. who is infecting other people.

00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:47.019
Make sense?

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:49.283
And there's special workers for doing that.

00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:51.142
For this particular problem,

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:53.457
we designed a new category of worker

00:06:53.457 --> 00:06:54.802
who, like a SARS worker

00:06:54.802 --> 00:06:56.663
or someone looking for bird flu,

00:06:56.663 --> 00:06:58.410
might find first cases.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.611
In this case, it's someone who's very angry

00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:02.364
because someone looked at his girlfriend

00:07:02.364 --> 00:07:04.150
or owes him money,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.619
and you can find workers and train them

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:09.733
into these specialized categories.

00:07:09.733 --> 00:07:11.383
And the second thing to do, of course,

00:07:11.383 --> 00:07:12.884
is to prevent further spread,

00:07:12.884 --> 00:07:16.406
that means to find who else has been exposed,

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.851
but may not be spreading so much right now

00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:21.377
like someone with a smaller case of T.B.,

00:07:21.377 --> 00:07:24.231
or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods,

00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:25.857
but in the same group,

00:07:25.857 --> 00:07:28.154
and then they need to be, in a way,

00:07:28.154 --> 00:07:29.527
managed as well,

00:07:29.527 --> 00:07:32.878
particular to the specific disease process.

00:07:32.878 --> 00:07:35.931
And then the third part, the shifting the norms,

00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:39.231
and that means a whole bunch of community activities,

00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:41.572
remodeling, public education,

00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:43.709
and then you've got what you might call

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:44.931
group immunity.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:46.819
And that combination of factors

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:49.181
is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda

00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:51.618
was very successfully reversed.

00:07:51.618 --> 00:07:54.448
And so what we decided to do in the year 2000

00:07:54.448 --> 00:07:56.368
is kind of put this together in a way

00:07:56.368 --> 00:07:58.895
by hiring in new categories of workers,

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.470
the first being violence interruptors.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.132
And then we would put all of this into place

00:08:04.132 --> 00:08:05.567
in one neighborhood

00:08:05.567 --> 00:08:07.977
in what was the worst police district

00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:09.884
in the United States at the time.

00:08:09.884 --> 00:08:12.627
So violence interruptors hired from the same group,

00:08:12.627 --> 00:08:15.612
credibility, trust, access,

00:08:15.612 --> 00:08:18.230
just like the health workers in Somalia,

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.497
but designed for a different category,

00:08:20.497 --> 00:08:22.469
and trained in persuasion,

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:26.247
cooling people down, buying time, reframing.

00:08:26.247 --> 00:08:28.213
And then another category of worker,

00:08:28.213 --> 00:08:30.753
the outreach workers, to keep people

00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:34.123
in a way on therapy for six to 24 months.

00:08:34.123 --> 00:08:37.782
Just like T.B., but the object is behavior change.

00:08:37.782 --> 00:08:39.590
And then a bunch of community activities

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.285
for changing norms.

00:08:41.285 --> 00:08:43.652
Now our first experiment of this

00:08:43.652 --> 00:08:46.329
resulted in a 67-percent drop

00:08:46.329 --> 00:08:47.800
in shootings and killings

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.197
in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago.

00:08:50.197 --> 00:08:52.347
(Applause)

00:08:52.347 --> 00:08:53.707
And this was a beautiful thing

00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.323
for the neighborhood itself,

00:08:55.323 --> 00:08:58.215
first 50 or 60 days, then 90 days,

00:08:58.215 --> 00:08:59.994
and then there was unfortunately another shooting

00:08:59.994 --> 00:09:01.513
in another 90 days,

00:09:01.513 --> 00:09:03.953
and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.

00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:06.351
They were using parks they weren't using before.

00:09:06.351 --> 00:09:08.488
The sun was out. Everybody was happy.

00:09:08.488 --> 00:09:11.678
But of course, the funders said, "Wait a second,

00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:13.005
do it again."

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:16.322
And so we had to then, fortunately,

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:19.081
get the funds to repeat this experience,

00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:21.092
and this is one of the next four neighborhoods

00:09:21.092 --> 00:09:24.112
that had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.

00:09:24.112 --> 00:09:26.888
And since that time, this has been replicated

00:09:26.888 --> 00:09:28.504
20 times.

00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:30.585
There have been independent evaluations

00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:32.531
supported by the Justice Department

00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:35.308
and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:39.102
that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent

00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:41.211
reductions in shootings and killings

00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:43.133
using this new method.

00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:44.580
In fact, there have been three independent

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.698
evaluations of this now.

00:09:46.698 --> 00:09:48.955
Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this,

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:51.151
including being featured on

00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:55.096
The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story.

00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:57.894
The Economist in 2009

00:09:57.894 --> 00:10:00.108
said this is "the approach that will come to prominence."

00:10:00.108 --> 00:10:02.445
And even a movie was made around our work.

00:10:02.445 --> 00:10:03.613
[The Interrupters]

00:10:03.613 --> 00:10:06.117
However, not so fast,

00:10:06.117 --> 00:10:07.979
because a lot of people did not agree

00:10:07.979 --> 00:10:09.960
with this way of going about it.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.923
We got a lot of criticism,

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:13.662
a lot of opposition,

00:10:13.662 --> 00:10:15.397
and a lot of opponents.

00:10:15.397 --> 00:10:18.248
In other words, what do you mean, health problem?

00:10:18.248 --> 00:10:20.834
What do you mean, epidemic?

00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:23.642
What do you mean, no bad guys?

00:10:23.642 --> 00:10:25.795
And there's whole industries designed

00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:28.753
for managing bad people.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.796
What do you mean, hiring people

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:33.745
who have backgrounds?

00:10:33.745 --> 00:10:38.244
My business friends said,

00:10:38.244 --> 00:10:41.591
"Gary, you're being criticized tremendously.

00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:43.589
You must be doing something right."

00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:45.598
(Laughter)

00:10:45.598 --> 00:10:48.853
My musician friends added the word "dude."

00:10:48.853 --> 00:10:52.624
So anyway, additionally,

00:10:52.624 --> 00:10:54.449
there was still this problem,

00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:57.354
and we were getting highly criticized as well

00:10:57.354 --> 00:11:00.650
for not dealing with all of these other problems.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.780
Yet we were able to manage malaria

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.532
and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:08.470
in places with awful economies

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.290
without healing the economy.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.825
So what's actually happened is,

00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:15.270
although there is still some opposition,

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.090
the movement is clearly growing.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.174
Many of the major cities in the U.S.,

00:11:19.174 --> 00:11:21.412
including New York City and Baltimore

00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:22.677
and Kansas City,

00:11:22.677 --> 00:11:24.610
their health departments are running this now.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.231
Chicago and New Orleans, the health departments

00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:29.762
are having a very large role in this.

00:11:29.762 --> 00:11:32.617
This is being embraced more by law enforcement

00:11:32.617 --> 00:11:34.596
than it had been years ago.

00:11:34.596 --> 00:11:36.650
Trauma centers and hospitals

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.944
are doing their part in stepping up.

00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:40.837
And the U.S. Conference of Mayors

00:11:40.837 --> 00:11:43.430
has endorsed not only the approach

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.723
but the specific model.

00:11:45.723 --> 00:11:48.972
Where there's really been uptake even faster

00:11:48.972 --> 00:11:50.969
is in the international environment,

00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:52.725
where there's a 55-percent drop

00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:55.149
in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico,

00:11:55.149 --> 00:11:57.955
where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras,

00:11:57.955 --> 00:12:00.869
where the strategy has been applied in Kenya

00:12:00.869 --> 00:12:03.515
for the recent elections,

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:06.688
and where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq.

00:12:06.688 --> 00:12:09.963
So violence is responding as a disease

00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:12.228
even as it behaves as a disease.

00:12:12.228 --> 00:12:14.431
So the theory, in a way,

00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:18.596
is kind of being validated by the treatment.

00:12:18.596 --> 00:12:21.530
And recently, the Institute of Medicine

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.667
came out with a workshop report

00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:25.531
which went through some of the data,

00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:27.076
including the neuroscience,

00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:31.399
on how this problem is really transmitted.

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:34.310
So I think this is good news,

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.174
because it allows us an opportunity

00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:37.729
to come out of the Middle Ages,

00:12:37.729 --> 00:12:40.771
which is where I feel this field has been.

00:12:40.771 --> 00:12:43.877
It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility

00:12:43.877 --> 00:12:46.673
of replacing some of these prisons

00:12:46.673 --> 00:12:49.955
with playgrounds or parks,

00:12:49.955 --> 00:12:52.623
and to consider the possibility

00:12:52.623 --> 00:12:56.310
of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods,

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.764
and to allow there to be a new strategy,

00:12:59.764 --> 00:13:03.625
a new set of methods, a new set of workers:

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:07.040
science, in a way, replacing morality.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.424
And moving away from emotions

00:13:09.424 --> 00:13:12.611
is the most important part of the solution

00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:16.929
to science as a more important part of the solution.

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:21.652
So I didn't mean to come up with this at all.

00:13:21.652 --> 00:13:24.154
It was a matter of,

00:13:24.154 --> 00:13:25.985
I wanted actually a break,

00:13:25.985 --> 00:13:30.096
and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs,

00:13:30.096 --> 00:13:31.733
we asked some questions

00:13:31.733 --> 00:13:34.929
and tried some tools

00:13:34.929 --> 00:13:37.486
that actually have been used many times before

00:13:37.486 --> 00:13:39.404
for other things.

00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:42.659
For myself, I tried to get away from

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:44.402
infectious diseases,

00:13:44.402 --> 00:13:46.357
and I didn't.

00:13:46.357 --> 00:13:47.984
Thank you.

00:13:47.984 --> 00:13:51.274
(Applause)
