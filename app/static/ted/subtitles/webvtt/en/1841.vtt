WEBVTT

00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:03.076
So in my free time outside of Twitter

00:00:03.076 --> 00:00:04.527
I experiment a little bit

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:07.150
with telling stories online, experimenting

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.573
with what we can do with new digital tools.

00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:11.079
And in my job at Twitter,

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.695
I actually spent a little bit of time

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:15.439
working with authors and storytellers as well,

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.644
helping to expand out the bounds

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:19.954
of what people are experimenting with.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.324
And I want to talk through some examples today

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:23.733
of things that people have done

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.902
that I think are really fascinating

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:29.037
using flexible identity and anonymity on the web

00:00:29.037 --> 00:00:33.110
and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.262
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:37.573
Long before a little thing called Twitter,

00:00:37.573 --> 00:00:40.614
radio brought us broadcasts

00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:43.498
and connected millions of people

00:00:43.498 --> 00:00:45.939
to single points of broadcast.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.961
And from those single points emanated stories.

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:51.950
Some of them were familiar stories.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.415
Some of them were new stories.

00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:56.414
And for a while they were familiar formats,

00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:58.635
but then radio began to evolve its own

00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:01.566
unique formats specific to that medium.

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:05.250
Think about episodes that happened live on radio.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.573
Combining the live play

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:09.934
and the serialization of written fiction,

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:12.119
you get this new format.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.048
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:18.173
radio is a great example of how a new medium

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:21.980
defines new formats which then define new stories.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.916
And of course, today, we have an entirely new

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:26.517
medium to play with,

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:27.943
which is this online world.

00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:31.807
This is the map of verified users on Twitter

00:01:31.807 --> 00:01:33.113
and the connections between them.

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:35.880
There are thousands upon thousands of them.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.475
Every single one of these points

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:39.357
is its own broadcaster.

00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:43.030
We've gone to this world of many to many,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.795
where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.368
And I think that we should start to see

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:52.053
wildly new formats emerge

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:55.961
as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.

00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:59.313
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier

00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:01.501
for creative experimentation, if you will,

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.850
that we've explored and begun to settle

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.829
this wild land of the Internet

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.072
and are now just getting ready

00:02:09.072 --> 00:02:11.154
to start to build structures on it,

00:02:11.154 --> 00:02:13.241
and those structures are the new formats

00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:17.794
of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.

00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:20.099
I believe this starts with an evolution

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.993
of existing methods.

00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:23.756
The short story, for example,

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:25.218
people are saying that the short story

00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:27.993
is experiencing a renaissance of sorts

00:02:27.993 --> 00:02:31.392
thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.

00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:34.470
One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.191
with short stories on Amazon

00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:40.723
by releasing one very short story called "Wool."

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.225
And he actually says that he didn't intend

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:44.570
for "Wool" to become a series,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.196
but that the audience loved the first story so much

00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:49.607
they demanded more, and so he gave them more.

00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:53.111
He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one,

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:55.105
"Wool 3," which was even longer,

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:56.895
culminating in "Wool 5,"

00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:59.736
which was a 60,000-word novel.

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:03.721
I think Howey was able to do all of this because

00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:06.664
he had the quick feedback system of e-books.

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:08.466
He was able to write and publish

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:10.055
in relatively short order.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:13.152
There was no mediator between him and the audience.

00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:15.958
It was just him directly connected with his audience

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.107
and building on the feedback and enthusiasm

00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:19.928
that they were giving him.

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:21.813
So this whole project was an experiment.

00:03:21.813 --> 00:03:23.920
It started with the one short story,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.049
and I think the experimentation actually became

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.377
a part of Howey's format.

00:03:28.377 --> 00:03:31.616
And that's something that this medium enabled,

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:35.793
was experimentation being a part of the format itself.

00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:38.964
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan

00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:40.412
called "Black Box."

00:03:40.412 --> 00:03:41.919
It was originally written

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.600
specifically with Twitter in mind.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.909
Egan convinced The New Yorker

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.331
to start a New Yorker fiction account

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:50.148
from which they could tweet

00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:51.952
all of these lines that she created.

00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:55.399
Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.240
Egan mocked that up just writing manually

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.156
in this storyboard sketchbook,

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:04.143
used the physical space constraints

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.652
of those storyboard squares

00:04:05.652 --> 00:04:07.453
to write each individual tweet,

00:04:07.453 --> 00:04:10.392
and those tweets ended up becoming

00:04:10.392 --> 00:04:14.080
over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.850
Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.418
to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:22.962
I think that's pretty exciting:

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:25.468
tune-in literary fiction.

00:04:25.468 --> 00:04:28.529
The experience of Egan's story, of course,

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.578
like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.

00:04:31.578 --> 00:04:33.117
You could scroll back through it,

00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:36.000
but interestingly, if you were watching it live,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.631
there was this suspense that built

00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:41.148
because the actual tweets,

00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:43.451
you had no control over when you would read them.

00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:45.891
They were coming at a pretty regular clip,

00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:48.269
but as the story was building,

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:51.512
normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,

00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:53.823
but in this case, The New Yorker did,

00:04:53.823 --> 00:04:56.993
and they were sending you bit by bit by bit,

00:04:56.993 --> 00:05:00.275
and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.

00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:03.346
Another great example of fiction

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:05.390
and the short story on Twitter,

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.813
Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."

00:05:08.813 --> 00:05:11.443
It began with this tweet: "On November 28

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:13.594
at 10:13 p.m.,

00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:15.669
a woman identified as Miranda Brown,

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.499
44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.865
from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."

00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:22.595
It begins in Elliott's voice,

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:24.336
but then Elliott's voice recedes,

00:05:24.336 --> 00:05:27.718
and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,

00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:30.817
characters that Elliott created on Twitter

00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:32.546
specifically to tell this story,

00:05:32.546 --> 00:05:35.160
a story from multiple perspectives

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.285
leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.

00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:40.563
when this woman falls to her death.

00:05:40.563 --> 00:05:43.667
These three characters brought an authentic vision

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.389
from multiple perspectives.

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.715
One reviewer called Elliott's story

00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:50.605
"Twitter fiction done right," because she did.

00:05:50.605 --> 00:05:52.333
She captured that voice

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:55.521
and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.220
Interestingly, though, it wasn't just

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.384
Twitter as a distribution mechanism.

00:06:00.384 --> 00:06:02.528
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.772
Elliott told me later

00:06:03.772 --> 00:06:07.819
she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.622
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth

00:06:11.622 --> 00:06:13.471
between different characters

00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:16.084
tweeting out each line, line by line.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.837
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.353
of what was coming out of the characters' voices

00:06:21.353 --> 00:06:24.462
really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,

00:06:24.462 --> 00:06:27.140
but also to this format that she had created

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.753
of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.

00:06:31.753 --> 00:06:34.480
As you begin to play with flexible identity online,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.777
it gets even more interesting

00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:37.722
as you start to interact with the real world.

00:06:37.722 --> 00:06:39.626
Things like Invisible Obama

00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:41.867
or the famous "binders full of women"

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:44.413
that came up during the 2012 election cycle,

00:06:44.413 --> 00:06:48.584
or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter

00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:50.694
in which you have all of these accounts

00:06:50.694 --> 00:06:53.670
for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing,"

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.573
including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window

00:06:57.573 --> 00:07:01.709
in one single episode. (Laughter)

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:04.845
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.

00:07:04.845 --> 00:07:07.161
They are creative people experimenting

00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:10.217
with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.

00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:11.970
You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.370
in which you have these fictional characters

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.328
that engage with the real world.

00:07:16.328 --> 00:07:18.120
They comment on politics,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.654
they cry out against the evils of Congress.

00:07:22.654 --> 00:07:24.438
Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.

00:07:24.438 --> 00:07:27.758
And they engage with the real world.

00:07:27.758 --> 00:07:29.616
They respond to it.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.761
So once you take flexible identity,

00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:34.460
anonymity, engagement with the real world,

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.631
and you move beyond simple homage or parody

00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:41.220
and you put these tools to work in telling a story,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.103
that's when things get really interesting.

00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:45.912
So during the Chicago mayoral election

00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:47.480
there was a parody account.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.894
It was Mayor Emanuel.

00:07:48.894 --> 00:07:52.360
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.680
particularly in the expletive department.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.759
This foul-mouthed account

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:01.646
followed the daily activities of the race,

00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:03.326
providing commentary as it went.

00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:05.807
It followed all of the natural tropes

00:08:05.807 --> 00:08:08.189
of a good, solid Twitter parody account,

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:11.871
but then started to get weird.

00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:15.244
And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:20.512
to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic

00:08:20.512 --> 00:08:23.600
in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.757
engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.370
which is -- it didn't actually happen.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.788
I double checked the newspapers.

00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:37.331
And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.

00:08:37.331 --> 00:08:39.330
This is something that doesn't usually happen

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.791
with a Twitter parody account.

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:44.520
It ended, a true narrative conclusion.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.742
And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,

00:08:47.742 --> 00:08:50.077
who was completely anonymous this whole time,

00:08:50.077 --> 00:08:53.775
I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him

00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:55.359
to turn this into a book,

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:58.732
because it was a narrative format in the end,

00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:01.293
and I think that turning it into a book

00:09:01.293 --> 00:09:04.991
is representative of this idea that he had created something new

00:09:04.991 --> 00:09:08.617
that needed to be translated into previous formats.

00:09:08.617 --> 00:09:10.710
One of my favorite examples

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.706
of something that's happening on Twitter right now,

00:09:12.706 --> 00:09:17.482
actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.

00:09:17.482 --> 00:09:19.914
Crimer Show tells the story

00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:22.655
of a supercriminal and a hapless detective

00:09:22.655 --> 00:09:26.340
that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.762
with all of the tropes of a television show.

00:09:28.762 --> 00:09:30.299
Crimer Show's creator has said that

00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:35.291
it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,

00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:38.149
but, man, is it weird.

00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:40.120
And there are all these times where Crimer,

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.549
the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:44.801
He's always taking off his sunglasses

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:47.769
or turning to the camera,

00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:50.209
but these things just happen in text.

00:09:50.209 --> 00:09:53.043
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television

00:09:53.043 --> 00:09:56.795
and additionally presenting each Crimer Show

00:09:56.795 --> 00:10:02.028
as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod,"

00:10:02.028 --> 00:10:04.077
presenting them as episodes

00:10:04.077 --> 00:10:07.107
really, it creates something new.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.696
There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:12.820
on Twitter pretty much every day,

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.432
and they're archived that way.

00:10:14.432 --> 00:10:17.213
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.

00:10:17.213 --> 00:10:19.497
Something totally new has been created here

00:10:19.497 --> 00:10:23.033
out of parodying something on television.

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:25.873
I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,

00:10:25.873 --> 00:10:28.640
there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.589
RealTimeWWII is an account

00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:34.652
that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago

00:10:34.652 --> 00:10:37.021
in exceptional detail, as if

00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:39.750
you were reading the news reports from that day.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.505
And the author Teju Cole has done

00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:44.916
a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:46.544
on events of the news.

00:10:46.544 --> 00:10:50.987
In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.

00:10:50.987 --> 00:10:53.587
I think that in both of these examples,

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:55.228
you're beginning to see ways in which

00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:58.052
people are telling stories with nonfiction content

00:10:58.052 --> 00:11:00.961
that can be built into new types

00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.522
of fictional storytelling.

00:11:03.522 --> 00:11:06.084
So with real-time storytelling,

00:11:06.084 --> 00:11:08.613
blurring the lines between fact and fiction,

00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:10.690
the real world and the digital world,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.472
flexible identity, anonymity,

00:11:14.472 --> 00:11:17.993
these are all tools that we have accessible to us,

00:11:17.993 --> 00:11:19.885
and I think that they're just the building blocks.

00:11:19.885 --> 00:11:22.523
They are the bits that we use

00:11:22.523 --> 00:11:25.160
to create the structures, the frames,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.258
that then become our settlements on this

00:11:28.258 --> 00:11:31.018
wide open frontier for creative experimentation.

00:11:31.018 --> 00:11:32.469
Thank you.

00:11:32.469 --> 00:11:37.223
(Applause)
