WEBVTT

00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:03.999
"Give me liberty or give me death."

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:06.266
When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.191
said these words in 1775,

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:11.094
he could never have imagined

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.159
just how much they would come to resonate

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.182
with American generations to come.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.847
At the time, these words were earmarked

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:21.220
and targeted against the British,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.119
but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.807
what many Westerners believe,

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:30.255
that freedom is the most cherished value,

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:33.176
and that the best systems of politics and economics

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:35.390
have freedom embedded in them.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.184
Who could blame them?

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:40.098
Over the past hundred years, the combination

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:43.141
of liberal democracy and private capitalism

00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.561
has helped to catapult the United States

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:46.822
and Western countries

00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:49.235
to new levels of economic development.

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:51.953
In the United States over the past hundred years,

00:00:51.953 --> 00:00:54.343
incomes have increased 30 times,

00:00:54.343 --> 00:00:56.014
and hundreds of thousands of people

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.287
have been moved out of poverty.

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:02.320
Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.699
has helped to spur industrialization

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.561
and also helped in the creation and the building

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:10.352
of things like household appliances

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:12.575
such as refrigerators and televisions,

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:16.623
motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.

00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:19.305
It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:21.569
of the private capitalism crisis,

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.336
President Obama said,

00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:26.232
"The question before us is not whether the market

00:01:26.232 --> 00:01:28.867
is a force for good or ill.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:32.090
Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.168
is unmatched."

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:36.057
Thus, there's understandably

00:01:36.057 --> 00:01:39.191
a deep-seated presumption among Westerners

00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:42.001
that the whole world will decide to adopt

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.085
private capitalism as the model of economic growth,

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:47.392
liberal democracy, and will continue

00:01:47.392 --> 00:01:51.523
to prioritize political rights over economic rights.

00:01:51.523 --> 00:01:54.373
However, to many who live in the emerging markets,

00:01:54.373 --> 00:01:57.337
this is an illusion, and even though

00:01:57.337 --> 00:01:59.444
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

00:01:59.444 --> 00:02:01.715
which was signed in 1948,

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:04.010
was unanimously adopted,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.701
what it did was to mask a schism

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:10.207
that has emerged between developed
and developing countries,

00:02:10.224 --> 00:02:12.305
and the ideological beliefs

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:15.952
between political and economic rights.

00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:19.489
This schism has only grown wider.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.059
Today, many people who live in the emerging markets,

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.972
where 90 percent of the world's population lives,

00:02:24.972 --> 00:02:27.000
believe that the Western obsession

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.627
with political rights is beside the point,

00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:31.605
and what is actually important

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.826
is delivering on food, shelter,

00:02:33.826 --> 00:02:35.924
education and healthcare.

00:02:35.924 --> 00:02:38.340
"Give me liberty or give me death"

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.103
is all well and good if you can afford it,

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:44.066
but if you're living on less than one dollar a day,

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.034
you're far too busy trying to survive

00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:47.850
and to provide for your family

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.381
than to spend your time going around

00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:52.392
trying to proclaim and defend democracy.

00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:54.239
Now, I know many people in this room

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.427
and around the world will think,

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:59.410
"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,"

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.637
because private capitalism and liberal democracy

00:03:02.637 --> 00:03:04.903
are held sacrosanct.

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:07.272
But I ask you today, what would you do

00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:09.083
if you had to choose?

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.897
What if you had to choose

00:03:10.897 --> 00:03:13.360
between a roof over your head

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.037
and the right to vote?

00:03:15.037 --> 00:03:16.630
Over the last 10 years,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.410
I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.615
many of them in the emerging markets,

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:24.943
in Latin America, Asia,

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:27.625
and my own continent of Africa.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:30.265
I've met with presidents, dissidents,

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:32.633
policymakers, lawyers, teachers,

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:34.936
doctors and the man on the street,

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:36.619
and through these conversations,

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.419
it's become clear to me

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.347
that many people in the emerging markets

00:03:40.347 --> 00:03:43.556
believe that there's actually a split occurring

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.322
between what people believe ideologically

00:03:46.322 --> 00:03:49.008
in terms of politics and economics in the West

00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:51.892
and that which people believe in the rest of the world.

00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:53.763
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:55.223
I'm not saying people in the emerging markets

00:03:55.223 --> 00:03:57.314
don't understand democracy,

00:03:57.314 --> 00:03:59.223
nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally

00:03:59.223 --> 00:04:01.708
like to pick their presidents or their leaders.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.263
Of course they would.

00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:06.284
However, I am saying that on balance,

00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:07.866
they worry more about

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:10.897
where their living standard improvements are going to come from,

00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:13.180
and how it is their governments can deliver for them,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.085
than whether or not the government

00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:18.025
was elected by democracy.

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:20.114
The fact of the matter

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:22.579
is that this has become a very poignant question

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:24.912
because there is for the first time in a long time

00:04:24.912 --> 00:04:28.482
a real challenge to the Western ideological systems

00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:30.636
of politics and economics,

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.709
and this is a system that is embodied by China.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:37.671
And rather than have private capitalism,
they have state capitalism.

00:04:37.687 --> 00:04:41.959
Instead of liberal democracy,
they have de-prioritized the democratic system.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:44.323
And they have also decided to prioritize

00:04:44.323 --> 00:04:47.980
economic rights over political rights.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.829
I put it to you today that it is this system

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:52.674
that is embodied by China

00:04:52.674 --> 00:04:54.634
that is gathering momentum amongst people

00:04:54.634 --> 00:04:57.722
in the emerging markets as the system to follow,

00:04:57.722 --> 00:04:59.742
because they believe increasingly

00:04:59.742 --> 00:05:01.417
that it is the system

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.818
that will promise the best and fastest improvements

00:05:04.818 --> 00:05:08.429
in living standards in the shortest period of time.

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:11.008
If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments

00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:12.830
explaining to you first

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.860
why economically they've come to this belief.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.686
First of all, it's China's economic performance

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.728
over the past 30 years.

00:05:21.728 --> 00:05:24.448
She's been able to produce record economic growth

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:28.083
and meaningfully move many people out of poverty,

00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:31.262
specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:34.076
by moving over 300 million people

00:05:34.076 --> 00:05:37.334
out of indigence.

00:05:37.334 --> 00:05:39.848
It's not just in economics,

00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:42.345
but it's also in terms of living standards.

00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:45.189
We see that in China, 28 percent of people

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.012
had secondary school access.

00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:49.389
Today, it's closer to 82 percent.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.984
So in its totality, economic improvement

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:54.680
has been quite significant.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.716
Second, China has been able

00:05:57.716 --> 00:06:00.852
to meaningfully improve its income inequality

00:06:00.852 --> 00:06:03.517
without changing the political construct.

00:06:03.517 --> 00:06:05.947
Today, the United States and China

00:06:05.947 --> 00:06:08.473
are the two leading economies in the world.

00:06:08.473 --> 00:06:10.722
They have vastly different political systems

00:06:10.722 --> 00:06:13.044
and different economic systems,

00:06:13.044 --> 00:06:14.514
one with private capitalism,

00:06:14.514 --> 00:06:16.953
another one broadly with state capitalism.

00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:19.026
However, these two countries

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:21.133
have the identical GINI Coefficient,

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:23.680
which is a measure of income equality.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.912
Perhaps what is more disturbing

00:06:25.912 --> 00:06:28.006
is that China's income equality

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:30.327
has been improving in recent times,

00:06:30.327 --> 00:06:31.944
whereas that of the United States

00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:35.007
has been declining.

00:06:35.007 --> 00:06:37.563
Thirdly, people in the emerging markets

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.957
look at China's amazing and legendary

00:06:39.957 --> 00:06:42.283
infrastructure rollout.

00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:43.942
This is not just about China

00:06:43.942 --> 00:06:46.302
building roads and ports and railways

00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:47.738
in her own country --

00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:50.826
she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers

00:06:50.826 --> 00:06:52.417
of road network in China

00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:55.365
and surpass that of the United States --

00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:58.176
but even if you look to places like Africa,

00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:01.233
China has been able to help tar the distance

00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:02.887
of Cape Town to Cairo,

00:07:02.887 --> 00:07:04.512
which is 9,000 miles,

00:07:04.512 --> 00:07:08.423
or three times the distance of New York to California.

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:12.863
Now this is something that people can see and point to.

00:07:12.863 --> 00:07:14.545
Perhaps it's no surprise

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:18.266
that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.134
Africans in 10 countries said

00:07:20.134 --> 00:07:21.802
they thought that the Chinese were doing

00:07:21.802 --> 00:07:23.696
amazing things to improve their livelihoods

00:07:23.696 --> 00:07:28.194
by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.

00:07:28.194 --> 00:07:32.714
Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions

00:07:32.714 --> 00:07:36.085
to age-old social problems that the world faces.

00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:39.353
If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,

00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:42.605
you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics

00:07:42.605 --> 00:07:44.832
continue to be a stumbling block

00:07:44.832 --> 00:07:46.933
to the delivery of medicine and healthcare

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:48.803
in the rural areas.

00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:51.681
However, through a network of state-owned enterprises,

00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.577
the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,

00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:56.067
using their companies

00:07:56.067 --> 00:07:59.339
to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:01.545
Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:04.795
that around the world, people are pointing
at what China is doing and saying,

00:08:04.795 --> 00:08:06.937
"I like that. I want that.

00:08:06.937 --> 00:08:09.131
I want to be able to do what China's doing.

00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:11.901
That is the system that seems to work."

00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:13.574
I'm here to also tell you

00:08:13.574 --> 00:08:15.321
that there are lots of shifts occurring

00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:17.281
around what China is doing

00:08:17.281 --> 00:08:19.356
in the democratic stance.

00:08:19.356 --> 00:08:22.021
In particular, there is growing doubt

00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:24.123
among people in the emerging markets,

00:08:24.123 --> 00:08:25.830
when people now believe that democracy

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.114
is no longer to be viewed

00:08:28.114 --> 00:08:31.597
as a prerequisite for economic growth.

00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:35.838
In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,

00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:38.746
not just China, have shown that actually,

00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:41.432
it's economic growth that is a prerequisite

00:08:41.432 --> 00:08:43.196
for democracy.

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:46.442
In a recent study, the evidence has shown

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:48.940
that income is the greatest determinant

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.688
of how long a democracy can last.

00:08:51.688 --> 00:08:54.421
The study found that if your per capita income

00:08:54.421 --> 00:08:56.633
is about 1,000 dollars a year,

00:08:56.633 --> 00:08:59.631
your democracy will last about eight and a half years.

00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:01.349
If your per capita income is between

00:09:01.349 --> 00:09:03.749
2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,

00:09:03.749 --> 00:09:06.791
then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.

00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:08.615
And only if your per capita income

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.746
is above 6,000 dollars a year

00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:14.490
will you have democracy come hell or high water.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.202
What this is telling us

00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:18.775
is that we need to first establish a middle class

00:09:18.775 --> 00:09:21.892
that is able to hold the government accountable.

00:09:21.892 --> 00:09:24.267
But perhaps it's also telling us

00:09:24.267 --> 00:09:25.849
that we should be worried about going

00:09:25.849 --> 00:09:28.759
around the world and shoehorning democracy,

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:30.569
because ultimately we run the risk

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:32.699
of ending up with illiberal democracies,

00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:34.760
democracies that in some sense

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.927
could be worse than the authoritarian governments

00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:40.614
that they seek to replace.

00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:42.880
The evidence around illiberal democracies

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.700
is quite depressing.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.146
Freedom House finds that although 50 percent

00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:50.303
of the world's countries today are democratic,

00:09:50.303 --> 00:09:53.009
70 percent of those countries are illiberal

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.362
in the sense that people don't have free speech

00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:58.107
or freedom of movement.

00:09:58.107 --> 00:10:00.426
But also, we're finding from Freedom House

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:02.547
in a study that they published last year

00:10:02.547 --> 00:10:04.662
that freedom has been on the decline

00:10:04.662 --> 00:10:07.234
every year for the past seven years.

00:10:07.234 --> 00:10:09.018
What this says

00:10:09.018 --> 00:10:10.356
is that for people like me

00:10:10.356 --> 00:10:12.966
who care about liberal democracy,

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:15.313
is we've got to find a more sustainable way

00:10:15.313 --> 00:10:17.658
of ensuring that we have a sustainable form

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.859
of democracy in a liberal way,

00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:22.859
and that has its roots in economics.

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:25.788
But it also says that as China moves

00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:28.320
toward being the largest economy in the world,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.341
something that is expected to happen

00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:32.416
by experts in 2016,

00:10:32.416 --> 00:10:34.686
that this schism between the political

00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:38.048
and economic ideologies of the West and the rest

00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:40.979
is likely to widen.

00:10:40.979 --> 00:10:43.534
What might that world look like?

00:10:43.534 --> 00:10:45.096
Well, the world could look like

00:10:45.096 --> 00:10:48.361
more state involvement and state capitalism;

00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:51.200
greater protectionisms of nation-states;

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.709
but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:55.876
ever-declining political rights

00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:57.937
and individual rights.

00:10:57.937 --> 00:11:00.699
The question that is left for us in general

00:11:00.699 --> 00:11:03.815
is, what then should the West be doing?

00:11:03.815 --> 00:11:06.520
And I suggest that they have two options.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.937
The West can either compete or cooperate.

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:14.125
If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:16.132
and in effect go around the world

00:11:16.132 --> 00:11:18.459
and continue to try and push an agenda

00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:21.499
of private capitalism and liberal democracy,

00:11:21.499 --> 00:11:24.155
this is basically going against headwinds,

00:11:24.155 --> 00:11:26.179
but it also would be a natural stance

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:27.640
for the West to take

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.673
because in many ways it is the antithesis

00:11:29.673 --> 00:11:31.820
of the Chinese model

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.948
of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.

00:11:35.948 --> 00:11:37.727
Now the fact of the matter is,

00:11:37.727 --> 00:11:39.685
if the West decides to compete,

00:11:39.685 --> 00:11:43.083
it will create a wider schism.

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:45.936
The other option is for the West to cooperate,

00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:47.530
and by cooperating I mean

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.040
giving the emerging market countries the flexibility

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.087
to figure out in an organic way

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:54.849
what political and economic system

00:11:54.849 --> 00:11:56.542
works best for them.

00:11:56.542 --> 00:11:58.272
Now I'm sure some of you in the room

00:11:58.272 --> 00:12:01.146
will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,

00:12:01.146 --> 00:12:03.217
and this is a way, in other words,

00:12:03.217 --> 00:12:05.129
for the West to take a back seat.

00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:06.584
But I put it to you

00:12:06.584 --> 00:12:08.934
that if the United States and European countries

00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:11.585
want to remain globally influential,

00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:13.455
they may have to consider cooperating

00:12:13.455 --> 00:12:16.004
in the short term in order to compete,

00:12:16.004 --> 00:12:18.247
and by that, they might have to focus

00:12:18.247 --> 00:12:21.482
more aggressively on economic outcomes

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:23.191
to help create the middle class

00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:25.862
and therefore be able to hold government accountable

00:12:25.862 --> 00:12:29.889
and create the democracies that we really want.

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:32.478
The fact of the matter is that

00:12:32.478 --> 00:12:34.381
instead of going around the world

00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:37.868
and haranguing countries for engaging with China,

00:12:37.868 --> 00:12:40.828
the West should be encouraging its own businesses

00:12:40.828 --> 00:12:43.327
to trade and invest in these regions.

00:12:43.327 --> 00:12:47.579
Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior,

00:12:47.579 --> 00:12:50.179
the West should be showing how it is

00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:52.566
that their own system of politics and economics

00:12:52.566 --> 00:12:54.716
is the superior one.

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:56.736
And instead of shoehorning democracy

00:12:56.736 --> 00:12:58.227
around the world,

00:12:58.227 --> 00:12:59.502
perhaps the West should take a leaf

00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:01.354
out of its own history book

00:13:01.354 --> 00:13:04.204
and remember that it takes a lot of patience

00:13:04.204 --> 00:13:05.774
in order to develop the models

00:13:05.774 --> 00:13:08.107
and the systems that you have today.

00:13:08.107 --> 00:13:11.579
Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:14.208
reminds us that it took the United States

00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:16.854
nearly 170 years

00:13:16.854 --> 00:13:19.523
from the time that the Constitution was written

00:13:19.523 --> 00:13:22.483
for there to be equal rights in the United States.

00:13:22.483 --> 00:13:23.845
Some people would argue that today

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.359
there is still no equal rights.

00:13:25.359 --> 00:13:27.205
In fact, there are groups who would argue

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:32.533
that they still do not have equal rights under the law.

00:13:32.533 --> 00:13:34.115
At its very best,

00:13:34.115 --> 00:13:36.367
the Western model speaks for itself.

00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:38.528
It's the model that put food on the table.

00:13:38.528 --> 00:13:40.119
It's the refrigerators.

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:42.151
It put a man on the moon.

00:13:42.151 --> 00:13:43.941
But the fact of the matter is,

00:13:43.941 --> 00:13:45.591
although people back in the day

00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:47.657
used to point at the Western countries and say,

00:13:47.657 --> 00:13:49.700
"I want that, I like that,"

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.859
there's now a new person in town

00:13:51.859 --> 00:13:54.298
in the form of a country, China.

00:13:54.298 --> 00:13:56.384
Today, generations are looking at China

00:13:56.384 --> 00:13:59.024
and saying, "China can produce infrastructure,

00:13:59.024 --> 00:14:01.140
China can produce economic growth,

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.708
and we like that."

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:05.422
Because ultimately, the question before us,

00:14:05.422 --> 00:14:07.278
and the question before

00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:08.983
seven billion people on the planet

00:14:08.983 --> 00:14:12.083
is, how can we create prosperity?

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:14.998
People who care and will pivot towards the model

00:14:14.998 --> 00:14:16.523
of politics and economics

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.090
in a very rational way,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.555
to those models that will ensure

00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:22.536
that they can have better living standards

00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:25.159
in the shortest period of time.

00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:26.870
As you leave here today,

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.275
I would like to leave you

00:14:28.275 --> 00:14:29.928
with a very personal message,

00:14:29.928 --> 00:14:32.014
which is what it is that I believe

00:14:32.014 --> 00:14:34.418
we should be doing as individuals,

00:14:34.418 --> 00:14:37.787
and this is really about being open-minded,

00:14:37.787 --> 00:14:41.126
open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams

00:14:41.126 --> 00:14:44.361
of creating prosperity for people around the world,

00:14:44.361 --> 00:14:47.285
creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty

00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:48.961
for hundreds of millions of people,

00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:51.745
has to be based in being open-minded,

00:14:51.745 --> 00:14:53.972
because these systems have good things

00:14:53.972 --> 00:14:56.449
and they have bad things.

00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:58.158
Just to illustrate,

00:14:58.158 --> 00:15:00.644
I went into my annals of myself.

00:15:00.644 --> 00:15:02.426
That's a picture of me.

00:15:02.426 --> 00:15:04.666
Awww. (Laughter)

00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:08.892
I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.

00:15:08.892 --> 00:15:10.839
At the time of my birth,

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:12.921
blacks were not issued birth certificates,

00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:15.265
and that law only changed in 1973.

00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:18.410
This is an affidavit from the Zambian government.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.862
I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years,

00:15:20.862 --> 00:15:23.747
I've gone from not being recognized as a human being

00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:26.694
to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today

00:15:26.694 --> 00:15:29.272
to talk to you about my views.

00:15:29.272 --> 00:15:32.996
In this vein, we can increase economic growth.

00:15:32.996 --> 00:15:36.413
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.

00:15:36.413 --> 00:15:38.614
But also, it's going to require

00:15:38.614 --> 00:15:40.608
that we look at our assumptions,

00:15:40.608 --> 00:15:42.835
assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with

00:15:42.835 --> 00:15:44.814
around democracy, around private capitalism,

00:15:44.814 --> 00:15:46.749
around what creates economic growth

00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:49.381
and reduces poverty and creates freedoms.

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.258
We might have to tear those books up

00:15:51.258 --> 00:15:53.829
and start to look at other options

00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:56.686
and be open-minded to seek the truth.

00:15:56.686 --> 00:15:58.933
Ultimately, it's about transforming the world

00:15:58.933 --> 00:16:00.619
and making it a better place.

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:02.837
Thank you very much.

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:06.437
(Applause)
