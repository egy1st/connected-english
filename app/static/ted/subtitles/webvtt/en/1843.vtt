WEBVTT

00:00:01.228 --> 00:00:05.518
So I'm a city planner, an urban designer,

00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:07.590
former arts advocate,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.383
trained in architecture and art history,

00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:14.517
and I want to talk to you today not about design

00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:16.953
but about America

00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:21.158
and how America can be more economically resilient,

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:23.483
how America can be healthier,

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:25.136
and how America can be

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:27.754
more environmentally sustainable.

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:30.172
And I realize this is a global forum,

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:32.241
but I think I need to talk about America

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.824
because there is a history,

00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:35.511
in some places, not all,

00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.961
of American ideas being appropriated,

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.493
being emulated, for better or for worse,

00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:41.834
around the world.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:43.985
And the worst idea we've ever had

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:46.352
is suburban sprawl.

00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:49.723
It's being emulated in many places as we speak.

00:00:49.723 --> 00:00:52.386
By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.790
of the landscape and the creation of the landscape

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.126
around the requirement of automobile use,

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.769
and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.520
has become a gas-belching,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.120
time-wasting and life-threatening

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.553
prosthetic device

00:01:09.553 --> 00:01:11.189
that many of us need just to,

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.777
most Americans, in fact, need,

00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:15.097
just to live their daily lives.

00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:16.681
And there's an alternative.

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.269
You know, we say, half the world is living in cities.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.210
Well, in America, that living in cities,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.868
for many of them, they're living in cities still

00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:24.134
where they're dependent on that automobile.

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:27.113
And what I work for, and to do,

00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:29.799
is to make our cities more walkable.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.322
But I can't give design arguments for that

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:34.011
that will have as much impact

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.927
as the arguments that I've learned

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:39.444
from the economists, the epidemiologists

00:01:39.444 --> 00:01:41.160
and the environmentalists.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.421
So these are the three arguments that I'm going

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.532
to give you quickly today.

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:47.016
When I was growing up in the '70s,

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:50.651
the typical American spent one tenth of their income,

00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:53.890
American family, on transportation.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.475
Since then, we've doubled the number of roads

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:59.252
in America, and we now spend one fifth

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.913
of our income on transportation.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.974
Working families, which are defined as

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:05.898
earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars

00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:07.857
a year in America

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:10.361
are spending more now on transportation

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.599
than on housing, slightly more,

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.832
because of this phenomenon called "drive till you qualify,"

00:02:15.832 --> 00:02:18.250
finding homes further and further and further

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.177
from the city centers and from their jobs,

00:02:21.177 --> 00:02:23.702
so that they're locked in this, two, three hours,

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:25.899
four hours a day of commuting.

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.373
And these are the neighborhoods, for example,

00:02:27.373 --> 00:02:29.795
in the Central Valley of California

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.902
that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.124
and when the price of gas went up;

00:02:35.124 --> 00:02:37.392
they were decimated.

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:38.658
And in fact, these are many

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.261
of the half-vacant communities that you see today.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:44.442
Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:46.515
it goes underwater, and you have to pay

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:50.380
twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.100
So we know what it's done to our society

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.431
and all the extra work we have to do

00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:57.200
to support our cars.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.932
What happens when a city decides

00:02:58.932 --> 00:03:01.206
it's going to set other priorities?

00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:03.178
And probably the best example we have here

00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:05.589
in America is Portland, Oregon.

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.928
Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s

00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:10.626
that began to distinguish it

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:13.162
from almost every other American city.

00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:15.280
While most other cities were growing

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.415
an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,

00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:21.090
they instituted an urban growth boundary.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.260
While most cities were reaming out their roads,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.505
removing parallel parking and trees

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.706
in order to flow more traffic,

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:31.439
they instituted a skinny streets program.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.353
And while most cities were investing in more roads

00:03:35.353 --> 00:03:38.262
and more highways, they actually invested

00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:40.739
in bicycling and in walking.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.804
And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,

00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:46.237
which seems like a lot of money,

00:03:46.237 --> 00:03:48.753
but it was spent over about 30 years,

00:03:48.753 --> 00:03:51.122
so two million dollars a year -- not that much --

00:03:51.122 --> 00:03:53.447
and half the price of the one cloverleaf

00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:56.266
that they decided to rebuild in that city.

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.235
These changes and others like them changed

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:00.197
the way that Portlanders live,

00:04:00.197 --> 00:04:02.358
and their vehicle-miles traveled per day,

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:03.917
the amount that each person drives,

00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:06.230
actually peaked in 1996,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.331
has been dropping ever since,

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.395
and they now drive 20 percent less

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:11.828
than the rest of the country.

00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:14.584
The typical Portland citizen drives

00:04:14.584 --> 00:04:18.552
four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day

00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:20.874
than they did before.

00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:22.861
The economist Joe Cortright did the math

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.379
and he found out that those four miles

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:25.811
plus those 11 minutes

00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:27.733
adds up to fully three and a half percent

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:30.263
of all income earned in the region.

00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:32.139
So if they're not spending that money on driving --

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.752
and by the way, 85 percent of the money

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:36.346
we spend on driving leaves the local economy --

00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:38.221
if they're not spending that money on driving,

00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:39.992
what are they spending it on?

00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:41.669
Well, Portland is reputed to have

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.591
the most roof racks per capita,

00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.431
the most independent bookstores per capita,

00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:50.675
the most strip clubs per capita.

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:53.311
These are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations

00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:54.950
of a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.148
spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds

00:04:58.148 --> 00:05:00.174
than the rest of America.

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:02.489
Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:03.829
than most other states,

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:05.394
which may be a good thing or a bad thing,

00:05:05.394 --> 00:05:07.393
but it makes you glad they're driving less.

00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:09.766
(Laughter)

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.102
But actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,

00:05:13.102 --> 00:05:15.645
and home investment is about as local

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.783
an investment as you can get.

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:19.194
But there's a whole other Portland story,

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.739
which isn't part of this calculus,

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:23.626
which is that young, educated people

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:26.078
have been moving to Portland in droves,

00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:28.596
so that between the last two censuses,

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.878
they had a 50-percent increase

00:05:30.878 --> 00:05:32.742
in college-educated millennials,

00:05:32.742 --> 00:05:34.926
which is five times what you saw anywhere else

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:38.202
in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.

00:05:38.202 --> 00:05:42.515
So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents

00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:45.095
by being more walkable and more bikeable,

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.930
but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.748
that people want to be in these days.

00:05:50.748 --> 00:05:52.141
So the best economic strategy

00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:53.544
you can have as a city

00:05:53.544 --> 00:05:57.258
is not the old way of trying to attract corporations

00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:59.590
and trying to have a biotech cluster

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.684
or a medical cluster,

00:06:01.684 --> 00:06:03.093
or an aerospace cluster,

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:06.193
but to become a place where people want to be.

00:06:06.193 --> 00:06:09.671
And millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,

00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:12.512
64 percent of whom decide first

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:13.791
where they want to live,

00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.807
then they move there, then they look for a job,

00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:18.752
they will come to your city.

00:06:18.752 --> 00:06:21.613
The health argument is a scary one,

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:24.107
and you've probably heard part of this argument before.

00:06:24.107 --> 00:06:27.074
Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:30.184
back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.

00:06:30.184 --> 00:06:33.783
Now one out of three Americans is obese,

00:06:33.783 --> 00:06:37.650
and a second third of the population is overweight.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.529
Twenty-five percent of young men

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.450
and 40 percent of young women are too heavy

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.101
to enlist in our own military forces.

00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:47.479
According to the Center for Disease Control,

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.276
fully one third of all children born after 2000

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:52.976
will get diabetes.

00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:54.949
We have the first generation of children in America

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.819
who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.030
I believe that this American healthcare crisis

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.468
that we've all heard about

00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:05.084
is an urban design crisis,

00:07:05.084 --> 00:07:07.896
and that the design of our cities lies at the cure.

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:10.461
Because we've talked a long time about diet,

00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:13.215
and we know that diet impacts weight,

00:07:13.215 --> 00:07:15.527
and weight of course impacts health.

00:07:15.527 --> 00:07:18.298
But we've only started talking about inactivity,

00:07:18.298 --> 00:07:21.490
and how inactivity born of our landscape,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.820
inactivity that comes from the fact that we live

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.689
in a place where there is no longer any such thing

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:29.285
as a useful walk, is driving our weight up.

00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:30.859
And we finally have the studies,

00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:33.545
one in Britain called "Gluttony versus sloth"

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:36.246
that tracked weight against diet

00:07:36.246 --> 00:07:38.151
and tracked weight against inactivity,

00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.854
and found a much higher, stronger correlation

00:07:40.854 --> 00:07:42.902
between the latter two.

00:07:42.902 --> 00:07:44.919
Dr. James Levine at, in this case,

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:47.112
the aptly-named Mayo Clinic

00:07:47.112 --> 00:07:51.651
put his test subjects in electronic underwear,

00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:53.644
held their diet steady,

00:07:53.644 --> 00:07:55.648
and then started pumping the calories in.

00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:57.145
Some people gained weight,

00:07:57.145 --> 00:07:58.522
some people didn't gain weight.

00:07:58.522 --> 00:08:01.988
Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,

00:08:01.988 --> 00:08:03.692
they were shocked to learn that the only difference

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.574
between the subjects that they could figure out

00:08:05.574 --> 00:08:07.458
was the amount they were moving,

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:09.098
and that in fact those who gained weight

00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:12.850
were sitting, on average, two hours more per day

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.166
than those who didn't.

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.109
So we have these studies that tie

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:18.423
weight to inactivity, but even more,

00:08:18.423 --> 00:08:20.938
we now have studies that tie weight to where you live.

00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:22.571
Do you live in a more walkable city

00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:24.007
or do you live in a less walkable city,

00:08:24.007 --> 00:08:25.931
or where in your city do you live?

00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:28.596
In San Diego, they used Walk Score --

00:08:28.596 --> 00:08:30.953
Walk Score rates every address in America

00:08:30.953 --> 00:08:32.592
and soon the world

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.981
in terms of how walkable it is --

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.864
they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods

00:08:37.864 --> 00:08:39.557
and less walkable neighborhoods.

00:08:39.557 --> 00:08:42.359
Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,

00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:44.630
you were 35 percent likely to be overweight.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.953
If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,

00:08:46.953 --> 00:08:49.160
you were 60 percent likely to be overweight.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.998
So we have study after study now

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:53.053
that's tying where you live

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:55.440
to your health, particularly as in America,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.570
the biggest health crisis we have is this one

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.294
that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.

00:09:02.294 --> 00:09:04.017
And I learned a new word last week.

00:09:04.017 --> 00:09:07.647
They call these neighborhoods "obesageneric."

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:10.878
I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.

00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:12.645
Now that's one thing, of course.

00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:15.120
Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.247
in this country.

00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:17.905
You probably haven't thought that much about it.

00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:20.626
Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma,

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:23.531
three times what it was in the '90s,

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:26.422
and it's almost all coming from car exhaust.

00:09:26.422 --> 00:09:28.434
American pollution does not come

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:30.742
from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,

00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:32.999
and the amount that people are driving in your city,

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:35.447
your urban VMT, is a good prediction

00:09:35.447 --> 00:09:37.949
of the asthma problems in your city.

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:40.164
And then finally, in terms of driving,

00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:43.070
there's the issue of the single-largest killer

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.712
of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:47.806
of all people, is car crashes.

00:09:47.806 --> 00:09:49.308
And we take car crashes for granted.

00:09:49.308 --> 00:09:51.143
We figure it's a natural risk

00:09:51.143 --> 00:09:52.725
of being on the road.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.898
But in fact, here in America, 12 people

00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:57.254
out of every 100,000

00:09:57.254 --> 00:09:59.352
die every year from car crashes.

00:09:59.352 --> 00:10:00.821
We're pretty safe here.

00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:03.207
Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.

00:10:03.207 --> 00:10:05.045
It's Japan, it's four per 100,000.

00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:07.614
Do you know where it's three per 100,000?

00:10:07.614 --> 00:10:09.339
New York City.

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:11.995
San Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.

00:10:11.995 --> 00:10:14.055
Oh, so cities make us safer

00:10:14.055 --> 00:10:16.224
because we're driving less?

00:10:16.224 --> 00:10:18.643
Tulsa: 14 per 100,000.

00:10:18.643 --> 00:10:21.884
Orlando: 20 per 100,000.

00:10:21.884 --> 00:10:23.601
It's not whether you're in the city or not,

00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:25.287
it's how is your city designed?

00:10:25.287 --> 00:10:29.119
Was it designed around cars or around people?

00:10:29.119 --> 00:10:30.889
Because if your city is designed around cars,

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:35.748
it's really good at smashing them into each other.

00:10:35.748 --> 00:10:39.483
That's part of a much larger health argument.

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:41.752
Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating,

00:10:41.752 --> 00:10:43.993
because the environmentalists turned on a dime

00:10:43.993 --> 00:10:45.512
about 10 years ago.

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:46.988
The environmental movement in America

00:10:46.988 --> 00:10:50.016
has historically been an anti-city movement

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.527
from Jefferson on.

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:53.882
"Cities are pestilential to the health,

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:55.873
to the liberties, to the morals of man.

00:10:55.873 --> 00:10:57.983
If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,

00:10:57.983 --> 00:10:59.899
as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:01.314
as they are in Europe

00:11:01.314 --> 00:11:03.976
and take to eating one another as they do there."

00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:06.707
He apparently had a sense of humor.

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.760
And then the American environmental movement

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.870
has been a classically Arcadian movement.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.983
To become more environmental, we move into the country,

00:11:12.983 --> 00:11:15.651
we commune with nature, we build suburbs.

00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:19.674
But, of course, we've seen what that does.

00:11:19.674 --> 00:11:21.880
The carbon mapping of America,

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.767
where is the CO2 being emitted,

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.696
for many years only

00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:28.223
hammered this argument in more strongly.

00:11:28.223 --> 00:11:31.064
If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,

00:11:31.064 --> 00:11:32.579
any carbon map of the U.S.,

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:35.722
it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,

00:11:35.722 --> 00:11:38.178
hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,

00:11:38.178 --> 00:11:41.746
dark, peaceful in the countryside.

00:11:41.746 --> 00:11:43.685
Until some economists said, you know,

00:11:43.685 --> 00:11:46.131
is that the right way to measure CO2?

00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:48.117
There are only so many people in this country at any given time,

00:11:48.117 --> 00:11:50.204
and we can choose to live where perhaps

00:11:50.204 --> 00:11:51.843
we would have a lighter impact.

00:11:51.843 --> 00:11:54.636
And they said, let's measure CO2 per household,

00:11:54.636 --> 00:11:57.240
and when they did that, the maps just flipped,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.259
coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:02.935
and red hot in these exurban

00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:05.707
"drive till you qualify" neighborhoods.

00:12:05.707 --> 00:12:07.660
So a fundamental shift, and now you have

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.424
environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser

00:12:10.424 --> 00:12:12.991
saying we are a destructive species.

00:12:12.991 --> 00:12:15.157
If you love nature, the best thing you can do

00:12:15.157 --> 00:12:17.425
is stay the heck away from it,

00:12:17.425 --> 00:12:19.979
move to a city, and the denser the better,

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:22.483
and the denser cities like Manhattan

00:12:22.483 --> 00:12:24.819
are the cities that perform the best.

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:28.968
So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline

00:12:28.968 --> 00:12:33.284
at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,

00:12:33.284 --> 00:12:36.758
consuming half of the electricity of Dallas.

00:12:36.758 --> 00:12:38.760
But of course, we can do better.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.872
Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.

00:12:41.872 --> 00:12:45.966
European cities consume half as much again.

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:48.162
So obviously, we can do better,

00:12:48.162 --> 00:12:51.531
and we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.

00:12:51.531 --> 00:12:53.977
My final argument in this topic is that

00:12:53.977 --> 00:12:57.631
I think we're trying to be green the wrong way,

00:12:57.631 --> 00:12:59.807
and I'm one of many people who believes that

00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:02.879
this focus on gadgets,

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:05.570
on accessorizing --

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.589
What can I add to my house,

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.701
what can I add to what I've already got

00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:12.164
to make my lifestyle more sustainable? --

00:13:12.164 --> 00:13:14.105
has kind of dominated the discussion.

00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:15.959
So I'm not immune to this.

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:17.494
My wife and I built a new house

00:13:17.494 --> 00:13:20.493
on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,

00:13:20.493 --> 00:13:22.595
and we did our best to clear the shelves

00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:24.650
of the sustainability store.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.885
We've got the solar photovoltaic system,

00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:29.334
solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,

00:13:29.334 --> 00:13:31.242
bamboo floors.

00:13:31.242 --> 00:13:34.614
A log burning in my German high-tech stove

00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:37.303
apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon

00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:38.984
to the atmosphere than were it left alone

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.096
to decompose in the forest.

00:13:41.096 --> 00:13:43.876
Yet all of these innovations --

00:13:43.876 --> 00:13:45.763
That's what they said in the brochure.

00:13:45.763 --> 00:13:46.991
(Laughter)

00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:49.131
All of these innovations together

00:13:49.131 --> 00:13:52.215
contribute a fraction of what we contribute

00:13:52.215 --> 00:13:54.120
by living in a walkable neighborhood

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.891
three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.

00:13:57.891 --> 00:14:00.090
We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.440
and you should do the same thing,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.820
but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.452
saves as much energy in a year

00:14:05.452 --> 00:14:08.386
as moving to a walkable city does in a week.

00:14:08.386 --> 00:14:09.735
And we don't want to have this argument.

00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:11.943
Politicians and marketers are afraid

00:14:11.943 --> 00:14:15.676
of marketing green as a "lifestyle choice."

00:14:15.676 --> 00:14:18.593
You don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,

00:14:18.593 --> 00:14:20.454
that they have to change their lifestyle.

00:14:20.454 --> 00:14:23.618
But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life

00:14:23.618 --> 00:14:26.135
and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,

00:14:26.135 --> 00:14:29.466
something that would be better than what we have right now?

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:31.977
Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,

00:14:31.977 --> 00:14:33.966
it's called the Mercer Survey.

00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:35.166
You may have heard of it.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:38.348
They rank hundreds of nations worldwide

00:14:38.348 --> 00:14:40.761
according to 10 criteria that they believe add up

00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:45.860
to quality of life: health, economics, education,

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.162
housing, you name it.

00:14:49.162 --> 00:14:51.550
There's six more. Short talk.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.339
(Laughter)

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:55.986
And it's very interesting to see that

00:14:55.986 --> 00:14:58.275
the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu,

00:14:58.275 --> 00:15:02.037
number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects

00:15:02.037 --> 00:15:05.976
of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities.

00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:07.698
The driving cities in the Sun Belt,

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.867
the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta,

00:15:10.867 --> 00:15:14.019
these cities are not appearing on the list.

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:15.837
But who's doing even better?

00:15:15.837 --> 00:15:18.173
The Canadian cities like Vancouver,

00:15:18.173 --> 00:15:20.497
where again, they're burning half the fuel.

00:15:20.497 --> 00:15:23.308
And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German,

00:15:23.308 --> 00:15:25.240
like Dusseldorf or Vienna,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.670
where they're burning, again, half as much fuel.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.525
And you see this alignment, this strange alignment.

00:15:30.525 --> 00:15:32.413
Is being more sustainble

00:15:32.413 --> 00:15:34.841
what gives you a higher quality of life?

00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:37.478
I would argue the same thing

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:39.459
that makes you more sustainble

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:41.509
is what gives you a higher quality of life,

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:44.500
and that's living in a walkable neighborhood.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.979
So sustainability, which includes our wealth

00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:50.753
and our health

00:15:50.753 --> 00:15:55.205
may not be a direct function of our sustainability.

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.662
But particularly here in America,

00:15:57.662 --> 00:16:00.103
we are polluting so much

00:16:00.103 --> 00:16:02.779
because we're throwing away our time

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:05.353
and our money and our lives on the highway,

00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:07.577
then these two problems would seem to share

00:16:07.577 --> 00:16:10.211
the same solution, which is to make our cities

00:16:10.211 --> 00:16:11.554
more walkable.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:14.201
Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done,

00:16:14.201 --> 00:16:15.629
it has been done,

00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:18.193
and it's being done now in more than a few cities,

00:16:18.193 --> 00:16:20.729
around the globe and in our country.

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:23.791
I take some solace from Winston Churchill,

00:16:23.791 --> 00:16:25.161
who put it this way:

00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:26.939
"The Americans can be counted on

00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:28.214
to do the right thing

00:16:28.214 --> 00:16:30.963
once they have exhausted the alternatives." (Laughter)

00:16:30.963 --> 00:16:32.959
Thank you.

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:39.317
(Applause)
