00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.161
As humans, it's in our nature

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.455
to want to improve our health 
and minimize our suffering.

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:07.122
Whatever life throws at us,

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:09.587
whether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,

00:00:09.587 --> 00:00:12.779
or even broken bones, we want to try and get better.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.262
Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab,

00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:18.002
and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.470
have used materials in really creative ways

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.214
in the body over time.

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:26.860
Take, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.742
This was actually used by the Mayans

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:32.281
as an artificial tooth replacement.

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:33.914
We're not quite sure why they did it.

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:36.490
It's hard. It's durable.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.608
But it also had other very nice properties.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.888
In fact, when they put it into the jawbone,

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:45.795
it could integrate into the jaw,

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.893
and we know now with very sophisticated

00:00:47.893 --> 00:00:49.566
imaging technologies

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.915
that part of that integration comes from the fact

00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:53.602
that this material is designed

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:56.421
in a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry,

00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:58.649
has a beautiful architecture.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.401
And I think in many ways we can sort of think

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:03.408
of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:04.928
as the first real application

00:01:04.928 --> 00:01:07.223
of the bluetooth technology.

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:08.685
(Laughter)

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:13.078
But if we move on and think throughout history

00:01:13.078 --> 00:01:16.062
how people have used different 
materials in the body,

00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:17.776
very often it's been physicians

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.168
that have been quite creative.

00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:21.136
They've taken things off the shelf.

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:23.021
One of my favorite examples

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:26.278
is that of Sir Harold Ridley,

00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:28.416
who was a famous ophthalmologist,

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:30.984
or at least became a famous ophthalmologist.

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:32.911
And during World War II, what he would see

00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:35.763
would be pilots coming back from their missions,

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:37.515
and he noticed that within their eyes

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:40.455
they had shards of small bits of material

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:41.975
lodged within the eye,

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:43.674
but the very interesting thing about it

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:45.967
was that material, actually, wasn't causing

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:47.980
any inflammatory response.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.319
So he looked into this, and he figured out

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.923
that actually that material was little shards of plastic

00:01:52.923 --> 00:01:55.662
that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.

00:01:55.662 --> 00:01:58.063
And this led him to propose that material

00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:00.825
as a new material for intraocular lenses.

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:02.930
It's called PMMA, and it's now used

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.732
in millions of people every year

00:02:04.732 --> 00:02:07.501
and helps in preventing cataracts.

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:09.810
And that example, I think, is a really nice one,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.245
because it helps remind us that in the early days,

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:14.198
people often chose materials

00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:16.083
because they were bioinert.

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:19.595
Their very purpose was to 
perform a mechanical function.

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:21.045
You'd put them in the body

00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:23.209
and you wouldn't get an adverse response.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.877
And what I want to show you is that

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.258
in regenerative medicine,

00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:28.082
we've really shifted away from that idea

00:02:28.082 --> 00:02:29.995
of taking a bioinert material.

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:32.284
We're actually actively looking for materials

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:35.252
that will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,

00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:37.579
and that furthermore we can put in the body,

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.028
they'll have their function,

00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:43.578
and then they'll dissolve away over time.

00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:45.511
If we look at this schematic,

00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:47.112
this is showing you what we think of

00:02:47.112 --> 00:02:49.249
as the typical tissue-engineering approach.

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.093
We have cells there, typically from the patient.

00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:53.975
We can put those onto a material,

00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:56.683
and we can make that material 
very complex if we want to,

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:58.878
and we can then grow that up in the lab

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.393
or we can put it straight back into the patient.

00:03:01.393 --> 00:03:03.844
And this is an approach that's 
used all over the world,

00:03:03.844 --> 00:03:07.367
including in our lab.

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:09.824
But one of the things that's really important

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:11.702
when we're thinking about stem cells

00:03:11.702 --> 00:03:14.281
is that obviously stem cells 
can be many different things,

00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:16.045
and they want to be many different things,

00:03:16.045 --> 00:03:17.921
and so we want to make sure that the environment

00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.271
we put them into has enough information

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:22.267
so that they can become the right sort

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.953
of specialist tissue.

00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:28.016
And if we think about the different types of tissues

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:30.035
that people are looking at regenerating

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:32.346
all over the world, in all the 
different labs in the world,

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:35.282
there's pretty much every tissue you can think of.

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:36.904
And actually, the structure of those tissues

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:39.518
is quite different, and it's going to really depend

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:41.936
on whether your patient has any underlying disease,

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:44.986
other conditions, in terms of how

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:46.547
you're going to regenerate your tissue,

00:03:46.547 --> 00:03:48.532
and you're going to need to think about the materials

00:03:48.532 --> 00:03:50.586
you're going to use really carefully,

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:52.311
their biochemistry, their mechanics,

00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:56.049
and many other properties as well.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.349
Our tissues all have very 
different abilities to regenerate,

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.091
and here we see poor Prometheus,

00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:04.184
who made a rather tricky career choice

00:04:04.184 --> 00:04:07.118
and was punished by the Greek gods.

00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:09.439
He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.042
every day to eat his liver.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.309
But of course his liver would regenerate every day,

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.581
and so day after day he was punished

00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:21.378
for eternity by the gods.

00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:25.258
And liver will regenerate in this very nice way,

00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:27.034
but actually if we think of other tissues,

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.803
like cartilage, for example,

00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:30.859
even the simplest nick and you're going to find it

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:33.302
really difficult to regenerate your cartilage.

00:04:33.302 --> 00:04:36.416
So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:39.216
Now, bone is somewhere in between,

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:42.116
and this is one of the tissues 
that we work on a lot in our lab.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.100
And bone is actually quite good at repairing.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.113
It has to be. We've probably all had fractures

00:04:46.113 --> 00:04:47.925
at some point or other.

00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:50.082
And one of the ways that you can think

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.771
about repairing your fracture

00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:54.598
is this procedure here, called 
an iliac crest harvest.

00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:56.264
And what the surgeon might do

00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:59.459
is take some bone from your iliac crest,

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:00.837
which is just here,

00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:03.361
and then transplant that 
somewhere else in the body.

00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:04.961
And it actually works really well,

00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:06.460
because it's your own bone,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.694
and it's well vascularized,

00:05:07.694 --> 00:05:10.063
which means it's got a really good blood supply.

00:05:10.063 --> 00:05:12.846
But the problem is, there's
only so much you can take,

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:15.769
and also when you do that operation,

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:18.308
your patients might actually have significant pain

00:05:18.308 --> 00:05:21.549
in that defect site even two 
years after the operation.

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:23.435
So what we were thinking is,

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:26.584
there's a tremendous need 
for bone repair, of course,

00:05:26.584 --> 00:05:29.071
but this iliac crest-type approach

00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:31.503
really has a lot of limitations to it,

00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:33.737
and could we perhaps recreate

00:05:33.737 --> 00:05:35.906
the generation of bone within the body

00:05:35.906 --> 00:05:39.221
on demand and then be able to transplant it

00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:44.126
without these very, very painful aftereffects

00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:47.809
that you would have with the iliac crest harvest?

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:50.471
And so this is what we did, and the way we did it

00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:53.809
was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.196
but actually thinking about it rather differently.

00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:58.115
And we simplified it a lot,

00:05:58.115 --> 00:06:00.166
so we got rid of a lot of these steps.

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.540
We got rid of the need to 
harvest cells from the patient,

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.457
we got rid of the need to put 
in really fancy chemistries,

00:06:05.457 --> 00:06:07.149
and we got rid of the need

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:09.977
to culture these scaffolds in the lab.

00:06:09.977 --> 00:06:12.156
And what we really focused on

00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:15.905
was our material system and making it quite simple,

00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:18.230
but because we used it in a really clever way,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.877
we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone

00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:22.523
using this approach.

00:06:22.523 --> 00:06:24.276
So we were using the body

00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:26.396
as really the catalyst to help us

00:06:26.396 --> 00:06:28.939
to make lots of new bone.

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.522
And it's an approach that we call

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:33.333
the in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:35.819
enormous amounts of bone using this approach.

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.058
And I'll talk you through this.

00:06:37.058 --> 00:06:39.538
So what we do is,

00:06:39.538 --> 00:06:41.881
in humans, we all have a layer of stem cells

00:06:41.881 --> 00:06:43.769
on the outside of our long bones.

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.472
That layer is called the periosteum.

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:47.760
And that layer is actually normally

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.409
very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.841
and it's got stem cells in it.

00:06:51.841 --> 00:06:53.260
Those stem cells are really important

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.069
in the embryo when it develops,

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.311
and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture

00:06:57.311 --> 00:07:00.172
to help you with repairing the bone.

00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:02.265
So we take that periosteum layer

00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:05.255
and we developed a way to inject underneath it

00:07:05.255 --> 00:07:08.071
a liquid that then, within 30 seconds,

00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:09.816
would turn into quite a rigid gel

00:07:09.816 --> 00:07:13.069
and can actually lift the
periosteum away from the bone.

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:16.757
So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity

00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:20.304
that is right next to both the bone

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:24.005
but also this really rich layer of stem cells.

00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:25.617
And we go in through a pinhole incision

00:07:25.617 --> 00:07:28.570
so that no other cells from the body can get in,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.362
and what happens is that that
artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity

00:07:33.362 --> 00:07:36.038
can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:38.124
and they can form lots of new tissue,

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.442
and then over time, you can harvest that tissue

00:07:40.442 --> 00:07:43.390
and use it elsewhere in the body.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.534
This is a histology slide

00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:47.704
of what we see when we do that,

00:07:47.704 --> 00:07:50.221
and essentially what we see

00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:51.855
is very large amounts of bone.

00:07:51.855 --> 00:07:54.335
So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,

00:07:54.335 --> 00:07:55.836
so the bone marrow,

00:07:55.836 --> 00:07:57.640
then you can see the original bone,

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.496
and you can see where that original bone finishes,

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:03.007
and just to the left of that is the new bone

00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:05.044
that's grown within that bioreactor cavity,

00:08:05.044 --> 00:08:07.475
and you can actually make it even larger.

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:10.102
And that demarcation that you can see

00:08:10.102 --> 00:08:12.453
between the original bone and the new bone

00:08:12.453 --> 00:08:14.466
acts as a very slight point of weakness,

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:16.600
so actually now the surgeon can come along,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.624
can harvest away that new bone,

00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:20.827
and the periosteum can grow back,

00:08:20.827 --> 00:08:22.696
so you're left with the leg

00:08:22.696 --> 00:08:24.246
in the same sort of state

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:26.248
as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.


00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:30.097
So it's very, very low in terms of after-pain

00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:33.952
compared to an iliac crest harvest.

00:08:33.952 --> 00:08:36.056
And you can grow different amounts of bone

00:08:36.056 --> 00:08:38.075
depending on how much gel you put in there,

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:41.277
so it really is an on demand sort of procedure.

00:08:41.277 --> 00:08:43.479
Now, at the time that we did this,

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:46.816
this received a lot of attention in the press,

00:08:46.816 --> 00:08:49.247
because it was a really nice way

00:08:49.247 --> 00:08:50.713
of generating new bone,

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:52.708
and we got many, many contacts

00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:55.326
from different people that 
were interested in using this.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.115
And I'm just going to tell you,

00:08:57.115 --> 00:09:00.068
sometimes those contacts are very strange,

00:09:00.068 --> 00:09:01.928
slightly unexpected,

00:09:01.928 --> 00:09:04.990
and the very most interesting,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.275
let me put it that way, contact that I had,

00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:10.486
was actually from a team of American footballers

00:09:10.486 --> 00:09:13.866
that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls

00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:18.147
made on their head.

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:20.880
And so you do get these kinds of contacts,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.497
and of course, being British

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:25.251
and also growing up in France,

00:09:25.251 --> 00:09:27.393
I tend to be very blunt,

00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:29.434
and so I had to explain to them very nicely

00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:30.909
that in their particular case,

00:09:30.909 --> 00:09:32.923
there probably wasn't that much in there

00:09:32.923 --> 00:09:35.911
to protect in the first place.

00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:37.481
(Laughter)

00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:38.734
(Applause)

00:09:38.734 --> 00:09:40.589
So this was our approach,

00:09:40.589 --> 00:09:42.233
and it was simple materials,

00:09:42.233 --> 00:09:44.220
but we thought about it carefully.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.840
And actually we know that those cells

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.978
in the body, in the embryo, as they develop

00:09:47.978 --> 00:09:51.207
can form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,

00:09:51.207 --> 00:09:53.762
and so we developed a gel that was slightly different

00:09:53.762 --> 00:09:56.181
in nature and slightly different chemistry,

00:09:56.181 --> 00:09:58.328
put it in there, and we were able to get

00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:00.506
100 percent cartilage instead.

00:10:00.506 --> 00:10:02.514
And this approach works really well, I think,

00:10:02.514 --> 00:10:04.996
for pre-planned procedures,

00:10:04.996 --> 00:10:07.868
but it's something you do have to pre-plan.

00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:10.136
So for other kinds of operations,

00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:11.833
there's definitely a need for other

00:10:11.833 --> 00:10:14.336
scaffold-based approaches.

00:10:14.336 --> 00:10:16.705
And when you think about designing

00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:18.343
those other scaffolds, actually,

00:10:18.343 --> 00:10:20.314
you need a really multi-disciplinary team.

00:10:20.314 --> 00:10:22.379
And so our team has chemists,

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:25.756
it has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,

00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:27.786
and those people all come together

00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:30.197
and we think really hard about 
designing the materials.

00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:33.163
But we want to make them have enough information

00:10:33.163 --> 00:10:35.317
that we can get the cells to do what we want,

00:10:35.317 --> 00:10:37.694
but not be so complex as to make it difficult

00:10:37.694 --> 00:10:39.437
to get to clinic.

00:10:39.437 --> 00:10:42.188
And so one of the things we think about a lot

00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:43.983
is really trying to understand

00:10:43.983 --> 00:10:46.360
the structure of the tissues in the body.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.020
And so if we think of bone,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.644
obviously my own favorite tissue,

00:10:50.644 --> 00:10:52.201
we zoom in, we can see,

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:54.083
even if you don't know anything 
about bone structure,

00:10:54.083 --> 00:10:56.628
it's beautifully organized, 
really beautifully organized.

00:10:56.628 --> 00:10:58.515
We've lots of blood vessels in there.

00:10:58.515 --> 00:11:00.854
And if we zoom in again, we see that the cells

00:11:00.854 --> 00:11:03.826
are actually surrounded by a 3D matrix

00:11:03.826 --> 00:11:05.997
of nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot

00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:08.179
of information to the cells.

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:09.793
And if we zoom in again,

00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:11.994
actually in the case of bone, the matrix

00:11:11.994 --> 00:11:14.145
around the cells is beautifully organized

00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:16.612
at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material

00:11:16.612 --> 00:11:19.196
that's part organic, part inorganic.

00:11:19.196 --> 00:11:21.268
And that's led to a whole field, really,

00:11:21.268 --> 00:11:23.659
that has looked at developing materials

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:26.407
that have this hybrid kind of structure.

00:11:26.407 --> 00:11:29.685
And so I'm showing here just two examples

00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:32.805
where we've made some materials
that have that sort of structure,

00:11:32.805 --> 00:11:34.243
and you can really tailor it.

00:11:34.243 --> 00:11:36.307
You can see here a very squishy one

00:11:36.307 --> 00:11:40.406
and now a material that's also 
this hybrid sort of material

00:11:40.406 --> 00:11:42.353
but actually has remarkable toughness,

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.829
and it's no longer brittle.

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:46.285
And an inorganic material 
would normally be really brittle,

00:11:46.285 --> 00:11:47.725
and you wouldn't be able to have

00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:49.913
that sort of strength and toughness in it.

00:11:49.913 --> 00:11:52.402
One other thing I want to quickly mention is that

00:11:52.402 --> 00:11:55.117
many of the scaffolds we make 
are porous, and they have to be,

00:11:55.117 --> 00:11:57.220
because you want blood vessels to grow in there.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.097
But the pores are actually oftentimes

00:11:59.097 --> 00:12:00.390
much bigger than the cells,

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.101
and so even though it's 3D,

00:12:02.101 --> 00:12:05.456
the cell might see it more 
as a slightly curved surface,

00:12:05.456 --> 00:12:07.132
and that's a little bit unnatural.

00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:09.380
And so one of the things you can think about doing

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.528
is actually making scaffolds 
with slightly different dimensions

00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:15.321
that might be able to surround your cells in 3D

00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:17.890
and give them a little bit more information.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.457
And there's a lot of work going 
on in both of these areas.

00:12:21.471 --> 00:12:25.440
Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.148
applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:31.411
because this is a really big clinical problem.

00:12:31.411 --> 00:12:34.996
And one of the things that we know is that,

00:12:34.996 --> 00:12:37.235
unfortunately, if you have a heart attack,

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:40.137
then that tissue can start to die,

00:12:40.137 --> 00:12:43.888
and your outcome may not be very good over time.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.598
And it would be really great, actually,

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.517
if we could stop that dead tissue

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:51.502
either from dying or help it to regenerate.

00:12:51.502 --> 00:12:54.750
And there's lots and lots of stem 
cell trials going on worldwide,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.822
and they use many different types of cells,

00:12:56.822 --> 00:12:59.174
but one common theme that seems to be coming out

00:12:59.174 --> 00:13:02.173
is that actually, very often, those cells will die

00:13:02.173 --> 00:13:03.968
once you've implanted them.

00:13:03.968 --> 00:13:05.843
And you can either put them into the heart

00:13:05.843 --> 00:13:07.863
or into the blood system,

00:13:07.863 --> 00:13:10.225
but either way, we don't seem to be able

00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:12.092
to get quite the right number of cells

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:14.334
getting to the location we want them to

00:13:14.334 --> 00:13:18.828
and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful

00:13:18.828 --> 00:13:21.568
cell regeneration that we would like to have

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:24.985
to get good clinical outcomes.

00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:26.968
And so some of the things that we're thinking of,

00:13:26.968 --> 00:13:30.089
and many other people in the field are thinking of,

00:13:30.089 --> 00:13:33.095
are actually developing materials for that.

00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:34.714
But there's a difference here.

00:13:34.714 --> 00:13:36.924
We still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,

00:13:36.924 --> 00:13:39.595
we still need really interesting topography,

00:13:39.595 --> 00:13:42.243
and we still need really interesting 
ways to surround the cells.

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.754
But now, the cells also

00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:46.779
would probably quite like a material

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:48.797
that's going to be able to be conductive,

00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:53.006
because the cells themselves will respond very well

00:13:53.006 --> 00:13:56.485
and will actually conduct signals 
between themselves.

00:13:56.485 --> 00:13:58.001
You can see them now

00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:00.476
beating synchronously on these materials,

00:14:00.476 --> 00:14:03.255
and that's a very, very exciting development

00:14:03.255 --> 00:14:05.369
that's going on.

00:14:05.369 --> 00:14:10.193
So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that

00:14:10.193 --> 00:14:12.549
being able to work in this sort of field,

00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:14.203
all of us that work in this field

00:14:14.203 --> 00:14:16.712
that's not only super-exciting science,

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:18.758
but also has the potential

00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:20.726
to impact on patients,

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:23.156
however big or small they are,

00:14:23.156 --> 00:14:24.709
is really a great privilege.

00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:27.853
And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.

00:14:27.853 --> 00:14:29.170
Thank you.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:34.094
(Applause)
