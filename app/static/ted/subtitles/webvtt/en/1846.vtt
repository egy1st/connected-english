WEBVTT

00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:03.360
Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.719
to work with many of the great

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:06.445
international architects,

00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:08.869
documenting their work and observing

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.828
how their designs have the capacity

00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:13.797
to influence the cities in which they sit.

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.640
I think of new cities like Dubai

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.117
or ancient cities like Rome

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:22.479
with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:25.296
or like right here in New York with the High Line,

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:27.867
a city which has been so much influenced

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.570
by the development of this.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.645
But what I find really fascinating

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:34.741
is what happens when architects and planners leave

00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:37.860
and these places become appropriated by people,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.200
like here in Chandigarh, India,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.520
the city which has been completely designed

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.659
by the architect Le Corbusier.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.639
Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:49.260
by people in very different ways

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.582
from whatever perhaps intended for,

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.888
like here, where you have the people

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.851
sitting in the windows of the assembly hall.

00:00:57.851 --> 00:00:59.938
But over the course of several years,

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:02.356
I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:04.402
CCTV building in Beijing

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:07.240
and the olympic stadium in the same city

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.384
by the architects Herzog and de Meuron.

00:01:10.384 --> 00:01:13.829
At these large-scale construction sites in China,

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.952
you see a sort of makeshift camp

00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:20.142
where workers live during the entire building process.

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:22.624
As the length of the construction takes years,

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.382
workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:28.648
informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:32.091
against the sophisticated structures that they're building.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.300
Over the past seven years, I've been following

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.971
my fascination with the built environment,

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:39.674
and for those of you who know me, you would say

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:41.660
that this obsession has led me to live

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.082
out of a suitcase 365 days a year.

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:47.579
Being constantly on the move

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.394
means that sometimes I am able

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:52.570
to catch life's most unpredictable moments,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.551
like here in New York

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:58.944
the day after the Sandy storm hit the city.

00:01:58.944 --> 00:02:01.008
Just over three years ago,

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.694
I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,

00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:06.490
and while flying over the city, I was just amazed

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.530
by the extent to which the slums

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.979
reach into every corner of the city,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.716
a place where nearly 70 percent of the population

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.057
lives in slums,

00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:18.350
draped literally all over the mountains.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.777
During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,

00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:24.130
I learned about the Torre David,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.673
a 45-story office building which sits

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:28.726
right in the center of Caracas.

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:30.329
The building was under construction

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.855
until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:36.221
and the death of the developer in the early '90s.

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:39.183
About eight years ago, people started moving

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:41.196
into the abandoned tower

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:43.215
and began to build their homes right in between

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:46.414
every column of this unfinished tower.

00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:49.211
There's only one little entrance to the entire building,

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:52.149
and the 3,000 residents come in and out

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.217
through that single door.

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:57.106
Together, the inhabitants created public spaces

00:02:57.106 --> 00:02:59.379
and designed them to feel more like a home

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.974
and less like an unfinished tower.

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:05.489
In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.499
They also made a basketball court.

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.199
But when you look up closely,

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.680
you see massive holes where elevators

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.260
and services would have run through.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.249
Within the tower, people have come up

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.515
with all sorts of solutions

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:21.496
in response to the various needs

00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:24.983
which arise from living in an unfinished tower.

00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:26.182
With no elevators,

00:03:26.182 --> 00:03:29.510
the tower is like a 45-story walkup.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.760
Designed in very specific ways

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.236
by this group of people

00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:37.132
who haven't had any education in architecture or design.

00:03:37.132 --> 00:03:39.413
And with each inhabitant finding their own

00:03:39.413 --> 00:03:41.380
unique way of coming by,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.182
this tower becomes like a living city,

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:47.394
a place which is alive with micro-economies

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.311
and small businesses.

00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:51.925
The inventive inhabitants, for instance,

00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:54.656
find opportunities in the most unexpected cases,

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:56.781
like the adjacent parking garage,

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:58.858
which has been reclaimed as a taxi route

00:03:58.858 --> 00:04:01.156
to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:02.603
in order to shorten the hike

00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:06.621
up to the apartments.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.531
A walk through the tower

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.641
reveals how residents have figured out

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:14.167
how to create walls, how to make an air flow,

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.130
how to create transparency,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.554
circulation throughout the tower,

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:20.373
essentially creating a home

00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:22.021
that's completely adapted

00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:25.299
to the conditions of the site.

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.424
When a new inhabitant moves into the tower,

00:04:27.424 --> 00:04:29.332
they already have a roof over their head,

00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:31.371
so they just typically mark their space

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.287
with a few curtains or sheets.

00:04:34.287 --> 00:04:37.459
Slowly, from found materials, walls rise,

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.382
and people create a space out of any found objects

00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:42.271
or materials.

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:44.771
It's remarkable to see the design decisions

00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.447
that they're making,

00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:49.082
like when everything is made out of red bricks,

00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:51.347
some residents will cover that red brick

00:04:51.347 --> 00:04:55.208
with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper

00:04:55.208 --> 00:05:00.260
just to make it a kind of clean finish.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.719
The inhabitants literally built up these homes

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.876
with their own hands, and this labor of love

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:06.629
instills a great sense of pride

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.881
in many families living in this tower.

00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.815
They typically make the best out of their conditions,

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:15.623
and try to make their spaces look nice and homey,

00:05:15.623 --> 00:05:19.170
or at least up until as far as they can reach.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.182
Throughout the tower, you come across

00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:24.348
all kinds of services, like the barber,

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:28.161
small factories, and every floor has

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.585
a little grocery store or shop.

00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:34.095
And you even find a church.

00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:36.459
And on the 30th floor, there is a gym

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.213
where all the weights and barbells

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.009
are made out of the leftover pulleys

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.419
from the elevators which were never installed.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.054
From the outside, behind this always-changing facade,

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.673
you see how the fixed concrete beams

00:05:47.673 --> 00:05:49.538
provide a framework for the inhabitants

00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:51.005
to create their homes

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:52.881
in an organic, intuitive way

00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:55.598
that responds directly to their needs.

00:05:55.598 --> 00:05:58.253
Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:00.824
to a community called Makoko,

00:06:00.824 --> 00:06:03.383
a slum where 150,000 people

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:06.565
live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.

00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:10.279
While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.685
when you see it from above, there seems to be

00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:15.850
a whole grid of waterways and canals

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.364
connecting each and every home.

00:06:18.364 --> 00:06:22.578
From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes

00:06:22.578 --> 00:06:25.248
which carry them out to their various homes and shops

00:06:25.248 --> 00:06:27.923
located in the expansive area.

00:06:27.923 --> 00:06:29.870
When out on the water, it's clear

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.759
that life has been completely adapted

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.398
to this very specific way of living.

00:06:34.398 --> 00:06:37.045
Even the canoes become variety stores

00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:38.985
where ladies paddle from house to house,

00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:43.101
selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.

00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.120
Behind every window and door frame,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.823
you'll see a small child peering back at you,

00:06:47.823 --> 00:06:50.807
and while Makoko seems to be packed with people,

00:06:50.807 --> 00:06:52.642
what's more shocking is actually

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:56.127
the amount of children pouring out of every building.

00:06:56.127 --> 00:06:58.107
The population growth in Nigeria,

00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:00.576
and especially in these areas like Makoko,

00:07:00.576 --> 00:07:02.728
are painful reminders

00:07:02.728 --> 00:07:06.967
of how out of control things really are.

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:09.246
In Makoko, very few systems

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:11.112
and infrastructures exist.

00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:14.044
Electricity is rigged and freshest water

00:07:14.044 --> 00:07:17.409
comes from self-built wells throughout the area.

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:19.813
This entire economic model

00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:22.605
is designed to meet a specific way of living

00:07:22.605 --> 00:07:25.720
on the water, so fishing and boat-making

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.495
are common professions.

00:07:27.495 --> 00:07:29.462
You'll have a set of entrepreneurs

00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:32.486
who have set up businesses throughout the area,

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:37.286
like barbershops, CD and DVD stores,

00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:42.649
movie theaters, tailors, everything is there.

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:44.444
There is even a photo studio

00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:46.201
where you see the sort of aspiration

00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:49.501
to live in a real house or to be associated

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:53.800
with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.424
On this particular evening,

00:07:55.424 --> 00:07:57.528
I came across this live band

00:07:57.528 --> 00:08:00.679
dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.

00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:02.709
They were floating through the canals

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:05.633
in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator

00:08:05.633 --> 00:08:09.969
for all of the community to enjoy.

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:12.960
By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.788
save for a small lightbulb

00:08:14.788 --> 00:08:17.522
or a fire.

00:08:17.522 --> 00:08:20.137
What originally brought me to Makoko

00:08:20.137 --> 00:08:21.944
was this project from a friend of mine,

00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:24.745
Kunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building

00:08:24.745 --> 00:08:26.791
this three-story floating school

00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:28.812
for the kids in Makoko.

00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:31.841
With this entire village existing on the water,

00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:34.264
public space is very limited,

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.928
so now that the school is finished,

00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:39.302
the ground floor is a playground for the kids,

00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:41.169
but when classes are out, the platform

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.740
is just like a town square,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.135
where the fishermen mend their nets

00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:49.300
and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.830
Another place I'd like to share with you

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.878
is the Zabbaleen in Cairo.

00:08:53.878 --> 00:08:56.637
They're descendants of farmers who began migrating

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:59.107
from the upper Egypt in the '40s,

00:08:59.107 --> 00:09:00.533
and today they make their living

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:03.723
by collecting and recycling waste from homes

00:09:03.723 --> 00:09:05.974
from all over Cairo.

00:09:05.974 --> 00:09:09.096
For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages

00:09:09.096 --> 00:09:10.765
where they would move around

00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:13.284
trying to avoid the local authorities,

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:15.603
but in the early 1980s, they settled

00:09:15.603 --> 00:09:17.320
on the Mokattam rocks

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.969
just at the eastern edge of the city.

00:09:19.969 --> 00:09:22.000
Today, they live in this area,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.804
approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,

00:09:24.804 --> 00:09:26.937
who live in this community of self-built

00:09:26.937 --> 00:09:29.117
multi-story houses

00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:33.410
where up to three generations live in one structure.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.888
While these apartments that they built for themselves

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:38.873
appear to lack any planning or formal grid,

00:09:38.873 --> 00:09:42.279
each family specializing in a certain form of recycling

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:44.512
means that the ground floor of each apartment

00:09:44.512 --> 00:09:48.169
is reserved for garbage-related activities

00:09:48.169 --> 00:09:52.192
and the upper floor is dedicated to living space.

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:54.063
I find it incredible to see

00:09:54.063 --> 00:09:55.999
how these piles and piles of garbage

00:09:55.999 --> 00:09:58.510
are invisible to the people who live there,

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.910
like this very distinguished man who is posing

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.119
while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,

00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:08.759
or like these two young men who are sitting

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:13.611
and chatting amongst these tons of garbage.

00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:15.344
While to most of us, living amongst

00:10:15.344 --> 00:10:17.432
these piles and piles of garbage

00:10:17.432 --> 00:10:19.783
may seem totally uninhabitable,

00:10:19.783 --> 00:10:21.873
to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just

00:10:21.873 --> 00:10:24.352
a different type of normal.

00:10:24.352 --> 00:10:26.989
In all these places I've talked about today,

00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:29.110
what I do find fascinating is that there's really

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.708
no such thing as normal,

00:10:30.708 --> 00:10:32.913
and it proves that people are able to adapt

00:10:32.913 --> 00:10:35.288
to any kind of situation.

00:10:35.288 --> 00:10:36.804
Throughout the day, it's quite common

00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:40.152
to come across a small party taking place

00:10:40.152 --> 00:10:43.996
in the streets, just like this engagement party.

00:10:43.996 --> 00:10:45.983
In this tradition, the bride-to-be

00:10:45.983 --> 00:10:48.128
displays all of their belongings,

00:10:48.128 --> 00:10:50.322
which they soon bring to their new husband.

00:10:50.322 --> 00:10:52.353
A gathering like this one

00:10:52.353 --> 00:10:54.250
offers such a juxtaposition

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.028
where all the new stuff is displayed

00:10:57.028 --> 00:10:59.394
and all the garbage is used

00:10:59.394 --> 00:11:06.031
as props to display all their new home accessories.

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:08.197
Like Makoko and the Torre David,

00:11:08.197 --> 00:11:09.742
throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all

00:11:09.742 --> 00:11:12.886
the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.

00:11:12.886 --> 00:11:14.966
There are the retail shops, the cafes

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.286
and the restaurants, and the community

00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:20.227
is this community of Coptic Christians,

00:11:20.227 --> 00:11:22.466
so you'll also find a church,

00:11:22.466 --> 00:11:25.911
along with the scores of religious iconographies

00:11:25.911 --> 00:11:27.669
throughout the area,

00:11:27.669 --> 00:11:30.858
and also all the everyday services

00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:32.657
like the electronic repair shops,

00:11:32.657 --> 00:11:35.745
the barbers, everything.

00:11:35.745 --> 00:11:37.918
Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen

00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:39.607
is also full of surprises.

00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:41.119
While from the outside,

00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:43.662
these homes look like any other informal structure

00:11:43.662 --> 00:11:45.980
in the city, when you step inside,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.843
you are met with all manner of design decisions

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:52.110
and interior decoration.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.274
Despite having limited access to space and money,

00:11:55.274 --> 00:11:57.153
the homes in the area are designed

00:11:57.153 --> 00:11:59.139
with care and detail.

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:01.182
Every apartment is unique,

00:12:01.182 --> 00:12:02.975
and this individuality tells a story

00:12:02.975 --> 00:12:06.101
about each family's circumstances and values.

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.247
Many of these people take their homes

00:12:08.247 --> 00:12:11.415
and interior spaces very seriously,

00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:12.922
putting a lot of work and care

00:12:12.922 --> 00:12:14.248
into the details.

00:12:14.248 --> 00:12:17.421
The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,

00:12:17.421 --> 00:12:21.278
where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.

00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:24.261
But despite this elaborate decor,

00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:26.815
sometimes these apartments are used

00:12:26.815 --> 00:12:28.625
in very unexpected ways,

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:31.005
like this home which caught my attention

00:12:31.005 --> 00:12:34.487
while all the mud and the grass was literally

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:36.974
seeping out under the front door.

00:12:36.974 --> 00:12:40.773
When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment

00:12:40.773 --> 00:12:44.081
was being transformed into a complete animal farm,

00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:46.972
where six or seven cows stood grazing

00:12:46.972 --> 00:12:51.644
in what otherwise would be the living room.

00:12:51.644 --> 00:12:55.012
But then in the apartment across the hall

00:12:55.012 --> 00:12:57.535
from this cow shed lives a newly married couple

00:12:57.535 --> 00:12:59.361
in what locals describe

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:07.482
as one of the nicest apartments in the area.

00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:10.708
The attention to this detail astonished me,

00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:13.379
and as the owner of the home so proudly

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:15.365
led me around this apartment,

00:13:15.365 --> 00:13:19.081
from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.

00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:22.883
But if it weren't for the strangely familiar

00:13:22.883 --> 00:13:25.746
stomach-churning odor that constantly

00:13:25.746 --> 00:13:29.191
passes through the apartment,

00:13:29.191 --> 00:13:31.784
it would be easy to forget

00:13:31.784 --> 00:13:34.476
that you are standing next to a cow shed

00:13:34.476 --> 00:13:39.973
and on top of a landfill.

00:13:39.973 --> 00:13:42.652
What moved me the most was that despite

00:13:42.652 --> 00:13:44.686
these seemingly inhospitable conditions,

00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:46.479
I was welcomed with open arms

00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:50.405
into a home that was made with love, care,

00:13:50.405 --> 00:13:52.655
and unreserved passion.

00:13:52.655 --> 00:13:56.039
Let's move across the map to China,

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:59.926
to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.

00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:03.616
In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,

00:14:03.616 --> 00:14:06.299
there lived until recently an estimated

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:10.168
40 million people in these houses underground.

00:14:10.168 --> 00:14:12.619
These dwellings are called the yaodongs.

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:14.809
Through this architecture by subtraction,

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:18.396
these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.

00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:22.270
In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.016
and hidden behind these mounds of dirt

00:14:25.016 --> 00:14:27.516
are these square, rectangular houses

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:30.107
which sit seven meters below the ground.

00:14:30.107 --> 00:14:32.095
When I asked people why they were digging

00:14:32.095 --> 00:14:33.984
their houses from the ground,

00:14:33.984 --> 00:14:36.007
they simply replied that they are poor wheat

00:14:36.007 --> 00:14:38.187
and apple farmers who didn't have the money

00:14:38.187 --> 00:14:41.588
to buy materials, and this digging out

00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:46.056
was their most logical form of living.

00:14:46.056 --> 00:14:48.954
From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.953
have approached the tasks of planning,

00:14:50.953 --> 00:14:53.352
design and management of their communities

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:55.731
and neighborhoods in ways that respond

00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:59.641
specifically to their environment and circumstances.

00:14:59.641 --> 00:15:01.872
Created by these very people who live,

00:15:01.872 --> 00:15:05.583
work and play in these particular spaces,

00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:08.580
these neighborhoods are intuitively designed

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.618
to make the most of their circumstances.

00:15:11.618 --> 00:15:13.523
In most of these places, the government

00:15:13.523 --> 00:15:16.052
is completely absent, leaving inhabitants

00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:19.971
with no choice but to reappropriate found materials,

00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:22.943
and while these communities are highly disadvantaged,

00:15:22.943 --> 00:15:24.985
they do present examples

00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:27.433
of brilliant forms of ingenuity,

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:29.761
and prove that indeed we have the ability

00:15:29.761 --> 00:15:33.304
to adapt to all manner of circumstances.

00:15:33.304 --> 00:15:35.497
What makes places like the Torre David

00:15:35.497 --> 00:15:37.294
particularly remarkable

00:15:37.294 --> 00:15:39.195
is this sort of skeleton framework

00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:40.817
where people can have a foundation

00:15:40.817 --> 00:15:42.889
where they can tap into.

00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:45.987
Now imagine what these already ingenious communities

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.079
could create themselves,

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:50.765
and how highly particular their solutions would be,

00:15:50.765 --> 00:15:53.307
if they were given the basic infrastructures

00:15:53.307 --> 00:15:55.286
that they could tap into.

00:15:55.286 --> 00:15:58.793
Today, you see these large residential development projects

00:15:58.793 --> 00:16:01.248
which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions

00:16:01.248 --> 00:16:03.290
to massive amounts of people.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.850
From China to Brazil, these projects attempt

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.857
to provide as many houses as possible,

00:16:08.857 --> 00:16:11.060
but they're completely generic

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.965
and simply do not work as an answer

00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:16.294
to the individual needs of the people.

00:16:16.294 --> 00:16:18.748
I would like to end with a quote

00:16:18.748 --> 00:16:21.829
from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:24.595
Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful

00:16:24.595 --> 00:16:26.271
Shorefast Foundation,

00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:29.360
based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.201
She says that "there's this plague of sameness

00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:34.124
which is killing the human joy,"

00:16:34.124 --> 00:16:36.419
and I couldn't agree with her more.

00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:37.862
Thank you.

00:16:37.862 --> 00:16:41.824
(Applause)
