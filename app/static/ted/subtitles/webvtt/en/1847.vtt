WEBVTT

00:00:00.498 --> 00:00:03.157
So I'd like you to come back with me

00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:05.058
just for a few minutes

00:00:05.058 --> 00:00:07.927
to a dark night in China,

00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:10.648
the night I met my husband.

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:14.091
It was a city so long ago that it was still called

00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:16.204
Peking.

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:18.825
So I went to a party.

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:22.208
I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:25.722
with owl glasses and a bow tie,

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:28.615
and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar,

00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:32.179
there in China specifically to study

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.270
Sino-Soviet relations.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.670
What a gift it was to the eager,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.428
young foreign correspondent that I was then.

00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:41.436
I'd pump him for information,

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:43.093
I'm mentally scribbling notes

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:45.402
for the stories I plan to write.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:47.887
I talk to him for hours.

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:51.398
Only months later,

00:00:51.398 --> 00:00:53.772
I discover who he really was.

00:00:53.772 --> 00:00:56.545
He was the China representative

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:00.774
for the American Soybean Association.

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:04.044
"I don't understand. Soybeans?

00:01:04.044 --> 00:01:06.799
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.687
"Well, how long would you have talked to me

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:10.729
if I told you we're in soybeans?"

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.210
(Laughter)

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.502
I said, "You jerk."

00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:20.255
Only jerk wasn't the word I used.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:24.402
I said, "You could've gotten me fired."

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:27.939
And he said, "Let's get married."

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.226
(Laughter)

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:32.122
"Travel the world and have lots of kids."

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:34.220
So we did.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.265
(Laughter)

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:41.507
(Applause)

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:45.247
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley

00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:46.694
turned out to be.

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:48.337
He was a Chinese scholar

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:50.203
who later, in his 60s,

00:01:50.203 --> 00:01:52.755
got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.243
He spoke six languages,

00:01:55.243 --> 00:01:57.731
he played 15 musical instruments,

00:01:57.731 --> 00:01:59.507
he was a licensed pilot,

00:01:59.507 --> 00:02:02.678
he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator,

00:02:02.678 --> 00:02:05.512
he was an expert in swine nutrition,

00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:09.293
dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir,

00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:13.477
and we did travel the country, and the world,

00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:15.706
and we did have a lot of kids.

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:17.448
We followed my job, and it seemed like

00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:21.015
there was nothing that we couldn't do.

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:24.797
So when we found the cancer,

00:02:24.797 --> 00:02:27.362
it doesn't seem strange to us at all

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:29.995
that without saying a word to each other,

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:32.421
we believed that,

00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.680
if we were smart enough

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.011
and strong enough and brave enough,

00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:41.484
and we worked hard enough,

00:02:41.484 --> 00:02:46.762
we could keep him from dying ever.

00:02:46.762 --> 00:02:50.261
And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.

00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:53.140
The surgeon emerged from the surgery.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.417
What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say:

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:57.419
"We got it all."

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.462
Then there was a setback when the pathologists

00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:02.835
looked at the kidney cancer closely.

00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:04.464
It turned out to be a rare,

00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:06.273
exceedingly aggressive type,

00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:09.355
with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.746
in several weeks at most.

00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:15.456
And yet, he did not die.

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.966
Mysteriously, he lived on.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:21.050
He coached Little League for our son.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.602
He built a playhouse for our daughter.

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:26.676
And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:28.350
looking for specialists.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.911
I'm looking for a cure.

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.988
So a year goes by

00:03:32.988 --> 00:03:36.194
before the cancer, as cancers do,

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:38.194
reappears,

00:03:38.194 --> 00:03:40.270
and with it comes another death sentence,

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.463
this time nine months.

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:46.477
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.

00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:48.297
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it,

00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:51.314
yet still he lives on.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.210
Then another year goes by.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.760
Two years go by.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.249
More specialists.

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.169
We take the kids to Italy.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.638
We take the kids to Australia.

00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:03.350
And then more years pass,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.740
and the cancer begins to grow.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.275
This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.

00:04:08.275 --> 00:04:10.211
They're exotic. They're experimental.

00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.419
They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.745
So he enters a clinical trial, and it works.

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.674
The cancer begins to shrink,

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:21.951
and for the third time,

00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:25.310
we've dodged death.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.607
So now I ask you,

00:04:28.607 --> 00:04:30.996
how do I feel

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:33.510
when the time finally comes

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.016
and there's another dark night,

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:38.517
sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?

00:04:38.517 --> 00:04:41.491
This time it's on the intensive care ward

00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:43.329
when a twentysomething resident

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:45.532
that I've never met before

00:04:45.532 --> 00:04:48.125
tells me that Terence is dying,

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:50.324
perhaps tonight.

00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:53.117
So what do I say when he says,

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:55.931
"What do you want me to do?"

00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:57.943
There's another drug out there.

00:04:57.943 --> 00:04:59.631
It's newer. It's more powerful.

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:02.200
He started it just two weeks ago.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.309
Perhaps there's still hope ahead.

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.264
So what do I say?

00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:10.620
I say, "Keep him alive if you can."

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.135
And Terence died six days later.

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:18.183
So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:19.979
It was an exhilarating fight,

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.696
and I'd repeat the fight today

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.345
without a moment's hesitation.

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:27.296
We fought together, we lived together.

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:29.400
It turned what could have been

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.134
seven of the grimmest years of our life

00:05:32.134 --> 00:05:35.745
into seven of the most glorious.

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:38.520
It was also an expensive fight.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.481
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices

00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:42.115
that everyone here agrees

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:44.520
pump up the cost of end-of-life care,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.806
and of healthcare for all of us.

00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:49.888
And for me, for us,

00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:51.970
we pushed the fight right over the edge,

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.195
and I never got the chance to say to him

00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:58.615
what I say to him now almost every day:

00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:01.692
"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."

00:06:01.692 --> 00:06:04.180
We never got the chance to say goodbye.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.459
We never thought it was the end.

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:11.638
We always had hope.

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:15.502
So what do we make of all of this?

00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:19.080
Being a journalist, after Terence died,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.369
I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:24.519
I wrote it because I wanted to know

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:26.205
why I did what I did,

00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:28.006
why he did what he did,

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:30.561
why everyone around us did what they did.

00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:32.197
And what did I discover?

00:06:32.197 --> 00:06:33.771
Well, one of the things I discovered is that

00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:36.848
experts think that one answer to

00:06:36.848 --> 00:06:39.598
what I did at the end was a piece of paper,

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:41.756
the advance directive,

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:46.096
to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.

00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:50.210
Yet I had that piece of paper.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.263
We both did.

00:06:52.263 --> 00:06:53.953
And they were readily available.

00:06:53.953 --> 00:06:55.892
I had them right at hand.

00:06:55.892 --> 00:06:58.251
Both of them said the same thing:

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.752
Do nothing if there is no further hope.

00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:04.972
I knew Terence's wishes

00:07:04.972 --> 00:07:08.786
as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.

00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:13.990
Yet we never got to no further hope.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.747
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands,

00:07:16.747 --> 00:07:20.003
we just kept redefining hope.

00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:25.295
I believed I could keep him from dying,

00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:28.109
and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen

00:07:28.109 --> 00:07:30.320
so many people and have talked to so many people

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.994
who have felt exactly the same way.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:36.928
Right up until days before his death,

00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:40.254
I felt strongly

00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:44.297
and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:49.544
that I could keep him from dying ever.

00:07:49.544 --> 00:07:52.779
Now, what do the experts call this?

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:55.126
They say it's denial.

00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:57.317
It's a strong word, isn't it?

00:07:57.317 --> 00:07:59.714
Yet I will tell you that denial

00:07:59.714 --> 00:08:04.828
isn't even close to a strong enough word

00:08:04.828 --> 00:08:07.474
to describe what those of us

00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:11.112
facing the death of our loved ones go through.

00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:13.453
And I hear the medical professionals say,

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:15.536
"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,

00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:17.987
but the family's in denial.

00:08:17.987 --> 00:08:20.163
The family won't listen to reason.

00:08:20.163 --> 00:08:22.185
They're in denial.

00:08:22.185 --> 00:08:24.537
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:27.841
It's so clear, yet they're in denial."

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.848
Now, I think this maybe isn't

00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:32.852
a very useful way of thinking.

00:08:32.852 --> 00:08:35.130
It's not just families either.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.255
The medical professionals too,

00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:40.615
you out there, you're in denial too.

00:08:40.615 --> 00:08:43.468
You want to help. You want to fix.

00:08:43.468 --> 00:08:45.294
You want to do.

00:08:45.294 --> 00:08:48.102
You've succeeded in everything you've done,

00:08:48.102 --> 00:08:50.144
and having a patient die,

00:08:50.144 --> 00:08:53.723
well, that must feel like failure.

00:08:53.723 --> 00:08:55.567
I saw it firsthand.

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:58.269
Just days before Terence died,

00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:00.287
his oncologist said,

00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:03.535
"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."

00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:05.917
Days before he died.

00:09:05.917 --> 00:09:07.350
Yet Ira Byock,

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.698
the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth

00:09:09.698 --> 00:09:12.629
said, "You know, the best doctor in the world

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:17.237
has never succeeded in making anyone immortal."

00:09:17.237 --> 00:09:23.743
So what the experts call "denial," I call "hope,"

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:26.077
and I'd like to borrow a phrase

00:09:26.077 --> 00:09:29.298
from my friends in software design.

00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:32.860
You just redefine denial and hope,

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.088
and it becomes a feature of being human.

00:09:36.088 --> 00:09:37.949
It's not a bug.

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:40.275
It's a feature.

00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:43.369
(Laughter)

00:09:43.369 --> 00:09:47.063
So we need to think more constructively

00:09:47.063 --> 00:09:51.375
about this very common, very profound

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:55.331
and very powerful human emotion.

00:09:55.331 --> 00:09:57.955
It's part of the human condition,

00:09:57.955 --> 00:10:00.132
and yet our system and our thinking

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:03.301
isn't built to accommodate it.

00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.356
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.261
and I believed it.

00:10:08.261 --> 00:10:11.375
Maybe I wanted to believe it.

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:16.704
And during Terence's illness, I, we,

00:10:16.704 --> 00:10:18.426
we wanted to believe the story

00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:21.021
of our fight together too.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:24.757
Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.696
it felt like giving up --

00:10:26.696 --> 00:10:29.413
meant giving up not only his life

00:10:29.413 --> 00:10:33.120
but also our story,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.330
our story of us as fighters,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.260
the story of us as invincible,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.468
and for the doctors, the story of themselves

00:10:40.468 --> 00:10:43.026
as healers.

00:10:43.026 --> 00:10:45.710
So what do we need?

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.649
Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:51.596
Maybe we need a new story,

00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:55.605
not a story about giving up the fight

00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:57.876
or of hopelessness,

00:10:57.876 --> 00:11:01.287
but rather a story of victory and triumph,

00:11:01.287 --> 00:11:06.130
of a valiant battle and, eventually,

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.450
a graceful retreat,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.457
a story that acknowledges

00:11:11.457 --> 00:11:15.220
that not even the greatest general defeats every foe,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.841
that no doctor has ever succeeded

00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:20.231
in making anyone immortal,

00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:26.297
and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,

00:11:26.297 --> 00:11:30.982
has ever stopped even the bravest,

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:35.031
wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband

00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:39.224
from dying when it was his time to go.

00:11:39.224 --> 00:11:41.537
People did mention hospice,

00:11:41.537 --> 00:11:44.908
but I wouldn't listen.

00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:48.833
Hospice was for people who were dying,

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.606
and Terence wasn't dying.

00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:54.516
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice,

00:11:54.516 --> 00:11:56.333
which I'm sure, as you all know,

00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:58.423
is a pretty typical outcome,

00:11:58.423 --> 00:11:59.935
and we never said goodbye

00:11:59.935 --> 00:12:02.990
because we were unprepared for the end.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.737
We have a noble path to curing the disease,

00:12:06.737 --> 00:12:09.067
patients and doctors alike,

00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:11.190
but there doesn't seem to be

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.790
a noble path to dying.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.848
Dying is seen as failing,

00:12:16.848 --> 00:12:19.500
and we had a heroic narrative

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.593
for fighting together,

00:12:21.593 --> 00:12:26.623
but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.

00:12:26.623 --> 00:12:30.741
So maybe we need a narrative

00:12:30.741 --> 00:12:34.217
for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,

00:12:34.217 --> 00:12:36.779
and maybe our new story will be

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:41.385
about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.852
Terence loved poetry,

00:12:43.852 --> 00:12:47.079
and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy

00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:49.508
is one of my favorite poets.

00:12:49.508 --> 00:12:52.392
So I'll give you a couple lines from him.

00:12:52.392 --> 00:12:54.608
This is a poem about Mark Antony.

00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:57.301
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,

00:12:57.301 --> 00:12:59.166
Cleopatra's guy?

00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.703
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.

00:13:01.703 --> 00:13:04.128
And he's been a pretty good general.

00:13:04.128 --> 00:13:05.188
He's won all the fights,

00:13:05.188 --> 00:13:07.643
he's eluded all the people that are out to get him,

00:13:07.643 --> 00:13:09.431
and yet this time, finally,

00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:11.180
he's come to the city of Alexandria

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.862
and realized he's lost.

00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:14.578
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.

00:13:14.578 --> 00:13:15.901
They're singing.

00:13:15.901 --> 00:13:18.501
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.

00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:20.680
And he suddenly knows

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.205
he's been deserted by the gods,

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:25.145
and it's time to let go.

00:13:25.145 --> 00:13:27.112
And the poet tells him what to do.

00:13:27.112 --> 00:13:30.378
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye,

00:13:30.378 --> 00:13:34.225
a goodbye that's fit for a hero.

00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:36.974
"As if long-prepared,

00:13:36.974 --> 00:13:39.653
as if courageous,

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:42.250
as it becomes you

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.422
who were worthy of such a city,

00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:46.825
approach the window with a firm step,

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.360
and with emotion,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.559
but not with the entreaties

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:54.320
or the complaints of a coward,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.291
as a last enjoyment,

00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:58.415
listen to the sounds,

00:13:58.415 --> 00:14:01.749
the exquisite instruments of the musical troops,

00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:04.030
and bid her farewell,

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.445
the Alexandria you are losing."

00:14:08.445 --> 00:14:12.135
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,

00:14:12.135 --> 00:14:14.153
a goodbye for a man

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:16.127
for whom anything,

00:14:16.127 --> 00:14:19.235
well, almost anything,

00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:21.125
was possible,

00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:24.265
a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.

00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:26.458
And isn't that what we're missing?

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:28.517
How can we learn that people's decisions

00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:30.027
about their loved ones

00:14:30.027 --> 00:14:33.956
are often based strongly, powerfully,

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.808
many times irrationally,

00:14:36.808 --> 00:14:39.152
on the slimmest of hopes?

00:14:39.152 --> 00:14:42.174
The overwhelming presence of hope

00:14:42.174 --> 00:14:43.597
isn't denial.

00:14:43.597 --> 00:14:46.417
It's part of our DNA as humans,

00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:48.735
and maybe it's time our healthcare system --

00:14:48.735 --> 00:14:53.219
doctors, patients, insurance companies, us,

00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:57.193
started accounting for the power of that hope.

00:14:57.193 --> 00:14:59.493
Hope isn't a bug.

00:14:59.493 --> 00:15:01.862
It's a feature.

00:15:01.862 --> 00:15:04.357
Thank you.

00:15:04.357 --> 00:15:07.412
(Applause)
