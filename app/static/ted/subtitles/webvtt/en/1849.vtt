Hetain Patel: (In Chinese)

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:14.606
Yuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain. I'm an artist.

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:16.467
And this is Yuyu,

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.886
who is a dancer I have been working with.

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:22.492
I have asked her to translate for me.

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:27.182
HP: (In Chinese)

00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:29.890
YR: If I may, I would like to tell you

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.620
a little bit about myself

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.916
and my artwork.

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:39.459
HP: (In Chinese)

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:42.583
YR: I was born and raised near Manchester,

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:43.550
in England,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.122
but I'm not going to say it in English to you,

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:49.883
because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.965
that might be made from my northern accent.

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.540
(Laughter)

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:04.975
HP: (In Chinese)

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:07.487
YR: The only problem with masking it

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:09.037
with Chinese Mandarin

00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:11.755
is I can only speak this paragraph,

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.534
which I have learned by heart

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:16.204
when I was visiting in China. (Laughter)

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:20.092
So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones

00:01:20.092 --> 00:01:21.952
and hope you won't notice.

00:01:21.952 --> 00:01:27.301
(Laughter)

00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:31.481
HP: (In Chinese)

00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:32.848
(Laughter)

00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:35.961
YR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:40.444
to any Mandarin speakers in the audience.

00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:44.887
As a child, I would hate being made

00:01:44.887 --> 00:01:47.515
to wear the Indian kurta pajama,

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:50.513
because I didn't think it was very cool.

00:01:50.513 --> 00:01:53.814
It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress,

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:56.472
and it had this baggy trouser part

00:01:56.472 --> 00:01:58.715
you had to tie really tight

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:02.139
to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.175
My dad never wore it,

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:07.100
so I didn't see why I had to.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.453
Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable,

00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:13.148
that people assume I represent something

00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:15.474
genuinely Indian when I wear it,

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:18.923
because that's not how I feel.

00:02:18.923 --> 00:02:24.775
HP: (In Chinese)

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:27.702
YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable

00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:30.110
wearing it is by pretending

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.321
they are the robes of a kung fu warrior

00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:36.060
like Li Mu Bai from that film,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.373
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

00:02:40.373 --> 00:02:45.556
(Music)

00:03:23.383 --> 00:03:24.992
Okay.

00:03:24.992 --> 00:03:32.063
So my artwork is about identity and language,

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:34.793
challenging common assumptions

00:03:34.793 --> 00:03:39.338
based on how we look like or where we come from,

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:43.082
gender, race, class.

00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:46.933
What makes us who we are anyway?

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:52.880
HP: (In Chinese)

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.256
YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics,

00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:56.831
watch kung fu movies,

00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:59.616
take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:01.265
He would say things like --

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:03.352
HP: Empty your mind.

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:04.416
(Laughter)

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:10.429
Be formless, shapeless, like water.

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:12.419
Now you put water into a cup.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.315
It becomes the cup.

00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:18.422
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.

00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:21.801
Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:24.450
Now, water can flow

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.100
or it can crash.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.455
Be water, my friend. (Applause)

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:34.557
YR: This year, I am 32 years old,

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:37.676
the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:40.270
I have been wondering recently,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.200
if he were alive today,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.226
what advice he would give me

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:48.170
about making this TED Talk.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.908
HP: Don't imitate my voice.

00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:53.979
It offends me.

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.009
(Laughter)

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.760
YR: Good advice,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.472
but I still think that we learn who we are

00:05:01.472 --> 00:05:03.575
by copying others.

00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:07.792
Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero

00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:11.687
in the playground, or mum or father?

00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:13.948
I have.

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:18.490
HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.495
for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair

00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:25.638
so that I could grow it back as my father had it

00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:28.404
when he first emigrated from India

00:05:28.404 --> 00:05:31.668
to the U.K. in the 1960s.

00:05:31.668 --> 00:05:35.798
He had a side parting and a neat mustache.

00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:38.417
At first, it was going very well.

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:41.467
I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:45.468
(Laughter)

00:05:45.468 --> 00:05:47.092
But then very quickly,

00:05:47.092 --> 00:05:48.839
I started to underestimate

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.519
my mustache growing ability,

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.921
and it got way too big.

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.668
It didn't look Indian anymore.

00:05:56.668 --> 00:05:58.511
Instead, people from across the road,

00:05:58.511 --> 00:06:00.402
they would shout things like --

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.618
HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! Ándale! Ándale!

00:06:02.618 --> 00:06:04.619
(Laughter)

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:06.983
HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.

00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:09.987
My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.

00:06:09.987 --> 00:06:12.514
He talks like this now.

00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:16.542
So it's not just my father that I've imitated.

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:20.140
A few years ago I went to China for a few months,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.974
and I couldn't speak Chinese,

00:06:22.974 --> 00:06:24.786
and this frustrated me,

00:06:24.786 --> 00:06:28.738
so I wrote about this and had it translated

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:35.225
into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart,

00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:38.422
like music, I guess.

00:06:38.422 --> 00:06:41.763
YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind

00:06:41.763 --> 00:06:44.642
clearer than the pin number to my bank card,

00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:48.570
so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.618
When I had learned this phrase,

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.354
I had an artist over there hear me out

00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:55.823
to see how accurate it sounded.

00:06:55.823 --> 00:06:58.309
I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:01.120
and told me, "Oh yeah, that's great,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.493
only it kind of sounds like a woman."

00:07:03.493 --> 00:07:04.955
I said, "What?"

00:07:04.955 --> 00:07:08.877
He said, "Yeah, you learned from a woman?"

00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:10.881
I said, "Yes. So?"

00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:13.522
He then explained the tonal differences

00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:15.772
between male and female voices

00:07:15.772 --> 00:07:19.574
are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well,

00:07:19.574 --> 00:07:21.567
but in a woman's voice.

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.790
(Laughter)

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:31.100
(Applause)

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.519
HP: Okay. So this imitation business

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:36.204
does come with risk.

00:07:36.204 --> 00:07:38.912
It doesn't always go as you plan it,

00:07:38.912 --> 00:07:42.382
even with a talented translator.

00:07:42.382 --> 00:07:44.668
But I am going to stick with it,

00:07:44.668 --> 00:07:49.033
because contrary to what we might usually assume,

00:07:49.033 --> 00:07:53.132
imitating somebody can reveal something unique.

00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:56.387
So every time I fail

00:07:56.387 --> 00:07:58.943
to become more like my father,

00:07:58.943 --> 00:08:02.838
I become more like myself.

00:08:02.838 --> 00:08:07.420
Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee,

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.066
I become more authentically me.

00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:12.551
This is my art.

00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:15.871
I strive for authenticity,

00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:18.106
even if it comes in a shape

00:08:18.106 --> 00:08:21.802
that we might not usually expect.

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:26.038
It's only recently that I've started to understand

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:29.745
that I didn't learn to sit like this

00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:31.891
through being Indian.

00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:35.167
I learned this from Spider-Man.

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:36.905
(Laughter)

00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:38.462
Thank you.

00:08:38.462 --> 00:08:44.478
(Applause)
