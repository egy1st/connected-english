WEBVTT

00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:03.047
I've spent my life working on sustainability.

00:00:03.047 --> 00:00:05.102
I set up a climate change NGO

00:00:05.102 --> 00:00:06.422
called The Climate Group.

00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:09.813
I worked on forestry issues in WWF.

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:11.889
I worked on development and agriculture issues

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.624
in the U.N. system.

00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:15.548
About 25 years in total,

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.271
and then three years ago, I found myself talking to

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:21.556
IKEA's CEO about joining his team.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.582
Like many people here, well,

00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:27.517
I want to maximize my personal impact in the world,

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:32.203
so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:35.010
But first, let's just take three numbers.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.081
The first number is three:

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.641
three billion people.

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:40.452
This is the number of people joining

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:42.504
the global middle class by 2030,

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:43.813
coming out of poverty.

00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:46.054
It's fantastic for them and their families,

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:49.097
but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,

00:00:49.097 --> 00:00:51.394
and this swells that number to five,

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:54.724
a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.

00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:56.601
The second number is six:

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:58.746
This is six degrees centigrade,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.310
what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.361
We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.709
or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:08.398
And if you think about it, all of the weird weather

00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:10.241
we've been having the last few years,

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.823
much of that is due to just one degree warming,

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:15.118
and we need CO2 emissions to peak

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:17.350
by the end of this decade globally

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.078
and then come down.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:23.149
It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.910
The third number is 12:

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.403
That's the number of cities in the world

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:28.194
that had a million or more people

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:29.627
when my grandmother was born.

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:31.247
You can see my grandmother there.

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:33.290
That was in the beginning of the last century.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.306
So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:37.327
the ninth largest city in the world.

00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:40.032
Now there are 500 cities, nearly,

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:42.463
with a million people or more in them.

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:45.807
And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:49.551
that's the century when we build all the world's cities,

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:51.961
the century that we're in the middle of right now.

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.807
Every other century was kind of practice,

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:59.625
and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.380
So think about it.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.150
We're building cities like never before,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.676
bringing people out of poverty like never before,

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:09.051
and changing the climate like never before.

00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:12.111
Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:13.776
to a must-do.

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:16.609
it's about what we do right here, right now,

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.290
and for the rest of our working lives.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.322
So I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:02:22.322 --> 00:02:23.695
what business can do

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.997
and what a business like IKEA can do,

00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:28.664
and we have a sustainability strategy

00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:30.661
called "people and planet positive"

00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:34.308
to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.

00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:36.443
Why would we not want to have a positive impact

00:02:36.443 --> 00:02:39.031
on the world as a business?

00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.519
Other companies have sustainability strategies.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.357
I'm going to refer to some of those as well,

00:02:43.357 --> 00:02:44.894
and I'm just going to mention a few

00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:47.490
of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.506
But first, let's think of customers.

00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:53.331
We know from asking people from China to the U.S.

00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:56.659
that the vast majority of people care about sustainability

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.541
after the day-to-day issues,

00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:01.118
the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:03.097
Can I pay the bills at the end of the month?

00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:06.559
Then they care about big issues like climate change.

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:10.991
But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.983
and they expect business to help,

00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:15.777
and they're a little bit disappointed today.

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:18.411
So take your mind back and think

00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:19.998
of the first sustainable products.

00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:23.911
We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.

00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.965
We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs

00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:28.812
that took five minutes to warm up

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:31.883
and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:35.251
And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.

00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:37.983
So every time you pulled on a t-shirt,

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:40.089
or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.758
or sometimes all three together,

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:45.203
you were reminded sustainability was about compromise.

00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:48.101
It wasn't a great start.

00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.389
Today we have choices.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.686
We can make products that are beautiful or ugly,

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:58.487
sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,

00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:00.350
functional or useless.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.215
So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:05.535
sustainable products.

00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:07.831
Let's take the LED.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.245
The LED is the next best thing to daylight.

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.426
The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:15.934
I'm not going to ask for a show of hands

00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:18.223
of how many of you still have them in your homes,

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:21.045
wasting energy every time you switch them on --

00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:22.482
change them after this --

00:04:22.482 --> 00:04:26.175
or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:29.966
but those old incandescent light bulbs

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.988
really should have been sold as heaters.

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:34.965
They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.

00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:37.407
They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.

00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:39.479
Now we have lights that produce light

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.171
and a little bit of heat on the side.

00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:43.997
You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED

00:04:43.997 --> 00:04:46.040
that you would have done in an old incandescent.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.775
And the best thing is, they'll also last

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:49.354
for more than 20 years.

00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:50.610
So think about that.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.106
You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:55.182
probably more if you're in this audience.

00:04:55.182 --> 00:04:57.792
You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:00.344
Your kids could go to school, go to college,

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:02.299
go away and have kids of their own, come back,

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:03.725
bring the grandkids,

00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:07.611
you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.

00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:10.450
So LEDs are fantastic.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.976
What we decided to do

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:14.929
was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:17.155
and continue to push all the old bulbs,

00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:19.146
the halogens and the CFLs.

00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:22.076
We decided, over the next two years,

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:24.591
we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:25.959
We will go all in.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.668
And this is what business needs to do: go all-in,

00:05:27.668 --> 00:05:29.112
go 100 percent,

00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:30.703
because then you stop investing in the old stuff,

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:32.857
you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,

00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:35.186
you use your supply chain and your creativity

00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:37.943
and you get the prices down so everybody can afford

00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:40.894
the best lights so they can save energy.

00:05:40.894 --> 00:05:45.044
(Applause)

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:48.173
It's not just about products in people's homes.

00:05:48.173 --> 00:05:49.817
We've got to think about the raw materials

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:51.999
that produce our products.

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:53.826
Obviously there's fantastic opportunities

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:55.320
with recycled materials,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.163
and we can and will go zero waste.

00:05:58.163 --> 00:06:00.151
And there's opportunities in a circular economy.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.593
But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.

00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:05.383
Let's take cotton.

00:06:05.383 --> 00:06:07.112
Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people

00:06:07.112 --> 00:06:08.523
are wearing cotton right now.

00:06:08.523 --> 00:06:10.057
It's a brilliant textile in use.

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:11.624
It's really dirty in production.

00:06:11.624 --> 00:06:15.758
It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:17.378
So we've worked with others,

00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:18.980
with other businesses and NGOs,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.836
on the Better Cotton Initiative,

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.005
working right back down to the farm,

00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:24.840
and there you can halve the amount of water

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.671
and halve the chemical inputs,

00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:29.567
the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:31.236
of running many of these farms

00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:33.280
with farmers with low incomes

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.983
can be chemical imports.

00:06:34.983 --> 00:06:37.128
Yields increase, and you halve the input costs.

00:06:37.128 --> 00:06:40.003
Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.

00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:41.730
Already hundreds of thousands of farmers

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.320
have been reached,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.984
and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.

00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:47.326
Again, we're going all-in.

00:06:47.326 --> 00:06:50.476
By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:53.462
Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.

00:06:53.462 --> 00:06:55.134
People sometimes think that

00:06:55.134 --> 00:06:56.599
100 percent's going to be hard,

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.370
and we've had the conversation in the business.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.212
Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do

00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:02.199
than 90 percent or 50 percent.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.631
If you have a 90 percent target,

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.052
everyone in the business finds a reason

00:07:05.052 --> 00:07:06.857
to be in the 10 percent.

00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:10.427
When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,

00:07:10.427 --> 00:07:13.317
and businesspeople like clarity,

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:15.982
because then you just get the job done.

00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:18.730
So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.324
You've got illegal logging

00:07:20.324 --> 00:07:23.149
and deforestation still on a very large scale,

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:25.849
or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:27.984
that we can be proud of.

00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:30.066
It's a simple choice, so we've worked

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:32.610
for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.980
with literally hundreds of other organizations,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.420
and there's a point here about collaboration.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.315
So hundreds of others, of NGOs,

00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:41.897
of forest workers' unions, and of businesses,

00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:43.569
have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:45.351
which sets standards for forestry

00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:47.873
and then checks the forestry's good on the ground.

00:07:47.873 --> 00:07:50.116
Now together, through our supply chain,

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:51.983
with partners, we've managed to certify

00:07:51.983 --> 00:07:54.860
35 million hectares of forestry.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.397
That's about the size of Germany.

00:07:57.397 --> 00:07:59.185
And we've decided in the next three years,

00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:01.220
we will double the volume of certified material

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.358
we put through our business.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.998
So be decisive on these issues.

00:08:05.998 --> 00:08:07.969
Use your supply chain to drive good.

00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:09.995
But then it comes to your operations.

00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:12.645
Some things are certain, I think.

00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:15.660
We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.583
We know the sun will be shining somewhere,

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:21.675
and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.

00:08:21.675 --> 00:08:24.327
So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?

00:08:24.327 --> 00:08:26.555
And why not take control of it ourselves?

00:08:26.555 --> 00:08:28.915
So we're going 100 percent renewable.

00:08:28.915 --> 00:08:31.671
By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy

00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:33.691
than the energy we consume as a business.

00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:35.667
For all of our stores, our own factories,

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:37.045
our distribution centers,

00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:39.499
we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:42.873
and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate

00:08:42.873 --> 00:08:45.500
in six countries, and we're not done yet.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.284
But think of a solar panel.

00:08:47.284 --> 00:08:49.463
A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:50.956
The electricity is free.

00:08:50.956 --> 00:08:52.761
Every time the sun comes out after that,

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.196
the electricity is free.

00:08:54.196 --> 00:08:56.213
So this is a good thing for the CFO,

00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:58.156
not just the sustainability guy.

00:08:58.156 --> 00:09:01.190
Every business can do things like this.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.169
But then we've got to look beyond our operations,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.918
and I think everybody would agree

00:09:05.918 --> 00:09:08.290
that now business has to take full responsibility

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.494
for the impacts of your supply chain.

00:09:10.494 --> 00:09:12.810
Many businesses now, fortunately,

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.817
have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,

00:09:14.817 --> 00:09:16.863
but not every business. Far from it.

00:09:16.863 --> 00:09:19.377
And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.

00:09:19.377 --> 00:09:21.118
We found there was a risk

00:09:21.118 --> 00:09:23.120
of child labor in the supply chain,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.630
and people in the business were shocked.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.954
And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.

00:09:28.954 --> 00:09:31.098
So a code of conduct was developed,

00:09:31.098 --> 00:09:34.049
and now we have 80 auditors out in the world

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:36.080
every day making sure all our factories

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.364
secure good working conditions

00:09:38.364 --> 00:09:39.913
and protect human rights

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.174
and make sure there is no child labor.

00:09:42.174 --> 00:09:44.334
But it's not just as simple as making sure

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.366
there's no child labor.

00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:48.566
You've got to say that's not enough today.

00:09:48.566 --> 00:09:50.614
I think we'd all agree that children

00:09:50.614 --> 00:09:52.810
are the most important people in the world

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.707
and the most vulnerable.

00:09:54.707 --> 00:09:56.955
So what can a business do today

00:09:56.955 --> 00:09:58.839
to actually use your total value chain

00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:01.118
to support a better quality of life

00:10:01.118 --> 00:10:02.706
and protect child rights?

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:05.003
We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children

00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:07.478
on developing some new business principles

00:10:07.478 --> 00:10:08.943
with children's rights.

00:10:08.943 --> 00:10:10.760
Increasing numbers of businesses

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.280
are signing up to these,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.743
but actually in a survey, many business leaders

00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:17.610
said they thought their business had nothing to do with children.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.109
So what we decided to do was, we will look

00:10:21.109 --> 00:10:22.670
and ask ourselves the tough questions

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.734
with partners who know more than us,

00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:27.691
what can we do to go beyond our business

00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:29.533
to help improve the lives of children?

00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:31.352
We also have a foundation

00:10:31.352 --> 00:10:33.247
that's committed to work through partners

00:10:33.247 --> 00:10:35.870
and help improve the lives and protect the rights

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.737
of 100 million children by 2015.

00:10:38.737 --> 00:10:40.413
You know the phrase,

00:10:40.413 --> 00:10:43.791
you can manage what you measure?

00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:48.441
Well, you should measure what you care about.

00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:49.990
If you're not measuring things,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.734
you don't care and you don't know.

00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:54.903
So let's take an example, measure the things

00:10:54.903 --> 00:10:57.060
that are important in your business.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.343
Isn't it about time that businesses

00:10:59.343 --> 00:11:02.321
were led equally by men and women?

00:11:02.321 --> 00:11:05.304
(Applause)

00:11:05.304 --> 00:11:10.446
So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA

00:11:10.446 --> 00:11:13.410
that 47 percent are women today,

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.806
but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap

00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:18.093
and follow it all the way through to senior management.

00:11:18.093 --> 00:11:20.939
And we do not want to wait another hundred years.

00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:23.898
So we've launched a women's open network

00:11:23.898 --> 00:11:25.423
this week in IKEA,

00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:27.599
and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:29.014
So the message here is,

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:31.398
measure what you care about and lead the change,

00:11:31.398 --> 00:11:34.401
and don't wait a hundred years.

00:11:34.401 --> 00:11:36.838
So we've gone from sustainability

00:11:36.838 --> 00:11:42.074
being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.

00:11:42.074 --> 00:11:45.226
It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.

00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:50.161
And everybody can do something on this as an individual.

00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:52.357
Be a discerning consumer.

00:11:52.357 --> 00:11:54.055
Vote with your wallets.

00:11:54.055 --> 00:11:56.235
Search out the companies

00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:58.930
that are acting on this.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.977
But also, there are other businesses already acting.

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:04.122
I mentioned renewable energy.

00:12:04.122 --> 00:12:06.440
You go to Google or Lego,

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.700
they're going 100 percent renewable too,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.067
in the same way that we are.

00:12:10.067 --> 00:12:13.193
On having really good sustainability strategies,

00:12:13.193 --> 00:12:16.437
there are companies like Nike, Patagonia,

00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:18.591
Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer.

00:12:18.591 --> 00:12:20.749
But I don't think any of those businesses would say

00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:23.014
they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.

00:12:23.014 --> 00:12:25.380
We'll make mistakes going forward,

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.897
but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,

00:12:27.897 --> 00:12:29.586
having a dialogue with the right partners,

00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:34.102
and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.

00:12:34.102 --> 00:12:36.901
So if you're a business leader,

00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:39.856
if you're not already weaving sustainability

00:12:39.856 --> 00:12:42.264
right into the heart of your business model,

00:12:42.264 --> 00:12:44.155
I'd urge you to do so.

00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:46.130
And together, we can help create

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.130
a sustainable world,

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.259
and, if we get it right,

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:51.748
we can make sustainability

00:12:51.748 --> 00:12:53.370
affordable for the many people,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.067
not a luxury for the few.

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:56.424
Thank you.

00:12:56.424 --> 00:13:01.235
(Applause)
