WEBVTT

00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:02.361
Africa is booming.

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:04.866
Per capita incomes since the year 2000

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.466
have doubled,

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.841
and this boom is impacting on everyone.

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.667
Life expectancy has increased by one year

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.417
every three years for the last decade.

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:18.902
That means if an African child is born today,

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:20.690
rather than three days ago,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.577
they will get an extra day of life

00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:24.600
at the end of their lifespan.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.391
It's that quick.

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.503
And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:

00:00:30.503 --> 00:00:34.753
600,000 less people a year are getting HIV

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.217
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:40.279
The battle against malaria is being won,

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:43.079
with deaths from malaria down 27 percent,

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.841
according to the latest World Bank data.

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.938
And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.110
This shouldn't surprise us,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.859
because actually, everybody grows.

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:54.835
If you go back to Imperial Rome

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:57.040
in the Year 1 A.D.,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.338
there was admittedly about 1,800 years

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:01.585
where there wasn't an awful lot of growth.

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:03.577
But then the people that the Romans

00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:07.392
would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,

00:01:07.392 --> 00:01:09.512
were actually part of the Industrial Revolution,

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:12.200
and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.240
and you saw that get quicker and quicker,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.000
and it's been impacting everyone.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.615
It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.865
or the tundra of northern Finland.

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:25.786
Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:28.120
the inevitable happens.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.741
Among the reasons I think it's happening right now

00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:34.223
is the quality of the leadership across Africa.

00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:37.541
I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s,

00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:41.237
the greatest politician in the world was African,

00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:43.848
but I'm meeting brilliant people

00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:45.712
across the continent the entire time,

00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:47.280
and they're doing the reforms

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.792
which have transformed the economic situation

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:51.573
for their countries.

00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:53.675
And the West is engaging with that.

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:55.994
The West has given debt forgiveness programs

00:01:55.994 --> 00:01:58.497
which have halved sub-Saharan debt

00:01:58.497 --> 00:02:02.215
from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40.

00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:04.904
At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120

00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:06.992
and we're all feeling slightly miserable

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:08.325
as a result.

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:11.440
Politics gets weaker when debt is high.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.403
When public sector debt is low,

00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:14.875
governments don't have to choose

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:17.357
between investing in education and health

00:02:17.357 --> 00:02:19.632
and paying interest on that debt you owe.

00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:22.854
And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good.

00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:24.711
The private sector as well.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.872
Again, in the West, we have private sector debt

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:30.127
of 200 percent of GDP in Spain,

00:02:30.127 --> 00:02:32.418
the U.K., and the U.S.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.493
That's an awful lot of debt.

00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:37.084
Africa, many African countries,

00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:40.570
are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.122
If there's any continent that can do what China has done --

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:47.539
China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart --

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.687
if anyone can do what China has done

00:02:49.687 --> 00:02:51.816
in the last 30 years,

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:54.410
it'll be Africa in the next 30.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.132
So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt.

00:02:57.132 --> 00:02:59.716
Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do.

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:01.530
Foreign direct investment

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.208
has poured into Africa in the last 15 years.

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:07.260
Back in the '70s,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.257
no one touched the continent with a barge pole.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:12.528
And this investment is actually Western-led.

00:03:12.528 --> 00:03:14.369
We hear a lot about China,

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.689
and they do lend a lot of money,

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.264
but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:22.330
has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.936
Ten percent's come from India.

00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:27.166
And they're investing in energy.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:30.416
Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now.

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:33.720
It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.791
And they're investing in telecoms,

00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:37.796
shopping malls.

00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:41.038
And this very encouraging story, I think,

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:42.913
is partly demographic-led.

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:46.250
And it's not just about African demographics.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.225
I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds

00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:51.507
in various parts of the world,

00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:54.898
and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second.

00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:57.353
Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn

00:03:57.353 --> 00:04:00.068
setting up an iPhone factory, by chance.

00:04:00.068 --> 00:04:01.688
You might choose China,

00:04:01.688 --> 00:04:03.890
which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.834
where there's 200 million young people,

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:10.679
and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger.

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.983
Which means you're going to have new guys

00:04:12.983 --> 00:04:15.345
knocking on the door saying, "Give us a job,"

00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:18.580
and, "I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job."

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.168
Now, that's completely changed now.

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:24.312
This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent

00:04:24.312 --> 00:04:28.423
fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China.

00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:31.624
So where do you set up your new factory?

00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:33.411
You look at South Asia, and people are.

00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:35.466
They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh,

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:37.857
and they're also looking at Africa.

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:39.648
And they're looking at Africa

00:04:39.648 --> 00:04:42.162
because that yellow line is showing you

00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:43.822
that the number of young Africans

00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:45.413
is going to continue to get bigger

00:04:45.413 --> 00:04:50.832
decade after decade after decade out to 2050.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.696
Now, there's a problem with lots of young people

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:55.646
coming into any market,

00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:57.190
particularly when they're young men.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.516
A bit dangerous, sometimes.

00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:01.474
I think one of the crucial factors

00:05:01.474 --> 00:05:04.895
is how educated is that demographic?

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:06.827
If you look at the red line here,

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:08.503
what you're going to see is that in 1975,

00:05:08.503 --> 00:05:10.592
just nine percent of kids

00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:12.992
were in secondary school education

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:15.650
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.417
Would you set up a factory

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.307
in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:20.627
Nobody else did.

00:05:20.627 --> 00:05:23.280
They chose instead Turkey and Mexico

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.776
to set up the textiles factories,

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:27.234
because their education levels

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:30.135
were 25 to 30 percent.

00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:33.596
Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:37.332
that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.

00:05:37.332 --> 00:05:40.511
They will get the textiles jobs

00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:43.191
that will take people out of rural poverty

00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:47.855
and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.

00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:50.914
So what's Africa looking like today?

00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:52.575
This is how I look at Africa.

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:54.399
It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:56.310
Each little box is about a billion dollars,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.027
and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention

00:05:58.027 --> 00:06:00.319
to Nigeria sitting there in the middle.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.484
South Africa is playing a role.

00:06:02.484 --> 00:06:04.563
But when I'm thinking about the future,

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:07.114
I'm actually most interested

00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:09.879
in Central, Western and Southern Africa.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.441
If I look at Africa by population,

00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:13.810
East Africa stands out

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.794
as so much potential.

00:06:15.794 --> 00:06:18.826
And I'm showing you something else with these maps.

00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:21.568
I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.

00:06:21.568 --> 00:06:24.821
Fragile democracies is the beige color.

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:27.464
Strong democracies are the orange color.

00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:30.194
And what you'll see here is that most Africans

00:06:30.194 --> 00:06:34.013
are now living in democracies.

00:06:34.013 --> 00:06:36.189
Why does that matter?

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.623
Because what people want

00:06:38.623 --> 00:06:40.758
is what politicians try,

00:06:40.758 --> 00:06:43.849
they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.496
And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:49.372
In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,

00:06:49.372 --> 00:06:51.602
the battle between the two candidates

00:06:51.602 --> 00:06:54.875
was over education.

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.868
One guy offered free secondary school education

00:06:56.868 --> 00:06:59.216
to all, not just 30 percent.

00:06:59.216 --> 00:07:00.535
The other guy had to say,

00:07:00.535 --> 00:07:02.662
I'm going to build 50 new schools.

00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:05.521
He won by a margin.

00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:08.571
So democracy is encouraging governments

00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.171
to invest in education.

00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:12.256
Education is helping growth and investment,

00:07:12.256 --> 00:07:13.668
and that's giving budget revenues,

00:07:13.668 --> 00:07:15.507
which is giving governments more money,

00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:18.713
which is helping growth through education.

00:07:18.713 --> 00:07:21.248
It's a positive, virtuous circle.

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:23.809
But I get asked this question,

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:26.895
and this particular question makes me quite sad:

00:07:26.895 --> 00:07:29.426
It's, "But what about corruption?

00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:33.530
How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?"

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.171
And what makes me sad about it

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:37.196
is that this graph here is showing you

00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:41.161
that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:45.707
When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.

00:07:45.707 --> 00:07:47.820
And the countries on the right hand side,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.543
you'll see the per capita GDP,

00:07:49.543 --> 00:07:51.368
basically every country

00:07:51.368 --> 00:07:54.863
with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,

00:07:54.863 --> 00:07:57.083
has got a corruption score

00:07:57.083 --> 00:08:00.118
of roughly, what's that, about three?

00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:02.401
Three out of 10. That's not good.

00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:04.749
Every poor country is corrupt.

00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:08.891
Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt.

00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:12.894
How do you get from poverty and corruption

00:08:12.894 --> 00:08:15.163
to wealth and less corruption?

00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:17.355
You see the middle class grow.

00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:20.842
And the way to do that is to invest,

00:08:20.842 --> 00:08:24.222
not to say I'm not investing in that continent

00:08:24.222 --> 00:08:26.499
because there's too much corruption.

00:08:26.499 --> 00:08:29.176
Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.

00:08:29.176 --> 00:08:32.115
I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --

00:08:32.115 --> 00:08:34.227
not in Africa, actually.

00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:35.925
But what I'm saying here is that

00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:37.715
we can make a difference

00:08:37.715 --> 00:08:40.621
and we can do that by investing.

00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:44.128
Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:46.995
Economists aren't great at forecasting.

00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:49.107
Because the question really is, what happens next?

00:08:49.107 --> 00:08:51.631
And if you go back to the year 2000,

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.394
what you'll find is The Economist

00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:56.562
had a very famous cover, "The Hopeless Continent,"

00:08:56.562 --> 00:08:58.744
and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:02.874
in Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --

00:09:02.874 --> 00:09:04.978
and they said,

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.511
what's going to happen in the next 10 years?

00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:09.890
They assumed two percent,

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.783
and that made it a pretty hopeless story,

00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:14.933
because population growth was two and a half.

00:09:14.933 --> 00:09:17.713
People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.

00:09:17.713 --> 00:09:21.151
Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover,

00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:22.997
and what does that new cover show?

00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:25.980
That new cover shows, well, Africa rising,

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.707
because the growth over the last 10 years

00:09:27.707 --> 00:09:30.327
has been about five and a half percent.

00:09:30.327 --> 00:09:33.853
I would like to see if you can all now become economists,

00:09:33.853 --> 00:09:36.368
because if growth for the last 10 years

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:38.488
has been five and a half percent,

00:09:38.488 --> 00:09:40.191
what do you think the IMF is forecasting

00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:43.211
for the next five years of growth in Africa?

00:09:43.211 --> 00:09:45.986
Very good. I think you're secretly saying

00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:48.168
to your head, probably five and a half percent.

00:09:48.168 --> 00:09:50.110
You're all economists, and I think,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.592
like most economists, wrong.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.688
No offense.

00:09:54.688 --> 00:09:57.569
What I like to do is try and find the countries

00:09:57.569 --> 00:10:01.730
that are doing exactly what Africa has already done,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.128
and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing

00:10:05.128 --> 00:10:08.175
to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:10.829
India is one of those examples.

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:14.948
This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.862
Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second.

00:10:17.862 --> 00:10:20.232
Actually, for the first 20 years,

00:10:20.232 --> 00:10:23.275
the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.

00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:25.336
It grew at two percent

00:10:25.336 --> 00:10:28.416
when population growth was about two and a half.

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:30.596
If that's familiar, that's exactly what happened

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:32.891
in sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.

00:10:32.891 --> 00:10:34.665
And then something happened in 1980.

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.888
Boom! India began to explode.

00:10:36.888 --> 00:10:39.172
It wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth,"

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:42.228
"democracies can't grow." Actually India could.

00:10:42.228 --> 00:10:45.034
And if I lay sub-Saharan growth

00:10:45.034 --> 00:10:47.302
on top of the Indian growth story,

00:10:47.302 --> 00:10:49.918
it's remarkably similar.

00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:52.205
Twenty years of not much growth

00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:53.759
and a trend line which is actually telling you

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:55.749
that sub-Saharan African growth is

00:10:55.749 --> 00:10:58.310
slightly better than India.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.745
And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.569
I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,

00:11:04.569 --> 00:11:08.675
I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,

00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:10.852
I can draw out some forecasts

00:11:10.852 --> 00:11:13.172
for the next 30 to 40 years

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.242
which I think are better

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:18.094
than the ones where you're looking backwards.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.441
And that tells me this:

00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:22.223
that Africa is going to go

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.260
from a $2 trillion economy today

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.532
to a $29 trillion economy by 2050.

00:11:29.532 --> 00:11:31.540
Now that's bigger than Europe and America

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.998
put together in today's money.

00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:38.918
Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.

00:11:38.918 --> 00:11:40.656
The population's going to double

00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.109
from one billion to two billion,

00:11:42.109 --> 00:11:45.459
so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold

00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:48.323
in the next 35 years.

00:11:48.323 --> 00:11:51.440
And when I present this in Africa --

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.244
Nairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.

00:11:55.244 --> 00:12:00.112
"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?"

00:12:00.112 --> 00:12:01.955
And you know what?

00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:04.344
Actually, I think they've got a point.

00:12:04.344 --> 00:12:06.816
Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned,

00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:10.100
yes from the positives in Asia and India,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.478
but also the negatives?

00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:14.040
Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.435
Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here

00:12:17.435 --> 00:12:19.044
this last week,

00:12:19.044 --> 00:12:20.988
surely some of these can perhaps

00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:23.716
help Africa grow even faster?

00:12:23.716 --> 00:12:26.151
And I think here we can play a role.

00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:28.994
Because technology does let you help.

00:12:28.994 --> 00:12:31.133
You can go and download

00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:33.168
some of the great African literature

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:34.967
from the Internet now.

00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:37.440
No, not right now, just 30 seconds.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.630
You can go and buy some of the great tunes.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.361
My iPod's full of them.

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.051
Buy African products.

00:12:43.051 --> 00:12:45.016
Go on holiday and see for yourself

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:46.565
the change that's happening.

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:47.970
Invest.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.096
Perhaps hire people, give them the skills

00:12:50.096 --> 00:12:52.365
that they can take back to Africa,

00:12:52.365 --> 00:12:54.630
and their companies will grow an awful lot faster

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.280
than most of ours here in the West.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.581
And then you and I can help make sure

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:05.710
that for Africa, the 21st century is their century.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.520
Thank you very much.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.520
(Applause)
