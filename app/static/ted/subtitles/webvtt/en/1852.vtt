00:00:01.617 --> 00:00:03.582
So when I was eight years old,

00:00:03.582 --> 00:00:05.740
a new girl came to join the class,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.773
and she was so impressive,

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:11.055
as the new girl always seems to be.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.733
She had vast quantities of very shiny hair

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.773
and a cute little pencil case,

00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:20.361
super strong on state capitals,

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:22.853
just a great speller.

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:27.803
And I just curdled with jealousy that year,

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:31.346
until I hatched my devious plan.

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:35.579
So one day I stayed a little late after school,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.659
a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.994
When the coast was clear, I emerged,

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:43.733
crept into the classroom,

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:47.590
and took from my teacher's desk the grade book.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.926
And then I did it.

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:52.293
I fiddled with my rival's grades,

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:55.123
just a little, just demoted some of those A's.

00:00:55.123 --> 00:00:58.222
All of those A's. (Laughter)

00:00:58.222 --> 00:01:01.965
And I got ready to return the book to the drawer,

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:04.999
when hang on, some of my other classmates

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:08.492
had appallingly good grades too.

00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:10.540
So, in a frenzy,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.528
I corrected everybody's marks,

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:14.437
not imaginatively.

00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:16.951
I gave everybody a row of D's

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.752
and I gave myself a row of A's,

00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:22.552
just because I was there, you know, might as well.

00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:28.162
And I am still baffled by my behavior.

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.574
I don't understand where the idea came from.

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:33.903
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.426
I felt great.

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:38.005
I don't understand why I was never caught.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:39.601
I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:40.914
I was never caught.

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:43.435
But most of all, I am baffled by,

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:44.942
why did it bother me so much

00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:46.886
that this little girl, this tiny little girl,

00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:48.600
was so good at spelling?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.710
Jealousy baffles me.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.634
It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:56.100
We know babies suffer from jealousy.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.750
We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.270
We know that jealousy is the number one cause

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.186
of spousal murder in the United States.

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.290
And yet, I have never read a study

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.205
that can parse to me its loneliness

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:17.059
or its longevity or its grim thrill.

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.906
For that, we have to go to fiction,

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.246
because the novel is the lab

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:23.820
that has studied jealousy

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.894
in every possible configuration.

00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:29.218
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say

00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:31.250
that if we didn't have jealousy,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.800
would we even have literature?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.390
Well no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey."

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.228
No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights."

00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:43.365
No Shakespeare.

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:45.555
There goes high school reading lists,

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:47.367
because we're losing "Sound and the Fury,"

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.616
we're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises,"

00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:53.743
we're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K."

00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:56.150
No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.911
I know it's fashionable to say that Proust

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.518
has the answers to everything,

00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:02.224
but in the case of jealousy,

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.965
he kind of does.

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:08.951
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,"

00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.952
and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:15.104
and just regular competitiveness, my brand,

00:03:15.104 --> 00:03:17.689
that we can hope to have. (Laughter)

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.116
And we think about Proust, we think

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:21.610
about the sentimental bits, right?

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.565
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:27.746
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:29.772
We forget how harsh his vision was.

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:31.612
We forget how pitiless he is.

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:33.933
I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:36.269
were tough as cat gut.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.317
I don't know what cat gut is,

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:41.218
but let's assume it's formidable.

00:03:41.218 --> 00:03:44.436
Let's look at why they go so well together,

00:03:44.436 --> 00:03:48.114
the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:51.345
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy,

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:54.728
which boils down into person, desire, impediment,

00:03:54.728 --> 00:03:59.396
is such a solid narrative foundation?

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:02.071
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,

00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:04.120
because let's think about what happens

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.898
when we feel jealous.

00:04:05.898 --> 00:04:09.850
When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.133
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.807
and these stories make us feel terrible

00:04:16.807 --> 00:04:19.030
because they're designed to make us feel terrible.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.564
As the teller of the tale and the audience,

00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:23.538
we know just what details to include,

00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:27.107
to dig that knife in. Right?

00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:30.462
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,

00:04:30.462 --> 00:04:32.478
and this is something Proust understood.

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:35.651
In the first volume, Swann's Way,

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:37.475
the series of books,

00:04:37.475 --> 00:04:39.181
Swann, one of the main characters,

00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:42.409
is thinking very fondly of his mistress

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.101
and how great she is in bed,

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:47.143
and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,

00:04:47.143 --> 00:04:49.184
and these are Proustian sentences,

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:50.696
so they're long as rivers,

00:04:50.696 --> 00:04:52.959
but in the course of a few sentences,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.366
he suddenly recoils and he realizes,

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:58.649
"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.420
somebody else would love about this woman.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.511
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:07.220
could be giving somebody else pleasure,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.498
maybe right about now."

00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:12.282
And this is the story he starts to tell himself,

00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:14.145
and from then on, Proust writes that

00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:17.192
every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.856
he adds to his "collection of instruments

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:23.478
in his private torture chamber."

00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:25.753
Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit,

00:05:25.753 --> 00:05:27.429
were notoriously jealous.

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:29.133
You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:31.737
the country if they wanted to break up with him.

00:05:31.737 --> 00:05:34.640
But you don't have to be that jealous

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.551
to concede that it's hard work. Right?

00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:39.160
Jealousy is exhausting.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.807
It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.

00:05:42.807 --> 00:05:44.896
And what does jealousy like?

00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:47.986
Jealousy likes information.

00:05:47.986 --> 00:05:50.375
Jealousy likes details.

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:53.198
Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,

00:05:53.198 --> 00:05:55.664
the cute little pencil case.

00:05:55.664 --> 00:05:57.206
Jealousy likes photos.

00:05:57.206 --> 00:06:00.936
That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter)

00:06:00.936 --> 00:06:04.897
Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.339
When Swann is in his jealous throes,

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.510
and suddenly he's listening at doorways

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.533
and bribing his mistress' servants,

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:12.985
he defends these behaviors.

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:15.402
He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,

00:06:15.402 --> 00:06:17.208
but it is no different

00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:19.558
from interpreting an ancient text

00:06:19.558 --> 00:06:21.225
or looking at a monument."

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.822
He says, "They are scientific investigations

00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:26.825
with real intellectual value."

00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:28.937
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy

00:06:28.937 --> 00:06:31.828
feels intolerable and makes us look absurd,

00:06:31.828 --> 00:06:36.498
but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,

00:06:36.498 --> 00:06:39.899
a quest for truth, painful truth,

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.828
and actually, where Proust is concerned,

00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:44.620
the more painful the truth, the better.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.357
Grief, humiliation, loss:

00:06:49.357 --> 00:06:52.313
These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.

00:06:52.313 --> 00:06:56.215
He says, "A woman whom we need,

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:59.001
who makes us suffer, elicits from us

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.506
a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital

00:07:02.506 --> 00:07:06.945
than a man of genius who interests us."

00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:09.820
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.117
No. I think he's trying to say

00:07:12.117 --> 00:07:15.286
that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:18.182
And does any other emotion crack us open

00:07:18.182 --> 00:07:20.510
in this particular way?

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.590
Does any other emotion reveal to us

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.923
our aggression and our hideous ambition

00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:28.322
and our entitlement?

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.972
Does any other emotion teach us to look

00:07:30.972 --> 00:07:34.164
with such peculiar intensity?

00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:36.316
Freud would write about this later.

00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:38.570
One day, Freud was visited

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.892
by this very anxious young man who was consumed

00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:43.395
with the thought of his wife cheating on him.

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:45.472
And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,

00:07:45.472 --> 00:07:47.586
because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.

00:07:47.586 --> 00:07:49.557
Because she's blameless; everybody knows it.

00:07:49.557 --> 00:07:50.887
The poor creature is just

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.885
under suspicion for no cause.

00:07:52.885 --> 00:07:55.694
But he's looking for things that his wife is doing

00:07:55.694 --> 00:07:58.194
without noticing, unintentional behaviors.

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:00.511
Is she smiling too brightly here,

00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:03.851
or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.527
[Freud] says that the man is becoming

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:10.875
the custodian of his wife's unconscious.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:12.696
The novel is very good on this point.

00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:15.504
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy

00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:19.488
trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.

00:08:19.488 --> 00:08:23.563
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are,

00:08:23.563 --> 00:08:26.082
the more we become residents of fantasy.

00:08:26.082 --> 00:08:29.002
And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't

00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:31.818
just provoke us to do violent things

00:08:31.818 --> 00:08:33.818
or illegal things.

00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:36.100
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.458
that are wildly inventive.

00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:40.901
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,

00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:44.920
but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.828
A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:51.697
creating a fake Facebook account

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:55.420
from which she sent vile, hideous messages

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.645
to herself for a year.

00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:01.770
For a year. A year.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.645
And she was trying to frame

00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:05.802
her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,

00:09:05.802 --> 00:09:09.443
and I have to confess when I heard this,

00:09:09.443 --> 00:09:11.355
I just reacted with admiration.

00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:12.932
(Laughter)

00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:15.347
Because, I mean, let's be real.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:19.664
What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?

00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:22.084
This is something from a novel.

00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:25.485
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.

00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:27.655
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.

00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:31.707
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.

00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:33.900
She's the author of "Strangers on a Train"

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.948
and "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"

00:09:35.948 --> 00:09:39.013
books that are all about how jealousy,

00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:40.888
it muddles our minds,

00:09:40.888 --> 00:09:43.882
and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,

00:09:43.882 --> 00:09:49.145
the membrane between what is and what could be

00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:52.038
can be pierced in an instant.

00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:54.486
Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.

00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:57.325
Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you

00:09:57.325 --> 00:09:59.501
or wanting what you have

00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:02.929
to being you and having what you once had,

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:04.462
and you're under the floorboards,

00:10:04.462 --> 00:10:05.825
he's answering to your name,

00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:07.517
he's wearing your rings,

00:10:07.517 --> 00:10:09.518
emptying your bank account.

00:10:09.518 --> 00:10:11.493
That's one way to go.

00:10:11.493 --> 00:10:15.157
But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.

00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:17.194
I can't give the world D's,

00:10:17.194 --> 00:10:20.041
as much as I would really like to, some days.

00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:23.539
And it's a pity, because we live in envious times.

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:26.446
We live in jealous times.

00:10:26.446 --> 00:10:28.459
I mean, we're all good citizens of social media,

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:31.843
aren't we, where the currency is envy?

00:10:31.843 --> 00:10:36.312
Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.

00:10:36.312 --> 00:10:39.753
So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,

00:10:39.753 --> 00:10:41.929
when they are in possession of a mystery.

00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:44.203
Let's go to 221B Baker Street

00:10:44.203 --> 00:10:46.221
and ask for Sherlock Holmes.

00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:48.690
When people think of Holmes,

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.799
they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,

00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:54.006
right, this criminal mastermind.

00:10:54.006 --> 00:10:56.469
But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,

00:10:56.469 --> 00:10:59.374
who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard

00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:01.104
who needs Holmes desperately,

00:11:01.104 --> 00:11:03.408
needs Holmes' genius, but resents him.

00:11:03.408 --> 00:11:05.265
Oh, it's so familiar to me.

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:09.282
So Lestrade needs his help, resents him,

00:11:09.282 --> 00:11:12.593
and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.

00:11:12.593 --> 00:11:16.470
But as they work together, something starts to change,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.513
and finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:23.443
once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,

00:11:23.443 --> 00:11:26.884
Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says,

00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:31.165
"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.

00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:34.524
We're proud of you."

00:11:34.524 --> 00:11:36.853
And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard

00:11:36.853 --> 00:11:39.852
who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.

00:11:39.852 --> 00:11:42.237
It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:44.332
in the mysteries, and I find it very moving,

00:11:44.332 --> 00:11:47.396
this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?

00:11:47.396 --> 00:11:49.309
It seems to treat jealousy

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:52.047
as a problem of geometry, not emotion.

00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:54.913
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:56.836
The next minute they're on the same side.

00:11:56.836 --> 00:11:58.983
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself

00:11:58.983 --> 00:12:01.950
admire this mind that he's resented.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.879
Could it be so simple though?

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:06.310
What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.020
just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.350
in relation to another?

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.221
Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent

00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:16.282
somebody's excellence.

00:12:16.282 --> 00:12:19.656
We could align ourselves with it.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.912
But I like contingency plans.

00:12:21.912 --> 00:12:24.248
So while we wait for that to happen,

00:12:24.248 --> 00:12:26.944
let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.

00:12:26.944 --> 00:12:29.395
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.

00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:31.478
Fiction alone domesticates it,

00:12:31.478 --> 00:12:33.356
invites it to the table.

00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:35.229
And look who it gathers:

00:12:35.229 --> 00:12:39.065
sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,

00:12:39.065 --> 00:12:43.534
crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.

00:12:43.534 --> 00:12:45.948
We are in excellent company.

00:12:45.948 --> 00:12:47.368
Thank you.

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:52.184
(Applause)
