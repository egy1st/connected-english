WEBVTT

00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:03.523
So last year, on the Fourth of July,

00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:06.022
experiments at the Large Hadron Collider

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:08.312
discovered the Higgs boson.

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:10.280
It was a historical day.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.575
There's no doubt that from now on,

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:14.409
the Fourth of July will be remembered

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.851
not as the day of the Declaration of Independence,

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.685
but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.117
Well, at least, here at CERN.

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:27.272
But for me, the biggest surprise of that day

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:29.771
was that there was no big surprise.

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.370
In the eye of a theoretical physicist,

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.263
the Higgs boson is a clever explanation

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:37.786
of how some elementary particles gain mass,

00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:40.622
but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory

00:00:40.622 --> 00:00:42.828
and incomplete solution.

00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:45.852
Too many questions are left unanswered.

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:48.687
The Higgs boson does not share the beauty,

00:00:48.687 --> 00:00:50.572
the symmetry, the elegance,

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:53.300
of the rest of the elementary particle world.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.922
For this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.864
believe that the Higgs boson could not

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:02.346
be the full story.

00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:05.200
We were expecting new particles and new phenomena

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.650
accompanying the Higgs boson.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.968
Instead, so far, the measurements

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:13.726
coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.875
or unexpected phenomena.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:19.528
Of course, the verdict is not definitive.

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:23.522
In 2015, the LHC will almost double

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:26.213
the energy of the colliding protons,

00:01:26.213 --> 00:01:28.284
and these more powerful collisions

00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:32.868
will allow us to explore further the particle world,

00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:36.000
and we will certainly learn much more.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.146
But for the moment, since we have found

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:42.295
no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose

00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:45.459
that the particles that we know today,

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.315
including the Higgs boson,

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:50.600
are the only elementary particles in nature,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.344
even at energies much larger

00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:56.110
than what we have explored so far.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.742
Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.

00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:04.174
We will find a surprising and intriguing result

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:07.973
about our universe, and to explain my point,

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:11.849
let me first tell you what the Higgs is about,

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.983
and to do so, we have to go back

00:02:14.983 --> 00:02:19.340
to one tenth of a billionth of a second

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.871
after the Big Bang.

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:22.912
And according to the Higgs theory,

00:02:22.912 --> 00:02:26.278
at that instant, a dramatic event took place

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:27.869
in the universe.

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:32.660
Space-time underwent a phase transition.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.737
It was something very similar to the phase transition

00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:39.282
that occurs when water turns into ice

00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:41.243
below zero degrees.

00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:44.183
But in our case, the phase transition

00:02:44.183 --> 00:02:46.714
is not a change in the way the molecules

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:49.000
are arranged inside the material,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.888
but is about a change

00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:54.514
of the very fabric of space-time.

00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:57.140
During this phase transition, empty space

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.812
became filled with a substance

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:02.844
that we now call Higgs field.

00:03:02.844 --> 00:03:05.173
And this substance may seem invisible to us,

00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:07.851
but it has a physical reality.

00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:09.909
It surrounds us all the time,

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.610
just like the air we breathe in this room.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.928
And some elementary particles interact

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:19.756
with this substance, gaining energy in the process.

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:22.831
And this intrinsic energy is what we call

00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:24.964
the mass of a particle,

00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:28.217
and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC

00:03:28.217 --> 00:03:32.749
has conclusively proved that this substance is real,

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.668
because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.

00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:40.112
And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:44.855
But this story is far more interesting than that.

00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:47.166
By studying the Higgs theory,

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:49.526
theoretical physicists discovered,

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:51.430
not through an experiment

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.906
but with the power of mathematics,

00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:57.618
that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist

00:03:57.618 --> 00:04:00.955
only in the form that we observe today.

00:04:00.955 --> 00:04:06.000
Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.572
so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,

00:04:10.572 --> 00:04:13.926
could exist in two states.

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:16.236
Besides the known Higgs state,

00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:19.383
there could be a second state in which the Higgs field

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:22.919
is billions and billions times denser

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.964
than what we observe today,

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:28.451
and the mere existence of another state

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.696
of the Higgs field poses a potential problem.

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:35.934
This is because, according to the laws

00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:38.627
of quantum mechanics, it is possible

00:04:38.627 --> 00:04:41.459
to have transitions between two states,

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:44.408
even in the presence of an energy barrier

00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:47.036
separating the two states,

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.245
and the phenomenon is called,

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:53.387
quite appropriately, quantum tunneling.

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:55.278
Because of quantum tunneling,

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:57.811
I could disappear from this room

00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:01.133
and reappear in the next room,

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:04.528
practically penetrating the wall.

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:07.343
But don't expect me to actually perform the trick

00:05:07.343 --> 00:05:09.921
in front of your eyes, because the probability

00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:14.309
for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:16.907
You would have to wait a really long time

00:05:16.907 --> 00:05:19.039
before it happens, but believe me,

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.216
quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:25.411
and it has been observed in many systems.

00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:27.973
For instance, the tunnel diode,

00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:30.170
a component used in electronics,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.592
works thanks to the wonders

00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:34.912
of quantum tunneling.

00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:37.204
But let's go back to the Higgs field.

00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:41.767
If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:44.121
then, because of quantum tunneling,

00:05:44.121 --> 00:05:47.834
a bubble of this state could suddenly appear

00:05:47.834 --> 00:05:51.076
in a certain place of the universe at a certain time,

00:05:51.076 --> 00:05:54.841
and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.

00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:57.930
Bubbles of vapor form inside the water,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.786
then they expand, turning liquid into gas.

00:06:01.786 --> 00:06:06.590
In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.017
could come into existence because of quantum tunneling.

00:06:10.017 --> 00:06:12.854
The bubble would then expand at the speed of light,

00:06:12.854 --> 00:06:16.340
invading all space, and turning the Higgs field

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.989
from the familiar state into a new state.

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:24.150
Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.895
We may not realize it in ordinary life,

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:30.100
but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.745
for the structure of matter.

00:06:32.745 --> 00:06:36.818
If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,

00:06:36.818 --> 00:06:39.762
we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying

00:06:39.762 --> 00:06:43.448
inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,

00:06:43.448 --> 00:06:45.788
and hydrogen would be

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:50.140
the only possible chemical element in the universe.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.151
And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,

00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:56.965
is not just a few times more intense than today,

00:06:56.965 --> 00:06:59.160
but billions of times,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.362
and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,

00:07:02.362 --> 00:07:05.515
all atomic matter would collapse.

00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:10.005
No molecular structures would be possible, no life.

00:07:10.005 --> 00:07:13.343
So, I wonder, is it possible

00:07:13.343 --> 00:07:15.929
that in the future, the Higgs field

00:07:15.929 --> 00:07:18.494
will undergo a phase transition and,

00:07:18.494 --> 00:07:21.623
through quantum tunneling, will be transformed

00:07:21.623 --> 00:07:26.310
into this nasty, ultra-dense state?

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.835
In other words, I ask myself, what is the fate

00:07:29.835 --> 00:07:32.918
of the Higgs field in our universe?

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:35.169
And the crucial ingredient necessary

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:39.555
to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.

00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:43.666
And experiments at the LHC found that the mass

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:47.940
of the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.976
This is tiny when expressed in familiar units,

00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:52.296
because it's equal to something like

00:07:52.296 --> 00:07:54.503
10 to the minus 22 grams,

00:07:54.503 --> 00:07:58.473
but it is large in particle physics units,

00:07:58.473 --> 00:08:00.577
because it is equal to the weight

00:08:00.577 --> 00:08:02.823
of an entire molecule

00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:05.243
of a DNA constituent.

00:08:05.243 --> 00:08:08.630
So armed with this information from the LHC,

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.574
together with some colleagues here at CERN,

00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:12.483
we computed the probability

00:08:12.483 --> 00:08:15.498
that our universe could quantum tunnel

00:08:15.498 --> 00:08:18.616
into the ultra-dense Higgs state,

00:08:18.616 --> 00:08:22.293
and we found a very intriguing result.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.442
Our calculations showed

00:08:24.442 --> 00:08:27.614
that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass

00:08:27.614 --> 00:08:29.459
is very special.

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:32.378
It has just the right value

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:35.071
to keep the universe hanging

00:08:35.071 --> 00:08:37.641
in an unstable situation.

00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:40.897
The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration

00:08:40.897 --> 00:08:42.946
that has lasted so far

00:08:42.946 --> 00:08:45.991
but that will eventually collapse.

00:08:45.991 --> 00:08:49.170
So according to these calculations,

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.200
we are like campers

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.652
who accidentally set their tent

00:08:53.652 --> 00:08:55.446
at the edge of a cliff.

00:08:55.446 --> 00:08:57.236
And eventually, the Higgs field

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:59.172
will undergo a phase transition

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:02.216
and matter will collapse into itself.

00:09:02.216 --> 00:09:05.660
So is this how humanity is going to disappear?

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.415
I don't think so.

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:10.768
Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling

00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:14.424
of the Higgs field is not likely to occur

00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:17.928
in the next 10 to the 100 years,

00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:20.970
and this is a very long time.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.738
It's even longer than

00:09:22.738 --> 00:09:26.407
the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.

00:09:26.407 --> 00:09:28.814
(Laughter)

00:09:28.814 --> 00:09:32.605
Even so, we will be long gone by then.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:35.213
In about five billion years,

00:09:35.213 --> 00:09:37.670
our sun will become a red giant,

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.183
as large as the Earth's orbit,

00:09:40.183 --> 00:09:43.460
and our Earth will be kaput,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.817
and in a thousand billion years,

00:09:45.817 --> 00:09:48.103
if dark energy keeps on fueling

00:09:48.103 --> 00:09:50.938
space expansion at the present rate,

00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:55.115
you will not even be able to see as far as your toes,

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:56.812
because everything around you

00:09:56.812 --> 00:10:00.513
expands at a rate faster than the speed of light.

00:10:00.513 --> 00:10:02.498
So it is really unlikely

00:10:02.498 --> 00:10:06.368
that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.

00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:09.947
But the reason why I am interested

00:10:09.947 --> 00:10:11.959
in the transition of the Higgs field

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:15.244
is because I want to address the question,

00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:20.209
why is the Higgs boson mass so special?

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:23.183
Why is it just right to keep the universe

00:10:23.183 --> 00:10:26.673
at the edge of a phase transition?

00:10:26.673 --> 00:10:30.535
Theoretical physicists always ask "why" questions.

00:10:30.535 --> 00:10:33.210
More than how a phenomenon works,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.682
theoretical physicists are always interested in

00:10:35.682 --> 00:10:38.914
why a phenomenon works in the way it works.

00:10:38.914 --> 00:10:42.276
We think that this these "why" questions

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:43.999
can give us clues

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:47.537
about the fundamental principles of nature.

00:10:47.537 --> 00:10:51.442
And indeed, a possible answer to my question

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:55.806
opens up new universes, literally.

00:10:55.806 --> 00:10:59.247
It has been speculated that our universe

00:10:59.247 --> 00:11:03.380
is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.943
made out of a multitude of bubbles,

00:11:05.943 --> 00:11:08.159
and each bubble is a different universe

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:10.053
with different fundamental constants

00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:11.918
and different physical laws.

00:11:11.918 --> 00:11:13.924
And in this context, you can only talk about

00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:18.635
the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.

00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:20.978
Then the key to the mystery

00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:24.241
could lie in the statistical properties

00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:26.469
of the multiverse.

00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:28.883
It would be something like what happens

00:11:28.883 --> 00:11:31.120
with sand dunes on a beach.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.992
In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes

00:11:33.992 --> 00:11:36.422
of any slope angle in a beach,

00:11:36.422 --> 00:11:40.583
and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes

00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:44.053
are typically around 30, 35 degrees.

00:11:44.053 --> 00:11:45.721
And the reason is simple:

00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:49.399
because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:52.283
As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes

00:11:52.283 --> 00:11:56.202
have slope angles around the critical value,

00:11:56.202 --> 00:11:58.186
near to collapse.

00:11:58.186 --> 00:12:01.183
And something similar could happen

00:12:01.183 --> 00:12:05.720
for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.592
In the majority of bubble universes,

00:12:08.592 --> 00:12:11.649
the Higgs mass could be around the critical value,

00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:15.245
near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,

00:12:15.245 --> 00:12:17.192
because of two competing effects,

00:12:17.192 --> 00:12:20.778
just as in the case of sand.

00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:23.923
My story does not have an end,

00:12:23.923 --> 00:12:27.658
because we still don't know the end of the story.

00:12:27.658 --> 00:12:30.946
This is science in progress,

00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:34.780
and to solve the mystery, we need more data,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.396
and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues

00:12:39.396 --> 00:12:42.017
to this story.

00:12:42.017 --> 00:12:45.847
Just one number, the Higgs boson mass,

00:12:45.847 --> 00:12:51.176
and yet, out of this number we learn so much.

00:12:51.176 --> 00:12:54.223
I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles

00:12:54.223 --> 00:12:56.259
are all there is in the universe,

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:58.965
even beyond the domain explored so far.

00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:02.733
From this, we discovered that the Higgs field

00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:06.176
that permeates space-time may be standing

00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:10.733
on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,

00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:14.283
and we discovered that this may be a hint

00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:18.316
that our universe is only a grain of sand

00:13:18.316 --> 00:13:21.929
in a giant beach, the multiverse.

00:13:21.929 --> 00:13:25.180
But I don't know if my hypothesis is right.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.863
That's how physics works: A single measurement

00:13:28.863 --> 00:13:31.727
can put us on the road to a new understanding

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:33.390
of the universe

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.409
or it can send us down a blind alley.

00:13:36.409 --> 00:13:38.973
But whichever it turns out to be,

00:13:38.973 --> 00:13:42.165
there is one thing I'm sure of:

00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:45.514
The journey will be full of surprises.

00:13:45.514 --> 00:13:46.887
Thank you.

00:13:46.887 --> 00:13:52.135
(Applause)
