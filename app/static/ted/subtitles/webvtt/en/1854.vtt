00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:03.054
My work focuses on the connection of

00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:06.561
both thinking about our community life

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:08.221
being part of the environment

00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.509
where architecture grows from the natural

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.981
local conditions and traditions.

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.130
Today I brought two recent projects

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.403
as an example of this.

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.479
Both projects are in emerging countries,

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:23.518
one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:25.277
And also they have in common

00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:28.309
that the different analyses from different perspectives

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.892
becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.

00:00:32.892 --> 00:00:35.634
The first example started with an invitation

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.657
to design a multistory shopping mall

00:00:37.657 --> 00:00:39.962
in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:42.257
And this is the type of building

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:45.082
we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:47.246
of what we had to design.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.321
At first, the first thing I thought was,

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:51.271
I want to run away.

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:53.332
(Laughter)

00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:55.640
After seeing a few of these buildings --

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.440
there are many in the city --

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.882
we realized that they have three very big points.

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:02.978
First, these buildings, they are almost empty

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:04.759
because they have very large shops

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.730
where people cannot afford to buy things.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.570
Second, they need tons of energy to perform

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.738
because of the skin treatment with glass

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:14.706
that creates heat in the inside,

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:16.346
and then you need a lot of cooling.

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:18.307
In a city where this shouldn't happen

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.202
because they have really mild weather

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:23.951
that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:27.141
And third is that their image has nothing to do

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.296
with Africa and with Ethiopia.

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:34.898
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.

00:01:34.898 --> 00:01:37.718
Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:39.846
I was really captivated by the old merkato

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:42.027
that is this open-air structure

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:43.919
where thousands of people, they go and buy things

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:46.286
every day from small vendors.

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:48.574
And also it has this idea of the public space

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:51.816
that uses the outdoors to create activity.

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:55.182
So I thought, this is what I really want to design,

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:56.971
not a shopping mall.

00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.251
But the question was how we could do a multistory,

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:03.140
contemporary building with these principles.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.596
The next challenge was when we looked at the site,

00:02:05.596 --> 00:02:08.144
that is, in a really growing area of the city,

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:10.628
where most of these buildings that you see in the image,

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:12.230
they were not there.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.902
And it's also between two parallel streets

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.269
that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.663
So the first thing we did was to create a connection

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:22.399
between these two streets,

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.598
putting all the entrances of the building.

00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:27.383
And this extends with an inclined atrium

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:29.711
that creates an open-air space in the building

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:32.440
that self-protects itself with its own shape

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.242
from the sun and the rain.

00:02:34.242 --> 00:02:35.898
And around this void

00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:39.201
we placed this idea of the market with small shops,

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:42.971
that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.

00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.242
I also thought, how to close the building?

00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:47.152
And I really wanted to find a solution

00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:50.615
that would respond to the local climate conditions.

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:52.723
And I started thinking about the textile

00:02:52.723 --> 00:02:54.604
like a shell made of concrete

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:58.175
with perforations that would let the air in,

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:00.799
and also the light, but in a filtered way.

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.603
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful 
patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.778
That they have fractal geometry properties

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:10.909
and this helped me to shape the whole facade.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.514
And we are building that

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:14.655
with these small prefabricated pieces

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:18.093
that are the windows that let the air and the light

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.075
in a controlled way inside the building.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.457
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses

00:03:22.457 --> 00:03:25.060
that use the light from the inside of the building

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.946
to light up the building at night.

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:32.068
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers

00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:33.224
because they were like,

00:03:33.224 --> 00:03:35.912
"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."

00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:41.721
But then we all realized that this idea of the market

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.495
happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:47.215
because basically they had more shops to sell.

00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:51.289
And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.517
not only because of the material compared with the glass,

00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:56.205
but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.362
So we created some budget savings

00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.259
that we used to implement the project.

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.191
And the first implementation was to think

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:05.431
about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy

00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:08.765
in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:12.982
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:15.063
And then under those panels

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:18.799
we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.613
that would create this urban oasis.

00:04:21.613 --> 00:04:23.403
And these porches on the roof,

00:04:23.403 --> 00:04:28.139
all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.301
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.

00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:36.356
The second example is a master plan

00:04:36.356 --> 00:04:39.635
of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.

00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:43.569
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.834
I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:49.956
but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.064
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:57.041
that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,

00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.490
opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.859
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:09.879
was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.063
similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:16.054
and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.

00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:18.839
On top of that, we selected some strategic points

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.040
reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.810
and this modified this initial pattern.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.260
And the last operation was to think about the cell,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.950
the small cell of the project, like the apartment,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.728
as an essential part of the master plan.

00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:34.901
And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.200
in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.963
And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house

00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:44.826
and then a natural ventilation.

00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:48.412
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments

00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:50.552
are perfectly oriented in that direction.

00:05:50.552 --> 00:05:52.012
And this is the result

00:05:52.012 --> 00:05:55.777
that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.

00:05:55.777 --> 00:05:57.375
It has these blocks with courtyards,

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.498
and then on the ground floor

00:05:58.498 --> 00:06:00.634
you have all these connections for the pedestrians.

00:06:00.634 --> 00:06:03.741
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish

00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:07.404
a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.

00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:10.950
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.842
The volume has this connecting shape

00:06:12.842 --> 00:06:16.144
that shades itself with three different types of apartments

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:19.787
and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood

00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:22.687
And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,

00:06:22.687 --> 00:06:24.417
such as a gym and a kindergarten

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:28.487
and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.

00:06:28.487 --> 00:06:31.287
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project

00:06:31.287 --> 00:06:34.997
is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.

00:06:34.997 --> 00:06:37.281
And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,

00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.818
and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,

00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:44.202
jumping from one building to another.

00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:46.561
These two examples,

00:06:46.561 --> 00:06:49.945
they have a common approach in the design process.

00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:52.524
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see

00:06:52.524 --> 00:06:54.670
the cities literally growing.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.411
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow

00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:04.552
changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:07.160
For this reason, I see even more importance

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.190
to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.251
that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment

00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:20.169
and that aim to connect nature and people.

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.067
Thank you very much.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.894
(Applause)
