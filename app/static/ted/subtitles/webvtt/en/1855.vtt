WEBVTT

00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:03.117
Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that

00:00:03.117 --> 00:00:05.197
companies, the really cool companies,

00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:06.709
the innovative ones, the creative,

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:08.511
new economy-type companies --

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:11.885
Apple, Google, Facebook --

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:14.573
are coming out of one particular country,

00:00:14.573 --> 00:00:16.304
the United States of America?

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.262
Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:19.740
That's Europe." But, yeah.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.424
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:25.392
Now what I do is I'm an economist,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.880
and I actually study the relationship

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.925
between innovation and economic growth

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:31.824
at the level of the company, the industry and the nation,

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.939
and I work with policymakers worldwide,

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:35.410
especially in the European Commission,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.721
but recently also in interesting places like China,

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:40.596
and I can tell you that that question

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:43.196
is on the tip of all of their tongues:

00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:45.415
Where are the European Googles?

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:49.160
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.168
which they understand is different

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:54.049
from this old economy growth model?

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.728
And what is interesting is that often,

00:00:56.728 --> 00:00:58.307
even if we're in the 21st century,

00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:00.690
we kind of come down in the end to these ideas

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.663
of market versus state.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:04.715
It's talked about in these modern ways,

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:08.478
but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:12.264
the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,

00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:15.536
the private initiative, whether this be about

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:17.750
a dynamic venture capital sector

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.096
that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:21.769
to these innovative companies,

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:23.894
the gazelles as we often call them,

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:25.889
which traditional banks are scared of,

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:27.921
or different types of really successful

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.927
commercialization policies which actually allow these companies

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:33.182
to bring these great inventions, their products,

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:35.205
to the market and actually get over this

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:37.456
really scary Death Valley period

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:40.022
in which many companies instead fail.

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:42.798
But what really interests me, especially nowadays

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:45.759
and because of what's happening politically around the world,

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.012
is the language that's used, the narrative,

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:52.171
the discourse, the images, the actual words.

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:54.476
So we often are presented

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:57.449
with the kind of words like that the private sector

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:59.719
is also much more innovative because it's able to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.319
think out of the box.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.572
They are more dynamic.

00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:06.326
Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:09.464
to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,

00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:11.556
where he said to be innovative,

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:14.326
you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.

00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:15.861
Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry

00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:18.012
and foolish and colorful guys, right?

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.965
And in places like Europe,

00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.550
it might be more equitable,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.112
we might even be a bit better dressed

00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:25.378
and eat better than the U.S.,

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:29.410
but the problem is this damn public sector.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.403
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.168
these things like dynamic venture capital

00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:38.902
and commercialization to actually be able to really

00:02:38.902 --> 00:02:40.606
be as fruitful as it could.

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:42.558
And even really respectable newspapers,

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:44.645
some that I'm actually subscribed to,

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.598
the words they use are, you know,

00:02:46.598 --> 00:02:49.701
the state as this Leviathan. Right?

00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:51.834
This monster with big tentacles.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:53.738
They're very explicit in these editorials.

00:02:53.738 --> 00:02:56.267
They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:58.193
to fix these little market failures

00:02:58.193 --> 00:02:59.952
when you have public goods

00:02:59.952 --> 00:03:02.784
or different types of negative externalities like pollution,

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:05.839
but you know what, what is the next big revolution

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:07.257
going to be after the Internet?

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:09.191
We all hope it might be something green,

00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:13.400
or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say --

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.266
this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution --

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:18.921
they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:21.409
Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.432
Even fund the basic research, because this is

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:26.101
popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:28.259
which private companies don't want to invest in,

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:29.820
do that, but you know what?

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.600
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.897
Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.

00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:37.524
They're often called garage tinkerers,

00:03:37.524 --> 00:03:39.554
because some of them actually did some things in garages,

00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:42.129
even though that's partly a myth.

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.423
And so what I want to do with you in, oh God,

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:45.607
only 10 minutes,

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:48.597
is to really think again this juxtaposition,

00:03:48.597 --> 00:03:51.456
because it actually has massive, massive implications

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:52.950
beyond innovation policy,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.710
which just happens to be the area

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.590
that I often talk with with policymakers.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.308
It has huge implications, even with this whole notion

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:04.508
that we have on where, when and why

00:04:04.508 --> 00:04:07.581
we should actually be cutting back on public spending

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.626
and different types of public services which,

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:11.383
of course, as we know, are increasingly being

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:13.445
outsourced because of this juxtaposition.

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.908
Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools

00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:20.770
is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.521
by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.

00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:25.504
So these kind of words are constantly,

00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:27.368
these juxtapositions come up everywhere,

00:04:27.368 --> 00:04:30.216
not just with innovation policy.

00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:31.887
And so to think again,

00:04:31.887 --> 00:04:34.293
there's no reason that you should believe me,

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:35.755
so just think of some of the smartest

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:38.026
revolutionary things that you have in your pockets

00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:40.968
and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:43.614
Ask who actually funded the really cool,

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:45.746
revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box

00:04:45.746 --> 00:04:47.533
things in the iPhone.

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:49.276
What actually makes your phone

00:04:49.276 --> 00:04:51.195
a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?

00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:53.286
So the Internet, which you can surf the web

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:54.994
anywhere you are in the world;

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.578
GPS, where you can actually know where you are

00:04:57.578 --> 00:04:58.911
anywhere in the world;

00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:01.044
the touchscreen display, which makes it also

00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:03.509
a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.226
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:11.627
and they're all government-funded.

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.216
And the point is that the Internet

00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:16.460
was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.355
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:23.113
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.

00:05:23.113 --> 00:05:25.052
The touchscreen display was funded

00:05:25.052 --> 00:05:29.847
by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF

00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:34.302
to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.

00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:36.520
Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.855
the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,"

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.107
but what's really interesting is that this is actually true

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:44.115
in sector after sector and department after department.

00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:46.253
So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally

00:05:46.253 --> 00:05:48.182
very interested in because I've actually had the fortune

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:50.896
to study it in quite some depth,

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:53.073
is wonderful to be asking this question

00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:55.820
about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.836
because each and every medicine can actually be

00:05:57.836 --> 00:06:01.807
divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.

00:06:01.807 --> 00:06:04.580
So the new molecular entities with priority rating

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.855
are the revolutionary new drugs,

00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:09.756
whereas the slight variations of existing drugs --

00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:11.747
Viagra, different color, different dosage --

00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:14.040
are the less revolutionary ones.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.897
And it turns out that a full 75 percent

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:19.674
of the new molecular entities with priority rating

00:06:19.674 --> 00:06:24.785
are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:27.468
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.

00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:29.519
They do. They spend on the marketing part.

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.667
They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:34.214
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,

00:06:34.214 --> 00:06:36.115
which is quite problematic.

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:38.332
In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:40.923
have spent more money in buying back their shares

00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:42.959
to boost their stock price than on R&amp;D,

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:45.287
but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day

00:06:45.287 --> 00:06:48.551
I'd be fascinated to tell you about.

00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:50.554
Now, what's interesting in all of this

00:06:50.554 --> 00:06:52.788
is the state, in all these examples,

00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:56.902
was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.

00:06:56.902 --> 00:06:59.631
It was actually shaping and creating markets.

00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:01.907
It was funding not only the basic research,

00:07:01.907 --> 00:07:04.266
which again is a typical public good,

00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:05.858
but even the applied research.

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:09.534
It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.

00:07:09.534 --> 00:07:12.633
So these SBIR and SDTR programs,

00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:16.664
which give small companies early-stage finance

00:07:16.664 --> 00:07:18.879
have not only been extremely important

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.976
compared to private venture capital,

00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:23.993
but also have become increasingly important.

00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:26.869
Why? Because, as many of us know,

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:28.736
V.C. is actually quite short-term.

00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:30.525
They want their returns in three to five years.

00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:33.054
Innovation takes a much longer time than that,

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:34.881
15 to 20 years.

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.268
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?

00:07:37.268 --> 00:07:39.595
Who's actually funding the hard stuff?

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:41.320
Of course, it's not just the state.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.550
The private sector does a lot.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.749
But the narrative that we've always been told

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:47.632
is the state is important for the basics,

00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:49.912
but not really providing that sort of high-risk,

00:07:49.912 --> 00:07:52.212
revolutionary thinking out of the box.

00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:54.544
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet

00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.449
to doing the spending, but also the envisioning,

00:07:57.449 --> 00:07:59.740
the strategic vision, for these investments,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.328
it was actually coming within the state.

00:08:01.328 --> 00:08:03.697
The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating

00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:06.795
to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,

00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:08.766
came from within government.

00:08:08.766 --> 00:08:11.113
And so there's huge implications of this.

00:08:11.113 --> 00:08:13.218
First of all, of course I'm not someone,

00:08:13.218 --> 00:08:15.220
this old-fashioned person, market versus state.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.745
What we all know in dynamic capitalism

00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:20.804
is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.

00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:23.543
But the point is, by constantly depicting

00:08:23.543 --> 00:08:25.668
the state part as necessary

00:08:25.668 --> 00:08:28.549
but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring

00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:31.598
and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,

00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:34.350
I think we've actually really stunted the possibility

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.922
to build these public-private partnerships

00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:37.468
in a really dynamic way.

00:08:37.468 --> 00:08:40.662
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part,

00:08:40.662 --> 00:08:42.890
the public part -- well, they're both P's --

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.250
with public-private partnerships

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.305
is in terms of de-risking.

00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:48.766
What the public sector did in all these examples

00:08:48.766 --> 00:08:50.853
I just gave you, and there's many more,

00:08:50.853 --> 00:08:54.317
which myself and other colleagues have been looking at,

00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:55.867
is doing much more than de-risking.

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:58.433
It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:01.006
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:03.717
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience

00:09:03.717 --> 00:09:05.777
with local, regional, national governments,

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:08.924
and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."

00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:12.368
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.

00:09:12.368 --> 00:09:14.182
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:09:14.182 --> 00:09:16.348
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.675
boring, it's sometimes

00:09:18.675 --> 00:09:20.887
that we actually create those organizations in that way.

00:09:20.887 --> 00:09:23.088
So what we have to actually do is build

00:09:23.088 --> 00:09:25.264
these entrepreneurial state organizations.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:27.753
DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,

00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:29.338
actually thought really hard about this,

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:32.031
how to welcome failure, because you will fail.

00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:33.956
You will fail when you innovative.

00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:37.828
One out of 10 experiments has any success.

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.566
And the V.C. guys know this,

00:09:39.566 --> 00:09:41.438
and they're able to actually fund the other losses

00:09:41.438 --> 00:09:43.292
from that one success.

00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:44.785
And this brings me, actually, probably,

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:47.380
to the biggest implication,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.047
and this has huge implications beyond innovation.

00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:53.707
If the state is more than just a market fixer,

00:09:53.707 --> 00:09:55.519
if it actually is a market shaper,

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:58.487
and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,

00:09:58.487 --> 00:10:00.481
what happened to the reward?

00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:02.855
We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,

00:10:02.855 --> 00:10:06.261
the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,

00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:07.881
and so some people are foolish enough

00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:10.343
or probably smart enough if they have time to wait,

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.825
to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk

00:10:12.825 --> 00:10:15.345
which over time will make a greater reward than bonds,

00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:16.924
that whole risk-reward thing.

00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:18.897
Well, where's the reward for the state

00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:21.353
of having taken on these massive risks

00:10:21.353 --> 00:10:23.812
and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?

00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:25.764
The Internet was crazy.

00:10:25.764 --> 00:10:28.916
It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.

00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:31.526
You had to be completely nuts to do it,

00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:33.307
and luckily, they were.

00:10:33.307 --> 00:10:35.808
Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards

00:10:35.808 --> 00:10:39.956
unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.

00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:42.557
And the problem is that economists often think,

00:10:42.557 --> 00:10:45.043
well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.

00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:46.592
You know, the companies will pay tax,

00:10:46.592 --> 00:10:48.882
the jobs they create will create growth

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:52.033
so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise

00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:55.257
will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.

00:10:55.257 --> 00:10:57.247
Well, unfortunately, that's not true.

00:10:57.247 --> 00:11:00.766
Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.

00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:03.733
Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.

00:11:03.733 --> 00:11:05.940
Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.029
I mean, one can take a position on that.

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:09.693
But also these companies

00:11:09.693 --> 00:11:12.765
that have actually had this massive benefit from the state --

00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:14.626
Apple's a great example.

00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:16.675
They even got the first -- well, not the first,

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:21.243
but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,

00:11:21.243 --> 00:11:23.912
through this SBIC program,

00:11:23.912 --> 00:11:25.960
which predated the SBIR program,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.278
as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.

00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:31.768
And yet we know they legally,

00:11:31.768 --> 00:11:35.450
as many other companies, pay very little tax back.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.437
So what we really need to actually rethink

00:11:38.437 --> 00:11:42.696
is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism

00:11:42.696 --> 00:11:45.383
that's much more direct than tax. Why not?

00:11:45.383 --> 00:11:47.953
It could happen perhaps through equity.

00:11:47.953 --> 00:11:49.760
This, by the way, in the countries

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.064
that are actually thinking about this strategically,

00:11:52.064 --> 00:11:54.195
countries like Finland in Scandinavia,

00:11:54.195 --> 00:11:56.230
but also in China and Brazil,

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.560
they're retaining equity in these investments.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.386
Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,

00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:05.046
it's a public funding agency in Finland,

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:07.872
which then funded the next round of Nokias.

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:09.881
The Brazilian Development Bank,

00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:12.676
which is providing huge amounts of funds today

00:12:12.676 --> 00:12:14.473
to clean technology, they just announced

00:12:14.473 --> 00:12:18.722
a $56 billion program for the future on this,

00:12:18.722 --> 00:12:22.261
is retaining equity in these investments.

00:12:22.261 --> 00:12:23.773
So to put it provocatively,

00:12:23.773 --> 00:12:26.712
had the U.S. government thought about this,

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.556
and maybe just brought back

00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:30.981
just something called an innovation fund,

00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:34.113
you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent

00:12:34.113 --> 00:12:35.996
of the profits from what the Internet produced

00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:37.654
had come back to that innovation fund,

00:12:37.654 --> 00:12:39.278
there would be so much more money

00:12:39.278 --> 00:12:41.506
to spend today on green technology.

00:12:41.506 --> 00:12:43.000
Instead, many of the state budgets

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.598
which in theory are trying to do that

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.434
are being constrained.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.244
But perhaps even more important,

00:12:49.244 --> 00:12:51.111
we heard before about the one percent,

00:12:51.111 --> 00:12:52.686
the 99 percent.

00:12:52.686 --> 00:12:56.431
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way,

00:12:56.431 --> 00:12:59.464
as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,

00:12:59.464 --> 00:13:01.285
because that's what we're talking about, right?

00:13:01.285 --> 00:13:03.219
Who are the different players in creating value

00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:05.514
in the economy, and is the state's role,

00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:09.243
has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?

00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:11.598
If we can actually have a broader theory

00:13:11.598 --> 00:13:13.651
of value creation and allow us to actually admit

00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:16.702
what the state has been doing and reap something back,

00:13:16.702 --> 00:13:19.521
it might just be that in the next round,

00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:22.087
and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution

00:13:22.087 --> 00:13:23.728
will in fact be green,

00:13:23.728 --> 00:13:25.451
that that period of growth

00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:28.141
will not only be smart, innovation-led,

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.327
not only green, but also more inclusive,

00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:34.581
so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.321
can actually also benefit from that growth,

00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:38.920
because they have not.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.173
Thank you.

00:13:40.173 --> 00:13:45.420
(Applause)
