00:00:00.546 --> 00:00:02.793
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:05.033
and this little white dog called Maui

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.918
was staying with me.

00:00:06.918 --> 00:00:09.390
Half the city was dark because of a power cut,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.614
and I was living on the dark side.

00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:13.723
Now, Maui was terrified of the dark,

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:15.827
so I had to carry him up the stairs,

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:18.915
actually down the stairs first, for his walk,

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:20.803
and then bring him back up.

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:23.784
I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:25.883
up to the seventh floor every day.

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:27.456
And through all of this,

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.760
I had to hold a torch between my teeth.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.404
The stores nearby were out of flashlights

00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:35.341
and batteries and bread.

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.004
For a shower, I walked 40 blocks

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.978
to a branch of my gym.

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:43.057
But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.

00:00:43.057 --> 00:00:46.358
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:49.650
at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.499
to juice my multiple devices.

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.224
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries

00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:57.849
and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.418
I wasn't the only one.

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:03.182
Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue

00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:05.646
under their umbrellas charging their cell phones

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:07.683
from outlets on the street.

00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:09.940
Nature had just reminded us

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.256
that it was stronger than all our technology,

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:15.525
and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:17.401
I think there's nothing like a crisis

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.590
to tell you what's really important and what's not,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.152
and Sandy made me realize that our devices

00:01:24.152 --> 00:01:26.418
and their connectivity matter to us

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:30.936
right up there with food and shelter.

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:34.253
The self as we once knew it no longer exists,

00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:36.745
and I think that an abstract, digital universe

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:39.270
has become a part of our identity,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.522
and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:46.365
I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:48.834
because the self and fiction have a lot in common.

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:52.151
They're both stories, interpretations.

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:54.604
You and I can experience things without a story.

00:01:54.604 --> 00:01:56.686
We might run up the stairs too quickly

00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:58.373
and we might get breathless.

00:01:58.373 --> 00:02:00.903
But the larger sense that we have of our lives,

00:02:00.903 --> 00:02:04.263
the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.

00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:07.383
Our story of our life is based on direct experience,

00:02:07.383 --> 00:02:09.277
but it's embellished.

00:02:09.277 --> 00:02:12.125
A novel needs scene after scene to build,

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.273
and the story of our life needs an arc as well.

00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:17.964
It needs months and years.

00:02:17.964 --> 00:02:20.982
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:23.572
But the story is not about these chapters.

00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:25.517
It's the whole book.

00:02:25.517 --> 00:02:28.860
It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.039
the victories and the disappointments,

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.244
but it's because how because of these,

00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:36.397
and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:38.492
we find our place in the world

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:41.572
and we change it and we change ourselves.

00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:44.965
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.980
a long arc of time that is our lifespan,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.483
and the timeframe of direct experience

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:51.936
that is the moment.

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:54.066
Now the self that experiences directly

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:55.967
can only exist in the moment,

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.729
but the one that narrates needs several moments,

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.843
a whole sequence of them,

00:03:00.843 --> 00:03:03.088
and that's why our full sense of self

00:03:03.088 --> 00:03:06.020
needs both immersive experience

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.465
and the flow of time.

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:11.614
Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything,

00:03:11.614 --> 00:03:14.182
in the erosion of a grain of sand,

00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:17.974
in the budding of a little bud into a rose.

00:03:17.974 --> 00:03:20.509
Without it, we would have no music.

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.547
Our own emotions and state of mind

00:03:22.547 --> 00:03:24.660
often encode time,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.218
regret or nostalgia about the past,

00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:30.718
hope or dread about the future.

00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:34.663
I think that technology has altered that flow of time.

00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:37.186
The overall time that we have for our narrative,

00:03:37.186 --> 00:03:39.360
our lifespan, has been increasing,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.477
but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:44.813
It has shrunk because our instruments enable us

00:03:44.813 --> 00:03:48.073
in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time,

00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:51.343
and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding

00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:53.216
of the material world,

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:54.652
and this granular understanding

00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:56.955
has generated reams of data

00:03:56.955 --> 00:03:59.316
that our brains can no longer comprehend

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:02.751
and for which we need more and more complicated computers.

00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:05.025
All of this to say that the gap

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:07.606
between what we can perceive and what we can measure

00:04:07.606 --> 00:04:09.528
is only going to widen.

00:04:09.528 --> 00:04:12.564
Science can do things with and in a picosecond,

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:15.267
but you and I are never going to have the inner experience

00:04:15.267 --> 00:04:18.453
of a millionth of a millionth of a second.

00:04:18.453 --> 00:04:22.495
You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow,

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:25.434
to the sun, the moon and the seasons,

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:28.174
and this is why we need that long arc of time

00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:30.403
with the past, the present and the future

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.167
to see things for what they are,

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.010
to separate signal from noise

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.566
and the self from sensations.

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:40.175
We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect,

00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:41.930
not just in the material world,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.220
but in our own intentions and our motivations.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.210
What happens when that arrow goes awry?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.694
What happens when time warps?

00:04:52.694 --> 00:04:54.643
So many of us today have the sensation

00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:56.887
that time's arrow is pointing everywhere

00:04:56.887 --> 00:04:59.152
and nowhere at once.

00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:01.839
This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.828
in the same way that it does in the natural one.

00:05:05.828 --> 00:05:08.528
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space

00:05:08.528 --> 00:05:09.758
as well as time.

00:05:09.758 --> 00:05:12.071
Far away over there is now here.

00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:14.800
News from India is a stream on my smartphone app

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.679
whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:19.114
And that's not all.

00:05:19.114 --> 00:05:21.583
Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year,

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:24.859
your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends,

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:26.994
because the Internet also archives,

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.788
and it warps the past.

00:05:28.788 --> 00:05:30.938
With no distinction left between the past,

00:05:30.938 --> 00:05:34.210
the present and the future, and the here or there,

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.026
we are left with this moment everywhere,

00:05:38.026 --> 00:05:40.450
this moment that I'll call the digital now.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.618
Just how can we prioritize

00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:44.977
in the landscape of the digital now?

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:46.882
This digital now is not the present,

00:05:46.882 --> 00:05:48.935
because it's always a few seconds ahead,

00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:50.768
with Twitter streams that are already trending

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.745
and news from other time zones.

00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:55.455
This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.943
or the second that you bite into a pastry

00:05:57.943 --> 00:06:01.280
or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.132
This now bears very little physical

00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:06.073
or psychological reference to our own state.

00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:08.333
Its focus, instead, is to distract us

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:10.283
at every turn on the road.

00:06:10.283 --> 00:06:12.454
Every digital landmark is an invitation

00:06:12.454 --> 00:06:14.869
to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:16.488
and do something else.

00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:18.481
Are you reading an interview by an author?

00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:21.121
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.

00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:23.850
Like it. Find other books exactly like his.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.718
Find other people reading those books.

00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:28.762
Travel can be liberating,

00:06:28.762 --> 00:06:30.523
but when it is incessant, we become

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.750
permanent exiles without repose.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.494
Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:37.541
for its own sake.

00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:40.129
Not just is the digital now far from the present,

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.791
but it's in direct competition with it,

00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:45.173
and this is because not just am I absent from it,

00:06:45.173 --> 00:06:46.266
but so are you.

00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:49.057
Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.

00:06:49.057 --> 00:06:52.747
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.

00:06:52.747 --> 00:06:55.575
I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night,

00:06:55.575 --> 00:06:57.374
shop for Parisian macarons,

00:06:57.374 --> 00:06:59.831
and leave video messages that get picked up later.

00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:01.806
At all times, I can operate

00:07:01.806 --> 00:07:04.042
at a different rhythm and pace from you,

00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:05.959
while I sustain the illusion

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:09.487
that I'm tapped into you in real time.

00:07:09.487 --> 00:07:11.096
Sandy was a reminder

00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:13.201
of how such an illusion can shatter.

00:07:13.201 --> 00:07:15.065
There were those with power and water,

00:07:15.065 --> 00:07:16.561
and those without.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.894
There are those who went back to their lives,

00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:20.931
and those who are still displaced

00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.286
after so many months.

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:25.988
For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate

00:07:25.988 --> 00:07:29.434
the illusion for those who have it that everyone does,

00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:32.062
and then, like an ironic slap in the face,

00:07:32.062 --> 00:07:34.180
it makes it true.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.857
For example, it's said that there are more people

00:07:35.857 --> 00:07:38.991
in India with access to cell phones than toilets.

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.413
Now if this rift, which is already so great

00:07:41.413 --> 00:07:42.875
in many parts of the world,

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:46.230
between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.812
isn't somehow bridged,

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:49.863
there will be ruptures between the digital

00:07:49.863 --> 00:07:52.038
and the real.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:55.676
For us as individuals who live in the digital now

00:07:55.676 --> 00:07:58.155
and spend most of our waking moments in it,

00:07:58.155 --> 00:08:00.332
the challenge is to live in two streams of time

00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:03.276
that are parallel and almost simultaneous.

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:07.376
How does one live inside distraction?

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:09.326
We might think that those younger than us,

00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:12.940
those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.078
Possibly, but I remember my childhood.

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:17.782
I remember my grandfather revising

00:08:17.782 --> 00:08:20.044
the capitals of the world with me.

00:08:20.044 --> 00:08:22.794
Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube,

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.569
and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:28.468
If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information

00:08:28.468 --> 00:08:30.633
with apps and hyperlinks,

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:32.544
but it really wouldn't be the same,

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:34.824
because much later, I went to Vienna,

00:08:34.824 --> 00:08:36.792
and I went to the Spanish riding school,

00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:40.157
and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.

00:08:40.157 --> 00:08:42.727
Night after night, he took me up on the terrace,

00:08:42.727 --> 00:08:45.505
on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter

00:08:45.505 --> 00:08:48.733
and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:51.428
And even here, when I look at the Great Bear,

00:08:51.428 --> 00:08:54.184
I get back that feeling of being a child,

00:08:54.184 --> 00:08:56.562
hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself

00:08:56.562 --> 00:08:58.782
on his shoulder,

00:08:58.782 --> 00:09:01.982
and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.

00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:04.449
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped

00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:07.691
so often in information and knowledge and fact,

00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:09.715
but it was about so much more

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:13.505
than information or knowledge or fact.

00:09:13.505 --> 00:09:15.629
Time-warping technology challenges

00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:17.581
our deepest core,

00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:21.348
because we are able to archive the past

00:09:21.348 --> 00:09:24.589
and some of it becomes hard to forget,

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:27.193
even as the current moment

00:09:27.193 --> 00:09:29.812
is increasingly unmemorable.

00:09:29.812 --> 00:09:32.552
We want to clutch, and we are left instead

00:09:32.552 --> 00:09:35.015
clutching at a series of static moments.

00:09:35.015 --> 00:09:37.721
They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.

00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:40.514
By archiving everything, we think that we can store it,

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:42.479
but time is not data.

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:44.612
It cannot be stored.

00:09:44.612 --> 00:09:46.628
You and I know exactly what it means like

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.532
to be truly present in a moment.

00:09:48.532 --> 00:09:49.749
It might have happened while we were

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:51.508
playing an instrument,

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:53.356
or looking into the eyes of someone we've known

00:09:53.356 --> 00:09:55.540
for a very long time.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.571
At such moments, our selves are complete.

00:09:58.571 --> 00:10:00.639
The self that lives in the long narrative arc

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:02.722
and the self that experiences the moment

00:10:02.722 --> 00:10:04.114
become one.

00:10:04.114 --> 00:10:06.056
The present encapsulates the past

00:10:06.056 --> 00:10:08.487
and a promise for the future.

00:10:08.487 --> 00:10:10.455
The present joins a flow of time

00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:12.698
from before and after.

00:10:12.698 --> 00:10:16.255
I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.

00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:18.594
I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope

00:10:18.594 --> 00:10:19.946
and she tucked up her sari

00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:21.674
and she jumped over it.

00:10:21.674 --> 00:10:24.328
I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:28.436
cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.

00:10:28.436 --> 00:10:30.843
My grandmother taught me that things happen

00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:34.564
in the time they take, that time can't be fought,

00:10:34.564 --> 00:10:36.397
and because it will pass and it will move,

00:10:36.397 --> 00:10:39.511
we owe the present moment our full attention.

00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:42.155
Attention is time.

00:10:42.155 --> 00:10:44.338
One of my yoga instructors once said

00:10:44.338 --> 00:10:46.581
that love is attention,

00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:48.415
and definitely from my grandmother,

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:52.741
love and attention were one and the same thing.

00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:55.324
The digital world cannibalizes time,

00:10:55.324 --> 00:10:58.704
and in doing so, I want to suggest

00:10:58.704 --> 00:11:00.378
that what it threatens

00:11:00.378 --> 00:11:02.808
is the completeness of ourselves.

00:11:02.808 --> 00:11:05.166
It threatens the flow of love.

00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:07.187
But we don't need to let it.

00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:08.655
We can choose otherwise.

00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:10.732
We've seen again and again

00:11:10.732 --> 00:11:12.962
just how creative technology can be,

00:11:12.962 --> 00:11:15.202
and in our lives and in our actions,

00:11:15.202 --> 00:11:19.191
we can choose those solutions and those innovations

00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:22.299
and those moments that restore the flow of time

00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:25.920
instead of fragmenting it.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.500
We can slow down and we can tune in

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.172
to the ebb and flow of time.

00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:35.120
We can choose to take time back.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.320
Thank you.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.320
(Applause)
