WEBVTT

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.489
Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.115
from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.

00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:10.262
My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:11.850
was going berserk,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.297
and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:18.093
and frantic. My God.

00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:20.843
I was there covering the 25th anniversary

00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:23.993
of the world's worst nuclear accident,

00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:25.942
as you can see by the look on my face,

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.833
reluctantly so, but with good reason,

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:32.296
because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:36.712
back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:38.928
as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima,

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:41.402
and the sarcophagus, which is the covering

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:42.979
over reactor number four,

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.861
which was hastily built 27 years ago,

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.779
now sits cracked and rusted

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:49.495
and leaking radiation.

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:51.173
So I was filming.

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:52.479
I just wanted to get the job done

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.066
and get out of there fast.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.350
But then, I looked into the distance,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.627
and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse,

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.170
and I'm thinking, who could be living here?

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.762
I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air,

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:09.472
are among the most highly contaminated on Earth,

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:11.090
and the reactor sits at the the center of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.736
a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone,

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:18.081
and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:20.628
You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away,

00:01:20.628 --> 00:01:22.549
you have to have a government minder,

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.185
and there's draconian radiation rules

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:29.890
and constant contamination monitoring.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.042
The point being, no human being

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:34.928
should be living anywhere near the dead zone.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.521
But they are.

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:39.174
It turns out an unlikely community

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:42.627
of some 200 people are living inside the zone.

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:44.485
They're called self-settlers.

00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:47.125
And almost all of them are women,

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:48.993
the men having shorter lifespans

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:51.310
in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.298
if not radiation.

00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:55.536
Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated

00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:57.156
at the time of the accident,

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:59.617
but not everybody accepted that fate.

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:02.410
The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.405
are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities

00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:07.355
and, it would seem, common sense,

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:11.045
and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:13.529
They did so illegally.

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.446
As one woman put it to a soldier

00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:18.260
who was trying to evacuate her for a second time,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.083
"Shoot me and dig the grave.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.661
Otherwise, I'm going home."

00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.196
Now why would they return to such deadly soil?

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.104
I mean, were they unaware of the risks

00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:30.115
or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:31.587
The thing is, they see their lives

00:02:31.587 --> 00:02:35.119
and the risks they run decidedly differently.

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.372
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,

00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:42.703
eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic,

00:02:42.703 --> 00:02:44.626
totally contaminated.

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:47.765
Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident,

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:49.798
but a few are left like this,

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:53.351
kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.662
Others have a few residents in them,

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:58.127
one or two "babushkas," or "babas,"

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:01.316
which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.

00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:04.399
Another village might have six or seven residents.

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.129
So this is the strange demographic of the zone --

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.998
isolated alone together.

00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:12.201
And when I made my way to that piping chimney

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:13.872
I'd seen in the distance,

00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:17.118
I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.

00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:20.184
She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village,

00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:22.146
population eight.

00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:24.109
(Laughter)

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.342
And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious,

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:31.351
"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."

00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:32.984
And you have to remember, these women have

00:03:32.984 --> 00:03:36.852
survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.

00:03:36.852 --> 00:03:40.423
Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor,

00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:42.254
killed millions of Ukrainians,

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:44.277
and they faced the Nazis in the '40s,

00:03:44.277 --> 00:03:47.253
who came through slashing, burning, raping,

00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:48.869
and in fact many of these women

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.954
were shipped to Germany as forced labor.

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:54.414
So when a couple decades into Soviet rule,

00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:55.609
Chernobyl happened,

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.671
they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.849
that was invisible.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.838
So they returned to their villages

00:04:02.838 --> 00:04:06.058
and are told they're going to get sick and die soon,

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:08.623
but five happy years, their logic goes,

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.178
is better than 10 stuck in a high rise

00:04:11.178 --> 00:04:13.038
on the outskirts of Kiev,

00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:15.216
separated from the graves of their mothers

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:17.536
and fathers and babies,

00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:21.492
the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon.

00:04:21.492 --> 00:04:23.890
For them, environmental contamination

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.440
may not be the worst sort of devastation.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.760
It turns out this holds true

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.851
for other species as well.

00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:32.798
Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned

00:04:32.798 --> 00:04:34.548
to the region in force,

00:04:34.548 --> 00:04:37.803
the very real, very negative effects of radiation

00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:41.361
being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus

00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:43.112
of humans.

00:04:43.112 --> 00:04:47.805
The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.863
And there is a kind of heroic resilience,

00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:53.734
a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those

00:04:53.734 --> 00:04:56.226
who start their day at 5 a.m.

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:58.469
pulling water from a well

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.173
and end it at midnight

00:05:00.173 --> 00:05:02.237
poised to beat a bucket with a stick

00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:05.137
and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes,

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:10.289
their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.699
And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.537
"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?"

00:05:17.537 --> 00:05:19.239
I mean, what about their health?

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:22.061
The benefits of hardy, physical living,

00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:23.665
but an environment made toxic

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:27.648
by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.

00:05:27.648 --> 00:05:29.783
It's incredibly difficult to parse.

00:05:29.783 --> 00:05:31.600
Health studies from the region

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.340
are conflicting and fraught.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.733
The World Health Organization

00:05:35.733 --> 00:05:38.463
puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.781
at 4,000, eventually.

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:43.419
Greenpeace and other organizations

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.577
put that number in the tens of thousands.

00:05:46.577 --> 00:05:49.569
Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.186
are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:55.253
suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere:

00:05:55.253 --> 00:05:58.531
higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism,

00:05:58.531 --> 00:06:00.711
unemployment and, importantly,

00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.954
disrupted social networks.

00:06:03.954 --> 00:06:06.360
Now, like many of you,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.985
I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:14.407
Home is a transient concept.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.584
I have a deeper connection to my laptop

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:20.926
than any bit of soil.

00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:23.165
So it's hard for us to understand, but home

00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:26.338
is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka,

00:06:26.338 --> 00:06:29.794
and connection to the land is palpable.

00:06:29.794 --> 00:06:31.585
And perhaps because these Ukrainian women

00:06:31.585 --> 00:06:33.588
were schooled under the Soviets

00:06:33.588 --> 00:06:35.830
and versed in the Russian poets,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.388
aphorisms about these ideas

00:06:37.388 --> 00:06:39.585
slip from their mouths all the time.

00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:42.592
"If you leave, you die."

00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:44.559
"Those who left are worse off now.

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.200
They are dying of sadness."

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.687
"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave."

00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:53.943
What sounds like faith, soft faith,

00:06:53.943 --> 00:06:57.068
may actually be fact,

00:06:57.068 --> 00:06:58.690
because the surprising truth --

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.076
I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:03.648
that these women who returned to their homes

00:07:03.648 --> 00:07:05.728
and have lived on some of the most radioactive land

00:07:05.728 --> 00:07:07.934
on Earth for the last 27 years,

00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:10.289
have actually outlived their counterparts

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:12.336
who accepted relocation,

00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:16.462
by some estimates up to 10 years.

00:07:16.462 --> 00:07:18.642
How could this be?

00:07:18.642 --> 00:07:20.341
Here's a theory: Could it be

00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:23.406
that those ties to ancestral soil,

00:07:23.406 --> 00:07:25.972
the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms,

00:07:25.972 --> 00:07:28.836
actually affect longevity?

00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:30.595
The power of motherland

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:33.053
so fundamental to that part of the world

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:34.865
seems palliative.

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:37.662
Home and community are forces

00:07:37.662 --> 00:07:41.722
that rival even radiation.

00:07:41.722 --> 00:07:44.200
Now radiation or not,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.804
these women are at the end of their lives.

00:07:46.804 --> 00:07:50.797
In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone,

00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:55.024
and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place,

00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:58.138
full only of animals and occasionally

00:07:58.138 --> 00:08:01.230
daring, flummoxed scientists.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.332
But the spirit and existence of the babushkas,

00:08:04.332 --> 00:08:06.039
whose numbers have been halved

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:08.181
in the three years I've known them,

00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:10.379
will leave us with powerful new templates

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:12.395
to think about and grapple with,

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:16.058
about the relative nature of risk,

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:19.905
about transformative connections to home,

00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:23.451
and about the magnificent tonic

00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:27.304
of personal agency and self-determination.

00:08:27.304 --> 00:08:29.239
Thank you.

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:33.239
(Applause)
