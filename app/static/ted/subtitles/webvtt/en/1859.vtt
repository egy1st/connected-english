00:00:01.617 --> 00:00:05.293
In December of 2010,

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:07.110
the city of Apatzingán

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.262
in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:12.632
awoke to gunfire.

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:14.208
For two straight days,

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.626
the city became an open battlefield

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.410
between the federal forces

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.079
and a well-organized group,

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.862
presumably from the local criminal organization,

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:26.234
La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.384
The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire

00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:31.804
but also explosions

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:35.075
and burning trucks used as barricades across the city,

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:37.092
so truly like a battlefield.

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:38.622
After these two days,

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:41.427
and during a particularly intense encounter,

00:00:41.427 --> 00:00:43.994
it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:46.499
Nazario Moreno, was killed.

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.510
In response to this terrifying violence,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.509
the mayor of Apatzingán

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:52.809
decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.156
The idea was to ask for a softer approach

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.574
to criminal activity in the state.

00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:01.768
And so, the day of the scheduled procession,

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:03.622
thousands of people showed up.

00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:05.316
As the mayor was preparing to deliver

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.427
the speech starting the march,

00:01:07.427 --> 00:01:08.929
his team noticed

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:12.087
that, while half of the participants

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:13.762
were appropriately dressed in white,

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:16.602
and bearing banners asking for peace,

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:18.771
the other half was actually marching

00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:21.862
in support of the criminal organization

00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:25.046
and its now-presumed-defunct leader.

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:28.115
Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.126
rather than participate or lead a procession

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:33.511
that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.

00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.753
And so his team stepped aside.

00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:37.829
The two marches joined together,

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.834
and they continued their path

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.444
towards the state capital.

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:48.255
This story of horrific violence

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:50.452
followed by a fumbled approach

00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:52.647
by federal and local authorities as they tried

00:01:52.647 --> 00:01:54.070
to engage civil society,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.426
who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,

00:01:57.426 --> 00:02:00.890
is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.239
where we see that our current understanding

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.607
of drug violence and what leads to it

00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:09.209
is probably at the very least incomplete.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.212
If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying

00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:13.242
to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico

00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:15.881
by, say, just researching online,

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:17.722
the first thing you would find out is that

00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:21.689
while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.808
there are some that are more

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:26.167
and there are some that are much less equal than others,

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:27.418
because you will quickly find out

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:29.122
that in the past six years

00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:31.270
anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.828
have lost their lives in drug-related violence.

00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:36.575
To put these numbers in perspective,

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:39.391
this is eight times larger than the number of casualties

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:43.912
in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.

00:02:43.912 --> 00:02:46.416
It's also shockingly close to the number of people

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.942
who have died in the Syrian civil war,

00:02:48.942 --> 00:02:51.155
which is an active civil war.

00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:54.351
This is happening just south of the border.

00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:55.955
Now as you're reading, however,

00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:57.638
you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly

00:02:57.638 --> 00:02:59.674
become numb to the numbers of deaths,

00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:03.360
because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.953
of faceless, nameless dead people.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.677
Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative

00:03:09.677 --> 00:03:11.512
that all the people who are dying

00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:14.368
were somehow involved in the drug trade,

00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:17.964
and we infer this because they were either tortured

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.125
or executed in a professional manner,

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:21.777
or, most likely, both.

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:23.758
And so clearly they were criminals

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:26.373
because of the way they died.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.936
And so the narrative is that somehow these people

00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:30.179
got what they were deserved.

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.630
They were part of the bad guys.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.178
And that creates some form of comfort

00:03:35.178 --> 00:03:36.810
for a lot of people.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.774
However, while it's easier to think

00:03:39.774 --> 00:03:43.759
of us, the citizens, the police, the army,

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.331
as the good guys, and them, the narcos,

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:50.625
the carteles, as the bad guys,

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:51.791
if you think about it,

00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:55.599
the latter are only providing a service to the former.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.714
Whether we like it or not,

00:03:57.714 --> 00:04:00.375
the U.S. is the largest market

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:01.993
for illegal substances in the world,

00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:05.047
accounting for more than half of global demand.

00:04:05.047 --> 00:04:08.307
It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico

00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:11.425
that is its only route of access from the South,

00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:14.480
and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.209
used to say, "Poor Mexico,

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.401
so far from God and so close to the United States."

00:04:23.401 --> 00:04:26.250
The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.717
of illegal drugs in the United States.

00:04:28.717 --> 00:04:31.143
Using very, very conservative assumptions,

00:04:31.143 --> 00:04:34.240
this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.023
of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.

00:04:37.023 --> 00:04:39.692
If we assume that the narcos only have access

00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:42.416
to the wholesale part, which we know is false,

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:44.757
that still leaves you with yearly revenues

00:04:44.757 --> 00:04:49.275
of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.

00:04:49.275 --> 00:04:51.191
To put these numbers in perspective,

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:55.984
Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.

00:04:55.984 --> 00:04:58.490
And it so happens that this is a product that,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.465
because of its nature, a business model

00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:04.219
to address this market requires you

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.348
to guarantee to your producers

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.966
that their product will be reliably placed

00:05:08.966 --> 00:05:11.083
in the markets where it is consumed.

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:14.640
And the only way to do this, because it's illegal,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.650
is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.949
that are used to transport drugs.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.466
Hence the violence.

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:25.498
If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,

00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:27.618
you will see that it almost perfectly aligns

00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:29.402
with the most efficient routes of transportation

00:05:29.402 --> 00:05:31.297
from the south to the north.

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:32.453
The only thing that the cartels are doing

00:05:32.453 --> 00:05:35.204
is that they're trying to protect their business.

00:05:35.204 --> 00:05:37.629
It's not only a multi-billion dollar market,

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.724
but it's also a complex one.

00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:42.433
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant

00:05:42.448 --> 00:05:44.764
that can only grow in certain latitudes,

00:05:44.764 --> 00:05:46.500
and so it means that a business model

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.235
to address this market requires you to have

00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:50.756
decentralized, international production,

00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:53.300
that by the way needs to have good quality control,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.801
because people need a good high

00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:57.386
that is not going to kill them

00:05:57.386 --> 00:06:00.248
and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.

00:06:00.248 --> 00:06:02.241
And so that means they need to secure

00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.143
production and quality control in the south,

00:06:05.143 --> 00:06:07.150
and you need to ensure that you have

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.642
efficient and effective distribution channels

00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:13.081
in the markets where these drugs are consumed.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.672
I urge you, but only a little bit,

00:06:14.672 --> 00:06:16.883
because I don't want to get you in trouble,

00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:20.169
to just ask around and see how difficult it would be

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.026
to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,

00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:25.971
whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,

00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:28.784
and some of you may be surprised to know

00:06:28.784 --> 00:06:30.798
that there are many dealers that offer a service

00:06:30.798 --> 00:06:32.622
where if you send them a text message,

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:34.327
they guarantee delivery of the drug

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:37.209
in 30 minutes or less.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:39.630
Think about this for a second.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.361
Think about the complexity

00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:44.761
of the distribution network that I just described.

00:06:44.761 --> 00:06:47.259
It's very difficult to reconcile this

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.381
with the image of faceless, ignorant goons

00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:53.986
that are just shooting each other,

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:55.674
very difficult to reconcile.

00:06:55.674 --> 00:06:59.003
Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,

00:06:59.003 --> 00:07:01.678
an effective organization requires

00:07:01.678 --> 00:07:03.587
an integrated strategy that includes

00:07:03.587 --> 00:07:06.460
a good organizational structure, good incentives,

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.452
a solid identity and good brand management.

00:07:09.452 --> 00:07:11.587
This leads me to the second thing that you would learn

00:07:11.587 --> 00:07:14.487
in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.

00:07:14.487 --> 00:07:16.049
Because you would quickly realize,

00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:17.712
and maybe be confused by the fact,

00:07:17.712 --> 00:07:18.949
that there are three organizations

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:22.484
that are constantly named in the articles.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.558
You will hear about Los Zetas,

00:07:24.558 --> 00:07:26.529
the Knights Templar, which is the new brand

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.387
for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,

00:07:29.387 --> 00:07:31.761
and the Sinaloa Federation.

00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:34.552
You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment

00:07:34.552 --> 00:07:38.907
of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter

00:07:38.907 --> 00:07:41.033
and they silence the press,

00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:44.407
and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.

00:07:44.407 --> 00:07:48.486
But this is the result of a very careful branding

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:50.287
and business strategy.

00:07:50.287 --> 00:07:52.456
You see, Los Zetas is not just

00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:54.256
this random assortment of individuals,

00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:57.911
but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,

00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:00.923
that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.

00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:03.337
When that corridor became contested, they decided

00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:05.127
that they wanted to recruit

00:08:05.127 --> 00:08:07.958
a professional enforcement arm.

00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.567
So they recruited Los Zetas:

00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:14.325
an entire unit of elite paratroopers

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:17.342
from the Mexican Army.

00:08:17.342 --> 00:08:21.048
They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,

00:08:21.048 --> 00:08:22.936
so much so that at some point, they decided

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:25.429
to just take over the operations,

00:08:25.429 --> 00:08:29.223
which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,

00:08:29.223 --> 00:08:31.864
because they grow up.

00:08:31.864 --> 00:08:35.560
Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.496
they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution

00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:40.703
in the most profitable markets like cocaine,

00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:41.993
but what they did have,

00:08:41.993 --> 00:08:44.453
and this is again based on their military origin,

00:08:44.453 --> 00:08:47.300
was a perfectly structured chain of command

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.925
with a very clear hierarchy

00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:53.989
and a very clear promotion path that allowed them

00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:57.811
to supervise and operate across many, many markets

00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:59.453
very effectively,

00:08:59.453 --> 00:09:03.252
which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:04.541
And so because they didn't have access

00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:06.876
to the more profitable drug markets,

00:09:06.876 --> 00:09:08.549
this pushed them and gave them the opportunity

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:12.047
to diversify into other forms of crime.

00:09:12.047 --> 00:09:16.102
That includes kidnapping, prostitution,

00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:18.283
local drug dealing and human trafficking,

00:09:18.283 --> 00:09:22.239
including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.

00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:26.487
So what they currently run is truly

00:09:26.487 --> 00:09:30.059
and quite literally a franchise business.

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:33.890
They focus most of their recruiting on the army,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.967
and they very openly advertise for better salaries,

00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:39.665
better benefits, better promotion paths,

00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:41.313
not to mention much better food,

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:44.020
than what the army can deliver.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.889
The way they operate is that

00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:47.794
when they arrive in a locality,

00:09:47.794 --> 00:09:49.545
they let people know that they are there,

00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:52.615
and they go to the most powerful local gang

00:09:52.615 --> 00:09:54.855
and they say, "I offer you

00:09:54.855 --> 00:09:58.044
to be the local representative of the Zeta brand."

00:09:58.044 --> 00:09:59.917
If they agree -- and you don't want to know

00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:01.660
what happens if they don't --

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.347
they train them and they supervise them

00:10:03.347 --> 00:10:06.674
on how to run the most efficient criminal operation

00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:10.175
for that town, in exchange for royalties.

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:12.081
This kind of business model obviously depends

00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:14.478
entirely on having a very effective brand of fear,

00:10:14.478 --> 00:10:16.851
and so Los Zetas

00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:19.144
carefully stage acts of violence

00:10:19.144 --> 00:10:21.077
that are spectacular in nature,

00:10:21.077 --> 00:10:23.877
especially when they arrive first in a city,

00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:27.111
but again, that's just a brand strategy.

00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:29.010
I'm not saying they're not violent,

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.953
but what I am saying is that even though you will read

00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:32.816
that they are the most violent of all,

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:35.779
when you count, when you do the body count,

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.551
they're actually all the same.

00:10:39.551 --> 00:10:42.639
In contrast to them, the Knights Templar

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:44.479
that arose in Michoacán

00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:47.086
emerged in reaction to the incursion

00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:49.621
of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.

00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:52.538
Michoacán is a geographically strategic state

00:10:52.538 --> 00:10:54.541
because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,

00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:57.132
and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,

00:10:57.132 --> 00:11:00.198
which then gives you direct access to the U.S.

00:11:00.198 --> 00:11:01.737
The Knights Templar realized very quickly

00:11:01.737 --> 00:11:05.245
that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,

00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:07.602
and so they developed a strategy

00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:10.381
as a social enterprise.

00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:13.381
They brand themselves as representative of

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.037
and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán

00:11:16.037 --> 00:11:18.335
against organized crime.

00:11:18.335 --> 00:11:20.066
Their brand of social enterprise means

00:11:20.066 --> 00:11:22.117
that they require a lot of civic engagement,

00:11:22.117 --> 00:11:26.283
so they invest heavily in providing local services,

00:11:26.283 --> 00:11:29.781
like dealing with home violence,

00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:33.557
going after petty criminals, treating addicts,

00:11:33.557 --> 00:11:36.335
and keeping drugs out of the local markets

00:11:36.335 --> 00:11:38.815
where they are,

00:11:38.815 --> 00:11:40.434
and, of course, protecting people

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:42.925
from other criminal organizations.

00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:45.956
Now, they kill a lot of people too,

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:48.053
but when they kill them,

00:11:48.068 --> 00:11:50.968
they provide very careful narratives and descriptions

00:11:50.968 --> 00:11:52.220
for why they did them,

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.183
through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:58.649
and billboards that explain that the people who were killed

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:00.977
were killed because they represented a threat

00:12:00.977 --> 00:12:02.833
not to us, as an organization, of course,

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:04.769
but to you, as citizens.

00:12:04.769 --> 00:12:07.225
And so we're actually here to protect you.

00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:09.789
They, as social enterprises do,

00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:11.289
have created a moral and ethical code

00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:13.658
that they advertise around,

00:12:13.658 --> 00:12:16.796
and they have very strict recruiting practices.

00:12:16.796 --> 00:12:18.619
And here you have the types of explanations

00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:22.560
that they provide for some of their actions.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.456
They have actually retained access

00:12:24.456 --> 00:12:26.756
to the profitable drug trade,

00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:28.966
but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,

00:12:28.966 --> 00:12:31.109
and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,

00:12:31.109 --> 00:12:32.911
they leverage that to, for example,

00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:36.468
trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created

00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:37.868
and legally extracted

00:12:37.868 --> 00:12:39.870
with illegal ephedrine from China

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.294
which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines

00:12:43.294 --> 00:12:45.694
that they produce, and then they have partnerships

00:12:45.694 --> 00:12:48.232
with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation

00:12:48.232 --> 00:12:50.922
that place their products in the U.S.

00:12:50.922 --> 00:12:53.593
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.

00:12:53.593 --> 00:12:55.791
When you read about them, you will often read about them

00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:59.491
with an undertone of reverence and admiration,

00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:01.407
because they are the most integrated

00:13:01.407 --> 00:13:03.695
and the largest of all the Mexican organizations,

00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:07.149
and, many people argue, the world.

00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:10.133
They started as just sort of a transport organization

00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:12.207
that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.

00:13:12.207 --> 00:13:14.332
and the Mexican borders,

00:13:14.332 --> 00:13:15.750
but now they have grown

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.176
into a truly integrated multinational

00:13:19.176 --> 00:13:21.482
that has partnerships in production in the south

00:13:21.482 --> 00:13:24.495
and partnerships in global distribution

00:13:24.495 --> 00:13:26.989
across the planet.

00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:30.319
They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,

00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:33.637
business acumen and innovation.

00:13:33.637 --> 00:13:35.736
They have designed new drug products

00:13:35.736 --> 00:13:37.459
and new drug processes.

00:13:37.459 --> 00:13:39.677
They have designed narco-tunnels

00:13:39.677 --> 00:13:41.218
that go across the border,

00:13:41.218 --> 00:13:43.033
and you can see that these are not

00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:46.981
"The Shawshank Redemption" types.

00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:50.677
They have invented narco-submarines and boats

00:13:50.677 --> 00:13:53.360
that are not detected by radar.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.923
They have invented drones to transport drugs,

00:13:55.923 --> 00:13:59.209
catapults, you name it.

00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:01.550
One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.988
actually made it to the Forbes list.

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:05.961
[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]

00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:08.866
Like any multinational would, they have specialized

00:14:08.866 --> 00:14:11.155
and focused only in the most profitable part of the business,

00:14:11.155 --> 00:14:13.833
which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,

00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:16.118
heroine, methamphetamines.

00:14:16.118 --> 00:14:18.691
Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.432
the way they control their operations

00:14:20.432 --> 00:14:22.214
is through family ties.

00:14:22.214 --> 00:14:24.159
When they're entering a new market, they send

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:25.880
a family member to supervise it,

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.697
or, if they're partnering with a new organization,

00:14:28.697 --> 00:14:30.117
they create a family tie,

00:14:30.117 --> 00:14:34.583
either through marriages or other types of ties.

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:36.746
Like any other multinational would,

00:14:36.746 --> 00:14:39.913
they protect their brand by outsourcing

00:14:39.913 --> 00:14:42.081
the more questionable parts of the business model,

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:44.124
like for example, when they have to engage

00:14:44.124 --> 00:14:46.889
in violence against other criminal organizations,

00:14:46.889 --> 00:14:50.334
they recruit gangs and other smaller players

00:14:50.334 --> 00:14:52.133
to do the dirty work for them,

00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:53.918
and they try to separate their operations

00:14:53.918 --> 00:14:57.553
and their violence and be very discrete about this.

00:14:57.553 --> 00:15:00.049
To further strengthen their brand,

00:15:00.049 --> 00:15:02.942
they actually have professional P.R. firms

00:15:02.942 --> 00:15:05.421
that shape how the press talks about them.

00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:08.972
They have professional videographers on staff.

00:15:08.972 --> 00:15:11.085
They have incredibly productive ties

00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:12.918
with the security organizations

00:15:12.918 --> 00:15:16.330
on both sides of the border.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.931
And so, differences aside,

00:15:18.931 --> 00:15:22.486
what these three organizations share

00:15:22.486 --> 00:15:26.126
is on the one hand, a very clear understanding

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:29.210
that institutions cannot be imposed from the top,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.150
but rather they are built from the bottom up

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.433
one interaction at a time.

00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:37.854
They have created extremely coherent structures

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.688
that they use to show the inconsistencies

00:15:40.688 --> 00:15:44.715
in government policies.

00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:47.202
And so what I want you to remember from this talk

00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:48.735
are three things.

00:15:48.735 --> 00:15:51.791
The first one is that drug violence

00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:53.668
is actually the result

00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:56.919
of a huge market demand

00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:00.569
and an institutional setup that forces

00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:03.695
the servicing of this market to necessitate violence

00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:07.740
to guarantee delivery routes.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.666
The second thing I want you to remember

00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:11.612
is that these are sophisticated,

00:16:11.612 --> 00:16:14.535
coherent organizations

00:16:14.535 --> 00:16:16.493
that are business organizations,

00:16:16.493 --> 00:16:18.412
and analyzing them and treating them as such

00:16:18.412 --> 00:16:21.801
is probably a much more useful approach.

00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:23.937
The third thing I want you to remember

00:16:23.937 --> 00:16:25.365
is that even though we're more comfortable

00:16:25.365 --> 00:16:27.888
with this idea of "them,"

00:16:27.888 --> 00:16:30.629
a set of bad guys separated from us,

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:33.606
we are actually accomplices to them,

00:16:33.606 --> 00:16:35.995
either through our direct consumption

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:40.067
or through our acceptance of the inconsistency

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:42.335
between our policies of prohibition

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:45.283
and our actual behavior of tolerance

00:16:45.283 --> 00:16:49.507
or even encouragement of consumption.

00:16:49.507 --> 00:16:53.527
These organizations service, recruit from,

00:16:53.527 --> 00:16:55.855
and operate within our communities,

00:16:55.855 --> 00:16:58.273
so necessarily, they are much more integrated

00:16:58.273 --> 00:17:02.743
within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.

00:17:02.743 --> 00:17:05.608
And so to me the question is not whether

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.889
these dynamics will continue the way they have.

00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:11.654
We see that the nature of this phenomenon

00:17:11.654 --> 00:17:14.122
guarantees that they will.

00:17:14.122 --> 00:17:17.002
The question is whether we are willing to continue

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:21.608
our support of a failed strategy

00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:27.115
based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance

00:17:27.115 --> 00:17:32.076
at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.

00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:33.807
Thank you.

00:17:33.807 --> 00:17:38.969
(Applause)
