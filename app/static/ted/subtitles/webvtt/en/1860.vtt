WEBVTT

00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:02.071
I am a neuroscientist

00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:05.882
with a mixed background in physics and medicine.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:10.923
My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:14.113
focuses on spinal cord injury,

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.844
which affects more than 50,000 people

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.534
around the world every year,

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:23.140
with dramatic consequences for affected individuals,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.373
whose life literally shatters

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:28.608
in a matter of a handful of seconds.

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:31.666
And for me, the Man of Steel,

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.870
Christopher Reeve,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.960
has best raised the awareness

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.875
on the distress of spinal cord injured people.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:42.014
And this is how I started my own personal journey

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:43.513
in this field of research,

00:00:43.513 --> 00:00:46.950
working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.546
I still remember this decisive moment.

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:53.497
It was just at the end of a regular day of work

00:00:53.497 --> 00:00:55.040
with the foundation.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.692
Chris addressed us, the scientists and experts,

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:03.285
"You have to be more pragmatic.

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:05.637
When leaving your laboratory tomorrow,

00:01:05.637 --> 00:01:08.541
I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center

00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:10.150
to watch injured people

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.175
fighting to take a step,

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:14.816
struggling to maintain their trunk.

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:16.229
And when you go home,

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.639
think of what you are going to change in your research

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:22.207
on the following day to make their lives better."

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:26.260
These words, they stuck with me.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.651
This was more than 10 years ago,

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:31.418
but ever since, my laboratory has followed

00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:33.381
the pragmatic approach to recovery

00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.792
after spinal cord injury.

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:37.833
And my first step in this direction

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:41.122
was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury

00:01:41.122 --> 00:01:44.769
that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:48.141
while offering well-controlled experimental conditions.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:50.708
And for this purpose, we placed two hemisections

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.123
on opposite sides of the body.

00:01:52.123 --> 00:01:54.268
They completely interrupt the communication

00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:56.850
between the brain and the spinal cord,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.560
thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.327
of the leg.

00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:05.218
But, as observed, after most injuries in humans,

00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:08.168
there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:10.871
through which recovery can occur.

00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:13.912
But how to make it happen?

00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:17.273
Well, the classical approach

00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:19.909
consists of applying intervention

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.819
that would promote the growth of the severed fiber

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.927
to the original target.

00:02:24.927 --> 00:02:28.678
And while this certainly remained the key for a cure,

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:32.193
this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me.

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.918
To reach clinical fruition rapidly,

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:36.478
it was obvious:

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:40.398
I had to think about the problem differently.

00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:43.506
It turned out that more than 100 years of research

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:45.147
on spinal cord physiology,

00:02:45.147 --> 00:02:47.472
starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington,

00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:49.279
had shown that

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.514
the spinal cord, below most injuries,

00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:54.767
contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:57.087
to coordinate locomotion,

00:02:57.087 --> 00:03:00.046
but because input from the brain is interrupted,

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:03.214
they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant.

00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:07.546
My idea: We awaken this network.

00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:11.833
And at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles,

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:14.399
after completing my Ph.D. in France,

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:16.308
where independent thinking

00:03:16.308 --> 00:03:19.415
is not necessarily promoted.

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:21.242
(Laughter)

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.995
I was afraid to talk to my new boss,

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:27.388
but decided to muster up my courage.

00:03:27.388 --> 00:03:30.045
I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor,

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:34.036
Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.

00:03:34.036 --> 00:03:36.286
He listened to me carefully,

00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:39.227
and responded with a grin.

00:03:39.227 --> 00:03:41.270
"Why don't you try?"

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.395
And I promise to you,

00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:46.750
this was such an important moment in my career,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.185
when I realized that the great leader

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:52.178
believed in young people and new ideas.

00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:53.786
And this was the idea:

00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:56.452
I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor

00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:58.578
to explain to you this complicated concept.

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:03.344
Imagine that the locomotor system is a car.

00:04:03.344 --> 00:04:05.590
The engine is the spinal cord.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.848
The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:11.855
How could we re-engage the engine?

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:14.997
First, we have to provide the fuel;

00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:17.340
second, press the accelerator pedal;

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.278
third, steer the car.

00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:21.040
It turned out that there are known neural pathways

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.994
coming from the brain that play this very function

00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:25.376
during locomotion.

00:04:25.376 --> 00:04:28.091
My idea: Replace this missing input

00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.493
to provide the spinal cord

00:04:29.493 --> 00:04:30.889
with the kind of intervention

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.619
that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:40.058
For this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,

00:04:40.058 --> 00:04:42.822
first to replace the missing fuel

00:04:42.822 --> 00:04:44.890
with pharmacological agents

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.370
that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.425
and second, to mimic the accelerator pedal

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.905
with electrical stimulation.

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:56.074
So here imagine an electrode

00:04:56.074 --> 00:04:58.480
implanted on the back of the spinal cord

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.742
to deliver painless stimulation.

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:03.574
It took many years, but eventually we developed

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.131
an electrochemical neuroprosthesis

00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:07.897
that transformed the neural network

00:05:07.897 --> 00:05:12.903
in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.

00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:19.183
Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.

00:05:19.183 --> 00:05:21.510
As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.316
the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:27.294
but without the brain.

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:29.284
Here what I call "the spinal brain"

00:05:29.284 --> 00:05:32.406
cognitively processes sensory information

00:05:32.406 --> 00:05:34.301
arising from the moving leg

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.996
and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle

00:05:37.996 --> 00:05:41.386
in order to stand, to walk, to run,

00:05:41.386 --> 00:05:43.498
and even here, while sprinting,

00:05:43.498 --> 00:05:45.795
instantly stand

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:48.258
if the treadmill stops moving.

00:05:48.258 --> 00:05:49.595
This was amazing.

00:05:49.595 --> 00:05:52.982
I was completely fascinated by this locomotion

00:05:52.982 --> 00:05:55.477
without the brain,

00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:59.132
but at the same time so frustrated.

00:05:59.132 --> 00:06:01.525
This locomotion was completely involuntary.

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:04.890
The animal had virtually no control over the legs.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.010
Clearly, the steering system was missing.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.902
And it then became obvious from me

00:06:10.902 --> 00:06:12.250
that we had to move away

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.622
from the classical rehabilitation paradigm,

00:06:15.622 --> 00:06:17.344
stepping on a treadmill,

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:20.564
and develop conditions that would encourage

00:06:20.564 --> 00:06:25.797
the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:29.182
With this in mind, we developed a completely new

00:06:29.182 --> 00:06:32.412
robotic system to support the rat

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.938
in any direction of space.

00:06:34.938 --> 00:06:37.113
Imagine, this is really cool.

00:06:37.113 --> 00:06:40.944
So imagine the little 200-gram rat

00:06:40.944 --> 00:06:44.645
attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:47.217
but the rat does not feel the robot.

00:06:47.217 --> 00:06:49.289
The robot is transparent,

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.651
just like you would hold a young child

00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:54.015
during the first insecure steps.

00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:57.569
Let me summarize: The rat received

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.014
a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.

00:07:00.014 --> 00:07:02.604
The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled

00:07:02.604 --> 00:07:06.811
a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.

00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:10.577
The robot provided the safe environment

00:07:10.577 --> 00:07:12.540
to allow the rat to attempt anything

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.222
to engage the paralyzed legs.

00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:18.047
And for motivation, we used what I think

00:07:18.047 --> 00:07:21.881
is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:

00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.188
fine Swiss chocolate.

00:07:24.188 --> 00:07:27.110
(Laughter)

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.673
Actually, the first results were very, very,

00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:34.308
very disappointing.

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:37.610
Here is my best physical therapist

00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:47.384
completely failing to encourage the rat

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.445
to take a single step,

00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:52.291
whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,

00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:54.597
walked beautifully on the treadmill.

00:07:54.597 --> 00:07:56.754
We were so frustrated.

00:07:56.754 --> 00:07:59.653
But you know, one of the most essential qualities

00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:02.129
of a scientist is perseverance.

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:05.545
We insisted. We refined our paradigm,

00:08:05.545 --> 00:08:07.808
and after several months of training,

00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:11.614
the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,

00:08:11.614 --> 00:08:13.426
and whenever she decided,

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:15.758
initiated full weight-bearing locomotion

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:19.008
to sprint towards the rewards.

00:08:19.008 --> 00:08:22.413
This is the first recovery ever observed

00:08:22.413 --> 00:08:24.307
of voluntary leg movement

00:08:24.307 --> 00:08:26.761
after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord

00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:30.222
leading to complete and permanent paralysis.

00:08:30.222 --> 00:08:32.209
In fact --

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:33.929
(Applause)

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:38.308
Thank you.

00:08:38.308 --> 00:08:41.402
In fact, not only could the rat initiate

00:08:41.402 --> 00:08:44.079
and sustain locomotion on the ground,

00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:46.360
they could even adjust leg movement,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.716
for example, to resist gravity

00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:51.340
in order to climb a staircase.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.290
I can promise you this was

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.399
such an emotional moment in my laboratory.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:59.142
It took us 10 years of hard work

00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:01.593
to reach this goal.

00:09:01.593 --> 00:09:04.144
But the remaining question was, how?

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:05.836
I mean, how is it possible?

00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:07.514
And here, what we found

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:11.190
was completely unexpected.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.348
This novel training paradigm

00:09:15.348 --> 00:09:19.019
encouraged the brain to create new connections,

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:21.921
some relay circuits

00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:24.969
that relay information from the brain

00:09:24.969 --> 00:09:28.125
past the injury and restore cortical control

00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:31.566
over the locomotor networks below the injury.

00:09:31.566 --> 00:09:34.488
And here, you can see one such example,

00:09:34.488 --> 00:09:37.851
where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.

00:09:37.851 --> 00:09:41.271
This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,

00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:43.634
and what this constellation

00:09:43.634 --> 00:09:45.985
of synaptic contacts means

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:49.784
is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center

00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:53.782
with only one relay neuron.

00:09:53.782 --> 00:09:55.713
But the remodeling was not restricted

00:09:55.713 --> 00:09:56.800
to the lesion area.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.089
It occurred throughout the central nervous system,

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:02.407
including in the brain stem,

00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:05.669
where we observed up to 300-percent increase

00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:09.428
in the density of fibers coming from the brain.

00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:12.955
We did not aim to repair the spinal cord,

00:10:12.955 --> 00:10:15.552
yet we were able to promote

00:10:15.552 --> 00:10:17.709
one of the more extensive remodeling

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:20.178
of axonal projections ever observed

00:10:20.178 --> 00:10:22.439
in the central nervous system of adult mammal

00:10:22.439 --> 00:10:24.984
after an injury.

00:10:24.984 --> 00:10:30.053
And there is a very important message

00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:34.496
hidden behind this discovery.

00:10:34.496 --> 00:10:37.718
They are the result of a young team

00:10:37.718 --> 00:10:40.110
of very talented people:

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.568
physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,

00:10:44.568 --> 00:10:46.767
engineers of all kinds,

00:10:46.767 --> 00:10:48.558
who have achieved together

00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:52.201
what would have been impossible by single individuals.

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:55.284
This is truly a trans-disciplinary team.

00:10:55.284 --> 00:10:57.472
They are working so close to each other

00:10:57.472 --> 00:11:00.663
that there is horizontal transfer of DNA.

00:11:00.663 --> 00:11:02.286
We are creating the next generation

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:04.527
of M.D.'s and engineers

00:11:04.527 --> 00:11:06.971
capable of translating discoveries all the way

00:11:06.971 --> 00:11:09.643
from bench to bedside.

00:11:09.643 --> 00:11:11.649
And me?

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:16.196
I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.

00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:22.999
Now, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:26.763
will this help injured people?

00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:30.655
Me too, every day.

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:34.068
The truth is that we don't know enough yet.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:38.292
This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,

00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:41.026
but I begin to believe that this may lead

00:11:41.026 --> 00:11:43.593
to an intervention to improve recovery

00:11:43.593 --> 00:11:46.780
and people's quality of life.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.269
I would like you all

00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:52.896
to take a moment and dream with me.

00:11:52.896 --> 00:11:58.791
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.

00:11:58.791 --> 00:12:01.946
After a few weeks of recovery,

00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:04.306
we will implant a programmable pump

00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:07.339
to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:09.781
directly to the spinal cord.

00:12:09.781 --> 00:12:13.044
At the same time, we will implant an electrode array,

00:12:13.044 --> 00:12:15.151
a sort of second skin

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:18.711
covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,

00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:21.977
and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator

00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:24.439
that delivers stimulations that are tailored

00:12:24.439 --> 00:12:26.625
to the person's needs.

00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:31.483
This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis

00:12:31.483 --> 00:12:34.234
that will enable locomotion

00:12:34.234 --> 00:12:38.281
during training with a newly designed supporting system.

00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:41.564
And my hope is that after several months of training,

00:12:41.564 --> 00:12:43.727
there may be enough remodeling of residual connection

00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:47.396
to allow locomotion without the robot,

00:12:47.396 --> 00:12:51.174
maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.

00:12:51.174 --> 00:12:53.708
My hope here is to be able to create

00:12:53.708 --> 00:12:55.973
the personalized condition

00:12:55.973 --> 00:12:58.636
to boost the plasticity of the brain

00:12:58.636 --> 00:13:00.167
and the spinal cord.

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:02.906
And this is a radically new concept

00:13:02.906 --> 00:13:06.199
that may apply to other neurological disorders,

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:10.737
what I termed "personalized neuroprosthetics,"

00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:13.761
where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,

00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:17.475
I implanted throughout the nervous system,

00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:20.816
in the brain, in the spinal cord,

00:13:20.816 --> 00:13:23.572
even in peripheral nerves,

00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:26.739
based on patient-specific impairments.

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:31.347
But not to replace the lost function, no --

00:13:31.347 --> 00:13:34.538
to help the brain help itself.

00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:37.178
And I hope this enticed your imagination,

00:13:37.178 --> 00:13:39.074
because I can promise to you

00:13:39.074 --> 00:13:42.317
this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur,

00:13:42.317 --> 00:13:44.109
but when.

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:46.342
And remember, we are only as great

00:13:46.357 --> 00:13:49.942
as our imagination, as big as our dream.

00:13:49.942 --> 00:13:51.934
Thank you.

00:13:51.934 --> 00:13:55.934
(Applause)
