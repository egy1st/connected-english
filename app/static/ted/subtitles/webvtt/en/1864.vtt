00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:02.082
I would like to talk to you about a story

00:00:02.082 --> 00:00:04.563
about a small town kid.

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:08.238
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:11.314
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:15.344
His village is near Mogadishu.

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:17.518
Drought drives the small village into poverty

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.386
and to the brink of starvation.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.222
With nothing left for him there,

00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:23.049
he leaves for the big city,

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.454
in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:29.284
When he arrives, there are no opportunities,

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:32.272
no jobs, no way forward.

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:34.296
He ends up living in a tent city

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:37.000
on the outskirts of Mogadishu.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.009
Maybe a year passes, nothing.

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.309
One day, he's approached by a gentleman

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.507
who offers to take him to lunch,

00:00:45.507 --> 00:00:48.583
then to dinner, to breakfast.

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:51.602
He meets this dynamic group of people,

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:53.107
and they give him a break.

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:54.426
He's given a bit of money

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:56.528
to buy himself some new clothes,

00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.064
money to send back home to his family.

00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:01.037
He is introduced to this young woman.

00:01:01.037 --> 00:01:02.752
He eventually gets married.

00:01:02.752 --> 00:01:05.557
He starts this new life.

00:01:05.557 --> 00:01:08.483
He has a purpose in life.

00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:11.257
One beautiful day in Mogadishu,

00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:14.145
under an azure blue sky,

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:16.666
a car bomb goes off.

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.861
That small town kid with the big city dreams

00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.109
was the suicide bomber,

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.467
and that dynamic group of people

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.836
were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:30.517
linked to al Qaeda.

00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:33.389
So how does the story of a small town kid

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:35.210
just trying to make it big in the city

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.040
end up with him blowing himself up?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.012
He was waiting.

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:41.910
He was waiting for an opportunity,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.692
waiting to begin his future,

00:01:43.692 --> 00:01:45.727
waiting for a way forward,

00:01:45.727 --> 00:01:48.106
and this was the first thing that came along.

00:01:48.106 --> 00:01:50.520
This was the first thing that pulled him out

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.460
of what we call waithood.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.756
And his story repeats itself

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:58.172
in urban centers around the world.

00:01:58.172 --> 00:02:00.926
It is the story of the disenfranchised,

00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:02.734
unemployed urban youth

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:06.677
who sparks riots in Johannesburg,

00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:09.011
sparks riots in London,

00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:13.665
who reaches out for something other than waithood.

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:16.329
For young people, the promise of the city,

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.023
the big city dream is that of opportunity,

00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:21.178
of jobs, of wealth,

00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:24.919
but young people are not sharing
in the prosperity of their cities.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:29.017
Often it's youth who suffer from
the highest unemployment rates.

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:32.210
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.770
will be under the age of 18.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.534
If we do not include young people

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:38.353
in the growth of our cities,

00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:40.832
if we do not provide them opportunities,

00:02:40.832 --> 00:02:42.854
the story of waithood,

00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:45.767
the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:49.942
will be the story of cities 2.0.

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:53.103
And in my city of birth, Mogadishu,

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:56.793
70 percent of young people
suffer from unemployment.

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:59.171
70 percent don't work,

00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:01.198
don't go to school.

00:03:01.198 --> 00:03:03.623
They pretty much do nothing.

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:07.139
I went back to Mogadishu last month,

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.149
and I went to visit Madina Hospital,

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:11.197
the hospital I was born in.

00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:13.222
I remember standing in front of that

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:16.200
bullet-ridden hospital thinking,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.233
what if I had never left?

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:19.426
What if I had been forced

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:21.945
into that same state of waithood?

00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:25.956
Would I have become a terrorist?

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:28.847
I'm not really sure about the answer.

00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:31.015
My reason for being in Mogadishu that month

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:32.562
was actually to host

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:35.109
a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.105
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.

00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:40.351
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions

00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:43.227
to the biggest challenges facing their city.

00:03:43.227 --> 00:03:46.629
One of the young men in the room was Aden.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.084
He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:53.273
There were no jobs, no opportunities.

00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:54.991
I remember him telling me,

00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:57.799
because he was a college graduate,

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.549
unemployed, frustrated,

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.946
that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab

00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:05.998
and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.

00:04:05.998 --> 00:04:09.876
They sought people like him out.

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:12.972
But his story takes a different route.

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:14.909
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.162
to getting from point A to point B are the roads.

00:04:18.162 --> 00:04:19.945
Twenty-three years of civil war

00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:22.176
have completely destroyed the road system,

00:04:22.176 --> 00:04:24.185
and a motorbike can be the easiest way

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:25.815
to get around.

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:29.056
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:31.181
He started a motorbike company.

00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:33.472
He began renting out motorbikes

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:36.772
to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.

00:04:36.772 --> 00:04:38.793
He bought 10 bikes, with the help

00:04:38.793 --> 00:04:40.491
of family and friends,

00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:42.224
and his dream is to eventually expand

00:04:42.224 --> 00:04:45.205
to several hundred within the next three years.

00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:47.773
How is this story different?

00:04:47.773 --> 00:04:50.130
What makes his story different?

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.960
I believe it is his ability to identify

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.298
and seize a new opportunity.

00:04:56.298 --> 00:04:58.329
It's entrepreneurship,

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:00.088
and I believe entrepreneurship can be

00:05:00.088 --> 00:05:03.066
the most powerful tool against waithood.

00:05:03.066 --> 00:05:04.836
It empowers young people

00:05:04.836 --> 00:05:08.216
to be the creators of the very economic opportunities

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:10.714
they are so desperately seeking.

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:14.396
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:16.512
I want to talk to you about a young man

00:05:16.512 --> 00:05:18.801
who attended one of my meetings,

00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:21.685
Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.

00:05:21.685 --> 00:05:23.368
He was helping me train some of the young people

00:05:23.368 --> 00:05:24.805
at the summit in entrepreneurship

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:26.427
and how to be innovative

00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:29.194
and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.691
He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen

00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:34.375
in over 22 years,

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:37.639
and until recently, until Mohamed came along,

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.529
if you wanted flowers at your wedding,

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:40.922
you used plastic bouquets

00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:42.508
shipped from abroad.

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.314
If you asked someone,

00:05:44.314 --> 00:05:46.589
"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.175
for many who grew up under civil war,

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:51.958
the answer would be, "Never."

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.906
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:58.353
He started a landscaping and design floral company.

00:05:58.353 --> 00:06:01.661
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.717
and started growing tulips and lilies,

00:06:03.717 --> 00:06:05.423
which he said could survive

00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:08.134
the harsh Mogadishu climate.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:11.832
And he began delivering flowers to weddings,

00:06:11.832 --> 00:06:13.765
creating gardens at homes

00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:16.369
and businesses around the city,

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.106
and he's now working on creating

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:21.731
Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:23.830
There's no public park in Mogadishu.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.159
He wants to create a space where families,

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.810
young people, can come together,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.448
and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.

00:06:32.448 --> 00:06:34.404
And he doesn't grow roses because

00:06:34.404 --> 00:06:38.528
they use too much water, by the way.

00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:42.840
So the first step is to inspire young people,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.032
and in that room, Mohamed's presence

00:06:45.032 --> 00:06:48.508
had a really profound impact
on the youth in that room.

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:51.095
They had never really thought
about starting up a business.

00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:52.942
They've thought about working for an NGO,

00:06:52.942 --> 00:06:54.629
working for the government,

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:58.936
but his story, his innovation,

00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:00.889
really had a strong impact on them.

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.008
He forced them to look at their city

00:07:03.008 --> 00:07:04.762
as a place of opportunity.

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:08.510
He empowered them to believe
that they could be entrepreneurs,

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.930
that they could be change makers.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.490
By the end of the day, they were coming up

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.041
with innovative solutions

00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:17.373
to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.

00:07:17.373 --> 00:07:19.976
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions

00:07:19.976 --> 00:07:22.898
to local problems.

00:07:22.898 --> 00:07:25.129
So inspiring young people

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:27.543
and creating a culture of entrepreneurship

00:07:27.543 --> 00:07:29.410
is a really great step,

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.099
but young people need capital

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.888
to make their ideas a reality.

00:07:32.888 --> 00:07:35.212
They need expertise and mentorship

00:07:35.212 --> 00:07:38.612
to guide them in developing
and launching their businesses.

00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:41.099
Connect young people with the resources they need,

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:44.564
provide them the support they need
to go from ideation to creation,

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:48.664
and you will create catalysts for urban growth.

00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:51.588
For me, entrepreneurship is more than just

00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:53.144
starting up a business.

00:07:53.144 --> 00:07:55.525
It's about creating a social impact.

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:57.660
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.147
I believe he is selling hope.

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.736
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:04.908
when it's created, will actually transform

00:08:04.908 --> 00:08:06.980
the way people see their city.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.133
Aden hired street kids to help rent out

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:10.995
and maintain those bikes for him.

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:13.053
He gave them the opportunity to escape

00:08:13.053 --> 00:08:15.989
the paralysis of waithood.

00:08:15.989 --> 00:08:18.019
These young entrepreneurs are having

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:21.553
a tremendous impact in their cities.

00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:24.069
So my suggestion is,

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:26.585
turn youth into entrepreneurs,

00:08:26.585 --> 00:08:29.808
incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,

00:08:29.808 --> 00:08:33.647
and you will have more stories
of flowers and Peace Parks

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.740
than of car bombs and waithood.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.560
Thank you.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.073
(Applause)
