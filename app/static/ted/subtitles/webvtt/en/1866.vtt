00:00:00.935 --> 00:00:03.049
Today I am going to teach you

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.809
how to play my favorite game:

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.292
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:13.612
It's the only game in the world that I know of

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.679
that allows you, the player,

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.098
the opportunity to experience

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:22.486
10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:24.998
This is true, so if you play this game with me today

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:27.001
for just one single minute,

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.701
you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:33.767
pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.365
contentment, and creativity,

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:36.904
all in the span of one minute.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:39.236
So this sounds pretty good, right?
Now you're willing to play.

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:40.799
In order to teach you this game,

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.172
I'm going to need some volunteers

00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:44.075
to come up onstage really quickly,

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:45.553
and we're going to do a little hands-on demo.

00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:47.594
While they're coming up, I should let you know,

00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:50.056
this game was invented 10 years ago

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:53.353
by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.098
So thank you, Monochrom.

00:00:55.098 --> 00:00:57.141
Okay, so most people are familiar

00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.133
with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.721
Sunni, let's just remind them.

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.507
One, two, three, four, 
I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle,

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:05.607
and of course Sunni beats me
because she's the best.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:09.411
Now the first thing about
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:10.822
we're the gamer generation.

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:13.173
There are a billion gamers on the planet now,

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.727
so we need more of a challenge.

00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:18.106
So the first thing we need is more thumbs.

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:19.800
So Eric, come on over.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.611
So we could get three thumbs together,

00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:25.069
and Peter could join us.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.789
We could even have four thumbs together,

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.316
and the way you win

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:31.513
is you're the first person
to pin someone else's thumb.

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:33.371
This is really important. You can't, like,

00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:35.908
wait while they fight it out and
then swoop in at the last minute.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:37.403
That is not how you win.

00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:38.738
Ah, who did that? Eric you did that.

00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:41.540
So Eric would have won. He was
the first person to pin my thumb.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.950
Okay, so that's the first rule,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.809
and we can see that three or four

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:47.988
is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,

00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:50.630
but if you feel ambitious,
you don't have to hold back.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.995
We can really go for it.

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.161
So you can see up here.

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:57.133
Now the only other rule you need to remember is,

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.400
gamer generation, we like a challenge.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.047
I happen to notice you all have

00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:02.883
some thumbs you're not using.

00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:05.890
So I think we should kind of get some more involved.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.660
And if we had just four people,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.498
we would do it just like this,

00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:11.184
and we would try and wrestle

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:12.965
both thumbs at the same time.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:14.272
Perfect.

00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:16.386
Now, if we had more people in the room,

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.265
instead of just wrestling in a closed node,

00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:21.048
we might reach out and try
and grab some other people.

00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:22.769
And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.321
We're going to try and get all, something like,

00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.297
I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room

00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:29.610
connected in a single node.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.650
And we have to connect both levels,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.096
so if you're up there, you're going to be

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:37.309
reaching down and reaching up.

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.983
Now — (Laughter) —

00:02:38.983 --> 00:02:40.875
before we get started --

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:43.908
This is great. You're excited to play. —

00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:46.988
before we get started, can I have
the slides back up here really quick,

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:48.945
because if you get good at this game,

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:51.581
I want you to know there are some advanced levels.

00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:54.493
So this is the kind of simple level, right?

00:02:54.493 --> 00:02:56.405
But there are advanced configurations.

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:58.415
This is called the Death Star Configuration.

00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:00.122
Any Star Wars fans?

00:03:00.122 --> 00:03:02.470
And this one's called the Möbius Strip.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.290
Any science geeks, you get that one.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.194
This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.

00:03:07.194 --> 00:03:09.208
So we'll stick with the normal one for now,

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:11.150
and I'm going to give you 30 seconds,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.175
every thumb into the node,

00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:14.648
connect the upper and the lower levels,

00:03:14.648 --> 00:03:16.150
you guys go on down there.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.326
Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.

00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:23.932
Stand up! It's easier if you stand up.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:27.871
Everybody, up up up up up!

00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:30.635
Stand up, my friends.

00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:32.193
All right.

00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:35.001
Don't start wrestling yet.

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.781
If you have a free thumb, wave it around,

00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.002
make sure it gets connected.

00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:43.694
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.

00:03:43.694 --> 00:03:47.027
If you have a free thumb,
wave it around to make sure.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.520
Grab that thumb!

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.863
Reach behind you. There you go.

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:51.421
Any other thumbs?

00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.936
Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go.

00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:56.649
Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.179
Okay? One, two, three, go!

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:03.268
(Laughter)

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.532
Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:12.049
(Applause)

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.591
Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:16.996
All right.

00:04:16.996 --> 00:04:20.408
While you are basking in the glow

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:22.210
of having won your first

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.825
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,

00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:26.415
let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.

00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:28.354
So curiosity.

00:04:28.354 --> 00:04:30.326
I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:32.126
You were like, "What the hell is she talking about?"

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:34.003
So I provoked a little curiosity.

00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:36.672
Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem

00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:38.031
of getting all the thumbs into the node.

00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:39.444
I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.

00:04:39.444 --> 00:04:40.998
So you used creativity. That was great.

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:43.250
How about surprise? The actual feeling

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.912
of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once
is pretty surprising.

00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:47.772
You heard that sound go up in the room.

00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:49.611
We had excitement. As you started to wrestle,

00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:51.816
maybe you're starting to win
or this person's, like, really into it,

00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:54.302
so you kind of get the excitement going.

00:04:54.302 --> 00:04:56.245
We have relief. You got to stand up.

00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:58.003
You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,

00:04:58.003 --> 00:04:59.320
getting to shake it out.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.880
We had joy. You were laughing, smiling.
Look at your faces. This room is full of joy.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.840
We had some contentment.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.529
I didn't see anybody sending text messages
or checking their email while we were playing,

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.522
so you were totally content to be playing.

00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:13.210
The most important three emotions,

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.822
awe and wonder, we had everybody
connected physically for a minute.

00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:18.421
When was the last time you were at TED

00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:21.250
and you got to connect physically
with every single person in the room?

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.896
And it's truly awesome and wondrous.

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:24.740
And speaking of physical connection,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.743
you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,

00:05:27.743 --> 00:05:30.920
you release oxytocin, you feel bonded
to everyone in the room.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.436
You guys know that the best way
to release oxytocin quickly

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:35.935
is to hold someone else's hand
for at least six seconds.

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.487
You guys were all holding hands
for way more than six seconds,

00:05:38.487 --> 00:05:40.267
so we are all now biochemically primed

00:05:40.267 --> 00:05:42.120
to love each other. That is great.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.044
And the last emotion of pride.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:47.848
How many people are like me. Just admit it.

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:48.994
You lost both your thumbs.

00:05:48.994 --> 00:05:50.943
It just didn't work out for you.

00:05:50.943 --> 00:05:53.506
That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:56.270
You learned, from scratch,
a game you never knew before.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.976
Now you know how to play it.
You can teach other people.

00:05:57.976 --> 00:05:59.544
So congratulations.

00:05:59.544 --> 00:06:01.865
How many of you won just won thumb?

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:03.236
All right. I have very good news for you.

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:04.368
According to the official rules

00:06:04.368 --> 00:06:06.364
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,

00:06:06.364 --> 00:06:10.145
this makes you a grandmaster of the game.

00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:12.377
Because there aren't that many
people who know how to play,

00:06:12.377 --> 00:06:14.576
we have to kind of accelerate the program

00:06:14.576 --> 00:06:16.169
more than a game like chess.

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.962
So congratulations, grandmasters.

00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:20.453
Win one thumb once, you will
become a grandmaster.

00:06:20.453 --> 00:06:22.482
Did anybody win both their thumbs?

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:23.981
Yes. Awesome. Okay.

00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:26.904
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status.

00:06:26.904 --> 00:06:28.670
You guys, according to the rules,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.346
are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations.

00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:35.075
I will just leave you with this tip,
if you want to play again.

00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:36.863
The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:38.949
you've got your two nodes going on.

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.671
Pick off the one that looks easiest.

00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:42.652
They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.736
Focus on that one and do something crazy

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:46.072
with this arm.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.401
As soon as you win, suddenly stop.

00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:50.201
Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.767
That's how you become a legendary grandmaster
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.294
Thank you for letting me
teach you my favorite game.

00:06:55.294 --> 00:06:57.130
Wooo! (Applause)

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.210
Thank you. (Applause)
