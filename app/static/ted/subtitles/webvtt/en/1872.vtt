WEBVTT

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.292
When we think of Nepal,

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:05.747
we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains

00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:07.019
of the Himalayas,

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.468
the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes,

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.514
or the huge expanse of its grasslands.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.721
What some of us may not realize

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.045
is that in the Himalayan foothills,

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.219
where the climate is much warmer

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.307
and the landscape much greener,

00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:24.733
there lives a great diversity of wildlife,

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.469
including the one-horned rhinoceros,

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.143
the Asian elephant

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:31.218
and the Bengal tiger.

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.070
But unfortunately, these animals

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.733
are under constant threat from poachers

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.045
who hunt and kill them for their body parts.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.254
To stop the killing of these animals,

00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:43.852
battalions of soldiers and rangers

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.101
are sent to protect Nepal's national parks,

00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:48.726
but that is not an easy task,

00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:51.397
because these soldiers have to patrol

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:54.388
thousands of hectares of forests on foot

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.029
or elephant backs.

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:58.514
It is also risky for these soldiers

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.895
when they get into gunfights with poachers,

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:02.911
and therefore Nepal is always looking

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:06.207
for new ways to help with protecting the forests

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:08.184
and wildlife.

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.693
Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:13.406
in the fight against wildlife crime,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.112
and these are drones,

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:18.386
or more specifically, conservation drones.

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:20.900
For about a year now, my colleagues and I

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.160
have been building drones for Nepal

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.658
and training the park protection personnel

00:01:25.658 --> 00:01:27.636
on the use of these drones.

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:29.268
Not only does a drone give you

00:01:29.268 --> 00:01:31.742
a bird's-eye view of the landscape,

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.777
but it also allows you to capture detailed,

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:38.759
high-resolution images of objects on the ground.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.268
This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.205
taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.168
in the lowlands of Nepal.

00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:49.399
Now we believe that drones have

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.207
tremendous potential,

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:53.985
not only for combating wildlife crime,

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.948
but also for monitoring the health

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.487
of these wildlife populations.

00:01:58.487 --> 00:02:00.337
So what is a drone?

00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.846
Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:04.947
is simply a model aircraft

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:07.392
fitted with an autopilot system,

00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:11.661
and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,

00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.715
a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter

00:02:15.715 --> 00:02:17.974
and a few other sensors.

00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:19.393
Now a drone like this

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:21.599
is meant to carry a useful payload,

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.382
such as a video camera

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:25.370
or a photographic camera.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.719
It also requires a software that allows the user

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.420
to program a mission,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.826
to tell the drone where to go.

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:34.903
Now people I talk to are often surprised

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:37.234
when they hear that these are the only

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:40.341
four components that make a conservation drone,

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.845
but they are even more surprised

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:45.345
when I tell them how affordable
these components are.

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:47.631
The facts is, a conservation drone

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.890
doesn't cost very much more than

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.867
a good laptop computer

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:55.126
or a decent pair of binoculars.

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:58.098
So now that you've built
your own conservation drone,

00:02:58.098 --> 00:03:00.260
you probably want to go fly it,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.193
but how does one fly a drone?

00:03:02.193 --> 00:03:03.785
Well, actually, you don't,

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.275
because the drone flies itself.

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:09.405
All you have to do is to program a mission

00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:11.665
to tell the drone where to fly.

00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:13.984
But you simply do that by clicking on

00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:17.233
a few way points on the Google Maps interface

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.483
using the open-source software.

00:03:19.483 --> 00:03:21.430
Those missions could be as simple

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.456
as just a few way points,

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:26.833
or they could be slightly longer
and more complicated,

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:29.254
to fly along a river system.

00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:33.103
Sometimes, we fly the drone
in a lawnmower-type pattern

00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:35.223
and take pictures of that area,

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:37.194
and those pictures can be processed

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:39.933
to produce a map of that forest.

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:42.536
Other researchers might want to fly the drone

00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:44.678
along the boundaries of a forest

00:03:44.678 --> 00:03:46.849
to watch out for poachers or people

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.767
who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:51.647
Now whatever your mission is,

00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:53.120
once you've programmed it,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.103
you simply upload it to the autopilot system,

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:57.743
bring your drone to the field,

00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:00.958
and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.300
And often we'll go about this mission

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.360
taking pictures or videos along the way,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.294
and usually at that point,

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:10.511
we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,

00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:13.441
sit back, and relax for the next few minutes,

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:16.952
although some of us sit back
and panic for the next few minutes

00:04:16.952 --> 00:04:19.170
worrying that the drone will not return.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.443
Usually it does, and when it does,

00:04:21.443 --> 00:04:24.849
it even lands automatically.

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.756
So what can we do with a conservation drone?

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:31.149
Well, when we built our first prototype drone,

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:33.667
our main objective was to fly it over

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:37.556
a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,

00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:40.605
to look for the nest of a species of great ape

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.761
known as the orangutan.

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.417
The reason we wanted to do that was because

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:47.446
we needed to know how many individuals

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:50.833
of this species are still left in that forest.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.019
Now the traditional method of surveying

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:56.621
for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot

00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.508
carrying heavy equipment

00:04:58.508 --> 00:05:02.158
and to use a pair of binoculars
to look up in the treetops

00:05:02.158 --> 00:05:05.576
where you might find an orangutan or its nest.

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:07.302
Now as you can imagine,

00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:10.272
that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,

00:05:10.272 --> 00:05:11.990
and costly process,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.786
so we were hoping that drones

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:17.111
could significantly reduce the cost of surveying

00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.678
for orangutan populations in Indonesia

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:22.145
and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:24.500
So we were very excited when we captured

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.670
our first pair of orangutan nests on camera.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.834
And this is it; this is the first ever picture

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:33.874
of orangutan nests taken with a drone.

00:05:33.874 --> 00:05:35.898
Since then we have taken pictures

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:37.516
of dozens of these nests

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:40.285
from around various parts of Southeast Asia,

00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:42.528
and we're now working with computer scientists

00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:46.447
to develop algorithms that can automatically count

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:48.464
the number of nests from the thousands

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:51.583
of photos we've collected so far.

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.541
But nests are not the only objects

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:55.331
these drones can detect.

00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:57.640
This is a wild orangutan

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.161
happily feeding on top of a palm tree,

00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:03.713
seemingly oblivious to our drone
that was flying overhead,

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:06.097
not once but several times.

00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:09.115
We've also taken pictures of other animals

00:06:09.115 --> 00:06:12.236
including forest buffalos in Gabon,

00:06:12.236 --> 00:06:15.451
elephants, and even turtle nests.

00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:18.991
But besides taking pictures
of just the animals themselves,

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:22.992
we also take pictures of the habitats
these animals live in,

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:24.606
because we want to keep track

00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:27.560
of the health of these habitats.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.779
Sometimes, we zoom out a little

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.032
and look at other things that might be happening

00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:33.496
in the landscape.

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:36.796
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:40.038
Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation

00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:41.560
in that part of the world,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.617
so we wanted to use this new drone technology

00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:47.732
to keep track of the spread of these plantations

00:06:47.732 --> 00:06:49.742
in Southeast Asia.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:52.105
But drones could also be used to keep track of

00:06:52.105 --> 00:06:54.589
illegal logging activities.

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:57.030
This is a recently logged forest,

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.385
again in Sumatra.

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:00.544
You could even still see the processed

00:07:00.544 --> 00:07:04.172
wooden planks left on the ground.

00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:06.461
But perhaps the most exciting part

00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:09.027
about taking pictures from the air is

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:11.453
we could later stitch these pictures together

00:07:11.453 --> 00:07:14.316
using special software to create a map

00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:17.083
of the entire landscape, and this map

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.098
gives us crucial information

00:07:19.098 --> 00:07:21.366
for monitoring land use change,

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:25.113
to let us know where and when
plantations might be expanding,

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:27.390
where forests might be contracting,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.772
or where fires might be breaking out.

00:07:30.772 --> 00:07:33.004
Aerial images could also be processed

00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:35.313
to produce three-dimensional

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:37.310
computer models of forests.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.263
Now these models are not just visually appealing,

00:07:40.263 --> 00:07:42.764
but they are also geometrically accurate,

00:07:42.764 --> 00:07:45.541
which means researchers can now measure

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:47.666
the distance between trees,

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:50.961
calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,

00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:54.160
and so on, all of which are important information

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.473
for monitoring the health of these forests.

00:07:57.473 --> 00:07:59.926
Recently, we've also begun experimenting

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.990
with thermal imaging cameras.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.879
Now these cameras can detect

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.853
heat-emitting objects from the ground,

00:08:05.864 --> 00:08:13.236
and therefore they are very useful
for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.

00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:15.120
So I've told you quite a lot about

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.336
what conservation drones are,

00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:19.653
how you might operate one of these drones,

00:08:19.653 --> 00:08:21.662
and what a drone could do for you.

00:08:21.662 --> 00:08:23.898
I will now tell you where conservation drones

00:08:23.898 --> 00:08:26.353
are being used around the world.

00:08:26.353 --> 00:08:29.406
We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.

00:08:29.406 --> 00:08:31.547
We brought a few of these to Indonesia

00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:33.690
for the first few test flights.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.505
Since then, we've been building drones

00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:38.187
for our collaborators from around the world,

00:08:38.187 --> 00:08:40.367
and these include fellow biologists

00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:44.295
and partners from major conservation organizations.

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:46.585
Perhaps the best and most rewarding part

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.711
about working with these collaborators

00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:50.191
is the feedback they give us

00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:52.834
on how to improve our drones.

00:08:52.834 --> 00:08:54.965
Building drones for us is

00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:57.129
a constant work in progress.

00:08:57.129 --> 00:09:00.206
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.820
their range, their ruggedness,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.498
and the amount of payload they can carry.

00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:07.540
We also work with collaborators

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.827
to discover new ways of using these drones.

00:09:10.827 --> 00:09:14.107
For example, camera traps are a common tool

00:09:14.107 --> 00:09:18.002
used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals

00:09:18.002 --> 00:09:19.563
hiding in the forests,

00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:21.897
but these are motion-activated cameras,

00:09:21.897 --> 00:09:24.538
so they snap a picture every time an animal

00:09:24.538 --> 00:09:26.210
crosses their path.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.762
But the problem with camera traps

00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:31.505
is that the researcher has to go back to the forest

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:34.958
every so often to retrieve those images,

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.610
and that takes a lot of time,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.444
especially if there are dozens

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:41.572
or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.

00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:44.383
Now a drone could be designed to perform the task

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:46.107
much more efficiently.

00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:48.777
This drone, carrying a special sensor,

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:51.118
could be flown over the forest

00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:53.865
and remotely download these images

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:58.002
from wi-fi–enabled cameras.

00:09:58.002 --> 00:10:00.139
Radio collars are another tool

00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:02.387
that's commonly used by biologists.

00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:05.054
Now these collars are put onto animals.

00:10:05.054 --> 00:10:07.855
They transmit a radio signal which allows

00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:13.002
the researcher to track the movements
of these animals across the landscape.

00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:15.659
But the traditional way of tracking animals

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:17.881
is pretty ridiculous,

00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:20.825
because it requires the researcher to be walking

00:10:20.825 --> 00:10:24.939
on the ground carrying a huge
and cumbersome radio antenna,

00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:27.812
not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have

00:10:27.812 --> 00:10:30.780
on our rooftops. Some of us still do.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.045
A drone could be used to do the same job

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:34.704
much more efficiently.

00:10:34.704 --> 00:10:36.410
Why not equip a drone

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.413
with a scanning radio receiver,

00:10:38.413 --> 00:10:40.407
fly that over the forest canopy

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:41.945
in a certain pattern

00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:44.737
which would allow the user or the operator

00:10:44.737 --> 00:10:47.319
to triangulate the location

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:50.306
of these radio-collared animals remotely

00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:53.279
without having to step foot in the forest.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.782
A third and perhaps most exciting way

00:10:55.782 --> 00:10:57.312
of using these drones

00:10:57.312 --> 00:11:00.262
is to fly them to a really remote,

00:11:00.262 --> 00:11:02.538
never-explored-before rainforest

00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:04.362
somewhere hidden in the tropics,

00:11:04.362 --> 00:11:08.295
and parachute down a tiny spy microphone

00:11:08.295 --> 00:11:10.741
that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls

00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:14.063
of mammals, birds, amphibians,

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:18.340
the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.079
That would give us biologists

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.965
a pretty good idea of what animals

00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:24.515
might be living in those forests.

00:11:24.515 --> 00:11:26.564
And finally, I would like to show you

00:11:26.564 --> 00:11:29.665
the latest version of our conservation drone.

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:31.804
The MAJA drone has a wingspan

00:11:31.804 --> 00:11:33.478
of about two meters.

00:11:33.478 --> 00:11:35.428
It weighs only about two kilograms,

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.889
but it can carry half its weight.

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:40.484
It is a fully autonomous system.

00:11:40.484 --> 00:11:42.871
During its mission, it can even transmit

00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:46.834
a live video feed back to a ground station laptop,

00:11:46.834 --> 00:11:48.377
which allows the user

00:11:48.377 --> 00:11:51.307
to see what the drone is seeing in real time.

00:11:51.307 --> 00:11:53.729
It carries a variety of sensors,

00:11:53.729 --> 00:11:56.067
and the photo quality of some of these sensors

00:11:56.067 --> 00:12:00.277
can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.

00:12:00.277 --> 00:12:03.958
This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,

00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.082
which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.

00:12:07.082 --> 00:12:08.997
That is quite sufficient for most

00:12:08.997 --> 00:12:11.996
of our conservation applications.

00:12:11.996 --> 00:12:14.066
Now, conservation drones began as

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.257
a crazy idea from two biologists

00:12:16.257 --> 00:12:19.542
who are just deeply passionate
about this technology.

00:12:19.542 --> 00:12:21.692
And we believe, strongly believe,

00:12:21.692 --> 00:12:25.039
that drones can and will be a game changer

00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:28.073
for conservation research and applications.

00:12:28.073 --> 00:12:31.248
We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics

00:12:31.248 --> 00:12:34.769
who thought that we were just
fooling around with toy planes.

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:36.195
And in a way, they are right.

00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:37.824
I mean, let's be honest,

00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:41.512
drones are the ultimate toys for boys.

00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:43.918
But at the same time, we've also gotten to know

00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:46.167
many wonderful colleagues and collaborators

00:12:46.167 --> 00:12:47.715
who share our vision

00:12:47.715 --> 00:12:50.571
and see the potential of conservation drones.

00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:54.170
To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.428
and practitioners should make full use

00:12:56.428 --> 00:12:59.962
of every available tool, including drones,

00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:02.603
in our fight to save the last remaining forests

00:13:02.603 --> 00:13:04.390
and wildlife of this planet.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.388
Thank you.

00:13:06.388 --> 00:13:12.110
(Applause)
