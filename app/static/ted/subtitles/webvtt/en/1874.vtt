WEBVTT

00:00:00.502 --> 00:00:04.693
Technology can change our understanding of nature.

00:00:04.693 --> 00:00:07.844
Take for example the case of lions.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:10.014
For centuries, it's been said that female lions

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:12.743
do all of the hunting out in the open savanna,

00:00:12.743 --> 00:00:16.724
and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:19.736
You've heard this too, I can tell.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.322
Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.994
in the Kruger National Park in South Africa.

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:27.586
Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:29.183
on male and female lions,

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:30.791
and we mapped their hunting behavior

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:32.239
from the air.

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.905
The lower left shows a lion sizing up

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:36.917
a herd of impala for a kill,

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:38.486
and the right shows what I call

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:40.349
the lion viewshed.

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:42.971
That's how far the lion can see in all directions

00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:47.146
until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:48.587
And what we found

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:51.093
is that male lions are not the lazy hunters

00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:52.617
we thought them to be.

00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:54.754
They just use a different strategy.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.506
Whereas the female lions hunt

00:00:56.506 --> 00:00:57.638
out in the open savanna

00:00:57.638 --> 00:01:00.299
over long distances, usually during the day,

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.309
male lions use an ambush strategy

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.042
in dense vegetation, and often at night.

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:10.048
This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds

00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:11.913
of male lions on the left

00:01:11.913 --> 00:01:13.902
and females on the right.

00:01:13.902 --> 00:01:16.458
Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation,

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:18.573
and the white are wide open spaces.

00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:21.673
And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level

00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:24.203
of hunting male and female lions.

00:01:24.203 --> 00:01:26.532
All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:29.385
of the very spooky conditions under which

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:31.465
male lions do their hunting.

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:32.961
I bring up this example to begin,

00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:37.429
because it emphasizes how little
we know about nature.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.104
There's been a huge amount of work done so far

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:43.732
to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,

00:01:43.732 --> 00:01:45.681
and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,

00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:47.595
as shown in red on the slide.

00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:49.935
I find it ironic that we're doing so much,

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:53.568
yet these areas are fairly unknown to science.

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:56.225
So how can we save what we don't understand?

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:58.887
Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer

00:01:58.887 --> 00:02:00.578
with a background in physics and chemistry

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.782
and biology and a lot of other boring subjects,

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:06.784
but above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:08.496
about our planet.

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:10.170
So I created this,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.447
the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.

00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:15.504
It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,

00:02:15.504 --> 00:02:18.264
but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:20.700
of high-tech sensors, computers,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.911
and a very motivated staff

00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:25.380
of Earth scientists and pilots.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.240
Two of our instruments are very unique:

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.994
one is called an imaging spectrometer

00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:30.856
that can actually measure the chemical composition

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:33.785
of plants as we fly over them.

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:35.711
Another one is a set of lasers,

00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:37.442
very high-powered lasers,

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:39.402
that fire out of the bottom of the plane,

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:41.274
sweeping across the ecosystem

00:02:41.274 --> 00:02:45.371
and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second

00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:47.849
in high-resolution 3D.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.833
Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:52.005
in San Francisco, not far from where I live.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.808
Although we flew straight over this bridge,

00:02:53.808 --> 00:02:55.464
we imaged it in 3D, captured its color

00:02:55.464 --> 00:02:57.511
in just a few seconds.

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.606
But the real power of the CAO

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:01.781
is its ability to capture the actual building blocks

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.550
of ecosystems.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.249
This is a small town in the Amazon,

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:06.864
imaged with the CAO.

00:03:06.864 --> 00:03:08.603
We can slice through our data

00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:10.867
and see, for example, the 3D structure

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:13.200
of the vegetation and the buildings,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.109
or we can use the chemical information

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.840
to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.183
as we fly over them.

00:03:19.183 --> 00:03:22.669
The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.586
And we can see biodiversity in ways

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:26.745
that you never could have imagined.

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.296
This is what a rainforest might look like

00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:30.503
as you fly over it in a hot air balloon.

00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:32.597
This is how we see a rainforest,

00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:34.942
in kaleidoscopic color that tells us

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:37.884
that there are many species living with one another.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.808
But you have to remember that these trees

00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:42.104
are literally bigger than whales,

00:03:42.104 --> 00:03:45.016
and what that means is that
they're impossible to understand

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.991
just by walking on the ground below them.

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:52.629
So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.387
and this tells us not only the species

00:03:54.387 --> 00:03:56.271
that are living in the canopy,

00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:58.191
but it tells us a lot of information

00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:01.767
about the rest of the species
that occupy the rainforest.

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:03.898
Now I created the CAO

00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:06.037
in order to answer questions that have proven

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.389
extremely challenging to answer
from any other vantage point,

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.266
such as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:15.503
I want to share three of those
questions with you today.

00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:17.210
The first questions is,

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.939
how do we manage our carbon reserves

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.695
in tropical forests?

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:25.254
Tropical forests contain a huge
amount of carbon in the trees,

00:04:25.254 --> 00:04:27.668
and we need to keep that carbon in those forests

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:31.082
if we're going to avoid any further global warming.

00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:33.308
Unfortunately, global carbon emissions

00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:35.071
from deforestation

00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:38.246
now equals the global transportation sector.

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:42.549
That's all ships, airplanes, trains 
and automobiles combined.

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:45.640
So it's understandable that policy negotiators

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.128
have been working hard to reduce deforestation,

00:04:48.128 --> 00:04:49.999
but they're doing it on landscapes

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.138
that are hardly known to science.

00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:54.499
If you don't know where the carbon is exactly,

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.351
in detail, how can you know what you're losing?

00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:01.408
Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system.

00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:03.724
With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks

00:05:03.724 --> 00:05:06.522
of tropical forests in utter detail.

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:09.377
The red shows, obviously,
closed-canopy tropical forest,

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:11.395
and then you see the cookie cutting,

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:15.302
or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.

00:05:15.302 --> 00:05:18.125
It's like cutting a cake except this cake

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:20.324
is about whale deep.

00:05:20.324 --> 00:05:22.292
And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest

00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:24.305
and the trees at the same time.

00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:26.507
And what's amazing is, even though we flew

00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:28.784
very high above this forest,

00:05:28.784 --> 00:05:30.687
later on in analysis, we can go in

00:05:30.687 --> 00:05:32.907
and actually experience the treetrops,

00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:35.254
leaf by leaf, branch by branch,

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:38.761
just as the other species that live in this forest

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:41.578
experience it along with the trees themselves.

00:05:41.578 --> 00:05:43.744
We've been using the technology to explore

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:46.614
and to actually put out the first carbon geographies

00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:48.228
in high resolution

00:05:48.228 --> 00:05:50.474
in faraway places like the Amazon Basin

00:05:50.474 --> 00:05:52.761
and not-so-faraway places like the United States

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:54.494
and Central America.

00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:57.994
What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you
on a high-resolution, first-time tour

00:05:57.994 --> 00:06:01.923
of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.

00:06:01.923 --> 00:06:04.685
The colors are going to be going from red to blue.

00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:06.679
Red is extremely high carbon stocks,

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:09.218
your largest cathedral forests you can imagine,

00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:11.460
and blue are very low carbon stocks.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.894
And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,

00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:16.283
totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography

00:06:16.283 --> 00:06:17.869
until today.

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:19.715
We can fly to this area in northern Peru

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:21.851
and see super high carbon stocks in red,

00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:23.340
and the Amazon River and floodplain

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.085
cutting right through it.

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:26.983
We can go to an area of utter devastation

00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:28.818
caused by deforestation in blue,

00:06:28.818 --> 00:06:32.260
and the virus of deforestation
spreading out in orange.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.944
We can also fly to the southern Andes

00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:36.794
to see the tree line and see exactly how

00:06:36.794 --> 00:06:38.710
the carbon geography ends

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.416
as we go up into the mountain system.

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:44.321
And we can go to the biggest swamp
in the western Amazon.

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:45.694
It's a watery dreamworld

00:06:45.694 --> 00:06:48.040
akin to Jim Cameron's "Avatar."

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.344
We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.701
Panama, and see also a huge range

00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:55.263
of carbon variation,

00:06:55.263 --> 00:06:57.264
from high in red to low in blue.

00:06:57.264 --> 00:07:00.196
Unfortunately, most of the carbon
is lost in the lowlands,

00:07:00.196 --> 00:07:01.742
but what you see that's left,

00:07:01.742 --> 00:07:04.475
in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,

00:07:04.475 --> 00:07:06.589
is the stuff that's up in the mountains.

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:08.947
One interesting exception to this

00:07:08.947 --> 00:07:10.563
is right in the middle of your screen.

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:13.207
You're seeing the buffer zone
around the Panama Canal.

00:07:13.207 --> 00:07:15.120
That's in the reds and yellows.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.860
The canal authorities are using force

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.975
to protect their watershed and global commerce.

00:07:19.975 --> 00:07:21.465
This kind of carbon mapping

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:23.383
has transformed conservation

00:07:23.383 --> 00:07:24.979
and resource policy development.

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:27.339
It's really advancing our ability to save forests

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:29.714
and to curb climate change.

00:07:29.714 --> 00:07:33.145
My second question: How do we
prepare for climate change

00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:35.291
in a place like the Amazon rainforest?

00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:36.944
Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time

00:07:36.944 --> 00:07:40.169
in these places, and we're seeing
the climate changing already.

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.781
Temperatures are increasing,

00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:44.413
and what's really happening is
we're getting a lot of droughts,

00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:46.070
recurring droughts.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.887
The 2010 mega-drought is shown here

00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:51.337
with red showing an area
about the size of Western Europe.

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:53.599
The Amazon was so dry in 2010

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.001
that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself

00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:58.135
dried up partially, as you see in the photo

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.556
in the lower portion of the slide.

00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:04.726
What we found is that in very remote areas,

00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:07.472
these droughts are having a big negative impact

00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:09.060
on tropical forests.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.780
For example, these are all of the dead trees in red

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.841
that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.

00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:16.718
This area happens to be on the border

00:08:16.718 --> 00:08:18.117
of Peru and Brazil,

00:08:18.117 --> 00:08:19.653
totally unexplored,

00:08:19.653 --> 00:08:22.456
almost totally unknown scientifically.

00:08:22.456 --> 00:08:24.922
So what we think, as Earth scientists,

00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:26.881
is species are going to have to migrate

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.673
with climate change from the east in Brazil

00:08:29.673 --> 00:08:31.737
all the way west into the Andes

00:08:31.737 --> 00:08:33.210
and up into the mountains

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.746
in order to minimize their
exposure to climate change.

00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:38.754
One of the problems with this is that humans

00:08:38.754 --> 00:08:41.779
are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:43.888
Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash

00:08:43.888 --> 00:08:46.790
in the forest created by gold miners.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.068
You see the forest in green in 3D,

00:08:49.068 --> 00:08:50.902
and you see the effects of gold mining

00:08:50.902 --> 00:08:53.441
down below the soil surface.

00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:57.900
Species have nowhere to migrate
in a system like this, obviously.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.552
If you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.

00:09:00.552 --> 00:09:02.590
It's an amazing experience every time,

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.133
no matter where you go.

00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:07.529
You're going to probably see it this way, on a river.

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.293
But what happens is a lot of times

00:09:09.293 --> 00:09:11.145
the rivers hide what's really going on

00:09:11.145 --> 00:09:13.910
back in the forest itself.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.624
We flew over this same river,

00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:17.464
imaged the system in 3D.

00:09:17.464 --> 00:09:19.280
The forest is on the left.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.266
And then we can digitally remove the forest

00:09:21.266 --> 00:09:23.725
and see what's going on below the canopy.

00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:26.175
And in this case, we found gold mining activity,

00:09:26.175 --> 00:09:27.412
all of it illegal,

00:09:27.412 --> 00:09:29.608
set back away from the river's edge,

00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:31.512
as you'll see in those strange pockmarks

00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:33.539
coming up on your screen on the right.

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:35.868
Don't worry, we're working with the authorities

00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:38.319
to deal with this and many, many other problems

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:40.929
in the region.

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:43.984
So in order to put together a conservation plan

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:45.724
for these unique, important corridors

00:09:45.724 --> 00:09:48.711
like the western Amazon
and the Andes Amazon corridor,

00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:50.875
we have to start making

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.281
geographically explicit plans now.

00:09:53.283 --> 00:09:57.258
How do we do that if we don't know
the geography of biodiversity in the region,

00:09:57.258 --> 00:09:58.953
if it's so unknown to science?

00:09:58.953 --> 00:10:00.817
So what we've been doing is using

00:10:00.817 --> 00:10:03.790
the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.014
to map for the first time the biodiversity

00:10:06.014 --> 00:10:07.593
of the Amazon rainforest.

00:10:07.593 --> 00:10:11.130
Here you see actual data showing
different species in different colors.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.270
Reds are one type of species, blues are another,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.615
and greens are yet another.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.778
And when we take this together and scale up

00:10:17.778 --> 00:10:19.662
to the regional level,

00:10:19.662 --> 00:10:22.231
we get a completely new geography

00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:26.619
of biodiversity unknown prior to this work.

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:28.767
This tells us where the big biodiversity changes

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:30.781
occur from habitat to habitat,

00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:32.964
and that's really important because it tells us

00:10:32.964 --> 00:10:35.859
a lot about where species may migrate to

00:10:35.859 --> 00:10:38.742
and migrate from as the climate shifts.

00:10:38.742 --> 00:10:41.964
And this is the pivotal information that's needed

00:10:41.964 --> 00:10:45.472
by decision makers to develop protected areas

00:10:45.472 --> 00:10:48.891
in the context of their regional development plans.

00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:50.788
And third and final question is,

00:10:50.788 --> 00:10:52.896
how do we manage biodiversity on a planet

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:54.874
of protected ecosystems?

00:10:54.874 --> 00:10:57.625
The example I started out
with about lions hunting,

00:10:57.625 --> 00:10:59.480
that was a study we did

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.472
behind the fence line of a protected area

00:11:01.472 --> 00:11:03.204
in South Africa.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.202
And the truth is, much of Africa's nature

00:11:05.202 --> 00:11:07.117
is going to persist into the future

00:11:07.117 --> 00:11:10.363
in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.

00:11:10.363 --> 00:11:12.839
This puts incredible pressure and responsibility

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.458
on park management.

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:17.075
They need to do and make decisions

00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:20.366
that will benefit all of the species
that they're protecting.

00:11:20.366 --> 00:11:23.435
Some of their decisions have really big impacts.

00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:25.511
For example, how much and where

00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:28.151
to use fire as a management tool?

00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:31.376
Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants,

00:11:31.376 --> 00:11:33.829
which may, if their populations get too large,

00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:35.876
have a negative impact on the ecosystem

00:11:35.876 --> 00:11:37.478
and on other species.

00:11:37.478 --> 00:11:39.971
And let me tell you, these types of dynamics

00:11:39.971 --> 00:11:41.919
really play out on the landscape.

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:44.380
In the foreground is an area with lots of fire

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.647
and lots of elephants:

00:11:45.647 --> 00:11:49.323
wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.

00:11:49.323 --> 00:11:51.504
As we cross this fence line, now we're getting

00:11:51.504 --> 00:11:53.828
into an area that has had protection from fire

00:11:53.828 --> 00:11:55.685
and zero elephants:

00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:59.843
dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.

00:11:59.843 --> 00:12:02.233
And in a place like Kruger,

00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:03.974
the soaring elephant densities

00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:05.717
are a real problem.

00:12:05.717 --> 00:12:08.081
I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,

00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:10.741
and there are no easy answers with this.

00:12:10.741 --> 00:12:13.057
But what's good is that
the technology we've developed

00:12:13.057 --> 00:12:15.529
and we're working with in South Africa, for example,

00:12:15.529 --> 00:12:18.885
is allowing us to map every
single tree in the savanna,

00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:20.454
and then through repeat flights

00:12:20.454 --> 00:12:22.200
we're able to see which trees

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.230
are being pushed over by elephants,

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.488
in the red as you see on the screen,
and how much that's happening

00:12:27.488 --> 00:12:30.025
in different types of landscapes in the savanna.

00:12:30.025 --> 00:12:31.666
That's giving park managers

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:34.029
a very first opportunity to use

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:37.371
tactical management strategies
that are more nuanced

00:12:37.371 --> 00:12:41.193
and don't lead to those extremes
that I just showed you.

00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:44.905
So really, the way we're looking

00:12:44.905 --> 00:12:46.946
at protected areas nowadays

00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:49.834
is to think of it as tending to a circle of life,

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:51.882
where we have fire management,

00:12:51.882 --> 00:12:56.016
elephant management, those impacts on
the structure of the ecosystem,

00:12:56.016 --> 00:12:58.006
and then those impacts

00:12:58.006 --> 00:13:00.312
affecting everything from insects

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:03.112
up to apex predators like lions.

00:13:03.112 --> 00:13:04.877
Going forward, I plan to greatly expand

00:13:04.877 --> 00:13:06.605
the airborne observatory.

00:13:06.605 --> 00:13:08.772
I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit

00:13:08.772 --> 00:13:10.455
so we can manage the entire planet

00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:12.188
with technologies like this.

00:13:12.188 --> 00:13:14.037
Until then, you're going to find me flying

00:13:14.037 --> 00:13:16.540
in some remote place that you've never heard of.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.082
I just want to end by saying that technology is

00:13:19.082 --> 00:13:22.821
absolutely critical to managing our planet,

00:13:22.821 --> 00:13:24.920
but even more important is the understanding

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.652
and wisdom to apply it.

00:13:26.652 --> 00:13:28.751
Thank you.

00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:32.828
(Applause)
