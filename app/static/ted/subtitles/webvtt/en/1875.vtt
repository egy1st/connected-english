00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:03.293
Sarge Salman: All the way from
Los Altos Hills, California,

00:00:03.293 --> 00:00:05.354
Mr. Henry Evans.

00:00:05.354 --> 00:00:09.246
(Applause)

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:22.105
Henry Evans: Hello.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:23.960
My name is Henry Evans,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.551
and until August 29, 2002,

00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:32.575
I was living my version of the American dream.

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:37.073
I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.

00:00:37.073 --> 00:00:38.928
My dad was a lawyer.

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:41.917
My mom was a homemaker.

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.368
My six siblings and I were good kids,

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:47.860
but caused our fair share of trouble.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.250
After high school, I left home to study

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.153
and learn more about the world.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:55.810
I went to Notre Dame University

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.356
and graduated with degrees
in accounting and German,

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:02.300
including spending a year of study in Austria.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.181
Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:11.193
I married my high school sweetheart, Jane.

00:01:11.193 --> 00:01:13.555
I am lucky to have her.

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:18.200
Together, we raised four wonderful children.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.281
I worked and studied hard
to move up the career ladder,

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.676
eventually becoming a chief financial officer

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:28.476
in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:31.253
My family and I bought our first and only home

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:35.089
on December 13, 2001,

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:37.298
a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot

00:01:37.298 --> 00:01:39.738
of Los Altos Hills, California,

00:01:39.738 --> 00:01:42.974
from where I am speaking to you now.

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:45.584
We were looking forward to rebuilding it,

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.819
but eight months after we moved in,

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.211
I suffered a stroke-like attack
caused by a birth defect.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:57.150
Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.493
at the ripe old age of 40.

00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:02.646
It took me several years,

00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:06.215
but with the help of an incredibly supportive family,

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:11.074
I finally decided life was still worth living.

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:13.619
I became fascinated with using technology

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:18.043
to help the severely disabled.

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:20.565
Head tracking devices sold commercially

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:23.316
by the company Madentec

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:27.174
convert my tiny head movements
into cursor movements,

00:02:27.174 --> 00:02:31.460
and enable my use of a regular computer.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.719
I can surf the web, exchange email with people,

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.647
and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins

00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:39.764
in online word games.

00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:42.650
This technology allows me to remain engaged,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.003
mentally active,

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:47.754
and feel like I am a part of the world.

00:02:47.754 --> 00:02:51.059
One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.645
when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:56.396
of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:59.240
demonstrating a PR2 robot.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.287
I emailed Charlie and
Steve Cousins of Willow Garage,

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:08.139
and we formed the Robots for Humanity project.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.040
For about two years, Robots for Humanity

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.421
developed ways for me to use the PR2

00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.801
as my body surrogate.

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:21.894
I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.

00:03:21.894 --> 00:03:23.668
From my home in California,

00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:27.647
I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter)

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:32.064
I handed out Halloween candy.

00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:38.091
I opened my refrigerator on my own.

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:42.163
I began doing tasks around the house.

00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:45.731
I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.396
to live and contribute,

00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:53.022
both for myself and others in my circumstance.

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:57.630
All of us have disabilities in one form or another.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.056
For example, if either of us
wants to go 60 miles an hour,

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:08.400
both of us will need an assistive device called a car.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.716
Your disability doesn't make you
any less of a person,

00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:14.140
and neither does mine.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.913
By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter)

00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:21.810
Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.754
to fly on our own.

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:28.864
Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage

00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:31.436
connected with me Chad Jenkins.

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:33.909
Chad showed me how easy it is

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.565
to purchase and fly aerial drones.

00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:40.153
It was then I realized that I could also use

00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:42.381
an aerial drone to expand the worlds

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:45.519
of bedridden people through flight,

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:48.442
giving a sense of movement and control

00:04:48.442 --> 00:04:51.519
that is incredible.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:54.396
Using a mouse cursor I control with my head,

00:04:54.396 --> 00:04:56.285
these web interfaces allow me

00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:57.895
to see video from the robot

00:04:57.895 --> 00:04:59.528
and send control commands

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:03.255
by pressing buttons in a web browser.

00:05:03.255 --> 00:05:07.164
With a little practice, I became
good enough with this interface

00:05:07.164 --> 00:05:10.841
to drive around my home on my own.

00:05:13.884 --> 00:05:16.592
I could look around our garden

00:05:16.592 --> 00:05:20.702
and see the grapes we are growing.

00:05:20.702 --> 00:05:26.722
I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter)

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:29.721
One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone

00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:33.142
on our basketball hoop.

00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:37.688
I went even further by seeing if I could use

00:05:37.688 --> 00:05:40.711
a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift,

00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:42.759
as modified by Fighting Walrus,

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.406
to have an immersive experience

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:48.361
controlling the drone.

00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:50.288
With Chad's group at Brown,

00:05:50.288 --> 00:05:52.761
I regularly fly drones around his lab

00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:58.517
several times a week,
from my home 3,000 miles away.

00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:02.042
All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic,

00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:05.072
so we also find time to play friendly games

00:06:05.072 --> 00:06:08.789
of robot soccer. (Laughter)

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.179
I never thought I would be able to casually

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:16.151
move around a campus like Brown on my own.

00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:20.493
I just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter)

00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:26.953
Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside,

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:29.142
I bet all of these people here

00:06:29.142 --> 00:06:31.348
would love to see you fly this drone

00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:34.513
from your bed in California 3,000 miles away.

00:06:34.513 --> 00:06:39.370
(Applause)

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.330
Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately?

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.838
(Laughter)

00:06:52.838 --> 00:06:56.347
Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic?

00:06:56.347 --> 00:07:00.684
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:06.831
Can you show us how excited you are?

00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.747
(Laughter)

00:07:11.113 --> 00:07:12.764
All right, big finish.

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:16.436
Can you show us how good of a pilot you are?

00:07:17.818 --> 00:07:22.445
(Applause)

00:07:22.468 --> 00:07:24.954
All right, we still have a little ways to go with that,

00:07:24.954 --> 00:07:27.466
but I think it shows the promise.

00:07:27.466 --> 00:07:30.102
What makes Henry's story amazing

00:07:30.102 --> 00:07:33.230
is it's about understanding Henry's needs,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.224
understanding what people in Henry's situation

00:07:36.224 --> 00:07:38.133
need from technology,

00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:39.790
and then also understanding

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.168
what advanced technology can provide,

00:07:42.168 --> 00:07:44.241
and then bringing those two things together

00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:47.483
for use in a wise and responsible way.

00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:49.593
What we're trying to do is democratize robotics,

00:07:49.593 --> 00:07:51.494
so that anybody can be a part of this.

00:07:51.494 --> 00:07:54.490
We're providing affordable,
off-the-shelf robot platforms

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.030
such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.618
the Suitable Technologies beam,
only 17,000 dollars,

00:08:01.618 --> 00:08:03.978
along with open-source robotics software

00:08:03.978 --> 00:08:06.155
so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do.

00:08:06.155 --> 00:08:09.039
And our hope is that, by providing these tools,

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:10.687
that you'll be able to think of better ways

00:08:10.687 --> 00:08:12.588
to provide movement for the disabled,

00:08:12.588 --> 00:08:15.310
to provide care for our aging population,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.294
to help better educate our children,

00:08:17.294 --> 00:08:19.608
to think about what the new types

00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:22.200
of middle class jobs could be for the future,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.803
to both monitor and protect our environment,

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:26.882
and to explore the universe.

00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:29.917
Back to you, Henry.

00:08:30.813 --> 00:08:33.599
HE: Thank you, Chad.

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.421
With this drone setup, we show the potential

00:08:36.421 --> 00:08:38.887
for bedridden people to once again be able

00:08:38.887 --> 00:08:41.558
to explore the outside world,

00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:43.935
and robotics will eventually provide

00:08:43.935 --> 00:08:45.278
a level playing field

00:08:45.278 --> 00:08:47.981
where one is only limited by their mental acuity

00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:50.226
and imagination,

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:52.385
where the disabled are able to perform

00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:55.080
the same activities as everyone else,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.982
and perhaps better,

00:08:57.982 --> 00:09:00.622
and technology will even allow us to provide

00:09:00.622 --> 00:09:02.783
an outlet for many people who are presently

00:09:02.783 --> 00:09:05.211
considered vegetables.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.218
One hundred years ago,

00:09:07.218 --> 00:09:10.569
I would have been treated like a vegetable.

00:09:10.569 --> 00:09:12.999
Actually, that's not true.

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:15.194
I would have died.

00:09:15.194 --> 00:09:18.016
It is up to us, all of us, to decide how

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:21.381
robotics will be used, for good or for evil,

00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:23.006
for simply replacing people

00:09:23.006 --> 00:09:24.643
or for making people better,

00:09:24.643 --> 00:09:28.583
for allowing us to do and enjoy more.

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:32.209
Our goal for robotics is to
unlock everyone's mental power

00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:34.878
by making the world more physically accessible

00:09:34.878 --> 00:09:37.421
to people such as myself and others like me

00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:39.603
around the globe.

00:09:39.603 --> 00:09:41.486
With the help of people like you,

00:09:41.486 --> 00:09:44.626
we can make this dream a reality.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.307
Thank you.

00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:54.236
(Applause)
