00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:03.565
One billion people in the world today

00:00:03.565 --> 00:00:05.845
do not have access to all-season roads.

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:07.550
One billion people.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.721
One seventh of the Earth's population

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:13.030
are totally cut off for some part of the year.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.358
We cannot get medicine to them reliably,

00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:17.704
they cannot get critical supplies,

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:19.693
and they cannot get their goods to market

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:23.583
in order to create a sustainable income.

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:25.727
In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:29.640
85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.659
Investments are being made,

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.204
but at the current level,

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:34.601
it's estimated it's going to take them

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.707
50 years to catch up.

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:40.001
In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.132
miles of roads, very expensive to build,

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:46.503
very expensive to maintain infrastructure,

00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:48.772
with a huge ecological footprint,

00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:52.444
and yet, very often, congested.

00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:54.826
So we saw this and we thought,

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:56.309
can there be a better way?

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.764
Can we create a system using today's
most advanced technologies

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:02.884
that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:05.239
in the same way they've done with mobile telephones

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.114
in the last 10 years?

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:10.059
Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:13.036
without ever putting copper lines in the ground.

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:16.386
Could we do the same for transportation?

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:18.701
Imagine this scenario.

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.859
Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali,

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.089
and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:27.321
What would you do today?

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.718
Well, you would place a request via mobile phone,

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:32.582
and someone would get the request immediately.

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:34.575
That's the part that works.

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.612
The medication may take days to arrive, though,

00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:38.022
because of bad roads.

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:40.378
That's the part that's broken.

00:01:40.378 --> 00:01:42.895
We believe we can deliver it within hours

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:45.476
with an electric autonomous flying vehicle

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:46.881
such as this.

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:49.766
This can transport a small payload
today, about two kilograms,

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:52.400
over a short distance, about 10 kilometers,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.755
but it's part of a wider network that may cover

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:58.715
the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:03.053
It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.

00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:05.988
It's a network for a transportation of matter.

00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:07.765
We call it Matternet.

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.279
We use three key technologies.

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.914
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:14.625
The second is automated ground stations

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:16.604
that the vehicles fly in and out of

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:18.862
to swap batteries and fly farther,

00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:20.604
or pick up or deliver loads.

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:22.335
And the third is the operating system

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:25.078
that manages the whole network.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:28.417
Let's look at each one of those
technologies in a bit more detail.

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:30.662
First of all, the UAVs.

00:02:30.662 --> 00:02:32.746
Eventually, we're going to be
using all sorts of vehicles

00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:35.200
for different payload capacities and different ranges.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.456
Today, we're using small quads.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:39.799
These are able to transport two kilograms

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.612
over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:45.138
Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road

00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:46.552
in the developing world,

00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:48.772
or even being stuck in traffic

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.817
in a developed world country.

00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:52.527
These fly autonomously.

00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:54.083
This is the key to the technology.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:56.443
So they use GPS and other sensors on board

00:02:56.443 --> 00:03:00.137
to navigate between ground stations.

00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:02.562
Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic

00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:05.600
payload and battery exchange mechanism,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.006
so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations,

00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:10.122
they dock, swap a battery automatically,

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.826
and go out again.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:14.582
The ground stations are located on safe locations

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:16.144
on the ground.

00:03:16.144 --> 00:03:18.143
They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission,

00:03:18.143 --> 00:03:19.997
which is the landing.

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:22.089
They are at known locations on the ground,

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:24.009
so the paths between them are also known,

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.747
which is very important from a reliability perspective

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:28.298
from the whole network.

00:03:28.298 --> 00:03:31.122
Apart from fulfilling the energy
requirements of the vehicles,

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:33.494
eventually they're going to be becoming

00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:36.194
commercial hubs where people can take out loads

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:39.257
or put loads into the network.

00:03:39.257 --> 00:03:41.480
The last component is the operating system

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.374
that manages the whole network.

00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:46.115
It monitors weather data from all the ground stations

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:49.456
and optimizes the routes of
the vehicles through the system

00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:52.047
to avoid adverse weather conditions,

00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:54.050
avoid other risk factors,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.770
and optimize the use of the resources

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.668
throughout the network.

00:03:57.668 --> 00:03:59.310
I want to show you what one of those flights

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.078
looks like.

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:05.020
Here we are flying in Haiti last summer,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.463
where we've done our first field trials.

00:04:07.463 --> 00:04:09.607
We're modeling here a medical delivery

00:04:09.607 --> 00:04:14.447
in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.

00:04:14.447 --> 00:04:16.998
People there love this.

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:19.127
And I want to show you

00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:24.003
what one of those vehicles looks like up close.

00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:26.011
So this is a $3,000 vehicle.

00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:30.028
Costs are coming down very rapidly.

00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:33.203
We use this in all sorts of weather conditions,

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:34.998
very hot and very cold climates,

00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:41.096
very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles.

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:45.115
Imagine if your life depended on this package,

00:04:45.115 --> 00:04:46.559
somewhere in Africa

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.822
or in New York City, after Sandy.

00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:54.128
The next big question is, what's the cost?

00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:57.938
Well, it turns out that the cost to transport

00:04:57.938 --> 00:05:01.897
two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle

00:05:01.897 --> 00:05:05.270
is just 24 cents.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.342
(Applause)

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:13.086
And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy

00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:15.075
expended for the flight is only two cents

00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:16.413
of a dollar today,

00:05:16.413 --> 00:05:18.546
and we're just at the beginning of this.

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:21.148
When we saw this, we felt that this is something

00:05:21.148 --> 00:05:24.147
that can have significant impact in the world.

00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:26.565
So we said, okay, how much does it cost

00:05:26.565 --> 00:05:28.633
to set up a network somewhere in the world?

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:30.663
And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.704
for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.

00:05:33.704 --> 00:05:36.111
The problem there is how do you take them

00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:38.340
from clinics where they're being collected

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.360
to hospitals where they're being analyzed?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.502
And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area

00:05:43.502 --> 00:05:46.159
spanning around 140 square kilometers?

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.633
That's roughly one and a half times
the size of Manhattan.

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:51.800
Well it turns out that the cost to do that there

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.775
would be less than a million dollars.

00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:58.006
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments.

00:05:58.006 --> 00:06:01.163
We think this can be -- this is the power

00:06:01.163 --> 00:06:03.882
of a new paradigm.

00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:06.365
So here we are: a new idea

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.235
about a network for transportation

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.881
that is based on the ideas of the Internet.

00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.110
It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.813
it's bidirectional, highly adaptable,

00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:18.323
with very low infrastructure investment,

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:22.456
very low ecological footprint.

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:24.740
If it is a new paradigm, though,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.886
there must be other uses for it.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.052
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.

00:06:29.052 --> 00:06:33.230
So let's look at the other end of the spectrum:

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.235
our cities and megacities.

00:06:35.235 --> 00:06:38.107
Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today.

00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:40.827
Half a billion of us live in megacities.

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:43.507
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:45.480
China alone is adding a megacity

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.587
the size of New York City every two years.

00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:51.240
These are places that do have road infrastructure,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.554
but it's very inefficient.

00:06:53.554 --> 00:06:55.686
Congestion is a huge problem.

00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:57.626
So we think it makes sense in those places

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.996
to set up a network of transportation

00:06:59.996 --> 00:07:02.162
that is a new layer that sits between the road

00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:03.433
and the Internet,

00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:06.339
initially for lightweight, urgent stuff,

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:08.388
and over time, we would hope to develop this

00:07:08.388 --> 00:07:10.380
into a new mode of transportation

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.832
that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:15.386
It's ultimately scalable

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:18.244
with a very small ecological footprint,

00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:21.220
operating in the background 24/7,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.566
just like the Internet.

00:07:23.566 --> 00:07:25.988
So when we started this

00:07:25.988 --> 00:07:28.990
a couple of years ago now,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.334
we've had a lot of people come up to us who said,

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:34.166
"This is a very interesting but crazy idea,

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:36.000
and certainly not something that you should

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.714
engage with anytime soon."

00:07:38.714 --> 00:07:40.857
And of course, we're talking about drones, right,

00:07:40.857 --> 00:07:44.559
a technology that's not only unpopular in the West

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:46.507
but one that has become a very, very unpleasant

00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:49.372
fact of life for many living in poor countries,

00:07:49.372 --> 00:07:52.183
especially those engaged in conflict.

00:07:52.183 --> 00:07:56.717
So why are we doing this?

00:07:56.717 --> 00:07:59.501
Well, we chose to do this one

00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:01.287
not because it's easy,

00:08:01.287 --> 00:08:04.122
but because it can have amazing impact.

00:08:04.122 --> 00:08:06.947
Imagine one billion people being connected

00:08:06.947 --> 00:08:09.342
to physical goods in the same way

00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:12.366
that mobile telecommunications connected them

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:14.458
to information.

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:18.198
Imagine if the next big network we built in the world

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:21.961
was a network for the transportation of matter.

00:08:21.961 --> 00:08:24.363
In the developing world, we would hope

00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:27.068
to reach millions of people with better vaccines,

00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:28.952
reach them with better medication.

00:08:28.952 --> 00:08:30.810
It would give us an unfair advantage against battling

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.802
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.

00:08:34.802 --> 00:08:36.498
Over time, we would hope it would become

00:08:36.498 --> 00:08:38.672
a new platform for economic transactions,

00:08:38.672 --> 00:08:41.133
lifting millions of people out of poverty.

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:43.343
In the developed world and the emerging world,

00:08:43.343 --> 00:08:44.811
we would hope it would become a new mode

00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:48.532
of transportation that could help make our cities

00:08:48.532 --> 00:08:50.385
more livable.

00:08:50.385 --> 00:08:53.728
So for those that still believe
that this is science fiction,

00:08:53.728 --> 00:08:56.543
I firmly say to you that it is not.

00:08:56.543 --> 00:08:58.212
We do need to engage, though,

00:08:58.212 --> 00:09:01.280
in social fiction to make it happen.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.447
Thank you.

00:09:03.447 --> 00:09:07.447
(Applause)
