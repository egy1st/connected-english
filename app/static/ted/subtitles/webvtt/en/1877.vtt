WEBVTT

00:00:00.745 --> 00:00:02.974
To give me an idea of how many of you here

00:00:02.974 --> 00:00:05.096
may find what I'm about to tell you

00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:06.721
of practical value,

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.410
let me ask you please to raise your hands:

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.977
Who here is either over 65 years old

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:16.746
or hopes to live past age 65

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:19.691
or has parents or grandparents who did live

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:21.658
or have lived past 65,

00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:24.243
raise your hands please. (Laughter)

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:26.397
Okay. You are the people to whom my talk

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:28.831
will be of practical value. (Laughter)

00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:30.488
The rest of you

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.276
won't find my talk personally relevant,

00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:34.190
but I think that you will still find the subject

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.837
fascinating.

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:37.469
I'm going to talk about growing older

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.888
in traditional societies.

00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:42.634
This subject constitutes just one chapter

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:45.225
of my latest book, which compares

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:48.442
traditional, small, tribal societies

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:50.992
with our large, modern societies,

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:52.617
with respect to many topics

00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:54.476
such as bringing up children,

00:00:54.476 --> 00:00:58.397
growing older, health, dealing with danger,

00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:00.742
settling disputes, religion

00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:03.533
and speaking more than one language.

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.090
Those tribal societies, which constituted

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.075
all human societies for most of human history,

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:12.369
are far more diverse than are our modern,

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.536
recent, big societies.

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.899
All big societies that have governments,

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.165
and where most people are strangers to each other,

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:21.513
are inevitably similar to each other

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:24.361
and different from tribal societies.

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.672
Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:30.221
in how to run a human society.

00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:33.028
They constitute experiments from which we ourselves

00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:35.430
may be able to learn.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.450
Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.186
as primitive and miserable,

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:41.557
but also they shouldn't be romanticized

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:43.774
as happy and peaceful.

00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:46.033
When we learn of tribal practices,

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.807
some of them will horrify us,

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:50.357
but there are other tribal practices which,

00:01:50.357 --> 00:01:51.706
when we hear about them,

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:53.653
we may admire and envy

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:55.877
and wonder whether we could adopt those practices

00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:58.574
ourselves.

00:01:58.574 --> 00:02:01.661
Most old people in the U.S. end up living

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:03.648
separately from their children

00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:05.154
and from most of their friends

00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:06.846
of their earlier years,

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:10.700
and often they live in separate
retirements homes for the elderly,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.908
whereas in traditional societies,

00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:15.742
older people instead live out their lives

00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:17.908
among their children, their other relatives,

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:20.305
and their lifelong friends.

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:22.474
Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:25.639
varies enormously among traditional societies,

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.820
from much worse to much better

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.778
than in our modern societies.

00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:33.575
At the worst extreme, many traditional societies

00:02:33.575 --> 00:02:35.388
get rid of their elderly

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.919
in one of four increasingly direct ways:

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.582
by neglecting their elderly

00:02:40.582 --> 00:02:44.011
and not feeding or cleaning them until they die,

00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:47.065
or by abandoning them when the group moves,

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:50.204
or by encouraging older people to commit suicide,

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:53.249
or by killing older people.

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.998
In which tribal societies do children

00:02:55.998 --> 00:02:58.384
abandon or kill their parents?

00:02:58.384 --> 00:03:01.408
It happens mainly under two conditions.

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:04.388
One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies

00:03:04.388 --> 00:03:06.111
that often shift camp

00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:08.290
and that are physically incapable

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.413
of transporting old people who can't walk

00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:13.973
when the able-bodied younger people already

00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:15.908
have to carry their young children

00:03:15.908 --> 00:03:18.726
and all their physical possessions.

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:20.890
The other condition is in societies

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.200
living in marginal or fluctuating environments,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.533
such as the Arctic or deserts,

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:29.117
where there are periodic food shortages,

00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:31.046
and occasionally there just isn't enough food

00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:33.526
to keep everyone alive.

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:35.950
Whatever food is available has to be reserved

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.275
for able-bodied adults and for children.

00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:43.175
To us Americans, it sounds horrible

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:45.408
to think of abandoning or killing

00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:47.589
your own sick wife or husband

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.888
or elderly mother or father,

00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:53.647
but what could those traditional societies

00:03:53.647 --> 00:03:55.130
do differently?

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.950
They face a cruel situation of no choice.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.945
Their old people had to do it to their own parents,

00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:03.233
and the old people know

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:06.384
what now is going to happen to them.

00:04:06.384 --> 00:04:08.198
At the opposite extreme

00:04:08.198 --> 00:04:10.877
in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:12.864
are the New Guinea farming societies

00:04:12.864 --> 00:04:15.861
where I've been doing my fieldwork 
for the past 50 years,

00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:19.108
and most other sedentary traditional societies

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:21.194
around the world.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:24.142
In those societies, older people are cared for.

00:04:24.142 --> 00:04:26.492
They are fed. They remain valuable.

00:04:26.492 --> 00:04:28.680
And they continue to live in the same hut

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.367
or else in a nearby hut near their children,

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:35.266
relatives and lifelong friends.

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:37.698
There are two main sets of reasons for this variation

00:04:37.698 --> 00:04:40.053
among societies in their treatment

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:41.450
of old people.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.087
The variation depends especially

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:45.357
on the usefulness of old people

00:04:45.357 --> 00:04:48.070
and on the society's values.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.393
First, as regards usefulness,

00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:53.848
older people continue to perform useful services.

00:04:53.848 --> 00:04:56.533
One use of older people in traditional societies

00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:58.533
is that they often are still effective

00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:00.946
at producing food.

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:03.359
Another traditional usefulness of older people

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:06.638
is that they are capable of babysitting

00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:08.332
their grandchildren,

00:05:08.332 --> 00:05:11.002
thereby freeing up their own adult children,

00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:12.873
the parents of those grandchildren,

00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:16.346
to go hunting and gathering
food for the grandchildren.

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:18.551
Still another traditional value of older people

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.471
is in making tools, weapons, baskets,

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:23.428
pots and textiles.

00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:26.677
In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.

00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:29.445
Older people usually are the leaders

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:31.294
of traditional societies,

00:05:31.294 --> 00:05:34.553
and the people most knowledgeable about politics,

00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:38.552
medicine, religion, songs and dances.

00:05:38.552 --> 00:05:41.004
Finally, older people in traditional societies

00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:44.931
have a huge significance that would never occur

00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:48.607
to us in our modern, literate societies,

00:05:48.607 --> 00:05:51.022
where our sources of information are books

00:05:51.022 --> 00:05:52.706
and the Internet.

00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:56.129
In contrast, in traditional societies without writing,

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.815
older people are the repositories of information.

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:02.380
It's their knowledge that spells the difference

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.130
between survival and death for their whole society

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.388
in a time of crisis caused by rare events

00:06:09.388 --> 00:06:11.983
for which only the oldest people alive

00:06:11.983 --> 00:06:14.272
have had experience.

00:06:14.272 --> 00:06:16.742
Those, then, are the ways in which older people

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:19.645
are useful in traditional societies.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.207
Their usefulness varies and contributes

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:24.825
to variation in the society's treatment

00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:26.825
of the elderly.

00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:28.644
The other set of reasons for variation

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:30.519
in the treatment of the elderly is

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:33.754
the society's cultural values.

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:35.780
For example, there's particular emphasis

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.989
on respect for the elderly in East Asia,

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:41.900
associated with Confucius' doctrine

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.450
of filial piety, which means obedience,

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.544
respect and support for elderly parents.

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:53.257
Cultural values that emphasize
respect for older people

00:06:53.257 --> 00:06:56.074
contrast with the low status of the elderly

00:06:56.074 --> 00:06:58.236
in the U.S.

00:06:58.236 --> 00:07:00.794
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:02.907
in job applications.

00:07:02.907 --> 00:07:05.442
They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.

00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:08.065
Our hospitals have an explicit policy

00:07:08.065 --> 00:07:13.032
called age-based allocation of healthcare resources.

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:15.805
That sinister expression means that

00:07:15.805 --> 00:07:18.011
if hospital resources are limited,

00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:20.061
for example if only one donor heart

00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:22.359
becomes available for transplant,

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.461
or if a surgeon has time to operate

00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:26.972
on only a certain number of patients,

00:07:26.972 --> 00:07:29.922
American hospitals have an explicit policy

00:07:29.922 --> 00:07:32.242
of giving preference to younger patients

00:07:32.242 --> 00:07:33.722
over older patients

00:07:33.722 --> 00:07:36.966
on the grounds that younger patients are considered

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:38.783
more valuable to society

00:07:38.783 --> 00:07:41.428
because they have more years of life ahead of them,

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:44.088
even though the younger patients have fewer years

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:48.070
of valuable life experience behind them.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.298
There are several reasons for this low status

00:07:50.298 --> 00:07:52.640
of the elderly in the U.S.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.825
One is our Protestant work ethic

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:58.138
which places high value on work,

00:07:58.138 --> 00:08:00.361
so older people who are no longer working

00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:02.344
aren't respected.

00:08:02.344 --> 00:08:05.201
Another reason is our American emphasis

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.584
on the virtues of self-reliance and independence,

00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:11.653
so we instinctively look down on older people

00:08:11.653 --> 00:08:15.250
who are no longer self-reliant and independent.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.351
Still a third reason is our American cult of youth,

00:08:19.351 --> 00:08:22.159
which shows up even in our advertisements.

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:25.423
Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict

00:08:25.423 --> 00:08:26.978
smiling young people,

00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:28.948
even though old as well as young people

00:08:28.948 --> 00:08:31.270
buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.273
Just think, what's the last time you saw

00:08:33.273 --> 00:08:35.950
a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.899
85 years old? Never.

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:40.705
Instead, the only American ads

00:08:40.705 --> 00:08:42.711
featuring white-haired old people

00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:46.576
are ads for retirement homes and pension planning.

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:48.626
Well, what has changed in the status

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:50.609
of the elderly today

00:08:50.609 --> 00:08:53.998
compared to their status in traditional societies?

00:08:53.998 --> 00:08:55.868
There have been a few changes for the better

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.073
and more changes for the worse.

00:08:58.073 --> 00:08:59.674
Big changes for the better

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:01.825
include the fact that today we enjoy

00:09:01.825 --> 00:09:03.809
much longer lives,

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:06.103
much better health in our old age,

00:09:06.103 --> 00:09:09.741
and much better recreational opportunities.

00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:12.011
Another change for the better is that we now have

00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:14.851
specialized retirement facilities

00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:18.202
and programs to take care of old people.

00:09:18.202 --> 00:09:21.070
Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.759
that we now have

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:25.333
more old people and fewer young people

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:28.017
than at any time in the past.

00:09:28.017 --> 00:09:29.768
That means that all those old people

00:09:29.768 --> 00:09:32.193
are more of a burden on the few young people,

00:09:32.193 --> 00:09:36.679
and that each old person has less individual value.

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:39.863
Another big change for the worse
in the status of the elderly

00:09:39.863 --> 00:09:42.540
is the breaking of social ties with age,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.384
because older people, their children,

00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:45.700
and their friends,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.550
all move and scatter independently of each other

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.804
many times during their lives.

00:09:50.804 --> 00:09:52.617
We Americans move on the average

00:09:52.617 --> 00:09:54.570
every five years.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.601
Hence our older people are likely

00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:58.908
to end up living distant from their children

00:09:58.908 --> 00:10:01.711
and the friends of their youth.

00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:04.873
Yet another change for the worse
in the status of the elderly

00:10:04.873 --> 00:10:08.603
is formal retirement from the workforce,

00:10:08.603 --> 00:10:11.353
carrying with it a loss of work friendships

00:10:11.353 --> 00:10:15.493
and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.

00:10:15.493 --> 00:10:17.978
Perhaps the biggest change for the worse

00:10:17.978 --> 00:10:20.851
is that our elderly are objectively

00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:24.013
less useful than in traditional societies.

00:10:24.013 --> 00:10:26.976
Widespread literacy means that they are no longer

00:10:26.976 --> 00:10:29.607
useful as repositories of knowledge.

00:10:29.607 --> 00:10:31.550
When we want some information,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.811
we look it up in a book or we Google it

00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:37.281
instead of finding some old person to ask.

00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:39.368
The slow pace of technological change

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:41.190
in traditional societies

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.040
means that what someone learns there as a child

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.699
is still useful when that person is old,

00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:50.302
but the rapid pace of technological change today

00:10:50.302 --> 00:10:52.369
means that what we learn as children

00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:55.259
is no longer useful 60 years later.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.638
And conversely, we older people are not fluent

00:10:57.638 --> 00:11:00.672
in the technologies essential for surviving

00:11:00.672 --> 00:11:02.643
in modern society.

00:11:02.643 --> 00:11:04.816
For example, as a 15-year-old,

00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:08.406
I was considered outstandingly
good at multiplying numbers

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:11.601
because I had memorized the multiplication tables

00:11:11.601 --> 00:11:13.746
and I know how to use logarithms

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:16.609
and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:19.695
Today, though, those skills are utterly useless

00:11:19.695 --> 00:11:22.066
because any idiot

00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:24.424
can now multiply eight-digit numbers

00:11:24.424 --> 00:11:27.611
accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.

00:11:27.611 --> 00:11:29.781
Conversely, I at age 75

00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:32.445
am incompetent at skills

00:11:32.445 --> 00:11:34.899
essential for everyday life.

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:37.683
My family's first TV set in 1948

00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:40.736
had only three knobs that I quickly mastered:

00:11:40.736 --> 00:11:43.486
an on-off switch, a volume knob,

00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.707
and a channel selector knob.

00:11:45.707 --> 00:11:47.795
Today, just to watch a program

00:11:47.795 --> 00:11:50.251
on the TV set in my own house,

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:53.968
I have to operate a 41-button TV remote

00:11:53.968 --> 00:11:55.950
that utterly defeats me.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.964
I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons

00:11:58.964 --> 00:12:01.161
and ask them to talk me through it

00:12:01.161 --> 00:12:06.158
while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:08.805
What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly

00:12:08.805 --> 00:12:12.259
in the U.S., and to make better use of their value?

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:14.033
That's a huge problem.

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.504
In my remaining four minutes today,

00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:19.081
I can offer just a few suggestions.

00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:21.003
One value of older people is that they are

00:12:21.003 --> 00:12:24.447
increasingly useful as grandparents

00:12:24.447 --> 00:12:26.954
for offering high-quality childcare

00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:29.607
to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,

00:12:29.607 --> 00:12:32.456
as more young women enter the workforce

00:12:32.456 --> 00:12:34.790
and as fewer young parents of either gender

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.450
stay home as full-time caretakers of their children.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.486
Compared to the usual alternatives

00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:44.084
of paid babysitters and day care centers,

00:12:44.084 --> 00:12:47.211
grandparents offer superior, motivated,

00:12:47.211 --> 00:12:49.899
experienced child care.

00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:53.165
They've already gained experience
from raising their own children.

00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:55.509
They usually love their grandchildren,

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:58.174
and are eager to spend time with them.

00:12:58.174 --> 00:13:00.075
Unlike other caregivers,

00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:02.972
grandparents don't quit their job

00:13:02.972 --> 00:13:05.408
because they found another job with higher pay

00:13:05.408 --> 00:13:08.921
looking after another baby.

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.325
A second value of older people is paradoxically

00:13:11.325 --> 00:13:13.986
related to their loss of value

00:13:13.986 --> 00:13:18.059
as a result of changing world
conditions and technology.

00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:20.095
At the same time, older people have gained

00:13:20.095 --> 00:13:22.406
in value today precisely because

00:13:22.406 --> 00:13:25.515
of their unique experience of living conditions

00:13:25.515 --> 00:13:27.234
that have now become rare

00:13:27.234 --> 00:13:30.544
because of rapid change, but that could come back.

00:13:30.544 --> 00:13:33.498
For example, only Americans now in their 70s

00:13:33.498 --> 00:13:35.758
or older today can remember

00:13:35.758 --> 00:13:39.086
the experience of living through a great depression,

00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:41.724
the experience of living through a world war,

00:13:41.724 --> 00:13:44.270
and agonizing whether or not

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.307
dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible

00:13:47.307 --> 00:13:51.420
than the likely consequences
of not dropping atomic bombs.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.696
Most of our current voters and politicians

00:13:53.696 --> 00:13:56.428
have no personal experience of any of those things,

00:13:56.428 --> 00:13:59.123
but millions of older Americans do.

00:13:59.123 --> 00:14:01.774
Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.161
could come back.

00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:04.467
Even if they don't come back,

00:14:04.467 --> 00:14:06.659
we have to be able to plan for them

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:09.470
on the basis of the experience of what they were like.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.304
Older people have that experience.

00:14:11.304 --> 00:14:13.357
Younger people don't.

00:14:13.357 --> 00:14:14.877
The remaining value of older people

00:14:14.877 --> 00:14:17.320
that I'll mention involves recognizing that

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.900
while there are many things that older people

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.506
can no longer do,

00:14:21.506 --> 00:14:22.995
there are other things that they can do

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.090
better than younger people.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.986
A challenge for society is 
to make use of those things

00:14:27.986 --> 00:14:30.458
that older people are better at doing.

00:14:30.458 --> 00:14:33.707
Some abilities, of course, decrease with age.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.345
Those include abilities at tasks

00:14:36.345 --> 00:14:39.916
requiring physical strength and stamina,

00:14:39.916 --> 00:14:43.040
ambition, and the power of novel reasoning

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.465
in a circumscribed situation,

00:14:45.465 --> 00:14:48.053
such as figuring out the structure of DNA,

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:51.954
best left to scientists under the age of 30.

00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:53.603
Conversely, valuable attributes

00:14:53.603 --> 00:14:57.149
that increase with age include experience,

00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:00.162
understanding of people and human relationships,

00:15:00.162 --> 00:15:02.453
ability to help other people

00:15:02.453 --> 00:15:04.881
without your own ego getting in the way,

00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:08.406
and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,

00:15:08.406 --> 00:15:11.231
such as economics and comparative history,

00:15:11.231 --> 00:15:14.445
best left to scholars over the age of 60.

00:15:14.445 --> 00:15:16.917
Hence older people are
much better than younger people

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:20.888
at supervising, administering, advising,

00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:24.370
strategizing, teaching, synthesizing,

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.076
and devising long-term plans.

00:15:27.076 --> 00:15:29.096
I've seen this value of older people

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:31.668
with so many of my friends in their 60s,

00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:33.658
70s, 80s and 90s,

00:15:33.658 --> 00:15:36.943
who are still active as investment managers,

00:15:36.943 --> 00:15:39.956
farmers, lawyers and doctors.

00:15:39.956 --> 00:15:42.086
In short, many traditional societies

00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:44.199
make better use of their elderly

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:47.309
and give their elderly more satisfying lives

00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:50.159
than we do in modern, big societies.

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:52.024
Paradoxically nowadays,

00:15:52.024 --> 00:15:54.950
when we have more elderly people than ever before,

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.671
living healthier lives and with better medical care

00:15:57.671 --> 00:15:59.157
than ever before,

00:15:59.157 --> 00:16:01.864
old age is in some respects more miserable

00:16:01.864 --> 00:16:03.631
than ever before.

00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:06.053
The lives of the elderly are widely recognized

00:16:06.053 --> 00:16:08.820
as constituting a disaster area

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.353
of modern American society.

00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:13.034
We can surely do better by learning

00:16:13.034 --> 00:16:14.909
from the lives of the elderly

00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:16.921
in traditional societies.

00:16:16.921 --> 00:16:18.863
But what's true of the lives of the elderly

00:16:18.863 --> 00:16:20.327
in traditional societies

00:16:20.327 --> 00:16:22.022
is true of many other features

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:24.616
of traditional societies as well.

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:27.205
Of course, I'm not advocating that we all give up

00:16:27.205 --> 00:16:29.320
agriculture and metal tools

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.404
and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

00:16:32.404 --> 00:16:33.948
There are many obvious respects

00:16:33.948 --> 00:16:36.427
in which our lives today are far happier

00:16:36.427 --> 00:16:39.489
than those in small, traditional societies.

00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:41.195
To mention just a few examples,

00:16:41.195 --> 00:16:44.165
our lives are longer, materially much richer,

00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:46.448
and less plagued by violence

00:16:46.448 --> 00:16:49.676
than are the lives of people in traditional societies.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.204
But there are also things to be admired

00:16:52.204 --> 00:16:54.346
about people in traditional societies,

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.665
and perhaps to be learned from them.

00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:59.256
Their lives are usually socially much richer

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:00.848
than our lives,

00:17:00.848 --> 00:17:03.140
although materially poorer.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.092
Their children are more self-confident,

00:17:06.092 --> 00:17:08.686
more independent, and more socially skilled

00:17:08.686 --> 00:17:11.022
than are our children.

00:17:11.022 --> 00:17:14.765
They think more realistically
about dangers than we do.

00:17:14.765 --> 00:17:18.294
They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease,

00:17:18.294 --> 00:17:21.528
stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases

00:17:21.528 --> 00:17:24.040
that will be the causes of death of almost

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.126
all of us in this room today.

00:17:27.126 --> 00:17:31.136
Features of the modern lifestyle
predispose us to those diseases,

00:17:31.136 --> 00:17:33.370
and features of the traditional lifestyle

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.877
protect us against them.

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:38.036
Those are just some examples of what we can learn

00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:40.324
from traditional societies.

00:17:40.324 --> 00:17:42.211
I hope that you will find it as fascinating

00:17:42.211 --> 00:17:44.620
to read about traditional societies

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.323
as I found it to live in those societies.

00:17:47.323 --> 00:17:49.503
Thank you.

00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:53.950
(Applause)
