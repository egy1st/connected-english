00:00:00.231 --> 00:00:02.611
So yesterday, I was out in the street

00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:05.287
in front of this building,

00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:08.323
and I was walking down the sidewalk,

00:00:08.323 --> 00:00:10.183
and I had company, several of us,

00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:11.681
and we were all abiding by the rules

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:14.068
of walking down sidewalks.

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:16.510
We're not talking each other. We're facing forward.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.933
We're moving.

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:21.196
When the person in front of me slows down.

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:23.186
And so I'm watching him, and he slows down,

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:24.783
and finally he stops.

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:26.868
Well, that wasn't fast enough for me,

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:30.547
so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him,

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:33.280
and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.843
and he was doing this.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.792
He was texting,

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:39.814
and he couldn't text and walk at the same time.

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:41.623
Now we could approach this

00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:43.515
from a working memory perspective

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:45.500
or from a multitasking perspective.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.029
We're going to do working memory today.

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:50.169
Now, working memory

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:53.317
is that part of our consciousness that we are

00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:55.771
aware of at any given time of day.

00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:57.413
You're going it right now.

00:00:57.413 --> 00:00:59.067
It's not something we can turn off.

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:02.518
If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:05.621
So right now, you're doing just fine.

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:07.977
Now working memory has four basic components.

00:01:07.977 --> 00:01:10.574
It allows us to store some immediate experiences

00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:12.190
and a little bit of knowledge.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.559
It allows us to reach back
into our long-term memory

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:17.409
and pull some of that in as we need it,

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.609
mixes it, processes it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.903
in light of whatever our current goal is.

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:23.417
Now the current goal isn't something like,

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.699
I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:28.502
It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie,

00:01:28.502 --> 00:01:31.104
or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:33.284
Now working memory capacity

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:35.890
is our ability to leverage that,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.685
our ability to take what we know

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:39.961
and what we can hang onto

00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:43.560
and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.310
our current goal.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.094
Now working memory capacity

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:49.147
has a fairly long history,

00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:51.346
and it's associated with a lot of positive effects.

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:53.734
People with high working memory capacity

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:55.978
tend to be good storytellers.

00:01:55.978 --> 00:01:59.955
They tend to solve and do well
on standardized tests,

00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:02.300
however important that is.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.083
They're able to have high levels of writing ability.

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:08.957
They're also able to reason at high levels.

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:11.875
So what we're going to do here
is play a little bit with some of that.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:14.425
So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks,

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:17.504
and we're going to take your 
working memory out for a ride.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.101
You up for that? Okay.

00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:22.299
I'm going to give you five words,

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.092
and I just want you to hang on to them.

00:02:24.092 --> 00:02:25.960
Don't write them down. Just hang on to them.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.372
Five words.

00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:30.575
While you're hanging on to them,
I'm going to ask you to answer three questions.

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:32.480
I want to see what happens with those words.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.327
So here's the words:

00:02:34.327 --> 00:02:37.615
tree,

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.550
highway,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.928
mirror,

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:45.060
Saturn

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.479
and electrode.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.063
So far so good?

00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:50.917
Okay. What I want you to do

00:02:50.917 --> 00:02:54.264
is I want you to tell me what the answer is

00:02:54.264 --> 00:02:56.586
to 23 times eight.

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:59.300
Just shout it out.

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:04.468
(Mumbling) (Laughter)

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:06.889
In fact it's -- (Mumbling) -- exactly. (Laughter)

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.116
All right. I want you to take out your left hand

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:12.796
and I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five,

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:14.999
six, seven, eight, nine, 10."

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.695
It's a neurological test,
just in case you were wondering.

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:19.560
All right, now what I want you to do

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.785
is to recite the last five letters

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:24.654
of the English alphabet backwards.

00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:28.539
You should have started with Z.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.830
(Laughter)

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.917
All right. How many people here are still pretty sure

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:36.368
you've got all five words?

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:39.549
Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half,

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.624
right, which is normal. There will be a range.

00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:43.180
Some people can hang on to five.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.464
Some people can hang on to 10.

00:03:44.464 --> 00:03:46.769
Some will be down to two or three.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.173
What we know is this is really important
to the way we function, right?

00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:52.121
And it's going to be really important here at TED

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.157
because you're going to be exposed
to so many different ideas.

00:03:55.157 --> 00:03:57.364
Now the problem that we have

00:03:57.364 --> 00:03:59.076
is that life comes at us,

00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:01.193
and it comes at us very quickly,

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:05.106
and what we need to do is to take that amorphous

00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:06.884
flow of experience and somehow

00:04:06.884 --> 00:04:08.391
extract meaning from it

00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:09.690
with a working memory

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.959
that's about the size of a pea.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.506
Now don't get me wrong,
working memory is awesome.

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:16.621
Working memory allows us

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:18.993
to investigate our current experience

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:20.488
as we move forward.

00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:23.656
It allows us to make sense of the world around us.

00:04:23.656 --> 00:04:25.575
But it does have certain limits.

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:29.418
Now working memory is great
for allowing us to communicate.

00:04:29.418 --> 00:04:30.890
We can have a conversation,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.577
and I can build a narrative around that

00:04:33.577 --> 00:04:35.307
so I know where we've been and where we're going

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:37.395
and how to contribute to this conversation.

00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:39.632
It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.

00:04:39.632 --> 00:04:41.436
We can be in the middle of a meeting,

00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:43.939
listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.581
decide whether or not we like it,

00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:46.839
ask follow-up questions.

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.209
All of that occurs within working memory.

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:52.056
It also allows us to go to the store

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:55.710
and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.481
when what we're really looking for

00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:00.318
is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter)

00:05:00.318 --> 00:05:03.040
Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.377
Now, a central issue with working memory

00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:07.774
is that it's limited.

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:09.970
It's limited in capacity, limited in duration,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.580
limited in focus.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.315
We tend to remember about four things.

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:16.212
Okay? It used to be seven,

00:05:16.212 --> 00:05:18.236
but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four,

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:20.779
and we were overachieving.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.752
Now we can remember those four things

00:05:22.752 --> 00:05:24.615
for about 10 to 20 seconds

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.342
unless we do something with it,

00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:28.855
unless we process it,
unless we apply it to something,

00:05:28.855 --> 00:05:32.500
unless we talk to somebody about it.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.742
When we think about working memory,

00:05:35.742 --> 00:05:39.046
we have to realize that this limited capacity

00:05:39.046 --> 00:05:41.541
has lots of different impacts on us.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:44.566
Have you ever walked from one room to another

00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:47.577
and then forgotten why you're there?

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:49.746
You do know the solution to that, right?

00:05:49.746 --> 00:05:52.092
You go back to that original room. (Laughter)

00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:56.029
Have you ever forgotten your keys?

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:58.558
You ever forgotten your car?

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:01.529
You ever forgotten your kids?

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.718
Have you ever been involved in a conversation,

00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:05.662
and you realize that the conversation to your left

00:06:05.662 --> 00:06:08.496
is actually more interesting? (Laughter)

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:10.120
So you're nodding and you're smiling,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.508
but you're really paying attention
to this one over here,

00:06:12.508 --> 00:06:14.808
until you hear that last word go up,

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:16.468
and you realize,

00:06:16.468 --> 00:06:19.422
you've been asked a question. (Laughter)

00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:21.369
And you're really hoping the answer is no,

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.588
because that's what you're about to say.

00:06:24.588 --> 00:06:27.064
All of that talks about working memory,

00:06:27.064 --> 00:06:29.322
what we can do and what we can't do.

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:30.859
We need to realize that working memory

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:32.258
has a limited capacity,

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:35.777
and that working memory capacity itself
is how we negotiate that.

00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:37.948
We negotiate that through strategies.

00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:40.269
So what I want to do is talk a little bit
about a couple of strategies here,

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:41.544
and these will be really important

00:06:41.544 --> 00:06:45.299
because you are now in an
information target-rich environment

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:47.419
for the next several days.

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.323
Now the first part of this that we need to think about

00:06:50.323 --> 00:06:53.090
and we need to process our existence, our life,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.805
immediately and repeatedly.

00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:57.246
We need to process what's going on

00:06:57.246 --> 00:07:00.160
the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.429
not a week later, at the moment.

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:06.162
So we need to think about, well,
do I agree with him?

00:07:06.162 --> 00:07:08.942
What's missing? What would I like to know?

00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:11.164
Do I agree with the assumptions?

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.974
How can I apply this in my life?

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.954
It's a way of processing what's going on

00:07:14.954 --> 00:07:16.721
so that we can use it later.

00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:19.681
Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice.

00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:22.093
So we need to think about it here.

00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:24.888
In between, we want to talk to people about it.

00:07:24.888 --> 00:07:27.111
We're going to write it down,
and when you get home,

00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:29.071
pull out those notes and think about them

00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:31.460
and end up practicing over time.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.011
Practice for some reason
became a very negative thing.

00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:35.463
It's very positive.

00:07:35.463 --> 00:07:38.513
The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively

00:07:38.513 --> 00:07:40.853
and we need to think illustratively.

00:07:40.853 --> 00:07:44.307
Oftentimes, we think that we have to relate
new knowledge to prior knowledge.

00:07:44.307 --> 00:07:46.237
What we want to do is spin that around.

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:47.994
We want to take all of our existence

00:07:47.994 --> 00:07:49.747
and wrap it around that new knowledge

00:07:49.747 --> 00:07:53.195
and make all of these connections
and it becomes more meaningful.

00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:56.989
We also want to use imagery.
We are built for images.

00:07:56.989 --> 00:07:58.847
We need to take advantage of that.

00:07:58.847 --> 00:08:00.357
Think about things in images,

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:02.706
write things down that way.

00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:04.268
If you read a book, pull things up.

00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:06.321
I just got through reading "The Great Gatsby,"

00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:09.420
and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.418
in my head, so my own version.

00:08:12.418 --> 00:08:14.421
The last one is organization and support.

00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:16.990
We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.131
We try to make meaning out of
everything that happens to us.

00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:22.421
Organization helps, so we need to structure

00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:24.000
what we're doing in ways that make sense.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.586
If we are providing knowledge and experience,

00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:28.071
we need to structure that.

00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:30.570
And the last one is support.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.292
We all started as novices.

00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:35.333
Everything we do is an
approximation of sophistication.

00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:38.270
We should expect it to change over time.
We have to support that.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.926
The support may come in asking people questions,

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:44.424
giving them a sheet of paper that has
an organizational chart on it

00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:46.977
or has some guiding images,

00:08:46.977 --> 00:08:48.877
but we need to support it.

00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:54.168
Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message

00:08:54.168 --> 00:08:57.094
from a working memory capacity standpoint is this:

00:08:57.094 --> 00:09:00.025
what we process, we learn.

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:04.826
If we're not processing life, we're not living it.

00:09:04.826 --> 00:09:06.718
Live life. Thank you.

00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:10.903
