00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Applause)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's really quite an honor to be here tonight,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because I've really been inspired.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that are, literally, world premieres.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I've been working on my new record

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I've never played these songs for anybody

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
except the microphone.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is a song that I wrote

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
about the meaning of technology,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which goes perfectly with this gathering.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I started thinking about -- when I was in college,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
especially as a blind person,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
doing a research paper was a major undertaking.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You had to go to the library,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
see if you could get them to find the books for you,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you know, footnotes and all that.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I wish I had that when I was in college.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Anyway, this is a song about:

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's called "All the Answers."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
♫ What is the weather in Cincinnati? ♫

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
♫ What is the time in Tokyo? ♫

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ Who is this little child's daddy? ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
♫ And who the hell needs to know? ♫

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
♫ Why do memories of you linger ♫

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
♫ when I'm trying to reach my goal? ♫

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
♫ And why must I move my fingers ♫

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
♫ to the music in my soul? ♫

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
♫ I don't know. ♫

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
♫ I don't have to know. ♫

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
♫ 'Cause here I go ... ♫

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000

♫ And I got all the answers ♫

♫ and I don't have to understand ♫

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
♫ Think I'll rummage through the century ♫

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
♫ while I listen to the sea. ♫

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ Oh, it's good to be so free, ♫

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
♫ so free. ♫

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
♫ Who was mayor of Chicago ♫

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
♫ back in 1964? ♫

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
♫ And why did Shakespeare create Iago ♫

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
♫ to tear apart a love so pure? ♫

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
♫ How can my dreams be so vivid ♫

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ in a psychosonic way? ♫

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
♫ Why must I become so livid ♫

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
♫ about the news I hear today? ♫

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
♫ I don't know. ♫

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
♫ I don't have to know. ♫

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
♫ And here I go ... ♫

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
♫ 'cause I got all the answers ♫

♫ the tabloid news ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
♫ Mm, it's good to be so free. ♫

00:03:37.000 --> 00:04:08.000

♫ I never ever have to be alone. ♫

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000

♫ Yeah, mm-hmm ... ♫

♫ Everything that's ever been known, ♫

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
♫ I can punch it up right here on my phone. ♫

♫ Freedom train, coming soon ♫

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000

♫ 'Cause I got all the answers ♫

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000

♫ And I got all the answers, yeah. ♫

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
♫ I got every book and magazine. ♫

♫ Uh-huh ... ♫

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
♫ I'm going to find the capitol of Peru ♫

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
♫ or the latitude of Kathmandu. ♫

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
♫ I'm gonna Google it ♫

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
♫ 'cause everybody's doing it. ♫

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
♫ And then I'll rummage through the century. ♫

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
♫ I got all the answers. ♫

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
♫ Yeah, yeah ♫

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000
♫ I got all the answers. ♫

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:51.000
(Applause)

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Thank you.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
That's the first time I've ever played it.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
(Applause)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's a "feel the fear and do it anyway" kind of thing.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This next song is a song

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It was one of the titles

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that I was sort of thinking about calling my record,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
except there's a couple of problems.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
One thing is, it's unpronounceable.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And it's a made-up word.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It's called "Tembererana."

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And the song is based on

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
what I think was my first

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
childhood attempts

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to think about invisible forces.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So "tembererana" was these dreams,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
in which I would be running away

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So this is called "Tembererana."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It's based on an Argentinian rhythm

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
called "carnivalito."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
♫ A dream within a dream, ♫

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
♫ a world within a world, ♫

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
♫ travels out across the land. ♫

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
♫ Images flickering, ♫

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
♫ a procession of limousines ♫

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
♫ travels slowly across the land. ♫

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
♫ Another child could use a hand. ♫

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
♫ Reaching out from within ♫

00:07:43.000 --> 00:08:02.000
♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
♫ Annihilation moves. ♫

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
♫ The earth is an open tomb. ♫

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
♫ The sound of the final boom ♫

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
♫ rumbles fiercely across the land. ♫

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
♫ Fear, you're the enemy. ♫

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
♫ Obliterating all but thee. ♫

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
♫ You see what you want to see. ♫

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
♫ Before I'm blinded, I will toast ♫

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
♫ the shade of power that I love most, ♫

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
♫ the power of creation. ♫

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:56.000
♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
♫ Da, da, da, da ♫

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
♫ As a child, alone and afraid, ♫

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
♫ escaping the impressions every feeling made, ♫

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
♫ I would run, run away ♫

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
♫ into a world where the good was the aim of the game ♫

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
♫ had a name. ♫

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
♫ It's the same name. ♫

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:55.000
♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana ♫

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana, hey ♫

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
♫ Tembererana, hey ♫

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
♫ Tembererana ... ♫

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
(Applause)
