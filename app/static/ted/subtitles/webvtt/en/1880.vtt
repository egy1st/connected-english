00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:04.231
There is something you know about me,

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:08.071
something very personal,

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:12.526
and there is something
I know about every one of you

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.498
and that's very central to your concerns.

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:19.244
There is something that we know

00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:25.302
about everyone we meet
anywhere in the world, on the street,

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:30.280
that is the very mainspring
of whatever they do

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:32.519
and whatever they put up with.

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:39.302
And that is that all of us
want to be happy.

00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:42.679
In this, we are all together.

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:48.677
How we imagine our happiness,
that differs from one another,

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:53.505
but it's already a lot
that we have all in common,

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:55.743
that we want to be happy.

00:00:57.164 --> 00:01:00.116
Now my topic is gratefulness.

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:06.002
What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.304
Many people would say,
well, that's very easy.

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:12.846
When you are happy, you are grateful.

00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:15.841
But think again.

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:21.908
Is it really the happy people
that are grateful?

00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:26.618
We all know quite a number of people

00:01:26.642 --> 00:01:30.819
who have everything
that it would take to be happy,

00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:32.600
and they are not happy,

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:36.339
because they want something else
or they want more of the same.

00:01:38.173 --> 00:01:44.997
And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune,

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:48.798
misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have,

00:01:48.822 --> 00:01:51.020
and they are deeply happy.

00:01:51.574 --> 00:01:54.993
They radiate happiness. You are surprised.

00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:57.216
Why? Because they are grateful.

00:01:58.348 --> 00:02:02.383
So it is not happiness
that makes us grateful.

00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:04.922
It's gratefulness that makes us happy.

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:08.752
If you think it's happiness
that makes you grateful,

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:10.261
think again.

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:12.539
It's gratefulness that makes you happy.

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.781
Now, we can ask,

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:20.266
what do we really mean by gratefulness?

00:02:20.897 --> 00:02:22.815
And how does it work?

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:27.951
I appeal to your own experience.

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:30.708
We all know from experience how it goes.

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:36.053
We experience something
that's valuable to us.

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:41.033
Something is given to us
that's valuable to us.

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:43.847
And it's really given.

00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:46.090
These two things have to come together.

00:02:46.114 --> 00:02:51.703
It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift.

00:02:51.727 --> 00:02:54.870
You haven't bought it.
You haven't earned it.

00:02:54.894 --> 00:02:57.345
You haven't traded it in.
You haven't worked for it.

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:58.797
It's just given to you.

00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:01.064
And when these two things come together,

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:06.713
something that's really valuable to me
and I realize it's freely given,

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:11.650
then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart,

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:15.318
happiness spontaneously rises in my heart.

00:03:16.037 --> 00:03:18.202
That's how gratefulness happens.

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:24.941
Now the key to all this

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:31.682
is that we cannot only
experience this once in a while.

00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:36.731
We cannot only have grateful experiences.

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:39.990
We can be people who live gratefully.

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.260
Grateful living, that is the thing.

00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:46.589
And how can we live gratefully?

00:03:48.136 --> 00:03:52.496
By experiencing, by becoming aware

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.269
that every moment
is a given moment, as we say.

00:03:57.293 --> 00:03:59.874
It's a gift. You haven't earned it.

00:03:59.898 --> 00:04:02.486
You haven't brought it about in any way.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.893
You have no way of assuring

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:08.893
that there will be
another moment given to you,

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:13.982
and yet, that's the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us,

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:19.494
this moment, with all the opportunity
that it contains.

00:04:19.518 --> 00:04:22.158
If we didn't have this present moment,

00:04:22.182 --> 00:04:25.358
we wouldn't have
any opportunity to do anything

00:04:25.382 --> 00:04:27.206
or experience anything,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.218
and this moment is a gift.

00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:31.154
It's a given moment, as we say.

00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:38.328
Now, we say the gift within this gift
is really the opportunity.

00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:42.894
What you are really grateful for
is the opportunity,

00:04:42.918 --> 00:04:44.852
not the thing that is given to you,

00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:46.831
because if that thing were somewhere else

00:04:46.855 --> 00:04:50.361
and you didn't have
the opportunity to enjoy it,

00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:52.196
to do something with it,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.163
you wouldn't be grateful for it.

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.145
Opportunity is the gift within every gift,

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.842
and we have this saying,
opportunity knocks only once.

00:05:05.943 --> 00:05:07.522
Well, think again.

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:12.866
Every moment is a new gift,
over and over again,

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.134
and if you miss the opportunity
of this moment,

00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:19.740
another moment is given to us,
and another moment.

00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:22.865
We can avail ourselves
of this opportunity,

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.736
or we can miss it,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.670
and if we avail ourselves
of the opportunity,

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:31.487
it is the key to happiness.

00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:34.752
Behold the master key to our happiness

00:05:34.776 --> 00:05:36.555
in our own hands.

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:41.276
Moment by moment,
we can be grateful for this gift.

00:05:41.593 --> 00:05:44.092
Does that mean

00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:46.827
that we can be grateful for everything?

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:49.216
Certainly not.

00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:54.513
We cannot be grateful
for violence, for war,

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:57.004
for oppression, for exploitation.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.099
On the personal level,
we cannot be grateful

00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:03.400
for the loss of a friend,
for unfaithfulness,

00:06:03.424 --> 00:06:05.146
for bereavement.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:10.503
But I didn't say
we can be grateful for everything.

00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:15.009
I said we can be grateful
in every given moment

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:16.863
for the opportunity,

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:23.282
and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult,

00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:25.822
we can rise to this occasion

00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:30.077
and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us.

00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:32.452
It isn't as bad as it might seem.

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:36.345
Actually, when you look at it
and experience it,

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.301
you find that most of the time,

00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:43.034
what is given to us
is the opportunity to enjoy,

00:06:43.058 --> 00:06:46.075
and we only miss it
because we are rushing through life

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.502
and we are not stopping
to see the opportunity.

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.326
But once in a while,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.272
something very difficult is given to us,

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:58.363
and when this difficult thing
occurs to us,

00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:02.691
it's a challenge to rise
to that opportunity,

00:07:02.715 --> 00:07:06.111
and we can rise to it
by learning something

00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:07.852
which is sometimes painful.

00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:09.939
Learning patience, for instance.

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:12.936
We have been told that the road to peace

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.704
is not a sprint,
but is more like a marathon.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:19.265
That takes patience. That's difficult.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:26.530
It may be to stand up for your opinion,
to stand up for your conviction.

00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:29.863
That's an opportunity that is given to us.

00:07:30.314 --> 00:07:33.739
To learn, to suffer, to stand up,

00:07:33.763 --> 00:07:36.109
all these opportunities are given to us,

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:37.615
but they are opportunities,

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:41.491
and those who avail themselves
of those opportunities

00:07:41.515 --> 00:07:43.618
are the ones that we admire.

00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:45.890
They make something out of life.

00:07:45.914 --> 00:07:50.642
And those who fail
get another opportunity.

00:07:51.023 --> 00:07:53.216
We always get another opportunity.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.297
That's the wonderful richness of life.

00:07:58.272 --> 00:08:04.797
So how can we find a method
that will harness this?

00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:09.827
How can each one of us find a method
for living gratefully,

00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:11.756
not just once in a while being grateful,

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.188
but moment by moment to be grateful.

00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:17.943
How can we do it?
It's a very simple method.

00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:23.030
It's so simple that it's actually
what we were told as children

00:08:23.054 --> 00:08:25.359
when we learned to cross the street.

00:08:25.882 --> 00:08:27.121
Stop.

00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:28.622
Look.

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:29.847
Go.

00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:31.246
That's all.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.643
But how often do we stop?

00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:36.727
We rush through life. We don't stop.

00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:40.149
We miss the opportunity
because we don't stop.

00:08:41.012 --> 00:08:43.340
We have to stop.

00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:45.716
We have to get quiet.

00:08:46.128 --> 00:08:50.930
And we have to build
stop signs into our lives.

00:08:51.628 --> 00:08:56.596
When I was in Africa
some years ago and then came back,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.724
I noticed water.

00:08:59.114 --> 00:09:03.269
In Africa where I was,
I didn't have drinkable water.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:07.249
Every time I turned on the faucet,
I was overwhelmed.

00:09:08.067 --> 00:09:11.652
Every time I clicked on the light,
I was so grateful.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.217
It made me so happy.

00:09:13.241 --> 00:09:15.224
But after a while, this wears off.

00:09:15.248 --> 00:09:19.010
So I put little stickers
on the light switch

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:20.711
and on the water faucet,

00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:23.191
and every time I turned it on, water.

00:09:23.817 --> 00:09:26.673
So leave it up to your own imagination.

00:09:26.697 --> 00:09:28.650
You can find whatever works best for you,

00:09:28.674 --> 00:09:31.936
but you need stop signs in your life.

00:09:32.278 --> 00:09:34.205
And when you stop,

00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:36.309
then the next thing is to look.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.961
You look. You open your eyes.

00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:41.247
You open your ears. You open your nose.

00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:43.667
You open all your senses

00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:46.922
for this wonderful richness
that is given to us.

00:09:47.326 --> 00:09:51.278
There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about,

00:09:51.302 --> 00:09:54.908
to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.

00:09:54.932 --> 00:09:57.751
And then we can also open our hearts,

00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:00.597
our hearts for the opportunities,

00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:03.839
for the opportunities also to help others,

00:10:03.863 --> 00:10:05.134
to make others happy,

00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:09.266
because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy.

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:14.877
And when we open
our hearts to the opportunities,

00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:18.517
the opportunities invite us
to do something,

00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:19.864
and that is the third.

00:10:19.888 --> 00:10:23.978
Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something.

00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:25.931
And what we can do

00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:30.617
is whatever life offers to you
in that present moment.

00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:35.684
Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,

00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:39.084
but sometimes
it's something more difficult.

00:10:39.108 --> 00:10:43.376
But whatever it is,
if we take this opportunity,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.847
we go with it, we are creative,
those are the creative people.

00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:52.720
And that little stop, look, go,

00:10:52.744 --> 00:10:54.974
is such a potent seed

00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:58.069
that it can revolutionize our world.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.796
Because we are at the present moment

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.132
in the middle of a change
of consciousness,

00:11:07.156 --> 00:11:09.697
and you will be surprised if you --

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:12.664
I am always surprised
when I hear how many times

00:11:12.688 --> 00:11:15.592
this word "gratefulness"
and "gratitude" comes up.

00:11:15.952 --> 00:11:17.266
Everywhere you find it,

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.545
a grateful airline,
a restaurant gratefulness,

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:23.754
a café gratefulness,
a wine that is gratefulness.

00:11:23.778 --> 00:11:27.029
Yes, I have even come across
a toilet paper

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:29.396
whose brand is called "Thank You."

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.016
(Laughter)

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.982
There is a wave of gratefulness

00:11:33.006 --> 00:11:36.788
because people are becoming aware
how important this is

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:39.408
and how this can change our world.

00:11:39.884 --> 00:11:46.500
It can change our world
in immensely important ways,

00:11:46.524 --> 00:11:50.111
because if you're grateful,
you're not fearful,

00:11:50.135 --> 00:11:53.497
and if you're not fearful,
you're not violent.

00:11:53.521 --> 00:11:57.683
If you're grateful,
you act out of a sense of enough

00:11:57.707 --> 00:11:59.777
and not of a sense of scarcity,

00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:01.826
and you are willing to share.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.118
If you are grateful,

00:12:03.142 --> 00:12:05.993
you are enjoying
the differences between people,

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.372
and you are respectful to everybody,

00:12:08.396 --> 00:12:12.105
and that changes this power pyramid
under which we live.

00:12:12.129 --> 00:12:17.133
And it doesn't make for equality,
but it makes for equal respect,

00:12:17.157 --> 00:12:19.137
and that is the important thing.

00:12:19.161 --> 00:12:22.837
The future of the world will be a network,

00:12:22.861 --> 00:12:26.487
not a pyramid turned upside down.

00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:30.999
The revolution of which I am speaking
is a nonviolent revolution,

00:12:31.023 --> 00:12:34.888
and it's so revolutionary
that it even revolutionizes

00:12:34.912 --> 00:12:37.069
the very concept of a revolution,

00:12:37.093 --> 00:12:39.330
because the normal revolution

00:12:39.354 --> 00:12:42.338
is one where the power pyramid
is turned upside down

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:45.507
and those who were on the bottom
are now on the top

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:49.657
and are doing exactly the same thing
that the ones before.

00:12:50.246 --> 00:12:54.558
What we need is a networking
of smaller groups,

00:12:54.582 --> 00:12:58.228
smaller and smaller groups
who know one another,

00:12:58.252 --> 00:13:02.799
who interact with one another,
and that is a grateful world.

00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:06.947
A grateful world
is a world of joyful people.

00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:09.618
Grateful people are joyful people,

00:13:09.642 --> 00:13:11.659
and joyful people --

00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:14.422
the more and more joyful people there are,

00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:17.720
the more and more
we'll have a joyful world.

00:13:18.758 --> 00:13:24.805
We have a network for grateful living,
and it has mushroomed.

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:27.252
We couldn't understand why it mushroomed.

00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:30.588
We have an opportunity
for people to light a candle

00:13:30.612 --> 00:13:32.773
when they are grateful for something.

00:13:33.217 --> 00:13:39.638
And there have been
15 million candles lit in one decade.

00:13:40.072 --> 00:13:46.273
People are becoming aware
that a grateful world is a happy world,

00:13:46.297 --> 00:13:52.299
and we all have the opportunity
by the simple stop, look, go,

00:13:52.323 --> 00:13:56.035
to transform the world,
to make it a happy place.

00:13:56.059 --> 00:13:57.537
And that is what I hope for us,

00:13:57.561 --> 00:14:02.435
and if this has contributed a little
to making you want to do the same,

00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:04.097
stop, look, go.

00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:05.290
Thank you.

00:14:05.314 --> 00:14:08.678
(Applause)
