00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:03.957
I'm here today to talk about social change,

00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:07.240
not a new therapy or a new intervention

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.957
or a new way of working with kids
or something like that,

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:12.902
but a new business model for social change,

00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:15.809
a new way of tackling the problem.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.983
In Britain, 63 percent of all men

00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:23.046
who come out of short sentences from prison

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:25.567
re-offend again within a year.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.185
Now how many previous offenses

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:30.568
do you think they have on average

00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:33.153
managed to commit?

00:00:33.153 --> 00:00:35.301
Forty-three.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.964
And how many previous times
do you think they've been in prison?

00:00:38.964 --> 00:00:40.151
Seven.

00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:42.965
So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:44.853
and we said to the Ministry of Justice,

00:00:44.853 --> 00:00:47.205
what's it worth to you

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:49.382
if fewer of these guys re-offend?

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.551
It's got to be worth something, right?

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.378
I mean, there's prison costs,

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:56.906
there's police costs, there's court costs,

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:59.638
all these things that you're spending money on

00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:02.151
to deal with these guys. What's it worth?

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:05.146
Now, of course, we care about the social value.

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:08.432
Social Finance, the organization I helped set up,

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:10.675
cares about social stuff.

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:13.717
But we wanted to make the economic case,

00:01:13.717 --> 00:01:15.495
because if we could make the economic case,

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:18.516
then the value of doing this 
would be completely compelling.

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:21.351
And if we can agree on both a value

00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:23.688
and a way of measuring whether we've been

00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:26.086
successful at reducing that re-offending,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.057
then we can do something

00:01:28.057 --> 00:01:30.620
we think rather interesting.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.544
The idea is called the social impact bond.

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:36.921
Now, the social impact bond is simply saying,

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:38.560
if we can get the government to agree,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.311
that we can create a contract where

00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:44.770
they only pay if it worked.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.939
So that means that they can try out new stuff

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.402
without the embarrassment

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:51.410
of having to pay if it didn't work,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.082
which for still quite a lot of bits of government,

00:01:53.082 --> 00:01:54.429
that's a serious issue.

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.024
Now, many of you may have noticed

00:01:56.024 --> 00:01:57.510
there's a problem at this point,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.724
and that is that it takes a long time to measure

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:02.490
whether those outcomes have happened.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.706
So we have to raise some money.

00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:08.153
We use the contract to raise money

00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:10.377
from socially motivated investors.

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:12.731
Socially motivated investors:

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.029
there's an interesting idea, right?

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.420
But actually, there's a lot of people who,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.653
if they're given the chance,

00:02:18.653 --> 00:02:20.535
would love to invest in something

00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:23.298
that does social good.

00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:25.271
And here's the opportunity.

00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.528
Do you want to also help government find

00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:29.964
whether there's a better economic model,

00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:32.340
not just leaving these guys to come out of prison

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.211
and waiting till they re-offend
and putting them back in again,

00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:36.768
but actually working with them

00:02:36.768 --> 00:02:38.327
to move to a different path

00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:40.926
to end up with fewer crimes

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:42.941
and fewer victims?

00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:45.452
So we find some investors,

00:02:45.452 --> 00:02:47.822
and they pay for a set of services,

00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:50.087
and if those services are successful,

00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:52.580
then they improve outcomes,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.221
and with those measured reductions in re-offending,

00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:56.296
government saves money,

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:57.833
and with those savings,

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:00.287
they can pay outcomes.

00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:02.463
And the investors do not just get their money back,

00:03:02.463 --> 00:03:04.471
but they make a return.

00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:06.912
So in March 2010, we signed

00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:08.932
the first social impact bond

00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:10.759
with the Ministry of Justice

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:12.796
around Peterborough Prison.

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:15.820
It was to work with 3,000 offenders

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.748
split into three cohorts of 1,000 each.

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:20.737
Now, each of those cohorts

00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:22.568
would get measured over the two years

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:23.770
that they were coming out of prison.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.825
They've got to have a year to commit their crimes,

00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:28.370
six months to get through the court system,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.765
and then they would be compared to a group

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:32.833
taken from the police national computer,

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:34.660
as similar as possible,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.194
and we would get paid

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:38.983
providing we achieved a hurdle rate
of 10-percent reduction,

00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:42.541
for every conviction event that didn't happen.

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:46.018
So we get paid for crimes saved.

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:50.122
Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction

00:03:50.122 --> 00:03:51.807
across all three cohorts,

00:03:51.807 --> 00:03:54.947
then the investors get a seven and a half percent

00:03:54.947 --> 00:03:57.090
annualized return on their investment,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.630
and if we do better than that,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.226
they can get up to 13 percent

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:02.759
annualized return on their investment,

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.877
which is okay.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:08.085
So everyone wins here, right?

00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:10.800
The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.243
and they only pay if it works.

00:04:13.243 --> 00:04:15.655
Investors get two opportunities:

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:18.711
for the first time, they can invest in social change.

00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:20.742
Also, they make a reasonable return,

00:04:20.742 --> 00:04:22.915
and they also know that

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:25.187
first investors in these kinds of things,

00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:26.844
they're going to have to believers.

00:04:26.844 --> 00:04:28.947
They're going to have to care in the social program,

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:30.939
but if this builds a track record

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.387
over five or 10 years,

00:04:32.387 --> 00:04:34.451
then you can widen that investor community

00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.907
as more people have confidence in the product.

00:04:36.907 --> 00:04:39.095
The service providers, well, for the first time,

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:41.954
they've got an opportunity to provide services

00:04:41.954 --> 00:04:44.181
and grow the evidence for what they're doing

00:04:44.181 --> 00:04:46.741
in a really constructive way and learn

00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:48.563
and demonstrate the value of what they're doing

00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:50.582
over five or six years, not just one or two

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.423
as often happens at the moment.

00:04:52.423 --> 00:04:55.901
Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.

00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:58.727
Now, the offenders, they also benefit.

00:04:58.727 --> 00:05:00.157
Instead of just coming out of the prison

00:05:00.157 --> 00:05:02.081
with 46 pounds in their pocket,

00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:03.580
half of them not knowing where they're spending

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.718
their first night out of jail,

00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:08.637
actually, someone meets them in prison,

00:05:08.637 --> 00:05:10.501
learns about their issues,

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.420
meets them at the gate,

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.173
takes them through to somewhere to stay,

00:05:15.173 --> 00:05:17.591
connects them to benefits,
connects them to employment,

00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:19.659
drug rehabilitation, mental health,

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.389
whatever's needed.

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.068
So let's think of another example:

00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:25.958
working with children in care.

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.582
Social impact bonds work great

00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:30.243
for any area where there is at the moment

00:05:30.243 --> 00:05:32.642
very expensive provision that produces

00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:34.216
poor outcomes for people.

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:36.130
So children in the state care

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.565
tend to do very badly.

00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:42.490
Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.389
of five GCSEs at 16,

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.859
against 58 percent of the wider population.

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:51.518
More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.559
have spent some time in care.

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:54.851
And even more worryingly,

00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:56.823
and this is a Home Office statistic,

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.723
70 percent of prostitutes

00:05:58.723 --> 00:06:00.907
have spent some time in care.

00:06:00.907 --> 00:06:03.907
The state is not a great parent.

00:06:03.907 --> 00:06:06.732
But there are great programs

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:09.744
for adolescents who are on the edge of care,

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.620
and 30 percent of kids going into care

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.279
are adolescents.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:16.119
So we set up a program with Essex County Council

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:19.765
to test out intensive family therapeutic support

00:06:19.765 --> 00:06:22.805
for those families with adolescents

00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:24.376
on the edge of the care system.

00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:27.162
Essex only pays in the event

00:06:27.162 --> 00:06:29.944
that it's saving them care costs.

00:06:29.944 --> 00:06:32.708
Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds.

00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:34.966
That program started last month.

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:37.290
Others, around homelessness in London,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.170
around youth and employment and education

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.537
elsewhere in the country.

00:06:42.537 --> 00:06:45.892
There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,

00:06:45.892 --> 00:06:48.367
and amazing levels of interest in this idea

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:49.890
all over the world.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.605
So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds

00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:55.855
into a social outcomes fund to support this idea.

00:06:55.855 --> 00:06:59.035
Obama has suggested 300 million dollars

00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:02.568
in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas

00:07:02.568 --> 00:07:04.254
and structures to move it forward,

00:07:04.254 --> 00:07:05.745
and a lot of other countries

00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:07.962
are demonstrating considerable interest.

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:10.018
So what's caused this excitement?

00:07:10.018 --> 00:07:12.537
Why is this so different for people?

00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:15.029
Well, the first piece, which we've talked about,

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:16.247
is innovation.

00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:19.445
It enables testing of new ideas

00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:23.038
in a way that's less difficult for everybody.

00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:25.674
The second piece it brings is rigor.

00:07:25.674 --> 00:07:28.967
By working to outcomes, people really have to test

00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:32.836
and bring data into the situation
that one's dealing with.

00:07:32.845 --> 00:07:35.338
So taking Peterborough as an example,

00:07:35.338 --> 00:07:37.561
we add case management

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:40.217
across all of the different organizations
that we're working with

00:07:40.217 --> 00:07:41.502
so they know

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.651
what actually has been done with different prisoners,

00:07:43.651 --> 00:07:45.720
and at the same time they learn

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.146
from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,

00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:49.881
because we pushed for the data,

00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:52.088
what actually happens, whether
they get re-arrested or not.

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:55.376
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly.

00:07:55.376 --> 00:07:58.313
And this leads to the third element, which is new,

00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:00.415
and that's flexibility.

00:08:00.415 --> 00:08:03.528
Because normal contracting for things,

00:08:03.528 --> 00:08:05.589
when you're spending government money,

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:08.100
you're spending our money, tax money,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.797
and the people who are in charge 
of that are very aware of it

00:08:10.797 --> 00:08:14.647
so the temptation is to control
exactly how you spend it.

00:08:14.647 --> 00:08:17.700
Now any entrepreneur in the room knows

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.797
that version 1.0, the business plan,

00:08:19.797 --> 00:08:22.644
is not the one that generally works.

00:08:22.644 --> 00:08:24.947
So when you're trying to do something like this,

00:08:24.947 --> 00:08:27.640
you need the flexibility to adapt the program.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.352
And again, in Peterborough, we started off

00:08:30.352 --> 00:08:34.509
with a program, but we also collected data,

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:36.386
and over the period of time,

00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:38.584
we nuanced and changed that program

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:41.204
to add a range of other elements,

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:42.969
so that the service adapts

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:45.470
and we meet the needs of the long term

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.534
as well as the short term:

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:50.643
greater engagement from the prisoners,

00:08:50.643 --> 00:08:53.422
longer-term engagement as well.

00:08:53.422 --> 00:08:55.958
The last element is partnership.

00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.135
There is, at the moment, a stale 
debate going on very often:

00:08:59.135 --> 00:09:01.260
state's better, public sector's better,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.771
private sector's better, social sector's better,

00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:06.439
for a lot of these programs.

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:08.421
Actually, for creating social change,

00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:10.160
we need to bring in the expertise

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.856
from all of those parties

00:09:11.856 --> 00:09:13.444
in order to make this work.

00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:15.487
And this creates a structure

00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:17.462
through which they can combine.

00:09:17.462 --> 00:09:19.394
So where does this leave us?

00:09:19.394 --> 00:09:21.228
This leaves us with a way

00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:24.215
that people can invest in social change.

00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:27.202
We've met thousands, possibly millions of people,

00:09:27.202 --> 00:09:29.635
who want the opportunity to invest in social change.

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:32.724
We've met champions all over the public sector

00:09:32.724 --> 00:09:35.139
keen to make these kinds of differences.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:36.924
With this kind of model,

00:09:36.924 --> 00:09:38.860
we can help bring them together.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.822
Thank you.

00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:45.022
(Applause)
