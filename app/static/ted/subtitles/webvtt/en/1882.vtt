WEBVTT

00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.505
We have a global health challenge

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:04.197
in our hands today,

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:07.257
and that is that the way we currently

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:10.182
discover and develop new drugs

00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:14.360
is too costly, takes far too long,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.074
and it fails more often than it succeeds.

00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:21.451
It really just isn't working, and that means

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.498
that patients that badly need new therapies

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:26.209
are not getting them,

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:29.707
and diseases are going untreated.

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:32.790
We seem to be spending more and more money.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.886
So for every billion dollars we spend in R&amp;D,

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:40.715
we're getting less drugs approved into the market.

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.932
More money, less drugs. Hmm.

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:45.852
So what's going on here?

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:48.447
Well, there's a multitude of factors at play,

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:50.468
but I think one of the key factors

00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:52.865
is that the tools that we currently have

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:56.948
available to test whether a drug is going to work,

00:00:56.948 --> 00:00:58.337
whether it has efficacy,

00:00:58.337 --> 00:01:00.103
or whether it's going to be safe

00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:03.655
before we get it into human clinical trials,

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:05.806
are failing us. They're not predicting

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:09.034
what's going to happen in humans.

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:11.757
And we have two main tools available

00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:13.771
at our disposal.

00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:17.812
They are cells in dishes and animal testing.

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:21.132
Now let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.

00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:24.285
So, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.

00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:26.340
We take them and rip them out

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.289
of their native environment,
throw them in one of these dishes,

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.874
and expect them to work.

00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:33.067
Guess what. They don't.

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:34.729
They don't like that environment

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.361
because it's nothing like

00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.037
what they have in the body.

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:41.108
What about animal testing?

00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:43.993
Well, animals do and can provide

00:01:43.993 --> 00:01:46.255
extremely useful information.

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:47.964
They teach us about what happens

00:01:47.964 --> 00:01:50.293
in the complex organism.

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:53.301
We learn more about the biology itself.

00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:56.199
However, more often than not,

00:01:56.199 --> 00:02:00.415
animal models fail to predict
what will happen in humans

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:03.601
when they're treated with a particular drug.

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.980
So we need better tools.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.733
We need human cells,

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.483
but we need to find a way to keep them happy

00:02:10.483 --> 00:02:12.074
outside the body.

00:02:12.074 --> 00:02:14.980
Our bodies are dynamic environments.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.820
We're in constant motion.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.011
Our cells experience that.

00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:21.820
They're in dynamic environments in our body.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.575
They're under constant mechanical forces.

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:27.031
So if we want to make cells happy

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.460
outside our bodies,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.986
we need to become cell architects.

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:35.330
We need to design, build and engineer

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.561
a home away from home for the cells.

00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:40.235
And at the Wyss Institute,

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:42.173
we've done just that.

00:02:42.173 --> 00:02:45.197
We call it an organ-on-a-chip.

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:46.988
And I have one right here.

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:49.803
It's beautiful, isn't it?
But it's pretty incredible.

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:54.303
Right here in my hand is a breathing, living

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:56.961
human lung on a chip.

00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:59.089
And it's not just beautiful.

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.529
It can do a tremendous amount of things.

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.308
We have living cells in that little chip,

00:03:05.308 --> 00:03:07.858
cells that are in a dynamic environment

00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:10.939
interacting with different cell types.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.578
There's been many people

00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:14.439
trying to grow cells in the lab.

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.595
They've tried many different approaches.

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:20.222
They've even tried to grow
little mini-organs in the lab.

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:21.771
We're not trying to do that here.

00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:23.897
We're simply trying to recreate

00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:25.474
in this tiny chip

00:03:25.474 --> 00:03:28.491
the smallest functional unit

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.045
that represents the biochemistry,

00:03:31.045 --> 00:03:34.169
the function and the mechanical strain

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.685
that the cells experience in our bodies.

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:40.717
So how does it work? Let me show you.

00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:43.351
We use techniques from the computer chip

00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:44.984
manufacturing industry

00:03:44.984 --> 00:03:47.181
to make these structures at a scale

00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:50.077
relevant to both the cells and their environment.

00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:52.141
We have three fluidic channels.

00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:55.853
In the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane

00:03:55.853 --> 00:03:57.916
on which we can add human cells

00:03:57.916 --> 00:03:59.260
from, say, our lungs,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.747
and then underneath, they had capillary cells,

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:03.535
the cells in our blood vessels.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:07.855
And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip

00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:10.684
that stretch and contract the membrane,

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:13.781
so the cells experience the same mechanical forces

00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:16.714
that they did when we breathe.

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:19.874
And they experience them how they did in the body.

00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:22.274
There's air flowing through the top channel,

00:04:22.274 --> 00:04:25.623
and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients

00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:28.462
through the blood channel.

00:04:28.462 --> 00:04:30.834
Now the chip is really beautiful,

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:32.931
but what can we do with it?

00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:35.255
We can get incredible functionality

00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:37.006
inside these little chips.

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:38.512
Let me show you.

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:41.143
We could, for example, mimic infection,

00:04:41.143 --> 00:04:44.679
where we add bacterial cells into the lung.

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:47.611
then we can add human white blood cells.

00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:50.202
White blood cells are our body's defense

00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:51.570
against bacterial invaders,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.739
and when they sense this
inflammation due to infection,

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:57.596
they will enter from the blood into the lung

00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:59.511
and engulf the bacteria.

00:04:59.511 --> 00:05:01.759
Well now you're going to see this happening

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.069
live in an actual human lung on a chip.

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.612
We've labeled the white blood cells
so you can see them flowing through,

00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:10.773
and when they detect that infection,

00:05:10.773 --> 00:05:12.170
they begin to stick.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.057
They stick, and then they try to go into the lung

00:05:16.057 --> 00:05:17.838
side from blood channel.

00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:21.527
And you can see here, we can actually visualize

00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:25.286
a single white blood cell.

00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:27.542
It sticks, it wiggles its way through

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:29.857
between the cell layers, through the pore,

00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:32.278
comes out on the other side of the membrane,

00:05:32.278 --> 00:05:35.713
and right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria

00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:37.362
labeled in green.

00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.366
In that tiny chip, you just witnessed

00:05:40.366 --> 00:05:43.547
one of the most fundamental responses

00:05:43.547 --> 00:05:45.504
our body has to an infection.

00:05:45.504 --> 00:05:49.274
It's the way we respond to -- an immune response.

00:05:49.274 --> 00:05:51.675
It's pretty exciting.

00:05:51.675 --> 00:05:54.018
Now I want to share this picture with you,

00:05:54.018 --> 00:05:56.656
not just because it's so beautiful,

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:59.992
but because it tells us an enormous
amount of information

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.589
about what the cells are doing within the chips.

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.848
It tells us that these cells

00:06:04.848 --> 00:06:07.159
from the small airways in our lungs,

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.910
actually have these hairlike structures

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.918
that you would expect to see in the lung.

00:06:10.918 --> 00:06:12.383
These structures are called cilia,

00:06:12.383 --> 00:06:15.293
and they actually move the mucus out of the lung.

00:06:15.293 --> 00:06:16.832
Yeah. Mucus. Yuck.

00:06:16.832 --> 00:06:19.272
But mucus is actually very important.

00:06:19.272 --> 00:06:21.853
Mucus traps particulates, viruses,

00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:23.312
potential allergens,

00:06:23.312 --> 00:06:24.913
and these little cilia move

00:06:24.913 --> 00:06:27.163
and clear the mucus out.

00:06:27.163 --> 00:06:29.075
When they get damaged, say,

00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:31.494
by cigarette smoke for example,

00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:34.302
they don't work properly,
and they can't clear that mucus out.

00:06:34.302 --> 00:06:38.119
And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.766
Cilia and the clearance of mucus

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:45.227
are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.

00:06:45.227 --> 00:06:48.777
But now, with the functionality
that we get in these chips,

00:06:48.777 --> 00:06:50.601
we can begin to look

00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.114
for potential new treatments.

00:06:53.114 --> 00:06:55.066
We didn't stop with the lung on a chip.

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.950
We have a gut on a chip.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.980
You can see one right here.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.206
And we've put intestinal human cells

00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:04.111
in a gut on a chip,

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:06.948
and they're under constant peristaltic motion,

00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:10.139
this trickling flow through the cells,

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.697
and we can mimic many of the functions

00:07:12.697 --> 00:07:14.960
that you actually would expect to see

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.653
in the human intestine.

00:07:16.653 --> 00:07:20.444
Now we can begin to create models of diseases

00:07:20.444 --> 00:07:22.854
such as irritable bowel syndrome.

00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:24.936
This is a disease that affects

00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:26.847
a large number of individuals.

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:28.621
It's really debilitating,

00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:32.563
and there aren't really many good treatments for it.

00:07:32.563 --> 00:07:34.865
Now we have a whole pipeline

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:37.144
of different organ chips

00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:40.876
that we are currently working on in our labs.

00:07:40.876 --> 00:07:44.295
Now, the true power of this technology, however,

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:46.420
really comes from the fact

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.965
that we can fluidically link them.

00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:50.912
There's fluid flowing across these cells,

00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:52.991
so we can begin to interconnect

00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:55.853
multiple different chips together

00:07:55.853 --> 00:08:00.066
to form what we call a virtual human on a chip.

00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:03.075
Now we're really getting excited.

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:07.170
We're not going to ever recreate 
a whole human in these chips,

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.339
but what our goal is is to be able to recreate

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:13.352
sufficient functionality

00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:15.712
so that we can make better predictions

00:08:15.712 --> 00:08:17.926
of what's going to happen in humans.

00:08:17.926 --> 00:08:20.850
For example, now we can begin to explore

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.284
what happens when we put
a drug like an aerosol drug.

00:08:24.284 --> 00:08:27.270
Those of you like me who have asthma,
when you take your inhaler,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.196
we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,

00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:31.822
how it enters the body,

00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:33.576
how it might affect, say, your heart.

00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:35.484
Does it change the beating of your heart?

00:08:35.484 --> 00:08:37.125
Does it have a toxicity?

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:39.133
Does it get cleared by the liver?

00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:41.285
Is it metabolized in the liver?

00:08:41.285 --> 00:08:43.176
Is it excreted in your kidneys?

00:08:43.176 --> 00:08:45.388
We can begin to study the dynamic

00:08:45.388 --> 00:08:48.013
response of the body to a drug.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.947
This could really revolutionize

00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:51.596
and be a game changer

00:08:51.596 --> 00:08:54.534
for not only the pharmaceutical industry,

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.907
but a whole host of different industries,

00:08:56.907 --> 00:08:59.307
including the cosmetics industry.

00:08:59.307 --> 00:09:02.189
We can potentially use the skin on a chip

00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:04.150
that we're currently developing in the lab

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.704
to test whether the ingredients in those products

00:09:06.704 --> 00:09:09.987
that you're using are actually 
safe to put on your skin

00:09:09.987 --> 00:09:12.676
without the need for animal testing.

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:14.620
We could test the safety

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.873
of chemicals that we are exposed to

00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:18.787
on a daily basis in our environment,

00:09:18.787 --> 00:09:22.518
such as chemicals in regular household cleaners.

00:09:22.518 --> 00:09:25.720
We could also use the organs on chips

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.499
for applications in bioterrorism

00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:31.070
or radiation exposure.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.420
We could use them to learn more about

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.464
diseases such as ebola

00:09:37.464 --> 00:09:41.356
or other deadly diseases such as SARS.

00:09:41.356 --> 00:09:43.194
Organs on chips could also change

00:09:43.194 --> 00:09:46.568
the way we do clinical trials in the future.

00:09:46.568 --> 00:09:49.155
Right now, the average participant

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:52.525
in a clinical trial is that: average.

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:55.851
Tends to be middle aged, tends to be female.

00:09:55.851 --> 00:09:58.323
You won't find many clinical trials

00:09:58.323 --> 00:09:59.838
in which children are involved,

00:09:59.838 --> 00:10:03.385
yet every day, we give children medications,

00:10:03.385 --> 00:10:07.131
and the only safety data we have on that drug

00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:10.205
is one that we obtained from adults.

00:10:10.205 --> 00:10:11.999
Children are not adults.

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:15.132
They may not respond in the same way adults do.

00:10:15.132 --> 00:10:17.544
There are other things like genetic differences

00:10:17.544 --> 00:10:18.977
in populations

00:10:18.977 --> 00:10:22.083
that may lead to at-risk populations

00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:25.520
that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.909
Now imagine if we could take cells
from all those different populations,

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:30.827
put them on chips,

00:10:30.827 --> 00:10:32.791
and create populations on a chip.

00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:34.629
This could really change the way

00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:36.698
we do clinical trials.

00:10:36.698 --> 00:10:39.530
And this is the team and the people
that are doing this.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.787
We have engineers, we have cell biologists,

00:10:42.787 --> 00:10:46.561
we have clinicians, all working together.

00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:48.487
We're really seeing something quite incredible

00:10:48.487 --> 00:10:50.092
at the Wyss Institute.

00:10:50.092 --> 00:10:52.263
It's really a convergence of disciplines,

00:10:52.263 --> 00:10:55.983
where biology is influencing the way we design,

00:10:55.983 --> 00:10:58.645
the way we engineer, the way we build.

00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:00.048
It's pretty exciting.

00:11:00.048 --> 00:11:03.612
We're establishing important industry collaborations

00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:06.985
such as the one we have with a company

00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:10.584
that has expertise in large-scale
digital manufacturing.

00:11:10.584 --> 00:11:12.603
They're going to help us make,

00:11:12.603 --> 00:11:14.129
instead of one of these,

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:15.712
millions of these chips,

00:11:15.712 --> 00:11:17.381
so that we can get them into the hands

00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:20.270
of as many researchers as possible.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.486
And this is key to the potential of that technology.

00:11:24.486 --> 00:11:27.023
Now let me show you our instrument.

00:11:27.023 --> 00:11:29.012
This is an instrument that our engineers

00:11:29.012 --> 00:11:31.630
are actually prototyping right now in the lab,

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.939
and this instrument is going to give us

00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:36.398
the engineering controls that we're going to require

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:40.566
in order to link 10 or more organ chips together.

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.795
It does something else that's very important.

00:11:42.795 --> 00:11:45.639
It creates an easy user interface.

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:48.629
So a cell biologist like me can come in,

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:50.637
take a chip, put it in a cartridge

00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:52.569
like the prototype you see there,

00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:54.640
put the cartridge into the machine

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.128
just like you would a C.D.,

00:11:56.128 --> 00:11:57.260
and away you go.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.009
Plug and play. Easy.

00:12:00.009 --> 00:12:02.523
Now, let's imagine a little bit

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:03.902
what the future might look like

00:12:03.902 --> 00:12:06.315
if I could take your stem cells

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:07.755
and put them on a chip,

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:10.974
or your stem cells and put them on a chip.

00:12:10.974 --> 00:12:14.475
It would be a personalized chip just for you.

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:17.683
Now all of us in here are individuals,

00:12:17.683 --> 00:12:20.521
and those individual differences mean

00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:22.963
that we could react very differently

00:12:22.963 --> 00:12:27.210
and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.778
I myself, a couple of years back,
had a really bad headache,

00:12:31.778 --> 00:12:34.191
just couldn't shake it, thought, 
"Well, I'll try something different."

00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:36.326
I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,

00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:38.206
I was on my way to the emergency room

00:12:38.206 --> 00:12:40.099
with a full-blown asthma attack.

00:12:40.099 --> 00:12:41.929
Now, obviously it wasn't fatal,

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:45.102
but unfortunately, some of these

00:12:45.102 --> 00:12:48.711
adverse drug reactions can be fatal.

00:12:48.711 --> 00:12:50.652
So how do we prevent them?

00:12:50.652 --> 00:12:53.232
Well, we could imagine one day

00:12:53.232 --> 00:12:55.575
having Geraldine on a chip,

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:57.324
having Danielle on a chip,

00:12:57.324 --> 00:12:58.797
having you on a chip.

00:12:58.797 --> 00:13:01.185
Personalized medicine. Thank you.

00:13:01.185 --> 00:13:05.339
(Applause)
