00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:03.873
So when I do my job, people hate me.

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:07.315
In fact, the better I do my job,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.666
the more people hate me.

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:11.071
And no, I'm not a meter maid,

00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:12.891
and I'm not an undertaker.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.051
I am a progressive, lesbian
talking head on Fox News.

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:19.138
(Applause)

00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:21.654
So y'all heard that, right?
Just to make sure, right?

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.757
I am a gay talking head on Fox News.

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:26.595
I am going to tell you how I do it,

00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:28.747
and the most important thing I've learned.

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:30.247
So I go on television.

00:00:30.544 --> 00:00:34.639
I debate people who literally want
to obliterate everything I believe in --

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:38.584
in some cases, who don't want
me and people like me to even exist.

00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:41.735
It's sort of like Thanksgiving
with your conservative uncle

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.338
on steroids,

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:46.908
with a live television
audience of millions.

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.004
It's totally almost just like that.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:51.362
And that's just on air.

00:00:51.387 --> 00:00:53.646
The hate mail I get is unbelievable.

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:58.631
Last week alone, I got 238
pieces of nasty email

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.591
and more hate tweets
than I can even count.

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:04.869
I was called an idiot,
a traitor, a scourge,

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:07.595
a cunt and an ugly man,

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:09.242
and that was just in one email.

00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:12.131
(Laughter)

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:14.893
So what have I realized,

00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:17.549
being on the receiving end
of all this ugliness?

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.373
Well, my biggest takeaway

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:23.381
is that for decades, we've been focused
on political correctness,

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.413
but what matters more
is emotional correctness.

00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:29.564
Let me give you a small example.

00:01:29.842 --> 00:01:32.548
I don't care if you call me a dyke.
I really don't.

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.045
I care about two things.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.612
One, I care that you spell it right.

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:41.681
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:45.104
Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:47.602
You'd totally be surprised.

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:51.493
And second, I don't care about the word,
I care about how you use it.

00:01:51.518 --> 00:01:53.842
Are you being friendly?
Are you just being naive?

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.651
Or do you really want
to hurt me personally?

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:02.278
Emotional correctness
is the tone, the feeling,

00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:04.367
how we say what we say,

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:07.097
the respect and compassion
we show one another.

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:10.256
And what I've realized
is that political persuasion

00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:14.129
doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.

00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:17.851
Political persuasion begins
with being emotionally correct.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.216
So when I first went
to go work at Fox News,

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.438
true confession,

00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:25.359
I expected there to be marks in the carpet

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:27.295
from all the knuckle-dragging.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.605
That, by the way, in case you're paying
attention, is not emotionally correct.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.661
But liberals on my side,

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:38.563
we can be self-righteous,
we can be condescending,

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:41.262
we can be dismissive of anyone
who doesn't agree with us.

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:44.050
In other words, we can
be politically right

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.349
but emotionally wrong.

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:51.865
And incidentally, that means that
people don't like us. Right?

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:54.318
Now here's the kicker.

00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:57.072
Conservatives are really nice.

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.068
I mean, not all of them,

00:02:59.092 --> 00:03:00.952
and not the ones who send me hate mail,

00:03:00.977 --> 00:03:02.364
but you would be surprised.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:05.798
Sean Hannity is one of
the sweetest guys I've ever met.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.790
He spends his free time
trying to fix up his staff on blind dates,

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.068
and I know that if I ever had a problem,

00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:15.179
he would do anything he could to help.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:20.697
Now, I think Sean Hannity
is 99 percent politically wrong,

00:03:21.057 --> 00:03:24.253
but his emotional correctness
is strikingly impressive.

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:26.227
And that's why people listen to him.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.624
Because you can't get
anyone to agree with you

00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:30.957
if they don't even listen to you first.

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:34.513
We spend so much time
talking past each other

00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:37.513
and not enough time talking
through our disagreements.

00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:41.307
And if we can start to find
compassion for one another,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.458
then we have a shot
at building common ground.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.982
It actually sounds really hokey
to say it standing up here,

00:03:49.284 --> 00:03:51.268
but when you try to put it in practice,

00:03:51.487 --> 00:03:52.887
it's really powerful.

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:55.895
So someone who says they hate immigrants,

00:03:56.224 --> 00:03:58.609
I try to imagine how scared they must be

00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:01.734
that their community is changing
from what they've always known.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.964
Or someone who says they
don't like teachers' unions,

00:04:05.237 --> 00:04:09.006
I bet they're really devastated to see
their kid's school going into the gutter,

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:11.181
and they're just looking
for someone to blame.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.807
Our challenge is to find
the compassion for others

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.902
that we want them to have for us.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.942
That is emotional correctness.

00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:22.982
I'm not saying it's easy.

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:26.316
An average of, like, 5.6 times per day

00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:29.158
I have to stop myself from responding
to all of my hate mail

00:04:29.183 --> 00:04:31.499
with a flurry of vile profanities.

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.147
This whole finding compassion
and common ground with your enemies thing

00:04:38.172 --> 00:04:41.250
is kind of like a political-spiritual
practice for me,

00:04:41.584 --> 00:04:43.972
and I ain't the Dalai Lama.

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:49.309
I'm not perfect,
but what I am is optimistic.

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:52.396
Because I don't just get hate mail.

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:55.452
I get a lot of really nice
letters, lots of them.

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.127
And one of my all-time favorites begins:

00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.124
"I am not a big fan
of your political leanings

00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:03.151
or your sometimes tortured logic,

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.960
(Laughter)

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:09.150
but I'm a big fan of you as a person."

00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:13.230
Now this guy doesn't
agree with me -- yet.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.832
(Laughter)

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.376
But he's listening --

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.782
not because of what I said,
but because of how I said it.

00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:26.726
And somehow, even though we've never met,
we've managed to form a connection.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:29.020
That's emotional correctness,

00:05:29.313 --> 00:05:31.974
and that's how we start the conversations

00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:33.718
that really lead to change.

00:05:33.962 --> 00:05:35.115
Thank you.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.968
(Applause)
