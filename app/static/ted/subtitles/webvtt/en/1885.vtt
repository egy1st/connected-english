00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:06.257
(Aquatic noises)

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.714
So this video was taken

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:13.146
at Aquarius undersea laboratory

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.999
four miles off the coast of Key Largo,

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.577
about 60 feet below the surface.

00:00:17.577 --> 00:00:19.301
NASA uses this extreme environment

00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:21.725
to train astronauts and aquanauts,

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:25.087
and last year, they invited us along for the ride.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:27.971
All the footage was taken from our open ROV,

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:32.458
which is a robot that we built in our garage.

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:36.026
So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle,

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:37.553
which in our case means our little robot

00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:39.817
sends live video

00:00:39.817 --> 00:00:41.735
across that ultra-thin tether

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:44.163
back to the computer topside.

00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:46.141
It's open source, meaning we publish

00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.186
and share all of our design files

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:49.694
and all of our code online,

00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:51.728
allowing anyone to modify

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.077
or improve or change the design.

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:56.380
It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.215
and costs about 1,000 times cheaper

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:00.094
than the ROVs James Cameron used

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:03.699
to explore the Titanic.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.909
So ROVs aren't new.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.617
They've been around for decades.

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:10.653
Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:13.472
Oil and gas companies use them for exploration

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.019
and construction.

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:17.781
What we've built isn't unique.

00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:20.655
It's how we've built it that's really unique.

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:23.636
So I want to give you a quick story
of how it got started.

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:25.907
So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I

00:01:25.907 --> 00:01:28.107
decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave

00:01:28.107 --> 00:01:29.965
in the foothills of the Sierras.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:31.868
We had heard this story about lost gold

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:34.386
from a Gold Rush-era robbery,
and we wanted to go up there.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.044
Unfortunately, we didn't have any money

00:01:36.044 --> 00:01:37.867
and we didn't have any tools to do it.

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:41.067
So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot,

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.840
but we didn't have all the parts figured out,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.052
so we did what anybody would do in our situation:

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:48.090
we asked the Internet for help.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.622
More specifically, we created this website,

00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:53.517
openROV.com, and shared 
our intentions and our plans

00:01:53.517 --> 00:01:55.907
For the first few months, it was just Eric and I

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.437
talking back to each other on the forums,

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:00.525
but pretty soon, we started to get feedback

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.368
from makers and hobbyists,

00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:04.362
and then actually professional ocean engineers

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:07.894
who had some suggestions for what we should do.

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.658
We kept working on it. We learned a lot.

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:11.683
We kept prototyping, and eventually,

00:02:11.683 --> 00:02:14.402
we decided we wanted to go 
to the cave. We were ready.

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:17.842
So about that time, our little expedition
became quite a story,

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:19.863
and it got picked up in The New York Times.

00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:21.675
And we were pretty much just overwhelmed

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:23.458
with interest from people who wanted a kit

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:25.979
that they could build this open ROV themselves.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.268
So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:30.500
and when we did,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.575
we raised our funding goal in about two hours,

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:35.780
and all of a sudden, 
had this money to make these kits.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.975
But then we had to learn how to make them.

00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:40.140
I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.400
So we quickly learned that our garage

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.079
was not big enough to hold our growing operation.

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.235
But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.942
thanks a lot to TechShop,
which was a big help to us,

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:53.927
and we shipped these kits all over the world

00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:55.756
just before Christmas of last year,

00:02:55.756 --> 00:02:57.538
so it was just a few months ago.

00:02:57.538 --> 00:02:59.446
But we're already starting to get video

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.044
and photos back from all over the world,

00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:04.074
including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:07.474
We've also learned the penguins love robots.

00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:09.487
(Laughter)

00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:12.655
So we're still publishing all the designs online,

00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:14.773
encouraging anyone to build these themselves.

00:03:14.773 --> 00:03:17.176
That's the only way that we could have done this.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:18.835
By being open source, we've created

00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:21.099
this distributed R&amp;D network,

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.895
and we're moving faster than
any venture-backed counterpart.

00:03:24.895 --> 00:03:28.100
But the actual robot is really only half the story.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.596
The real potential, the long term potential,

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:33.273
is with this community of DIY ocean explorers

00:03:33.273 --> 00:03:35.669
that are forming all over the globe.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.203
What can we discover

00:03:37.203 --> 00:03:39.107
when there's thousands of these devices

00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:41.153
roaming the seas?

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:43.429
So you're probably all wondering: the cave.

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.255
Did you find the gold?

00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:46.807
Well, we didn't find any gold,

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:50.036
but we decided that what we found
was much more valuable.

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:52.508
It was the glimpse into a potential future

00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:54.183
for ocean exploration.

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:57.093
It's something that's not limited to
the James Camerons of the world,

00:03:57.093 --> 00:03:59.688
but something that we're all participating in.

00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:01.021
It's an underwater world

00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:03.532
we're all exploring together.

00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:05.707
Thank you.

00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:09.707
(Applause)
