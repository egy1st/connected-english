00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:03.378
Mobility in developing world cities

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.536
is a very peculiar challenge,

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:07.341
because different from health

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.651
or education or housing,

00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:13.085
it tends to get worse as societies become richer.

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:15.869
Clearly, a unsustainable model.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.196
Mobility, as most other developing country problems,

00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:24.101
more than a matter of money or technology,

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:29.492
is a matter of equality, equity.

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.601
The great inequality in developing countries

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:36.026
makes it difficult to see, for example,

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:38.590
that in terms of transport,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.520
an advanced city is not one

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.542
where even the poor use cars,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.565
but rather one where even the rich

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.789
use public transport.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.355
Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:52.385
more than 30 percent of the population

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.920
uses bicycles,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.818
despite the fact that the Netherlands has

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:59.801
a higher income per capita than the United States.

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:03.658
There is a conflict in developing world cities

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:06.226
for money, for government investment.

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:08.727
If more money is invested in highways,

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:10.739
of course there is less money for housing,

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:13.096
for schools, for hospitals,

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:17.072
and also there is a conflict for space.

00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:19.498
There is a conflict for space between

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:22.023
those with cars and those without them.

00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:23.866
Most of us accept today

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.650
that private property and a market economy

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.848
is the best way to manage
most of society's resources.

00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:32.253
However, there is a problem with that,

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:34.921
that market economy needs

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.639
inequality of income in order to work.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.181
Some people must make more money,

00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:40.732
some others less.

00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:43.301
Some companies succeed. Others fail.

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:45.175
Then what kind of equality

00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:46.780
can we hope for today

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.702
with a market economy?

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:50.638
I would propose two kinds

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:52.992
which both have much to do with cities.

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:56.098
The first one is equality of quality of life,

00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:57.886
especially for children,

00:01:57.886 --> 00:01:59.541
that all children should have,

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.548
beyond the obvious health and education,

00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:06.407
access to green spaces, to sports facilities,

00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:09.433
to swimming pools, to music lessons.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.924
And the second kind of equality

00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:16.207
is one which we could call "democratic equality."

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:19.156
The first article in every constitution states

00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:22.445
that all citizens are equal before the law.

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:24.900
That is not just poetry.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.101
It's a very powerful principle.

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.687
For example, if that is true,

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:31.572
a bus with 80 passengers

00:02:31.572 --> 00:02:34.301
has a right to 80 times more road space

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:37.173
than a car with one.

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:41.566
We have been so used to inequality, sometimes,

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:45.297
that it's before our noses and we do not see it.

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:47.573
Less than 100 years ago,

00:02:47.573 --> 00:02:48.960
women could not vote,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.166
and it seemed normal,

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:54.850
in the same way that it seems normal today

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.782
to see a bus in traffic.

00:02:57.782 --> 00:03:00.733
In fact, when I became mayor,

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:03.701
applying that democratic principle

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.113
that public good prevails over private interest,

00:03:06.113 --> 00:03:09.013
that a bus with 100 people

00:03:09.013 --> 00:03:11.587
has a right to 100 times
more road space than a car,

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:14.601
we implemented a mass transit system

00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:17.070
based on buses in exclusive lanes.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.512
We called it TransMilenio,
in order to make buses sexier.

00:03:21.512 --> 00:03:29.309
And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful
democratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.473
expensive cars stuck in traffic,

00:03:33.473 --> 00:03:39.800
it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.629
In fact, it's not just a matter of equity.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.521
It doesn't take Ph.D.'s.

00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:47.793
A committee of 12-year-old children

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:49.799
would find out in 20 minutes

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.503
that the most efficient way to use scarce road space

00:03:53.503 --> 00:03:56.987
is with exclusive lanes for buses.

00:03:56.987 --> 00:04:00.309
In fact, buses are not sexy,

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.456
but they are the only possible means

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:06.739
to bring mass transit to all areas

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.414
of fast growing developing cities.

00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:12.589
They also have great capacity.

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.333
For example, this system in Guangzhou

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.038
is moving more passengers our direction

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:20.862
than all subway lines in China,

00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:23.353
except for one line in Beijing,

00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:25.690
at a fraction of the cost.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.804
We fought not just for space for buses,

00:04:29.804 --> 00:04:32.860
but we fought for space for people,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.073
and that was even more difficult.

00:04:36.073 --> 00:04:38.858
Cities are human habitats,

00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:42.587
and we humans are pedestrians.

00:04:42.587 --> 00:04:45.651
Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:48.443
or deer need to run, we need to walk.

00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:51.774
There is a really enormous conflict,

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.775
when we are talking about developing country cities,

00:04:54.775 --> 00:04:57.454
between pedestrians and cars.

00:04:57.454 --> 00:05:00.385
Here, what you see is a picture that shows

00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:02.037
insufficient democracy.

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:05.129
What this shows is that people who walk

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.804
are third-class citizens

00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:08.139
while those who go in cars

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.954
are first-class citizens.

00:05:09.954 --> 00:05:12.361
In terms of transport infrastructure,

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:13.564
what really makes a difference

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:16.110
between advanced and backward cities

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.202
is not highways or subways

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:20.466
but quality sidewalks.

00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:23.232
Here they made a flyover, probably very useless,

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:27.190
and they forgot to make a sidewalk.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.514
This is prevailing all over the world.

00:05:29.514 --> 00:05:33.299
Not even schoolchildren
are more important than cars.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.540
In my city of Bogotá,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.894
we fought a very difficult battle

00:05:38.894 --> 00:05:41.668
in order to take space from cars,

00:05:41.668 --> 00:05:44.564
which had been parking on sidewalks for decades,

00:05:44.564 --> 00:05:47.679
in order to make space for people that should reflect

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:49.347
dignity of human beings,

00:05:49.347 --> 00:05:52.196
and to make space for protected bikeways.

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:54.941
First of all, I had black hair before that.

00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:56.917
(Laughter)

00:05:56.917 --> 00:06:00.173
And I was almost impeached in the process.

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:02.317
It is a very difficult battle.

00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:05.494
However, it was possible, finally,

00:06:05.494 --> 00:06:08.732
after very difficult battles, to make a city

00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:11.416
that would reflect some respect for human dignity,

00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:13.211
that would show that those who walk are equally

00:06:13.211 --> 00:06:15.032
important to those who have cars.

00:06:15.032 --> 00:06:19.681
Indeed, a very important ideological
and political issue anywhere

00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:22.627
is how to distribute that most valuable resource

00:06:22.627 --> 00:06:25.036
of a city, which is road space.

00:06:25.036 --> 00:06:27.873
A city could find oil or diamonds underground

00:06:27.873 --> 00:06:29.964
and it would not be so valuable as road space.

00:06:29.964 --> 00:06:33.125
How to distribute it between pedestrians,

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:36.227
bicycles, public transport and cars?

00:06:36.227 --> 00:06:39.018
This is not a technological issue,

00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:42.542
and we should remember that in no constitution

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:44.863
parking is a constitutional right

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.364
when we make that distribution.

00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:50.995
We also built, and this was 15 years ago,

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.933
before there were bikeways in New York

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:54.377
or in Paris or in London,

00:06:54.377 --> 00:06:56.824
it was a very difficult battle as well,

00:06:56.824 --> 00:07:01.644
more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.

00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:03.568
I don't think protected bicycle ways

00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:06.322
are a cute architectural feature.

00:07:06.322 --> 00:07:09.028
They are a right, just as sidewalks are,

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.226
unless we believe that only those

00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:13.560
with access to a motor vehicle

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.627
have a right to safe mobility,

00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:17.900
without the risk of getting killed.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.567
And just as busways are,

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.658
protected bikeways also are

00:07:23.658 --> 00:07:25.537
a powerful symbol of democracy,

00:07:25.537 --> 00:07:29.187
because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle

00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:31.609
is equally important

00:07:31.609 --> 00:07:35.551
to one in a $30,000 car.

00:07:35.551 --> 00:07:39.268
And we are living in a unique moment in history.

00:07:39.268 --> 00:07:43.720
In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.282
which will exist in the year 2060 will be built.

00:07:48.282 --> 00:07:50.580
In many developing country cities,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.640
more than 80 and 90 percent

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.342
of the city which will exist in 2060

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:59.703
will be built over the next four or five decades.

00:07:59.703 --> 00:08:02.825
But this is not just a matter
for developing country cities.

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.814
In the United States, for example,

00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:07.479
more than 70 million new homes

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:10.176
must be built over the next 40 or 50 years.

00:08:10.176 --> 00:08:13.249
That's more than all the homes that today exist

00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:17.765
in Britain, France and Canada put together.

00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:21.122
And I believe that our cities today

00:08:21.122 --> 00:08:23.237
have severe flaws,

00:08:23.237 --> 00:08:26.795
and that different, better ones could be built.

00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:29.243
What is wrong with our cities today?

00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:33.477
Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child

00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:35.182
who is barely learning to speak

00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:36.693
in any city in the world today,

00:08:36.693 --> 00:08:38.375
"Watch out, a car,"

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.937
the child will jump in fright,

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.716
and with a very good reason, because there are

00:08:42.716 --> 00:08:45.273
more than 10,000 children who are killed

00:08:45.273 --> 00:08:48.742
by cars every year in the world.

00:08:48.742 --> 00:08:51.350
We have had cities for 8,000 years,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.686
and children could walk out of home and play.

00:08:55.686 --> 00:08:57.978
In fact, only very recently,

00:08:57.978 --> 00:08:59.812
towards 1900, there were no cars.

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:03.813
Cars have been here for really
less than 100 years.

00:09:03.813 --> 00:09:06.587
They completely changed cities.

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:08.535
In 1900, for example,

00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:12.421
nobody was killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.336
Only 20 years later,

00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:17.731
between 1920 and 1930,

00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:20.089
almost 200,000 people

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:22.599
were killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:26.630
Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.582
were killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:30.582 --> 00:09:34.585
So we could make different cities,

00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:37.346
cities that will give more priority to human beings

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:39.805
than to cars, that will give more public space

00:09:39.805 --> 00:09:41.929
to human beings than to cars,

00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:44.684
cities which show great respect

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:46.845
for those most vulnerable citizens,

00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:48.629
such as children or the elderly.

00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:52.434
I will propose to you a couple of ingredients

00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:55.776
which I think would make cities much better,

00:09:55.776 --> 00:09:58.261
and it would be very simple to implement them

00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:01.185
in the new cities which are only being created.

00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:04.238
Hundreds of kilometers of greenways

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:07.388
criss-crossing cities in all directions.

00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:10.132
Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces.

00:10:10.132 --> 00:10:13.093
They could go for dozens of kilometers safely

00:10:13.093 --> 00:10:16.147
without any risk in wonderful greenways,

00:10:16.147 --> 00:10:18.563
sort of bicycle highways,

00:10:18.563 --> 00:10:21.668
and I would invite you to imagine the following:

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:24.906
a city in which every other street would be

00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:29.977
a street only for pedestrians and bicycles.

00:10:29.992 --> 00:10:32.223
In new cities which are going to be built,

00:10:32.223 --> 00:10:34.768
this would not be particularly difficult.

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:38.295
When I was mayor of Bogotá,

00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:40.825
in only three years, we were able to create

00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:42.963
70 kilometers,

00:10:42.963 --> 00:10:45.459
in one of the most dense cities in the world,

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:47.826
of these bicycle highways.

00:10:47.826 --> 00:10:51.216
And this changes the way people live,

00:10:51.216 --> 00:10:53.888
move, enjoy the city.

00:10:53.888 --> 00:10:56.509
In this picture, you see in one
of the very poor neighborhoods,

00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:59.579
we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:01.940
and the cars still in the mud.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.763
Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars.

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:06.211
But what do we do first?

00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:09.372
Ninety-nine percent of the people
in those neighborhoods don't have cars.

00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:11.845
But you see, when a city is only being created,

00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:13.935
it's very easy to incorporate

00:11:13.935 --> 00:11:16.111
this kind of infrastructure.

00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:18.809
Then the city grows around it.

00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:21.852
And of course this is just a glimpse

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:24.647
of something which could be much better

00:11:24.647 --> 00:11:26.365
if we just create it,

00:11:26.365 --> 00:11:28.702
and it changes the way of life.

00:11:28.702 --> 00:11:32.768
And the second ingredient,
which would solve mobility,

00:11:32.768 --> 00:11:35.346
that very difficult challenge in developing countries,

00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:38.341
in a very low-cost and simple way,

00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:42.353
would be to have hundreds of kilometers

00:11:42.353 --> 00:11:44.875
of streets only for buses,

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:47.979
buses and bicycles and pedestrians.

00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:51.018
This would be, again, a very low-cost solution

00:11:51.018 --> 00:11:53.341
if implemented from the start,

00:11:53.341 --> 00:11:55.864
low cost, pleasant transit

00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:59.562
with natural sunlight.

00:11:59.562 --> 00:12:04.210
But unfortunately, reality is not as good

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.962
as my dreams.

00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:09.144
Because of private property of land

00:12:09.144 --> 00:12:12.165
and high land prices,

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:15.202
all developing country cities
have a large problem of slums.

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:18.112
In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:23.458
in cities initially were illegal developments.

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:26.670
And of course it's very difficult to have

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.626
mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.

00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:32.672
But even legal developments

00:12:32.672 --> 00:12:35.644
have also been located in the wrong places,

00:12:35.644 --> 00:12:38.445
very far from the city centers

00:12:38.445 --> 00:12:40.482
where it's impossible to provide

00:12:40.482 --> 00:12:44.313
low-cost, high-frequency public transport.

00:12:44.313 --> 00:12:47.193
As a Latin American, and Latin America

00:12:47.193 --> 00:12:50.620
was the most recently organized region in the world,

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:55.780
I would recommend, respectfully, passionately,

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.890
to those countries which are yet to urbanize --

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.911
Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950

00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:10.984
to 80 percent urban in 2010 --

00:13:10.984 --> 00:13:14.144
I would recommend Asian and African countries

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:15.926
which are yet to urbanize,

00:13:15.926 --> 00:13:20.093
such as India which is only 33 percent urban now,

00:13:20.093 --> 00:13:23.068
that governments should acquire
all land around cities.

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:25.589
In this way, their cities could grow in the right places

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:27.364
with the right spaces, with the parks,

00:13:27.364 --> 00:13:30.740
with the greenways, with the busways.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.255
The cities we are going to build

00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:34.095
over the next 50 years

00:13:34.095 --> 00:13:36.492
will determine quality of life and even happiness

00:13:36.492 --> 00:13:38.646
for billions of people towards the future.

00:13:38.646 --> 00:13:42.224
What a fantastic opportunity for leaders

00:13:42.224 --> 00:13:44.466
and many young leaders to come,

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:46.533
especially in the developing countries.

00:13:46.533 --> 00:13:48.380
They can create a much happier life

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.949
for billions towards the future.

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:51.912
I am sure, I am optimistic,

00:13:51.912 --> 00:13:53.820
that they will make cities better

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.989
than our most ambitious dreams.

00:13:56.989 --> 00:14:00.866
(Applause)
