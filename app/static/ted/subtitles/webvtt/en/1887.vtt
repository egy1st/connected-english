00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:02.023
A couple of years ago,

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:04.241
Harvard Business School chose

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:06.990
the best business model of that year.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.054
It chose Somali piracy.

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.270
Pretty much around the same time,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.103
I discovered that there were 544 seafarers

00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:22.489
being held hostage on ships,

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.579
often anchored just off the Somali coast

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.007
in plain sight.

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.632
And I learned these two facts, and I thought,

00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:32.073
what's going on in shipping?

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.644
And I thought, would that happen
in any other industry?

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:38.155
Would we see 544 airline pilots

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:39.785
held captive in their jumbo jets

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:43.272
on a runway for months, or a year?

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:47.098
Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers?

00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:48.977
It wouldn't happen.

00:00:48.977 --> 00:00:51.755
So I started to get intrigued.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.269
And I discovered another fact,

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.252
which to me was more astonishing

00:00:56.252 --> 00:00:59.337
almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before

00:00:59.337 --> 00:01:01.996
at the age of 42, 43.

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:07.315
That is how fundamentally 
we still depend on shipping.

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:09.660
Because perhaps the general public

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.785
thinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry,

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:15.323
something brought by sailboat

00:01:15.323 --> 00:01:18.708
with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows.

00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:20.602
But shipping isn't that.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:25.479
Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.082
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.

00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:34.647
Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.

00:01:34.647 --> 00:01:37.639
We are more dependent on it now than ever.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.398
And yet, for such an enormous industry --

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:44.875
there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea —

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:48.268
it's become pretty much invisible.

00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:52.557
Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that,

00:01:52.557 --> 00:01:54.903
because here shipping is so present

00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:58.285
that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:01:59.965
(Laughter)

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:01.981
But elsewhere in the world,

00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:04.227
if you ask the general public what they know

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:07.063
about shipping and how much
trade is carried by sea,

00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:11.680
you will get essentially a blank face.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.713
You will ask someone on the street

00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:15.436
if they've heard of Microsoft.

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:17.273
I should think they'll say yes,

00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:19.468
because they'll know that they make software

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:21.363
that goes on computers,

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:24.508
and occasionally works.

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:28.113
But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk,

00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:30.814
I doubt you'd get the same response,

00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:32.261
even though Maersk,

00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:35.952
which is just one shipping company amongst many,

00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:38.934
has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:40.415
[$60.2 billion]

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.338
Now why is this?

00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:44.251
A few years ago,

00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:47.523
the first sea lord of the British admiralty --

00:02:47.523 --> 00:02:49.328
he is called the first sea lord,

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:53.823
although the chief of the army is not called a land lord —

00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:56.266
he said that we, and he meant

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:58.948
in the industrialized nations in the West,

00:02:58.948 --> 00:03:02.760
that we suffer from sea blindness.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.404
We are blind to the sea

00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:07.330
as a place of industry or of work.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.623
It's just something we fly over,

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:12.628
a patch of blue on an airline map.

00:03:12.628 --> 00:03:15.953
Nothing to see, move along.

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:19.598
So I wanted to open my own eyes

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:22.675
to my own sea blindness,

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:26.045
so I ran away to sea.

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:28.396
A couple of years ago, I took a passage

00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:30.770
on the Maersk Kendal,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.112
a mid-sized container ship

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:35.340
carrying nearly 7,000 boxes,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.237
and I departed from Felixstowe,

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:39.000
on the south coast of England,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.161
and I ended up right here in Singapore

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:42.654
five weeks later,

00:03:42.654 --> 00:03:47.558
considerably less jet-lagged than I am right now.

00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:50.800
And it was a revelation.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.995
We traveled through five seas,

00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:55.542
two oceans, nine ports,

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:58.289
and I learned a lot about shipping.

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.007
And one of the first things that surprised me

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.394
when I got on board Kendal

00:04:02.394 --> 00:04:05.139
was, where are all the people?

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.759
I have friends in the Navy who tell me

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.898
they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time,

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:13.237
but on Kendal there were only 21 crew.

00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:16.114
Now that's because shipping is very efficient.

00:04:16.114 --> 00:04:19.178
Containerization has made it very efficient.

00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:21.272
Ships have automation now.

00:04:21.272 --> 00:04:24.001
They can operate with small crews.

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:25.790
But it also means that, in the words

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.250
of a port chaplain I once met,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.295
the average seafarer you're going to find

00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:34.434
on a container ship is either tired or exhausted,

00:04:34.434 --> 00:04:37.213
because the pace of modern shipping

00:04:37.213 --> 00:04:39.534
is quite punishing for what the shipping calls

00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:41.965
its human element,

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:44.417
a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.821
sounds a little bit inhuman.

00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:49.496
So most seafarers now working on container ships

00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:53.573
often have less than two hours in port at a time.

00:04:53.573 --> 00:04:55.211
They don't have time to relax.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.455
They're at sea for months at a time,

00:04:57.455 --> 00:04:58.770
and even when they're on board,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.072
they don't have access to what

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:04.506
a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.

00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:07.332
And another thing that surprised me
when I got on board Kendal

00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:10.317
was who I was sitting next to --

00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:15.576
Not the queen; I can't imagine why
they put me underneath her portrait --

00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:18.345
But around that dining table in the officer's saloon,

00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:20.173
I was sitting next to a Burmese guy,

00:05:20.173 --> 00:05:23.438
I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian.

00:05:23.438 --> 00:05:25.675
On the next table was a Chinese guy,

00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:28.717
and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.

00:05:28.717 --> 00:05:31.677
So that was a normal working ship.

00:05:31.677 --> 00:05:33.700
Now how is that possible?

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.592
Because the biggest dramatic change

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:37.436
in shipping over the last 60 years,

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:39.948
when most of the general public stopped noticing it,

00:05:39.948 --> 00:05:42.567
was something called an open registry,

00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:45.372
or a flag of convenience.

00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:47.959
Ships can now fly the flag of any nation

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:50.911
that provides a flag registry.

00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:53.186
You can get a flag from the landlocked nation

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.310
of Bolivia, or Mongolia,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.285
or North Korea, though that's not very popular.

00:05:58.285 --> 00:05:59.708
(Laughter)

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:01.819
So we have these very multinational,

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.600
global, mobile crews on ships.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.312
And that was a surprise to me.

00:06:09.312 --> 00:06:12.429
And when we got to pirate waters,

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:15.555
down the Bab-el-Mandeb strait
and into the Indian Ocean,

00:06:15.555 --> 00:06:17.307
the ship changed.

00:06:17.307 --> 00:06:20.450
And that was also shocking, because suddenly,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.664
I realized, as the captain said to me,

00:06:22.664 --> 00:06:24.666
that I had been crazy to choose to go

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:27.718
through pirate waters on a container ship.

00:06:27.718 --> 00:06:29.709
We were no longer allowed on deck.

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:32.305
There were double pirate watches.

00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:36.582
And at that time, there were those 
544 seafarers being held hostage,

00:06:36.582 --> 00:06:38.550
and some of them were held hostage for years

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.321
because of the nature of shipping
and the flag of convenience.

00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:43.403
Not all of them, but some of them were,

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:48.117
because for the minority
of unscrupulous ship owners,

00:06:48.117 --> 00:06:50.662
it can be easy to hide behind

00:06:50.662 --> 00:06:55.661
the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.

00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:59.600
What else does our sea blindness mask?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.919
Well, if you go out to sea on a ship

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.914
or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,

00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:06.783
you'll see very black smoke.

00:07:06.783 --> 00:07:09.318
And that's because shipping

00:07:09.318 --> 00:07:11.905
has very tight margins,
and they want cheap fuel,

00:07:11.905 --> 00:07:14.076
so they use something called bunker fuel,

00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:16.592
which was described to me
by someone in the tanker industry

00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:18.758
as the dregs of the refinery,

00:07:18.758 --> 00:07:22.015
or just one step up from asphalt.

00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:25.412
And shipping is the greenest method of transport.

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:27.755
In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,

00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:30.726
it emits about a thousandth of aviation

00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:32.841
and about a tenth of trucking.

00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:36.077
But it's not benign, because there's so much of it.

00:07:36.077 --> 00:07:38.607
So shipping emissions are
about three to four percent,

00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:40.782
almost the same as aviation's.

00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:42.171
And if you put shipping emissions

00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:45.551
on a list of the countries' carbon emissions,

00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:47.164
it would come in about sixth,

00:07:47.164 --> 00:07:49.278
somewhere near Germany.

00:07:49.278 --> 00:07:53.296
It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships

00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:55.891
pollute in terms of particles and soot

00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:57.291
and noxious gases

00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.869
as much as all the cars in the world.

00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:01.269
And the good news is that

00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:03.464
people are now talking about sustainable shipping.

00:08:03.464 --> 00:08:05.951
There are interesting initiatives going on.

00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:08.206
But why has it taken so long?

00:08:08.206 --> 00:08:10.553
When are we going to start talking and thinking

00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:14.589
about shipping miles as well as air miles?

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:17.394
I also traveled to Cape Cod to look

00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:21.321
at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,

00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.477
because this to me was one
of the most surprising things

00:08:23.477 --> 00:08:25.433
about my time at sea,

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:27.230
and what it made me think about.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.383
We know about man's impact on the ocean

00:08:30.383 --> 00:08:32.815
in terms of fishing and overfishing,

00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:34.623
but we don't really know much about

00:08:34.623 --> 00:08:36.806
what's happening underneath the water.

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:39.411
And in fact, shipping has a role to play here,

00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:43.057
because shipping noise has contributed

00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:46.250
to damaging the acoustic
habitats of ocean creatures.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.242
Light doesn't penetrate beneath
the surface of the water,

00:08:49.242 --> 00:08:51.869
so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins

00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:54.173
and even 800 species of fish

00:08:54.173 --> 00:08:57.064
communicate by sound.

00:08:57.064 --> 00:08:58.777
And a North Atlantic right whale

00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:01.984
can transmit across hundreds of miles.

00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:03.947
A humpback can transmit a sound

00:09:03.947 --> 00:09:05.885
across a whole ocean.

00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:07.840
But a supertanker can also be heard

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.911
coming across a whole ocean,

00:09:09.911 --> 00:09:12.475
and because the noise that
propellers make underwater

00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:15.812
is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,

00:09:15.812 --> 00:09:18.846
then it can damage their acoustic habitat,

00:09:18.846 --> 00:09:20.536
and they need this for breeding,

00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:22.187
for finding feeding grounds,

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.710
for finding mates.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.551
And the acoustic habitat of the
North Atlantic right whale

00:09:27.551 --> 00:09:30.901
has been reduced by up to 90 percent.

00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:35.513
But there are no laws governing 
acoustic pollution yet.

00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:38.769
And when I arrived in Singapore,

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:43.673
and I apologize for this, but I 
didn't want to get off my ship.

00:09:43.676 --> 00:09:46.635
I'd really loved being on board Kendal.

00:09:46.635 --> 00:09:48.530
I'd been well treated by the crew,

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.071
I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain,

00:09:52.071 --> 00:09:56.143
and I would happily have signed up
for another five weeks,

00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:57.974
something that the captain also said

00:09:57.974 --> 00:10:00.247
I was crazy to think about.

00:10:00.247 --> 00:10:02.491
But I wasn't there for nine months at a time

00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:04.446
like the Filipino seafarers,

00:10:04.446 --> 00:10:06.685
who, when I asked them to describe their job to me,

00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:09.007
called it "dollar for homesickness."

00:10:09.007 --> 00:10:10.485
They had good salaries,

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.516
but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life

00:10:13.516 --> 00:10:17.205
in a dangerous and often difficult element.

00:10:17.205 --> 00:10:19.291
But when I get to this part, I'm in two minds,

00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.216
because I want to salute those seafarers

00:10:22.216 --> 00:10:24.403
who bring us 90 percent of everything

00:10:24.403 --> 00:10:28.069
and get very little thanks or recognition for it.

00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:30.790
I want to salute the 100,000 ships

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.113
that are at sea

00:10:32.113 --> 00:10:34.646
that are doing that work, coming in and out

00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:37.875
every day, bringing us what we need.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.895
But I also want to see shipping,

00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:44.374
and us, the general public,
who know so little about it,

00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:46.414
to have a bit more scrutiny,

00:10:46.414 --> 00:10:48.518
to be a bit more transparent,

00:10:48.518 --> 00:10:51.790
to have 90 percent transparency.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.691
Because I think we could all benefit

00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:56.796
from doing something very simple,

00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:59.878
which is learning to see the sea.

00:10:59.878 --> 00:11:02.036
Thank you.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:06.344
(Applause)
