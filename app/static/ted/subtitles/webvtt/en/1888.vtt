WEBVTT

00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:03.646
I would like to show you how

00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:06.523
architecture has helped

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.618
to change the life of my community

00:00:09.618 --> 00:00:14.433
and has opened opportunities to hope.

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:17.392
I am a native of Burkina Faso.

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.610
According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.659
is one of the poorest countries in the world,

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.506
but what does it look like

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:29.925
to grow up in a place like that?

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.485
I am an example of that.

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:36.393
I was born in a little village called Gando.

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:40.885
In Gando, there was no electricity,

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:45.099
no access to clean drinking water, and no school.

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:47.923
But my father wanted me

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.972
to learn how to read and write.

00:00:49.972 --> 00:00:54.020
For this reason, I had to leave my family

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.914
when I was seven and to stay in a city

00:00:57.914 --> 00:00:59.902
far away from my village

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:03.579
with no contact with my family.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.000
In this place I sat

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.226
in a class like that

00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:12.978
with more than 150 other kids,

00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:15.470
and for six years.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.550
In this time, it just happened to me to come to school

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.245
to realize that my classmate died.

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:29.758
Today, not so much has changed.

00:01:29.758 --> 00:01:34.211
There is still no electricity in my village.

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:36.673
People still are dying in Burkina Faso,

00:01:36.673 --> 00:01:40.276
and access to clean drinking water

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:44.499
is still a big problem.

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:52.051
I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life

00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.803
when you grow up in a place like that.

00:01:54.803 --> 00:01:57.172
But I was lucky.

00:01:57.172 --> 00:01:59.256
I had a scholarship.

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:03.466
I could go to Germany to study.

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:07.371
So now, I suppose,

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:12.045
I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:16.502
it is for me to be standing before you today.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:20.874
From Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso,

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:25.180
to Berlin in Germany to become an architect

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.345
is a big, big step.

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:35.997
But what to do with this privilege?

00:02:35.997 --> 00:02:39.952
Since I was a student, I wanted to open up

00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:42.595
better opportunities to other kids in Gando.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.510
I just wanted to use my skills and build a school.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.494
But how do you do it when you're still a student

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:50.576
and you don't have money?

00:02:50.576 --> 00:02:53.078
Oh yes, I started to make drawings

00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:55.060
and asked for money.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.039
Fundraising was not an easy task.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.838
I even asked my classmates

00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:05.016
to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes,

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:08.984
but to sponsor my school project.

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:12.000
In real wonder, two years later,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.534
I was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars.

00:03:18.534 --> 00:03:21.497
When I came home to Gando

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:23.022
to bring the good news,

00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:27.171
my people were over the moon,

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:29.792
but when they realized

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.636
that I was planning to use clay,

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:34.719
they were shocked.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.262
"A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season,

00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:43.371
and Francis wants us to use it and build a school.

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:46.135
Is this the reason why he spent so much time

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:48.148
in Europe studying

00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:52.247
instead of working in the field with us?"

00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:56.540
My people build all the time with clay,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.461
but they don't see any innovation with mud.

00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:03.650
So I had to convince everybody.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.033
I started to speak with the community,

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:09.496
and I could convince everybody,

00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:12.506
and we could start to work.

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:14.270
And the women, the men,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.315
everybody from the village,

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:18.332
was part of this building process.

00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:22.041
I was allowed to use even traditional techniques.

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.204
So clay floor for example,

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:28.600
the young men come and stand like that, beating,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.196
hours for hours,

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:31.908
and then their mothers came,

00:04:31.908 --> 00:04:35.642
and they are beating in this position,

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:40.258
for hours, giving water and beating.

00:04:40.258 --> 00:04:41.886
And then the polishers come.

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:46.944
They start polishing it with a stone for hours.

00:04:46.944 --> 00:04:51.901
And then you have this result,

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:55.210
very fine, like a baby bottom.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.983
(Laughter)

00:04:56.983 --> 00:05:02.248
It's not photoshopped. (Laughter)

00:05:02.248 --> 00:05:05.232
This is the school, built with the community.

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:07.022
The walls are totally made out

00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:11.122
of compressed clay blocks from Gando.

00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:14.276
The roof structure is made

00:05:14.276 --> 00:05:17.098
with cheap steel bars

00:05:17.098 --> 00:05:20.994
normally hiding inside concrete.

00:05:20.994 --> 00:05:24.062
And the classroom, the ceiling is made

00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:26.817
out of both of them used together.

00:05:26.817 --> 00:05:29.727
In this school, there was a simple idea:

00:05:29.727 --> 00:05:33.437
to create comfort in a classroom.

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:38.608
Don't forget, it can be 45 degrees in Burkina Faso,

00:05:38.608 --> 00:05:40.542
so with simple ventilation,

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:42.592
I wanted to make the classroom

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.201
good for teaching and learning.

00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:48.046
And this is the project today,

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:51.680
12 years old, still in best condition.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.252
And the kids, they love it.

00:05:57.936 --> 00:06:00.791
And for me and my community,

00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:04.446
this project was a huge success.

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:07.348
It has opened up opportunities

00:06:07.348 --> 00:06:09.939
to do more projects in Gando.

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.877
So I could do a lot of projects,

00:06:12.877 --> 00:06:15.201
and here I am going to share with you

00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.381
only three of them.

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:21.177
The first one is the school extension, of course.

00:06:21.177 --> 00:06:24.492
How do you explain drawings and engineering

00:06:24.492 --> 00:06:28.144
to people who are neither able to read nor write?

00:06:28.144 --> 00:06:31.091
I started to build a prototype like that.

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:34.077
The innovation was to build a clay vault.

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:37.408
So then, I jumped on the top like that,

00:06:37.408 --> 00:06:39.720
with my team, and it works.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.947
The community is looking. It still works.

00:06:41.947 --> 00:06:44.805
So we can build. (Laughter)

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:48.688
And we kept building, and that is the result.

00:06:48.688 --> 00:06:52.322
The kids are happy, and they love it.

00:06:52.322 --> 00:06:56.483
The community is very proud. We made it.

00:06:56.483 --> 00:07:00.624
And even animals, like these donkeys,

00:07:00.624 --> 00:07:02.384
love our buildings.

00:07:02.384 --> 00:07:06.031
(Laughter)

00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:10.698
The next project is the library in Gando.

00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:14.361
And see now, we tried to introduce

00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:16.876
different ideas in our buildings,

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:20.707
but we often don't have so much material.

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:24.110
Something we have in Gando are clay pots.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.431
We wanted to use them to create openings.

00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:29.541
So we just bring them like you can see

00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.967
to the building site.

00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:34.133
we start cutting them,

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:37.064
and then we place them on top of the roof

00:07:37.064 --> 00:07:39.643
before we pour the concrete,

00:07:39.643 --> 00:07:41.654
and you have this result.

00:07:41.654 --> 00:07:44.564
The openings are letting the hot air out

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.403
and light in.

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:48.476
Very simple.

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:51.314
My most recent project in Gando

00:07:51.314 --> 00:07:53.332
is a high school project.

00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:55.265
I would like to share with you this.

00:07:55.265 --> 00:07:57.510
The innovation in this project

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.253
is to cast mud like you cast concrete.

00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:04.378
How do you cast mud?

00:08:04.378 --> 00:08:07.644
We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see,

00:08:07.644 --> 00:08:09.767
and when everything is ready,

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:11.904
when you know what is the best recipe

00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:13.098
and the best form,

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:15.749
you start working with the community.

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:17.895
And sometimes I can leave.

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:19.654
They will do it themselves.

00:08:19.654 --> 00:08:23.206
I came to speak to you like that.

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:25.897
Another factor in Gando is rain.

00:08:25.897 --> 00:08:27.721
When the rains come,

00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:30.009
we hurry up to protect our fragile walls

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:33.061
against the rain.

00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:36.573
Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

00:08:36.573 --> 00:08:39.138
It is simply how we protect our walls.

00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:40.607
(Laughter)

00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:43.485
The rain in Burkina comes very fast,

00:08:43.485 --> 00:08:46.050
and after that, you have floods

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.995
everywhere in the country.

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:52.045
But for us, the rain is good.

00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:55.950
It brings sand and gravel to the river

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.221
we need to use to build.

00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:00.122
We just wait for the rain to go.

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:03.716
We take the sand, we mix it with clay,

00:09:03.716 --> 00:09:06.502
and we keep building.

00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:08.307
That is it.

00:09:08.307 --> 00:09:11.401
The Gando project was always
connected to training the people,

00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.893
because I just wanted, one day

00:09:14.893 --> 00:09:17.796
when I fall down and die,

00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:20.480
that at least one person from Gando

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.222
keeps doing this work.

00:09:24.222 --> 00:09:27.065
But you will be surprised. I'm still alive.

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:28.615
(Laughter)

00:09:28.615 --> 00:09:31.792
And my people now can use their skills

00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:34.969
to earn money themselves.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.793
Usually, for a young man from Gando to earn money,

00:09:40.793 --> 00:09:42.889
you have to leave the country

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:46.132
to the city, sometimes leave the country

00:09:46.132 --> 00:09:48.124
and some never come back,

00:09:48.124 --> 00:09:51.568
making the community weaker.

00:09:51.568 --> 00:09:55.245
But now they can stay in the country

00:09:55.245 --> 00:09:57.437
and work on different building sites

00:09:57.437 --> 00:09:59.324
and earn money to feed their family.

00:09:59.324 --> 00:10:02.480
There's a new quality in this work.

00:10:04.278 --> 00:10:06.474
Yes, you know it.

00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:11.128
I have won a lot of awards through this work.

00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:14.809
For sure, it has opened opportunities.

00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:17.201
I have become myself known.

00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:22.091
But the reason why I do what I do

00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:25.566
is my community.

00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:27.680
When I was a kid,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.463
I was going to school,

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:33.494
I was coming back every holiday to Gando.

00:10:33.494 --> 00:10:35.637
By the end of every holidays,

00:10:35.637 --> 00:10:38.681
I had to say goodbye to the community,

00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:42.427
going from one compound to another one.

00:10:42.427 --> 00:10:47.658
All women in Gando will open their clothes like that

00:10:47.658 --> 00:10:51.593
and give me the last penny.

00:10:51.593 --> 00:10:56.714
In my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection.

00:10:56.714 --> 00:10:59.897
As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed.

00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:02.487
I just asked my mother one day,

00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:05.230
"Why do all these women love me so much?"

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.979
(Laughter)

00:11:06.979 --> 00:11:09.314
She just answered,

00:11:09.314 --> 00:11:13.095
"They are contributing to pay for your education

00:11:13.095 --> 00:11:16.440
hoping that you will be successful

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.538
and one day come back and help

00:11:19.538 --> 00:11:23.570
improve the quality of life of the community."

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.448
I hope now that I was able
to make my community proud

00:11:28.448 --> 00:11:30.321
through this work,

00:11:30.321 --> 00:11:34.133
and I hope I was able to prove you the power

00:11:34.133 --> 00:11:35.772
of community,

00:11:35.772 --> 00:11:39.499
and to show you that architecture

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:44.188
can be inspiring for communities

00:11:44.188 --> 00:11:46.441
to shape their own future.

00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:48.828
Merci beaucoup. (Applause)
