00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.576
So how many of you have ever
been in a cave before?

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:04.987
Okay, a few of you.

00:00:04.987 --> 00:00:06.619
When you think of a cave, most of you think

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:08.780
of a tunnel going through solid rock,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.711
and in fact, that's how most caves are.

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.094
Around this half of the country,

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:14.100
most of your caves are made of limestone.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.048
Back where I'm from, most of our 
caves are made of lava rock,

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:18.881
because we have a lot of volcanoes out there.

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.931
But the caves I want to share 
with you today are made

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:24.044
completely of ice, specifically glacier ice

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:26.042
that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:29.125
in the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.188
Now Mount Hood's only 
one hour's drive from Portland,

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:33.911
the largest city in Oregon,

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:36.140
where over two million people live.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.387
Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:39.944
is to find a new cave

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:42.157
and be the first human to ever go into it.

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:44.124
The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer

00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:46.555
is to be the first one to make a map of a cave.

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:48.763
Now these days, with so many people hiking around,

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:50.688
it's pretty hard to find a new cave,

00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:52.218
so you can imagine how excited we were

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.989
to find three new caves

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.025
within sight of Oregon's largest city

00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:58.071
and realize that they had never been explored

00:00:58.071 --> 00:00:59.402
or mapped before.

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:00.598
It was kind of like being an astronaut,

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:03.285
because we were getting to
see things and go places

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:06.569
that no one had ever seen or gone to before.

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:08.303
So what is a glacier?

00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:10.216
Well, those of you who have
ever seen or touched snow,

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:11.499
you know that it's really light,

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:15.220
because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals
clumped together, and it's mostly air.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.630
If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.828
it gets really small, hard and dense.

00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:21.580
Well, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.361
over 20 feet a year,

00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.304
it crushes the air out of it

00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:28.485
and gradually forms it into hard blue ice.

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:31.445
Now each year, more and more ice
stacks up on top of it,

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:33.357
and eventually it gets so heavy

00:01:33.357 --> 00:01:35.143
that it starts to slide down the mountain

00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:36.581
under its own weight,

00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:38.879
forming a slow-moving river of ice.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:41.224
When ice packed like that starts to move,

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:43.334
we call it a glacier, and we give it a name.

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:45.154
The name of the glacier these caves are formed in

00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:46.830
is the Sandy Glacier.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.283
Now each year, as new snow lands on the glacier,

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:51.950
it melts in the summer sun,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.809
and it forms little rivers of water
on the flow along the ice,

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:57.686
and they start to melt and bore
their way down through the glacier,

00:01:57.686 --> 00:01:59.614
forming big networks of caves,

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:02.919
sometimes going all the way down
to the underlying bedrock.

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:04.991
Now the crazy thing about glacier caves

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:08.098
is that each year, new tunnels form.

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:10.091
Different waterfalls pop up or move around

00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.223
from place to place inside the cave.

00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:14.068
Warm water from the top of the ice

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:15.545
is boring its way down,

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:17.485
and warm air from below the mountain

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:19.926
actually rises up, gets into the cave,

00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:22.469
and melts the ceilings back taller and taller.

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.596
But the weirdest thing about glacier caves

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:26.702
is that the entire cave is moving,

00:02:26.702 --> 00:02:28.582
because it's formed inside a block of ice

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.273
the size of a small city

00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:32.670
that's slowly sliding down the mountain.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.497
Now this is Brent McGregor,

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:36.469
my cave exploration partner.

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.084
He and I have both been exploring caves a long time

00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:41.052
and we've been climbing mountains a long time,

00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:44.132
but neither one of us had ever really
explored a glacier cave before.

00:02:44.132 --> 00:02:47.177
Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video

00:02:47.177 --> 00:02:50.804
of a couple of hikers that stumbled across
the entrance to one of these caves.

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:52.824
There were no GPS coordinates for it,

00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:54.367
and all we knew was that it was somewhere

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:56.047
out on the Sandy Glacier.

00:02:56.047 --> 00:02:58.646
So in July of that year, we went out on the glacier,

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.624
and we found a big crack in the ice.

00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:02.825
We had to build snow and ice anchors

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:06.017
so that we could tie off ropes
and rappel down into the hole.

00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:08.753
This is me looking into the entrance crevasse.

00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:11.304
At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:12.795
going right up the mountain

00:03:12.795 --> 00:03:15.328
underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.732
We followed this cave back for about a half mile

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.371
until it came to an end,

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:21.497
and then with the help of our survey tools

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:23.565
we made a three-dimensional map of the cave

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:25.088
on our way back out.

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:27.146
So how do you map a cave?

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:29.874
Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:33.098
because they have pits and holes 
going to overlapping levels.

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:34.702
To make a cave map, you have to set up

00:03:34.702 --> 00:03:37.597
survey stations every few feet inside the cave,

00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:40.888
and you use a laser to measure
the distance between those stations.

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.327
Then you use a compass and an inclinometer

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:45.263
to measure the direction the cave is headed

00:03:45.263 --> 00:03:47.979
and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.709
Now those of you taking trigonometry,

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.820
that particular type of math is very useful

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.353
for making maps like this

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:55.598
because it allows you to measure
heights and distances

00:03:55.598 --> 00:03:57.503
without actually having to go there.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.882
In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,

00:03:59.882 --> 00:04:01.913
the more useful I found all that math

00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:04.155
that I originally hated in school to be.

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:06.028
So when you're done surveying,

00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:08.455
you take all this data and
you punch it into a computer

00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:11.075
and you find someone that can draw really well,

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:12.723
and you have them draft up a map

00:04:12.723 --> 00:04:14.276
that looks something like this,

00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:17.544
and it'll show you both a
bird's-eye view of the passage

00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:19.994
as well as a profile view of the passage,

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:21.714
kind of like an ant farm view.

00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:23.713
We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:26.761
because it was like a big dragon
sleeping under the snow.

00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:29.273
Now later this summer, as more
snow melted off the glacier,

00:04:29.273 --> 00:04:32.940
we found more caves, and we realized
they were all connected.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.099
Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon,

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.119
Brent discovered this new cave not very far away.

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:40.258
The inside of it was coated with ice,

00:04:40.258 --> 00:04:43.185
so we had to wear big spikes
on our feet called crampons

00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:45.489
so we could walk around without slipping.

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:47.350
This cave was amazing.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.606
The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green

00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:51.344
because the sunlight from far above

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:54.319
was shining through the ice and lighting it all up.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.227
And we couldn't understand why this cave

00:04:56.227 --> 00:04:57.873
was so much colder than Snow Dragon

00:04:57.873 --> 00:05:00.782
until we got to the end and we found out why.

00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:03.700
There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.335
going 130 feet straight up
to the surface of the glacier.

00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:09.146
Cold air from the top of the mountain

00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:11.960
was flowing down this hole
and blasting through the cave,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.043
freezing everything inside of it.

00:05:14.043 --> 00:05:16.254
And we were so excited about finding this new pit,

00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:18.562
we actually came back in January the following year

00:05:18.562 --> 00:05:21.357
so we could be the first ones to explore it.

00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:22.782
It was so cold outside,

00:05:22.782 --> 00:05:25.040
we actually had to sleep inside the cave.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.768
There's our camp on the left side 
of this entrance room.

00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:31.377
The next morning, we climbed out of the cave

00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:33.386
and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier,

00:05:33.386 --> 00:05:35.614
where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit

00:05:35.614 --> 00:05:37.381
for the very first time.

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:39.468
Brent named this cave Pure Imagination,

00:05:39.468 --> 00:05:41.485
I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there

00:05:41.485 --> 00:05:44.067
were beyond what we could have ever imagined.

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:47.230
So besides really cool ice,
what else is inside these caves?

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.816
Well not too much lives in them 
because they're so cold

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.826
and the entrance is actually covered up with snow

00:05:51.826 --> 00:05:53.535
for about eight months of the year.

00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:55.471
But there are some really cool things in there.

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.834
There's weird bacteria living in the water

00:05:57.834 --> 00:06:00.098
that actually eat and digest rocks

00:06:00.098 --> 00:06:01.452
to make their own food

00:06:01.452 --> 00:06:03.168
to live under this ice.

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:05.270
In fact, this past summer, scientists collected

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.100
samples of water and ice

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.035
specifically to see if things called extremophiles,

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:13.874
tiny lifeforms that are evolved
to live in completely hostile conditions,

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:15.310
might be living under the ice,

00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:18.989
kind of like what they hope to find
on the polar icecaps of Mars someday.

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:20.450
Another really cool things is that,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.706
as seeds and birds land on
the surface of the glacier and die,

00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:25.350
they get buried in the snow

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.140
and gradually become part of the glacier,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.514
sinking deeper and deeper into the ice.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.757
As these caves form and melt 
their way up into the ice,

00:06:32.757 --> 00:06:35.206
they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:37.935
and fall onto the cave floor,
where we end up finding them.

00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:40.961
For example, this is a noble fir seed we found.

00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:43.186
It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years,

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:45.895
and it's just now starting to sprout.

00:06:45.895 --> 00:06:47.590
This mallard duck feather

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.911
was found over 1,800 feet
in the back of Snow Dragon Cave.

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.869
This duck died on the surface
of the glacier long, long ago,

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:57.324
and its feathers have finally made it
down through over 100 feet of ice

00:06:57.324 --> 00:06:59.508
before falling inside the cave.

00:06:59.508 --> 00:07:01.040
And this beautiful quartz crystal

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.165
was also found in the back of Snow Dragon.

00:07:03.165 --> 00:07:05.437
Even now, Brent and I find it hard to believe

00:07:05.437 --> 00:07:08.768
that all these discoveries were 
essentially in our own backyard,

00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:11.481
hidden away, just waiting to be found.

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:13.754
Like I said earlier, the idea of discovering

00:07:13.754 --> 00:07:15.161
in this busy world we live in

00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:18.061
kind of seems like something 
you can only do with space travel now,

00:07:18.061 --> 00:07:19.559
but that's not true.

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:21.837
Every year, new caves get discovered

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:23.602
that no one has ever been in before.

00:07:23.602 --> 00:07:25.849
So it's actually not too late for one of you

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:27.710
to become a discoverer yourself.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.571
You just have to be willing to look

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.207
and go where people don't often go

00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:34.185
and focus your eyes and your mind

00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:36.402
to recognize the discovery when you see it,

00:07:36.402 --> 00:07:38.733
because it might be in your own backyard.

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:40.587
Thank you very much.

00:07:40.587 --> 00:07:44.711
