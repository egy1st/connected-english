WEBVTT

00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:04.289
I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart,

00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:07.354
and so just before I get going,

00:00:07.354 --> 00:00:09.925
I wanted to tell you as a South African

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:12.909
that one of the men who has inspired me most

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.975
passed away a few hours ago.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:18.665
Nelson Mandela has come to the end

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:21.345
of his long walk to freedom.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:26.280
And so this talk is going to be for him.

00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:31.354
I grew up in wonder.

00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:35.469
I grew up amongst those animals.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.860
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.758
at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.

00:00:42.758 --> 00:00:45.530
It's a place where my family has been

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.725
in the safari business for four generations.

00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:51.962
Now for as long as I can remember,

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:56.699
my job has been to take people out into nature,

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.610
and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.430
to have the opportunity

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.311
to bring some of my experiences out in nature

00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:06.451
in to this gathering.

00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.330
Africa is a place

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.714
where people still sit under starlit skies

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:15.124
and around campfires and tell stories,

00:01:15.124 --> 00:01:17.815
and so what I have to share with you today

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:22.234
is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:25.372
stories about heroes of heart.

00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:27.492
Now my stories are not the stories

00:01:27.492 --> 00:01:29.190
that you'll hear on the news,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.163
and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:34.100
I also know it to be a place

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.366
where people, animals and ecosystems

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:42.753
teach us about a more interconnected world.

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:44.731
When I was nine years old,

00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:47.965
President Mandela came to stay with my family.

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:51.389
He had just been released from
his 27 years of incarceration,

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:54.016
and was in a period of readjustment

00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:56.675
to his sudden global icon status.

00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:59.175
Members of the African National Congress

00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:01.166
thought that in the bush

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.400
he would have time to rest and recuperate

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.161
away from the public eye,

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.540
and it's true that lions tend to be

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.771
a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.

00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:14.900
(Laughter)

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.446
But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:19.507
I would take him breakfast in bed,

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.875
and then, in an old track suit and slippers,

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.480
he would go for a walk around the garden.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.158
At night, I would sit with my family

00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:28.659
around the snowy, bunny-eared TV,

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.077
and watch images of that same

00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:33.011
quiet man from the garden

00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:36.061
surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:39.320
as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.272
He was bringing peace

00:02:41.272 --> 00:02:44.154
to a divided and violent South Africa,

00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:49.383
one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.

00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:52.147
Mandela said often that the gift of prison

00:02:52.147 --> 00:02:55.107
was the ability to go within and to think,

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.836
to create in himself

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:59.715
the things he most wanted for South Africa:

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:03.060
peace, reconciliation, harmony.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.915
Through this act of immense open-heartedness,

00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:08.147
he was to become the embodiment

00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:11.686
of what in South Africa we call "ubuntu."

00:03:11.686 --> 00:03:14.535
Ubuntu: I am because of you.

00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:17.198
Or, people are not people

00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:19.923
without other people.

00:03:19.923 --> 00:03:21.769
It's not a new idea or value

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.624
but it's one that I certainly think at these times

00:03:23.624 --> 00:03:25.373
is worth building on.

00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:28.537
In fact, it is said that in the
collective consciousness of Africa,

00:03:28.537 --> 00:03:30.576
we get to experience the deepest parts

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.881
of our own humanity

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:34.665
through our interactions with others.

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:36.777
Ubuntu is at play right now.

00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:38.777
You are holding a space for me

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:42.169
to express the deepest truth of who I am.

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.429
Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.507
and I spent a lot of time last week doing that,

00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:50.830
and it's not the same as this.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.256
(Laughter)

00:03:53.256 --> 00:03:56.704
If Mandela was the national
and international embodiment,

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.298
then the man who taught me the most

00:03:58.298 --> 00:04:00.901
about this value personally was this man,

00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:02.259
Solly Mhlongo.

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.067
Solly was born under a tree

00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:06.853
60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:08.353
He would never have a lot of money,

00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:09.775
but he was to be

00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:12.404
one of the richest men I would ever meet.

00:04:12.404 --> 00:04:15.123
Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle.

00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:19.305
Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is
about people who grow up looking after cattle,

00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:22.327
but it makes for über-resourcefulness.

00:04:22.327 --> 00:04:24.801
The first job that he ever got in the safari business

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.017
was fixing the safari trucks.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.671
Where he had learned to do that out in the bush

00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:31.800
I have no idea, but he could do it.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.727
He then moved across into what we called

00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:35.114
the habitat team.

00:04:35.114 --> 00:04:37.000
These were the people on the reserve

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.357
who were responsible for its well-being.

00:04:39.357 --> 00:04:41.641
He fixed roads, he mended wetlands,

00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:43.459
he did some anti-poaching.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:45.585
And then one day we were out together,

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:49.116
and he came across the tracks of where
a female leopard had walked.

00:04:49.116 --> 00:04:50.890
And it was an old track,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.331
but for fun he turned and he began to follow it,

00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:54.906
and I tell you, I could tell by the speed

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:56.603
at which he moved on those pad marks

00:04:56.603 --> 00:05:00.577
that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.

00:05:00.577 --> 00:05:02.351
If you drove past Solly

00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:04.029
somewhere out on the reserve,

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.678
you look up in your rearview mirror,

00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:07.523
you'd see he'd stopped the car

00:05:07.523 --> 00:05:09.569
20, 50 meters down the road

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.582
just in case you need help with something.

00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:15.335
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:16.730
was when one of our clients said,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.947
"Solly, you are pathologically helpful."

00:05:19.947 --> 00:05:22.394
(Laughter)

00:05:22.394 --> 00:05:25.285
When I started professionally guiding people

00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:26.942
out into this environment,

00:05:26.942 --> 00:05:28.502
Solly was my tracker.

00:05:28.502 --> 00:05:30.321
We worked together as a team.

00:05:30.321 --> 00:05:32.347
And the first guests we ever got

00:05:32.347 --> 00:05:35.194
were a philanthropy group from your East Coast,

00:05:35.194 --> 00:05:37.548
and they said to Solly, on the side, they said,

00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:40.189
"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.251
we want to see where you live."

00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:43.716
So we took them up to his house,

00:05:43.716 --> 00:05:46.588
and this visit of the philanthropist to his house

00:05:46.588 --> 00:05:49.269
coincided with a time when Solly's wife,

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:50.869
who was learning English,

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:53.053
was going through a phase
where she would open the door

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:55.717
by saying, "Hello, I love you.

00:05:55.717 --> 00:05:57.932
Welcome, I love you." (Laughter)

00:05:57.932 --> 00:06:00.481
And there was something so beautifully African

00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:02.326
about it to me, this small house

00:06:02.326 --> 00:06:04.911
with a huge heart in it.

00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:11.486
Now on the day that Solly saved my life,

00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:13.497
he was already my hero.

00:06:13.497 --> 00:06:15.078
It was a hot day,

00:06:15.078 --> 00:06:17.052
and we found ourselves down by the river.

00:06:17.052 --> 00:06:19.888
Because of the heat, I took my shoes off,

00:06:19.888 --> 00:06:21.591
and I rolled up my pants,

00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.832
and I walked into the water.

00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:25.394
Solly remained on the bank.

00:06:25.394 --> 00:06:28.417
The water was clear running over sand,

00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:31.731
and we turned and we began
to make our way upstream.

00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.551
And a few meters ahead of us,

00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:36.536
there was a place where a tree
had fallen out of the bank,

00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:39.307
and its branches were touching the water,

00:06:39.307 --> 00:06:40.904
and it was shadowy.

00:06:40.904 --> 00:06:43.362
And if had been a horror movie,

00:06:43.362 --> 00:06:45.598
people in the audience would have started saying,

00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:49.051
"Don't go in there. Don't go in there." (Laughter)

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:52.808
And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:54.923
Now the first thing that you notice
when a crocodile hits you

00:06:54.923 --> 00:06:56.523
is the ferocity of the bite.

00:06:56.523 --> 00:06:58.496
Wham! It hits me by my right leg.

00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:02.399
It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up.
I'm able to grab a branch.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.137
It's shaking me violently.

00:07:04.137 --> 00:07:05.851
It's a very strange sensation

00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:07.797
having another creature try and eat you,

00:07:07.797 --> 00:07:11.248
and there are few things that
promote vegetarianism like that.

00:07:11.248 --> 00:07:12.843
(Laughter)

00:07:12.843 --> 00:07:15.128
Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.

00:07:15.128 --> 00:07:17.175
He turns. He begins to make his way to me.

00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:19.126
The croc again continues to shake me.

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:21.043
It goes to bite me a second time.

00:07:21.043 --> 00:07:23.232
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me

00:07:23.232 --> 00:07:24.836
that gets washed downstream.

00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:27.009
As it bites the second time, I kick.

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:29.742
My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.

00:07:29.742 --> 00:07:31.873
I pull myself up into the branches,

00:07:31.873 --> 00:07:35.356
and as I come out of the water,
I look over my shoulder.

00:07:35.356 --> 00:07:37.276
My leg from the knee down

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:39.204
is mangled beyond description.

00:07:39.204 --> 00:07:40.599
The bone is cracked.

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.429
The meat is torn up.

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:47.029
I make an instant decision that
I'll never look at that again.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.413
As I come out of the water,

00:07:49.413 --> 00:07:52.030
Solly arrives at a deep section,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.655
a channel between us.

00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:55.793
He knows, he sees the state of my leg,

00:07:55.793 --> 00:07:57.639
he knows that between him and I

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:58.851
there is a crocodile,

00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:01.343
and I can tell you this man doesn't
slow down for one second.

00:08:01.343 --> 00:08:03.149
He comes straight into the channel.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.084
He wades in to above his waist.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:06.547
He gets to me. He grabs me.

00:08:06.547 --> 00:08:08.219
I'm still in a vulnerable position.

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:09.944
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder.

00:08:09.944 --> 00:08:12.363
This is the other thing about Solly,
he's freakishly strong.

00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:14.826
He turns. He walks me up the bank.

00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:16.880
He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.664
He wraps it around my leg,

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.955
picks me up a second time,

00:08:19.955 --> 00:08:21.861
walks me to a vehicle,

00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:25.285
and he's able to get me to medical attention.

00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:28.508
And I survive.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:32.769
Now — (Applause)

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:35.479
Now I don't know how many people you know

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:37.695
that go into a deep channel of water

00:08:37.695 --> 00:08:39.955
that they know has a crocodile in it

00:08:39.955 --> 00:08:41.298
to come and help you,

00:08:41.298 --> 00:08:44.742
but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.

00:08:44.742 --> 00:08:47.198
And he is one amazing example

00:08:47.198 --> 00:08:50.643
of what I have experienced all over Africa.

00:08:50.643 --> 00:08:52.774
In a more collective society,

00:08:52.774 --> 00:08:55.622
we realize from the inside

00:08:55.622 --> 00:08:58.755
that our own well-being is deeply tied

00:08:58.755 --> 00:09:01.993
to the well-being of others.

00:09:01.993 --> 00:09:05.262
Danger is shared. Pain is shared.

00:09:05.262 --> 00:09:08.187
Joy is shared. Achievement is shared.

00:09:08.187 --> 00:09:12.717
Houses are shared. Food is shared.

00:09:12.717 --> 00:09:15.913
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts

00:09:15.913 --> 00:09:17.327
and to share,

00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:19.279
and what Solly taught me that day

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.282
is the essence of this value,

00:09:21.282 --> 00:09:24.040
his animated, empathetic action

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.085
in every moment.

00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:29.592
Now although the root word is about people,

00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:32.966
I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.

00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:36.240
And then I met this young lady.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.934
Her name was Elvis.

00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:39.705
In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis

00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:42.562
because he said she walked like she was doing

00:09:42.562 --> 00:09:45.227
the Elvis the pelvis dance.

00:09:45.227 --> 00:09:49.593
She was born with very badly
deformed back legs and pelvis.

00:09:49.593 --> 00:09:51.857
She arrived at our reserve from a reserve

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.913
east of us on her migratory route.

00:09:53.913 --> 00:09:55.692
When I first saw her,

00:09:55.692 --> 00:09:58.160
I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.088
And yet, for the next five years

00:10:01.088 --> 00:10:03.618
she returned in the winter months.

00:10:03.618 --> 00:10:05.995
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush

00:10:05.995 --> 00:10:08.391
and to come across this unusual track.

00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:09.886
It looked like an inverted bracket,

00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:12.335
and we would drop whatever
we were doing and we would follow,

00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:14.006
and then we would come around the corner,

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:16.092
and there she would be with her herd.

00:10:16.092 --> 00:10:18.987
And that outpouring of emotion

00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:20.701
from people on our safari trucks

00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:23.943
as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.

00:10:23.943 --> 00:10:25.428
And it reminded me

00:10:25.428 --> 00:10:27.359
that even people who grow up in cities

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:30.944
feel a natural connection

00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:33.215
with the natural world and with animals.

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:36.799
And yet still I remained amazed
that she was surviving.

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:39.760
And then one day we came across
them at this small water hole.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.612
It was sort of a hollow in the ground.

00:10:41.612 --> 00:10:44.066
And I watched as the matriarch drank,

00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:47.340
and then she turned in that 
beautiful slow motion of elephants,

00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:49.110
looks like the arm in motion,

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.116
and she began to make her way up the steep bank.

00:10:52.116 --> 00:10:56.760
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.544
And I watched young Elvis

00:10:58.544 --> 00:11:01.900
begin to psych herself up for the hill.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.255
She got visibly -- ears came forward,

00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:07.404
she had a full go of it and halfway up,

00:11:07.404 --> 00:11:09.681
her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.

00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:11.500
She attempted it a second time,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.675
and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.532
And on the third attempt,

00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:18.989
an amazing thing happened.

00:11:18.989 --> 00:11:20.726
Halfway up the bank,

00:11:20.726 --> 00:11:23.799
a young teenage elephant came in behind her,

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:26.002
and he propped his trunk underneath her,

00:11:26.002 --> 00:11:29.339
and he began to shovel her up the bank.

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:30.727
And it occurred to me

00:11:30.727 --> 00:11:32.283
that the rest of the herd

00:11:32.283 --> 00:11:34.958
was in fact looking after this young elephant.

00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.482
The next day I watched again

00:11:37.482 --> 00:11:39.652
as the matriarch broke a branch

00:11:39.652 --> 00:11:41.493
and she would put it in her mouth,

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.450
and then she would break a second one

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.157
and drop it on the ground.

00:11:46.157 --> 00:11:48.529
And a consensus developed between all of us

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.378
who were guiding people in that area

00:11:50.378 --> 00:11:53.527
that that herd was in fact moving slower

00:11:53.527 --> 00:11:57.583
to accommodate that elephant.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.674
What Elvis and the herd taught me

00:11:59.674 --> 00:12:02.998
caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,

00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:05.614
and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,

00:12:05.614 --> 00:12:07.825
we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves

00:12:07.825 --> 00:12:09.582
reflected back at us.

00:12:09.582 --> 00:12:13.222
And it is not only through other people

00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:16.142
that we get to experience our humanity

00:12:16.142 --> 00:12:20.068
but through all the creatures that live on this planet.

00:12:20.068 --> 00:12:22.882
If Africa has a gift to share,

00:12:22.882 --> 00:12:26.709
it's a gift of a more collective society.

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:30.957
And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,

00:12:30.957 --> 00:12:35.368
what I see is the essence of that value

00:12:35.368 --> 00:12:37.730
being invented here.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.845
Thank you.

00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:44.698
(Applause)

00:13:04.082 --> 00:13:05.879
Pat Mitchell: So Boyd,

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:10.920
we know that you knew President Mandela

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.897
from early childhood

00:13:12.897 --> 00:13:15.796
and that you heard the news as we all did today,

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:18.236
and deeply distraught

00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:22.667
and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:24.749
But I just wondered if you wanted

00:13:24.749 --> 00:13:26.640
to share any additional thoughts,

00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:28.729
because we know that you heard that news

00:13:28.729 --> 00:13:32.109
just before coming in to do this session.

00:13:32.109 --> 00:13:33.805
Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.

00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:36.988
I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.

00:13:36.988 --> 00:13:38.759
He was suffering.

00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:41.157
And so of course there's the mixed emotions.

00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:43.141
But I just think of so many occurrences

00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:45.548
like the time he went on the Oprah show

00:13:45.548 --> 00:13:48.404
and asked her what the show would be about.

00:13:48.404 --> 00:13:49.882
(Laughter)

00:13:49.882 --> 00:13:53.180
And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you."

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.928
I mean, that's just incredible humility.

00:13:55.928 --> 00:13:59.591
(Laughter)

00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:02.753
He was the father of our nation

00:14:02.753 --> 00:14:09.201
and we've got a road to walk in South Africa.

00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:12.611
And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.

00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:15.394
You know, he used to go to
a rugby match and we would win.

00:14:15.394 --> 00:14:18.855
Anywhere he went, things went well.

00:14:18.855 --> 00:14:21.236
But I think that magic will be with us,

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:24.797
and the important thing is that we carry

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:26.322
what he stood for.

00:14:26.322 --> 00:14:29.809
And so that's what I'm going to try and do,

00:14:29.809 --> 00:14:32.701
and that's what people all over 
South Africa are trying to do.

00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:34.927
PM: And that's what you've done today.
BV: Oh, thank you.

00:14:34.927 --> 00:14:38.066
PM: Thank you.
BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.

00:14:38.066 --> 00:14:42.288
(Applause)
