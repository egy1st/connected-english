00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:02.271
I have a question:

00:00:02.271 --> 00:00:05.648
Who here remembers when they first realized

00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:09.071
they were going to die?

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:11.573
I do. I was a young boy,

00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:14.628
and my grandfather had just died,

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:18.546
and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.180
trying to make sense of what had happened.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.815
What did it mean that he was dead?

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:26.599
Where had he gone?

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.021
It was like a hole in reality had opened up

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:32.156
and swallowed him.

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:34.958
But then the really shocking
question occurred to me:

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.448
If he could die, could it happen to me too?

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:41.747
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me?

00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:43.537
Would it open up beneath my bed

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:46.771
and swallow me as I slept?

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:50.959
Well, at some point, all children
become aware of death.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:52.864
It can happen in different ways, of course,

00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:54.697
and usually comes in stages.

00:00:54.697 --> 00:00:58.210
Our idea of death develops as we grow older.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.939
And if you reach back into the dark corners

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:02.636
of your memory,

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:05.639
you might remember something like what I felt

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:08.894
when my grandfather died and when I realized

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:10.844
it could happen to me too,

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:13.423
that sense that behind all of this

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:16.760
the void is waiting.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.037
And this development in childhood

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:21.858
reflects the development of our species.

00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:25.173
Just as there was a point in your development

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:28.699
as a child when your sense of self and of time

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:30.798
became sophisticated enough

00:01:30.798 --> 00:01:34.720
for you to realize you were mortal,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.426
so at some point in the evolution of our species,

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:41.441
some early human's sense of self and of time

00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:43.684
became sophisticated enough

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:46.799
for them to become the first human to realize,

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.232
"I'm going to die."

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:52.451
This is, if you like, our curse.

00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:56.494
It's the price we pay for being so damn clever.

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:58.593
We have to live in the knowledge

00:01:58.593 --> 00:02:01.254
that the worst thing that can possibly happen

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.878
one day surely will,

00:02:02.878 --> 00:02:04.384
the end of all our projects,

00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:07.848
our hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.

00:02:07.848 --> 00:02:11.029
We each live in the shadow of a personal

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.018
apocalypse.

00:02:13.018 --> 00:02:15.522
And that's frightening. It's terrifying.

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:17.982
And so we look for a way out.

00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:21.263
And in my case, as I was about five years old,

00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:24.258
this meant asking my mum.

00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:26.720
Now when I first started asking

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.501
what happens when we die,

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.593
the grown-ups around me at the time

00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:33.796
answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:36.783
and half-hearted Christianity,

00:02:36.783 --> 00:02:38.727
and the phrase I heard most often

00:02:38.727 --> 00:02:40.286
was that granddad was now

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:42.750
"up there looking down on us,"

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.715
and if I should die too, which
wouldn't happen of course,

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:48.511
then I too would go up there,

00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:50.561
which made death sound a lot like

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.215
an existential elevator.

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:56.333
Now this didn't sound very plausible.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:59.236
I used to watch a children's
news program at the time,

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:01.676
and this was the era of space exploration.

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:03.850
There were always rockets going up into the sky,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.546
up into space, going up there.

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:08.875
But none of the astronauts when they came back

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.107
ever mentioned having met my granddad

00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:14.566
or any other dead people.

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:15.869
But I was scared,

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.309
and the idea of taking the existential elevator

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:19.915
to see my granddad

00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:21.330
sounded a lot better than being swallowed

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.401
by the void while I slept.

00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.670
And so I believed it anyway,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.341
even though it didn't make much sense.

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:31.583
And this thought process that I went through

00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:34.114
as a child, and have been through many times since,

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.024
including as a grown-up,

00:03:36.024 --> 00:03:38.471
is a product of what psychologists call

00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.935
a bias.

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:43.209
Now a bias is a way in which we systematically

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.927
get things wrong,

00:03:44.927 --> 00:03:47.611
ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,

00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:51.200
distort reality, or see what we want to see,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.432
and the bias I'm talking about

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:54.870
works like this:

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.105
Confront someone with the fact

00:03:57.105 --> 00:03:58.652
that they are going to die

00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:01.685
and they will believe just about any story

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:03.543
that tells them it isn't true

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.957
and they can, instead, live forever,

00:04:05.957 --> 00:04:10.042
even if it means taking the existential elevator.

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:14.470
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.345
It has been demonstrated in over 400

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:19.026
empirical studies.

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:21.535
Now these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.

00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:23.470
They work like this.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.960
You take two groups of people

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.743
who are similar in all relevant respects,

00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:30.432
and you remind one group that they're going to die

00:04:30.432 --> 00:04:33.061
but not the other, then you compare their behavior.

00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:36.934
So you're observing how it biases behavior

00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:40.688
when people become aware of their mortality.

00:04:40.688 --> 00:04:43.600
And every time, you get the same result:

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.687
People who are made aware of their mortality

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:48.698
are more willing to believe stories

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:50.561
that tell them they can escape death

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.333
and live forever.

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.622
So here's an example: One recent study

00:04:54.622 --> 00:04:57.392
took two groups of agnostics,

00:04:57.392 --> 00:04:58.988
that is people who are undecided

00:04:58.988 --> 00:05:01.503
in their religious beliefs.

00:05:01.503 --> 00:05:05.087
Now, one group was asked to think about being dead.

00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:06.732
The other group was asked to think about

00:05:06.732 --> 00:05:08.565
being lonely.

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:11.381
They were then asked again
about their religious beliefs.

00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:14.245
Those who had been asked
to think about being dead

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:17.818
were afterwards twice as likely to express faith

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.478
in God and Jesus.

00:05:19.478 --> 00:05:21.256
Twice as likely.

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:23.964
Even though the before they
were all equally agnostic.

00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:25.725
But put the fear of death in them,

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:29.584
and they run to Jesus.

00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:33.096
Now, this shows that reminding people of death

00:05:33.111 --> 00:05:36.341
biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:38.366
and it works not just for religion,

00:05:38.366 --> 00:05:40.603
but for any kind of belief system

00:05:40.603 --> 00:05:44.063
that promises immortality in some form,

00:05:44.063 --> 00:05:45.868
whether it's becoming famous

00:05:45.868 --> 00:05:47.282
or having children

00:05:47.282 --> 00:05:48.629
or even nationalism,

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.902
which promises you can live
on as part of a greater whole.

00:05:51.902 --> 00:05:53.833
This is a bias that has shaped

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:57.172
the course of human history.

00:05:57.172 --> 00:05:59.439
Now, the theory behind this bias

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.176
in the over 400 studies

00:06:01.176 --> 00:06:03.305
is called terror management theory,

00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:05.655
and the idea is simple. It's just this.

00:06:05.655 --> 00:06:08.204
We develop our worldviews,

00:06:08.204 --> 00:06:10.361
that is, the stories we tell ourselves

00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:13.097
about the world and our place in it,

00:06:13.097 --> 00:06:15.379
in order to help us manage

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.293
the terror of death.

00:06:18.293 --> 00:06:20.092
And these immortality stories

00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:23.089
have thousands of different manifestations,

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:26.673
but I believe that behind the apparent diversity

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:29.372
there are actually just four basic forms

00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:32.883
that these immortality stories can take.

00:06:32.883 --> 00:06:34.688
And we can see them repeating themselves

00:06:34.688 --> 00:06:37.858
throughout history, just with slight variations

00:06:37.858 --> 00:06:40.623
to reflect the vocabulary of the day.

00:06:40.623 --> 00:06:43.131
Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four

00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:45.384
basic forms of immortality story,

00:06:45.384 --> 00:06:46.954
and I want to try to give you some sense

00:06:46.954 --> 00:06:49.267
of the way in which they're retold by each culture

00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:51.034
or generation

00:06:51.034 --> 00:06:53.206
using the vocabulary of their day.

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:55.845
Now, the first story is the simplest.

00:06:55.845 --> 00:06:57.998
We want to avoid death,

00:06:57.998 --> 00:07:00.423
and the dream of doing that in this body

00:07:00.423 --> 00:07:01.783
in this world forever

00:07:01.783 --> 00:07:05.074
is the first and simplest kind of immortality story,

00:07:05.074 --> 00:07:07.533
and it might at first sound implausible,

00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:11.514
but actually, almost every culture in human history

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.576
has had some myth or legend

00:07:13.576 --> 00:07:16.337
of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth

00:07:16.337 --> 00:07:19.316
or something that promises to keep us going

00:07:19.316 --> 00:07:22.453
forever.

00:07:22.453 --> 00:07:24.046
Ancient Egypt had such myths,

00:07:24.046 --> 00:07:26.414
ancient Babylon, ancient India.

00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:29.266
Throughout European history, we find them
in the work of the alchemists,

00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:32.060
and of course we still believe this today,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.623
only we tell this story using the vocabulary

00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:36.279
of science.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:37.885
So 100 years ago,

00:07:37.885 --> 00:07:39.704
hormones had just been discovered,

00:07:39.704 --> 00:07:41.356
and people hoped that hormone treatments

00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:44.055
were going to cure aging and disease,

00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:46.908
and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,

00:07:46.908 --> 00:07:49.203
genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.

00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:53.161
But the idea that science can cure death

00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:55.502
is just one more chapter in the story

00:07:55.502 --> 00:07:57.735
of the magical elixir,

00:07:57.735 --> 00:08:02.171
a story that is as old as civilization.

00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:04.951
But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.354
and staying alive forever

00:08:06.354 --> 00:08:08.155
is a risky strategy.

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:10.395
When we look back through history

00:08:10.395 --> 00:08:13.179
at all those who have sought an elixir in the past,

00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:15.008
the one thing they now have in common

00:08:15.008 --> 00:08:17.638
is that they're all dead.

00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:21.376
So we need a backup plan,
and exactly this kind of plan B

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:24.947
is what the second kind of immortality story offers,

00:08:24.947 --> 00:08:26.702
and that's resurrection.

00:08:26.702 --> 00:08:29.076
And it stays with the idea that I am this body,

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:31.051
I am this physical organism.

00:08:31.051 --> 00:08:33.219
It accepts that I'm going to have to die

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:34.593
but says, despite that,

00:08:34.593 --> 00:08:37.096
I can rise up and I can live again.

00:08:37.096 --> 00:08:39.714
In other words, I can do what Jesus did.

00:08:39.714 --> 00:08:41.759
Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:44.870
and then he rose up and lived again.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.989
And the idea that we can all be
resurrected to live again

00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:50.277
is orthodox believe, not just for Christians

00:08:50.277 --> 00:08:52.980
but also Jews and Muslims.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.144
But our desire to believe this story

00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:57.154
is so deeply embedded

00:08:57.154 --> 00:08:59.252
that we are reinventing it again

00:08:59.252 --> 00:09:00.744
for the scientific age,

00:09:00.744 --> 00:09:03.567
for example, with the idea of cryonics.

00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:05.157
That's the idea that when you die,

00:09:05.157 --> 00:09:07.156
you can have yourself frozen,

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:09.545
and then, at some point when technology

00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:10.756
has advanced enough,

00:09:10.756 --> 00:09:12.876
you can be thawed out and repaired and revived

00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:14.165
and so resurrected.

00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:17.013
And so some people believe an omnipotent god

00:09:17.013 --> 00:09:18.892
will resurrect them to live again,

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:23.035
and other people believe an 
omnipotent scientist will do it.

00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:25.749
But for others, the whole idea of resurrection,

00:09:25.749 --> 00:09:27.752
of climbing out of the grave,

00:09:27.752 --> 00:09:30.471
it's just too much like a bad zombie movie.

00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:33.262
They find the body too messy, too unreliable

00:09:33.262 --> 00:09:35.410
to guarantee eternal life,

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.501
and so they set their hopes on the third,

00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:40.618
more spiritual immortality story,

00:09:40.618 --> 00:09:42.954
the idea that we can leave our body behind

00:09:42.954 --> 00:09:45.251
and live on as a soul.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.240
Now, the majority of people on Earth

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.013
believe they have a soul,

00:09:49.013 --> 00:09:51.423
and the idea is central to many religions.

00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:53.737
But even though, in its current form,

00:09:53.737 --> 00:09:55.652
in its traditional form,

00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:57.815
the idea of the soul is still hugely popular,

00:09:57.815 --> 00:09:59.247
nonetheless we are again

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:01.471
reinventing it for the digital age,

00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:02.948
for example with the idea

00:10:02.948 --> 00:10:04.938
that you can leave your body behind

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.184
by uploading your mind, your essence,

00:10:07.184 --> 00:10:09.140
the real you, onto a computer,

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.752
and so live on as an avatar in the ether.

00:10:13.752 --> 00:10:15.775
But of course there are skeptics who say

00:10:15.775 --> 00:10:17.619
if we look at the evidence of science,

00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:19.263
particularly neuroscience,

00:10:19.263 --> 00:10:21.092
it suggests that your mind,

00:10:21.092 --> 00:10:22.672
your essence, the real you,

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:25.085
is very much dependent on a particular part

00:10:25.085 --> 00:10:27.306
of your body, that is, your brain.

00:10:27.306 --> 00:10:29.827
And such skeptics can find comfort

00:10:29.827 --> 00:10:32.085
in the fourth kind of immortality story,

00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:34.442
and that is legacy,

00:10:34.442 --> 00:10:35.922
the idea that you can live on

00:10:35.922 --> 00:10:38.173
through the echo you leave in the world,

00:10:38.173 --> 00:10:40.522
like the great Greek warrior Achilles,

00:10:40.522 --> 00:10:43.151
who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy

00:10:43.151 --> 00:10:46.204
so that he might win immortal fame.

00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:48.470
And the pursuit of fame is as widespread

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.611
and popular now as it ever was,

00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:52.190
and in our digital age,

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.718
it's even easier to achieve.

00:10:53.718 --> 00:10:56.042
You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:57.735
or a great king or hero.

00:10:57.735 --> 00:11:02.558
All you need is an Internet connection
and a funny cat. (Laughter)

00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:05.021
But some people prefer to leave a more tangible,

00:11:05.021 --> 00:11:07.865
biological legacy -- children, for example.

00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:10.141
Or they like, they hope, to live on

00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:11.858
as part of some greater whole,

00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:14.307
a nation or a family or a tribe,

00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:16.773
their gene pool.

00:11:16.773 --> 00:11:18.286
But again, there are skeptics

00:11:18.286 --> 00:11:19.999
who doubt whether legacy

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:21.974
really is immortality.

00:11:21.974 --> 00:11:24.051
Woody Allen, for example, who said,

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:26.547
"I don't want to live on in
the hearts of my countrymen.

00:11:26.547 --> 00:11:28.744
I want to live on in my apartment."

00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:30.511
So those are the four

00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:32.694
basic kinds of immortality stories,

00:11:32.694 --> 00:11:34.336
and I've tried to give just some sense

00:11:34.336 --> 00:11:36.629
of how they're retold by each generation

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.216
with just slight variations

00:11:38.216 --> 00:11:40.521
to fit the fashions of the day.

00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:44.010
And the fact that they recur in this way,

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.998
in such a similar form but
in such different belief systems,

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:48.576
suggests, I think,

00:11:48.576 --> 00:11:50.978
that we should be skeptical of the truth

00:11:50.978 --> 00:11:54.739
of any particular version of these stories.

00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:56.850
The fact that some people believe

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.515
an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again

00:11:59.515 --> 00:12:03.216
and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it

00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:06.254
suggests that neither are really believing this

00:12:06.254 --> 00:12:08.924
on the strength of the evidence.

00:12:08.924 --> 00:12:11.350
Rather, we believe these stories

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.333
because we are biased to believe them,

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.161
and we are biased to believe them

00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:19.431
because we are so afraid of death.

00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:21.486
So the question is,

00:12:21.486 --> 00:12:24.958
are we doomed to lead the one life we have

00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.651
in a way that is shaped by fear and denial,

00:12:28.651 --> 00:12:31.726
or can we overcome this bias?

00:12:31.726 --> 00:12:34.193
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus

00:12:34.193 --> 00:12:35.921
thought we could.

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:39.469
He argued that the fear of death is natural,

00:12:39.469 --> 00:12:41.884
but it is not rational.

00:12:41.884 --> 00:12:44.542
"Death," he said, "is nothing to us,

00:12:44.542 --> 00:12:47.392
because when we are here, death is not,

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:51.145
and when death is here, we are gone."

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.943
Now this is often quoted, but it's difficult

00:12:52.943 --> 00:12:55.265
to really grasp, to really internalize,

00:12:55.265 --> 00:12:57.428
because exactly this idea of being gone

00:12:57.428 --> 00:12:59.567
is so difficult to imagine.

00:12:59.567 --> 00:13:01.798
So 2,000 years later, another philosopher,

00:13:01.798 --> 00:13:05.255
Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:

00:13:05.255 --> 00:13:08.199
"Death is not an event in life:

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:11.841
We do not live to experience death.

00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:13.035
And so," he added,

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:15.970
"in this sense, life has no end."

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.146
So it was natural for me as a child

00:13:19.146 --> 00:13:21.513
to fear being swallowed by the void,

00:13:21.513 --> 00:13:23.392
but it wasn't rational,

00:13:23.392 --> 00:13:25.377
because being swallowed by the void

00:13:25.377 --> 00:13:27.455
is not something that any of us

00:13:27.455 --> 00:13:30.725
will ever live to experience.

00:13:30.725 --> 00:13:33.254
Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because

00:13:33.254 --> 00:13:36.213
the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,

00:13:36.213 --> 00:13:40.695
yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.825
and when we bring out into the open

00:13:42.825 --> 00:13:45.523
the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,

00:13:45.523 --> 00:13:47.374
then we can at least start

00:13:47.374 --> 00:13:50.008
to try to minimize the influence it has

00:13:50.008 --> 00:13:51.891
on our lives.

00:13:51.891 --> 00:13:54.709
Now, I find it helps to see life

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.553
as being like a book:

00:13:56.553 --> 00:13:59.021
Just as a book is bounded by its covers,

00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:00.298
by beginning and end,

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:04.036
so our lives are bounded by birth and death,

00:14:04.036 --> 00:14:07.551
and even though a book is
limited by beginning and end,

00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:09.687
it can encompass distant landscapes,

00:14:09.687 --> 00:14:12.917
exotic figures, fantastic adventures.

00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:16.266
And even though a book is
limited by beginning and end,

00:14:16.266 --> 00:14:18.089
the characters within it

00:14:18.089 --> 00:14:20.931
know no horizons.

00:14:20.931 --> 00:14:24.088
They only know the moments
that make up their story,

00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:27.028
even when the book is closed.

00:14:27.028 --> 00:14:29.164
And so the characters of a book

00:14:29.164 --> 00:14:32.646
are not afraid of reaching the last page.

00:14:32.646 --> 00:14:34.924
Long John Silver is not afraid of you

00:14:34.924 --> 00:14:37.759
finishing your copy of "Treasure Island."

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:39.459
And so it should be with us.

00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:41.603
Imagine the book of your life,

00:14:41.603 --> 00:14:44.387
its covers, its beginning and end,
and your birth and your death.

00:14:44.387 --> 00:14:46.564
You can only know the moments in between,

00:14:46.564 --> 00:14:48.499
the moments that make up your life.

00:14:48.499 --> 00:14:50.446
It makes no sense for you to fear

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.536
what is outside of those covers,

00:14:52.536 --> 00:14:54.006
whether before your birth

00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:55.982
or after your death.

00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.511
And you needn't worry how long the book is,

00:14:58.511 --> 00:15:01.984
or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:03.526
The only thing that matters

00:15:03.526 --> 00:15:07.024
is that you make it a good story.

00:15:07.024 --> 00:15:09.244
Thank you.

00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:13.429
(Applause)
