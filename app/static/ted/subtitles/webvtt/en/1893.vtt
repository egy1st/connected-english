00:00:01.057 --> 00:00:02.497
Einstein said that

00:00:02.497 --> 00:00:05.954
"I never think about the future —
it comes soon enough."

00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:07.655
And he was right, of course.

00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:10.199
So today, I'm here to ask you to think of

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.059
how the future is happening now.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.822
Over the past 200 years, the world has experienced

00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:17.752
two major waves of innovation.

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:19.981
First, the Industrial Revolution

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.502
brought us machines and factories, railways,

00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:24.832
electricity, air travel,

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:27.152
and our lives have never been the same.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.578
Then the Internet revolution

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:32.811
brought us computing power, data networks,

00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:35.146
unprecedented access

00:00:35.146 --> 00:00:37.499
to information and communication,

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:40.774
and our lives have never been the same.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.387
Now we are experiencing

00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:44.151
another metamorphic change:

00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:46.338
the industrial Internet.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:49.313
It brings together intelligent machines,

00:00:49.313 --> 00:00:50.853
advanced analytics,

00:00:50.853 --> 00:00:53.219
and the creativity of people at work.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.419
It's the marriage of minds and machines.

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:58.975
And our lives will never be the same.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.968
In my current role, I see up close

00:01:01.968 --> 00:01:04.801
how technology is beginning to transform

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.332
industrial sectors that play a huge role

00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:09.725
in our economy and in our lives:

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:14.412
energy, aviation, transportation, health care.

00:01:14.412 --> 00:01:16.703
For an economist, this is highly unusual,

00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:18.242
and it's extremely exciting,

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:20.131
because this is a transformation

00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.153
as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more,

00:01:24.153 --> 00:01:25.612
and before the Industrial Revolution,

00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:28.562
there was no economic growth to speak of.

00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:31.917
So what is this industrial Internet?

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:33.780
Industrial machines are being equipped

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.040
with a growing number of electronic sensors

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.489
that allow them to see, hear, feel

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:41.195
a lot more than ever before,

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:44.266
generating prodigious amounts of data.

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.233
Increasingly sophisticated analytics

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:48.074
then sift through the data,

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.830
providing insights that allow us

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.864
to operate the machines in entirely new ways,

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:55.770
a lot more efficiently.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.759
And not just individual machines,

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.544
but fleets of locomotives, airplanes,

00:02:00.544 --> 00:02:03.716
entire systems like power grids, hospitals.

00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:07.942
It is asset optimization and system optimization.

00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:09.952
Of course, electronic sensors

00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:11.657
have been around for some time,

00:02:11.657 --> 00:02:13.569
but something has changed:

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.420
a sharp decline in the cost of sensors

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.897
and, thanks to advances in cloud computing,

00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:21.913
a rapid decrease in the cost of storing

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:24.280
and processing data.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.990
So we are moving to a world

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.783
where the machines we work with

00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:32.024
are not just intelligent; they are brilliant.

00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:34.782
They are self-aware, they are predictive,

00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:38.141
reactive and social.

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:42.099
It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines,

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.880
medical devices, communicating seamlessly

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.205
with each other and with us.

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:49.209
It's a world where information itself

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.396
becomes intelligent and comes to us

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:53.325
automatically when we need it

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:56.523
without having to look for it.

00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:58.050
We are beginning to deploy

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.505
throughout the industrial system

00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:02.550
embedded virtualization,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.752
multi-core processor technology,

00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:08.192
advanced cloud-based communications,

00:03:08.192 --> 00:03:10.934
a new software-defined machine infrastructure

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:13.678
which allows machine functionality

00:03:13.678 --> 00:03:16.252
to become virtualized in software,

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:19.414
decoupling machine software from hardware,

00:03:19.414 --> 00:03:23.021
and allowing us to remotely and automatically

00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:28.345
monitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets.

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:31.479
Why does any of this matter at all?

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.950
Well first of all, it's already allowing us

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.151
to shift towards preventive,

00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.029
condition-based maintenance,

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.991
which means fixing machines

00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:42.279
just before they break,

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.295
without wasting time

00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:46.623
servicing them on a fixed schedule.

00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:50.260
And this, in turn, is pushing us towards

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.115
zero unplanned downtime,

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:54.980
which means there will be no more power outages,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.020
no more flight delays.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.664
So let me give you a few examples

00:03:58.664 --> 00:04:00.543
of how these brilliant machines work,

00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:02.841
and some of the examples may seem trivial,

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.837
some are clearly more profound,

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:08.962
but all of them are going to
have a very powerful impact.

00:04:08.962 --> 00:04:10.916
Let's start with aviation.

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.184
Today, 10 percent of all flights

00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:15.302
cancellations and delays

00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:18.003
are due to unscheduled maintenance events.

00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:20.035
Something goes wrong unexpectedly.

00:04:20.035 --> 00:04:23.231
This results in eight billion dollars in costs

00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.643
for the airline industry globally every year,

00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:27.945
not to mention the impact on all of us:

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.030
stress, inconvenience,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.925
missed meetings as we sit helplessly

00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:34.834
in an airport terminal.

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:38.252
So how can the industrial Internet help here?

00:04:38.252 --> 00:04:40.887
We've developed a preventive maintenance system

00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:42.877
which can be installed on any aircraft.

00:04:42.877 --> 00:04:46.128
It's self-learning and able to predict issues

00:04:46.128 --> 00:04:49.084
that a human operator would miss.

00:04:49.084 --> 00:04:51.438
The aircraft, while in flight,

00:04:51.438 --> 00:04:53.788
will communicate with technicians on the ground.

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:55.748
By the time it lands, they will already know

00:04:55.748 --> 00:04:58.234
if anything needs to be serviced.

00:04:58.234 --> 00:05:01.850
Just in the U.S., a system like this can prevent

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.557
over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year,

00:05:05.557 --> 00:05:07.519
helping seven million passengers

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.055
get to their destinations on time.

00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:11.708
Or take healthcare.

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:13.439
Today, nurses spend an average

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.082
of 21 minutes per shift

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:17.775
looking for medical equipment.

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:22.158
That seems trivial, but it's less time spent

00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:24.867
caring for patients.

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:27.741
St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas,

00:05:27.741 --> 00:05:30.668
which has deployed industrial Internet technology

00:05:30.668 --> 00:05:32.733
to electronically monitor and connect

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.932
patients, staff and medical equipment,

00:05:35.932 --> 00:05:38.242
has reduced bed turnaround times

00:05:38.242 --> 00:05:39.977
by nearly one hour.

00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:42.787
If you need surgery, one hour matters.

00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:45.114
It means more patients can be treated,

00:05:45.114 --> 00:05:47.104
more lives can be saved.

00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:50.068
Another medical center, in Washington state,

00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:51.956
is piloting an application that allows

00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:55.049
medical images from city scanners and MRIs

00:05:55.049 --> 00:05:57.164
to be analyzed in the cloud,

00:05:57.164 --> 00:05:59.801
developing better analytics

00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:02.362
at a lower cost.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.986
Imagine a patient

00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:05.420
who has suffered a severe trauma,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.175
and needs the attention of several specialists:

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:09.984
a neurologist, a cardiologist,

00:06:09.984 --> 00:06:11.595
an orthopedic surgeon.

00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:14.921
If all of them can have instantaneous
and simultaneous access

00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:17.707
to scans and images as they are taken,

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:22.404
they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster.

00:06:22.405 --> 00:06:25.483
So all of this translates into better health outcomes,

00:06:25.483 --> 00:06:28.923
but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits.

00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:32.409
Just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:35.915
could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:38.712
to the healthcare industry worldwide,

00:06:38.712 --> 00:06:41.071
and that is just a drop in the sea

00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:43.807
compared to what we need to do to make healthcare

00:06:43.807 --> 00:06:46.228
affordable on a sustainable basis.

00:06:46.228 --> 00:06:48.486
Similar advances are happening in energy,

00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:50.956
including renewable energy.

00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:55.659
Wind farms equipped with new
remote monitorings and diagnostics

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:58.254
that allow wind turbines to talk to each other

00:06:58.254 --> 00:07:02.103
and adjust the pitch of their
blades in a coordinated way,

00:07:02.103 --> 00:07:04.222
depending on how the wind is blowing,

00:07:04.222 --> 00:07:06.198
can now produce electricity at a cost

00:07:06.198 --> 00:07:09.376
of less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.

00:07:09.376 --> 00:07:11.393
Ten years ago, that cost was 30 cents,

00:07:11.393 --> 00:07:13.345
six times as much.

00:07:13.345 --> 00:07:16.249
The list goes on, and it will grow fast,

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:18.950
because industrial data are
now growing exponentially.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.802
By 2020, they will account for over 50 percent

00:07:21.802 --> 00:07:24.030
of all digital information.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.209
But this is not just about data, so let me switch gears

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:30.050
and tell you how this is impacting already

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.493
the jobs we do every day,

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.214
because this new wave of innovation

00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:36.330
is bringing about new tools and applications

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.846
that will allow us to collaborate

00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:40.416
in a smarter and faster way,

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:43.549
making our jobs not just more efficient

00:07:43.549 --> 00:07:45.338
but more rewarding.

00:07:45.338 --> 00:07:48.242
Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm

00:07:48.242 --> 00:07:49.928
with a handheld device telling her

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.226
which turbines need servicing.

00:07:52.226 --> 00:07:53.704
She already has all the spare parts,

00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:56.246
because the problems were diagnosed in advanced.

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.720
And if she faces an unexpected issue,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.323
the same handheld device will allow her to

00:08:01.323 --> 00:08:03.831
communicate with colleagues at the service center,

00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:05.931
let them see what she sees,

00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:08.686
transmit data that they can run through diagnostics,

00:08:08.686 --> 00:08:10.983
and they can stream videos that will guide her,

00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:13.351
step by step, through whatever complex procedure

00:08:13.351 --> 00:08:15.813
is needed to get the machines back up and running.

00:08:15.813 --> 00:08:17.829
And their interaction gets documented

00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:22.231
and stored in a searchable database.

00:08:22.246 --> 00:08:24.001
Let's stop and think about this for a minute,

00:08:24.001 --> 00:08:25.722
because this is a very important point.

00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:27.948
This new wave of innovation is fundamentally

00:08:27.948 --> 00:08:30.418
changing the way we work.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:35.627
And I know that many of you will be concerned 
about the impact that innovation might have on jobs.

00:08:35.627 --> 00:08:37.124
Unemployment is already high,

00:08:37.124 --> 00:08:40.360
and there is always a fear 
that innovation will destroy jobs.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.491
And innovation is disruptive.

00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:44.944
But let me stress two things here.

00:08:44.944 --> 00:08:46.875
First, we've already lived through

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:49.638
mechanization of agriculture,
automation of industry,

00:08:49.638 --> 00:08:51.663
and employment has gone up,

00:08:51.663 --> 00:08:53.956
because innovation is fundamentally about growth.

00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:55.849
It makes products more affordable.

00:08:55.849 --> 00:08:58.509
It creates new demand, new jobs.

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:01.091
Second, there is a concern that in the future,

00:09:01.091 --> 00:09:03.247
there will only be room for engineers,

00:09:03.247 --> 00:09:06.267
data scientists, and other highly-specialized workers.

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:09.836
And believe me, as an economist, I am also scared.

00:09:09.836 --> 00:09:11.555
But think about it:

00:09:11.555 --> 00:09:14.174
Just as a child can easily figure out

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:15.930
how to operate an iPad,

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.055
so a new generation of mobile and intuitive

00:09:18.055 --> 00:09:20.779
industrial applications will make life easier

00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:23.198
for workers of all skill levels.

00:09:23.198 --> 00:09:26.400
The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.526
than the Charlie Chaplin of "Modern Times."

00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:32.570
And to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created:

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.446
mechanical digital engineers who understand

00:09:34.446 --> 00:09:36.578
both the machines and the data;

00:09:36.578 --> 00:09:38.861
managers who understand their industry

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:41.722
and the analytics and can reorganize the business

00:09:41.722 --> 00:09:44.844
to take full advantage of the technology.

00:09:44.844 --> 00:09:47.160
But now let's take a step back.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.204
Let's look at the big picture.

00:09:49.204 --> 00:09:51.627
There are people who argue that today's innovation

00:09:51.627 --> 00:09:53.976
is all about social media and silly games,

00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:55.866
with nowhere near the transformational power

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:57.945
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.700
They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.126
are behind us.

00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:05.440
And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.408
even back in the Stone Age,

00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:09.697
there must have been a group of cavemen

00:10:09.697 --> 00:10:11.576
sitting around a fire one day

00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:13.102
looking very grumpy,

00:10:13.102 --> 00:10:15.828
and looking disapprovingly
at another group of cavemen

00:10:15.828 --> 00:10:17.997
rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill,

00:10:17.997 --> 00:10:19.806
and saying to each other,

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:22.087
"Yeah, this wheel thing,

00:10:22.087 --> 00:10:24.878
cool toy, sure, but compared to fire,

00:10:24.878 --> 00:10:26.994
it will have no impact.

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:29.318
The big discoveries are all behind us."

00:10:29.318 --> 00:10:31.205
(Laughter)

00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:32.753
This technological revolution

00:10:32.753 --> 00:10:35.281
is as inspiring and transformational

00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:37.294
as anything we have ever seen.

00:10:37.294 --> 00:10:40.684
Human creativity and innovation
have always propelled us forward.

00:10:40.684 --> 00:10:42.131
They've created jobs.

00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:43.520
They've raised living standards.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.323
They've made our lives

00:10:45.323 --> 00:10:47.383
healthier and more rewarding.

00:10:47.383 --> 00:10:48.626
And the new wave of innovation

00:10:48.626 --> 00:10:50.976
which is beginning to sweep through industry

00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:52.598
is no different.

00:10:52.598 --> 00:10:54.614
In the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet

00:10:54.614 --> 00:10:58.554
could raise average income by 25 to 40 percent

00:10:58.554 --> 00:11:00.246
over the next 15 years,

00:11:00.246 --> 00:11:02.915
boosting growth to rates we
haven't seen in a long time,

00:11:02.915 --> 00:11:06.859
and adding between 10 and 15
trillion dollars to global GDP.

00:11:06.859 --> 00:11:11.112
That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today.

00:11:11.112 --> 00:11:13.623
But this is not a foregone conclusion.

00:11:13.623 --> 00:11:15.618
We are just at the beginning of this transformation,

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:17.474
and there will be barriers to break,

00:11:17.474 --> 00:11:19.160
obstacles to overcome.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.701
We will need to invest in the new technologies.

00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:25.410
We will need to adapt organizations
and managerial practices.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.304
We will need a robust cybersecurity approach

00:11:28.304 --> 00:11:32.047
that protects sensitive information
and intellectual property

00:11:32.047 --> 00:11:35.287
and safeguards critical infrastructure
from cyberattacks.

00:11:35.287 --> 00:11:37.524
And the education system will need to evolve

00:11:37.524 --> 00:11:40.732
to ensure students are equipped with the right skills.

00:11:40.732 --> 00:11:42.467
It's not going to be easy,

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:45.114
but it is going to be worth it.

00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:48.662
The economic challenges facing us are hard,

00:11:48.662 --> 00:11:50.758
but when I walk the factory floor,

00:11:50.758 --> 00:11:53.346
and I see how humans and brilliant machines

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:55.064
are becoming interconnected,

00:11:55.064 --> 00:11:57.138
and I see the difference this makes

00:11:57.138 --> 00:11:59.704
in a hospital, in an airport,

00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:02.385
in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic,

00:12:02.385 --> 00:12:03.993
I'm enthusiastic.

00:12:03.993 --> 00:12:07.447
This new technological revolution is upon us.

00:12:07.447 --> 00:12:10.641
So think about the future —
it will be here soon enough.

00:12:10.641 --> 00:12:13.326
Thank you.

00:12:13.326 --> 00:12:17.419
(Applause)
