00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.814
"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,

00:00:07.838 --> 00:00:10.216
and Mourners to and fro

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.043
kept treading -- treading --
till [it seemed]

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.386
that Sense was breaking through --

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:17.581
And when they all were seated,

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:19.579
a Service, like a Drum --

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:23.055
kept beating -- beating --
till I [thought]

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.845
my Mind was going numb --

00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:29.970
And then I heard them lift a Box
and creak across my Soul

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:33.029
with those same Boots of Lead, again,

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:36.046
then Space -- began to toll,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.177
As [all] the Heavens were a Bell,
and Being, [but] an Ear,

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.260
and I, and Silence, some strange Race,

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:45.864
wrecked, solitary, here --

00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:49.646
[And] then a Plank in Reason, broke,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.987
and I fell down and down --

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.662
and hit a World, at every plunge,

00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:58.245
and Finished knowing -- then --"

00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:03.012
We know depression through metaphors.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.365
Emily Dickinson was able
to convey it in language,

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:09.704
Goya in an image.

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:14.833
Half the purpose of art
is to describe such iconic states.

00:01:15.997 --> 00:01:19.851
As for me, I had always
thought myself tough,

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.677
one of the people who could survive

00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:24.024
if I'd been sent to a concentration camp.

00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:27.279
In 1991, I had a series of losses.

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:29.174
My mother died,

00:01:29.198 --> 00:01:31.300
a relationship I'd been in ended,

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:35.244
I moved back to the United States
from some years abroad,

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:37.982
and I got through all of those
experiences intact.

00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:41.516
But in 1994, three years later,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.282
I found myself losing interest
in almost everything.

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:49.935
I didn't want to do any of the things
I had previously wanted to do,

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.419
and I didn't know why.

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:56.548
The opposite of depression
is not happiness, but vitality.

00:01:57.127 --> 00:01:58.571
And it was vitality

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:01.558
that seemed to seep away
from me in that moment.

00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:05.908
Everything there was to do
seemed like too much work.

00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:08.034
I would come home

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:11.386
and I would see the red light
flashing on my answering machine,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.950
and instead of being thrilled
to hear from my friends,

00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:15.163
I would think,

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:17.782
"What a lot of people that is
to have to call back."

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:20.930
Or I would decide I should have lunch,

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:23.691
and then I would think,
but I'd have to get the food out

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:25.477
and put it on a plate

00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:29.365
and cut it up and chew it and swallow it,

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.723
and it felt to me
like the Stations of the Cross.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:37.419
And one of the things that often gets lost
in discussions of depression

00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:39.501
is that you know it's ridiculous.

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:42.744
You know it's ridiculous
while you're experiencing it.

00:02:42.768 --> 00:02:44.657
You know that most people manage

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:46.971
to listen to their messages and eat lunch

00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:48.901
and organize themselves to take a shower

00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:50.143
and go out the front door

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:51.795
and that it's not a big deal,

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.961
and yet you are nonetheless in its grip

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:58.422
and you are unable to figure out
any way around it.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.212
And so I began to feel myself doing less

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:05.522
and thinking less

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:06.861
and feeling less.

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.567
It was a kind of nullity.

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.044
And then the anxiety set in.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:16.259
If you told me that I'd have to be
depressed for the next month,

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:19.522
I would say, "As long I know it'll be over
in November, I can do it."

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:20.792
But if you said to me,

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:24.129
"You have to have acute anxiety
for the next month,"

00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:26.472
I would rather slit my wrist
than go through it.

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:28.054
It was the feeling all the time

00:03:28.078 --> 00:03:30.282
like that feeling you have
if you're walking

00:03:30.306 --> 00:03:33.827
and you slip or trip
and the ground is rushing up at you,

00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.563
but instead of lasting half a second,
the way that does,

00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:38.468
it lasted for six months.

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:41.421
It's a sensation
of being afraid all the time

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:44.430
but not even knowing
what it is that you're afraid of.

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:47.668
And it was at that point
that I began to think

00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:51.452
that it was just too painful to be alive,

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:54.036
and that the only reason
not to kill oneself

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.755
was so as not to hurt other people.

00:03:57.295 --> 00:04:00.176
And finally one day, I woke up

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.397
and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,

00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:04.915
because I lay in bed completely frozen,

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.864
looking at the telephone, thinking,

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:10.427
"Something is wrong
and I should call for help,"

00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:12.162
and I couldn't reach out my arm

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:14.428
and pick up the phone and dial.

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.852
And finally, after four full hours
of my lying and staring at it,

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:20.140
the phone rang,

00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:22.543
and somehow I managed to pick it up,

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.495
and it was my father, and I said,

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:28.965
"I'm in serious trouble.
We need to do something."

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:34.219
The next day I started
with the medications and the therapy.

00:04:35.352 --> 00:04:39.555
And I also started reckoning
with this terrible question:

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.683
If I'm not the tough person

00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:44.207
who could have made it
through a concentration camp,

00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:45.719
then who am I?

00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:47.604
And if I have to take medication,

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:51.541
is that medication making me
more fully myself,

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:53.783
or is it making me someone else?

00:04:53.807 --> 00:04:57.267
And how do I feel about it
if it's making me someone else?

00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:01.005
I had two advantages
as I went into the fight.

00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:04.256
The first is that I knew that,
objectively speaking,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.877
I had a nice life,

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:07.762
and that if I could only get well,

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:10.986
there was something at the other end
that was worth living for.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.827
And the other was
that I had access to good treatment.

00:05:14.343 --> 00:05:17.792
But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:20.327
and emerged and relapsed,

00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:23.345
and emerged and relapsed,

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:25.309
and finally understood

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:29.254
I would have to be on medication
and in therapy forever.

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:30.936
And I thought,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.746
"But is it a chemical problem
or a psychological problem?

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.703
And does it need a chemical cure
or a philosophical cure?"

00:05:37.727 --> 00:05:39.854
And I couldn't figure out which it was.

00:05:39.878 --> 00:05:41.978
And then I understood that actually,

00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:45.989
we aren't advanced enough in either area
for it to explain things fully.

00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:49.340
The chemical cure
and the psychological cure

00:05:49.364 --> 00:05:51.038
both have a role to play,

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:55.036
and I also figured out
that depression was something

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.284
that was braided so deep into us

00:05:57.308 --> 00:06:00.996
that there was no separating it
from our character and personality.

00:06:01.552 --> 00:06:06.014
I want to say that the treatments we have
for depression are appalling.

00:06:06.038 --> 00:06:07.641
They're not very effective.

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.728
They're extremely costly.

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:12.249
They come with innumerable side effects.

00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:13.710
They're a disaster.

00:06:14.027 --> 00:06:18.694
But I am so grateful that I live now
and not 50 years ago,

00:06:18.718 --> 00:06:21.638
when there would have been
almost nothing to be done.

00:06:21.662 --> 00:06:24.045
I hope that 50 years hence,

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:26.091
people will hear about my treatments

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:29.783
and be appalled that anyone endured
such primitive science.

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:34.127
Depression is the flaw in love.

00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:38.558
If you were married
to someone and thought,

00:06:38.582 --> 00:06:42.292
"Well, if my wife dies,
I'll find another one,"

00:06:42.316 --> 00:06:44.565
it wouldn't be love as we know it.

00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:49.931
There's no such thing as love
without the anticipation of loss,

00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:55.511
and that specter of despair
can be the engine of intimacy.

00:06:56.204 --> 00:06:59.035
There are three things
people tend to confuse:

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.148
depression, grief and sadness.

00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:06.305
Grief is explicitly reactive.

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:09.210
If you have a loss
and you feel incredibly unhappy,

00:07:09.234 --> 00:07:10.909
and then, six months later,

00:07:10.933 --> 00:07:14.018
you are still deeply sad,
but you're functioning a little better,

00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:15.827
it's probably grief,

00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:19.586
and it will probably ultimately
resolve itself in some measure.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.415
If you experience a catastrophic loss,

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.741
and you feel terrible,

00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:26.554
and six months later
you can barely function at all,

00:07:26.578 --> 00:07:29.092
then it's probably a depression
that was triggered

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:31.299
by the catastrophic circumstances.

00:07:31.648 --> 00:07:34.818
The trajectory tells us a great deal.

00:07:35.196 --> 00:07:38.556
People think of depression
as being just sadness.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.751
It's much, much too much sadness,

00:07:40.775 --> 00:07:42.526
much too much grief

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.659
at far too slight a cause.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.255
As I set out to understand depression,

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:50.926
and to interview people
who had experienced it,

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.743
I found that there were people
who seemed, on the surface,

00:07:54.767 --> 00:07:57.980
to have what sounded like
relatively mild depression

00:07:58.004 --> 00:08:00.742
who were nonetheless
utterly disabled by it.

00:08:01.297 --> 00:08:03.710
And there were other people
who had what sounded

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:06.796
as they described it
like terribly severe depression

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.560
who nonetheless had good lives

00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:11.290
in the interstices
between their depressive episodes.

00:08:11.885 --> 00:08:15.850
And I set out to find out
what it is that causes some people

00:08:15.874 --> 00:08:18.103
to be more resilient than other people.

00:08:18.127 --> 00:08:21.343
What are the mechanisms
that allow people to survive?

00:08:21.652 --> 00:08:24.850
And I went out and I interviewed
person after person

00:08:24.874 --> 00:08:26.850
who was suffering with depression.

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:29.065
One of the first people I interviewed

00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:33.943
described depression
as a slower way of being dead,

00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:36.301
and that was a good thing
for me to hear early on

00:08:36.325 --> 00:08:39.432
because it reminded me
that that slow way of being dead

00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:41.736
can lead to actual deadness,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.717
that this is a serious business.

00:08:43.741 --> 00:08:46.130
It's the leading disability worldwide,

00:08:46.154 --> 00:08:48.236
and people die of it every day.

00:08:49.184 --> 00:08:52.903
One of the people I talked to
when I was trying to understand this

00:08:52.927 --> 00:08:56.788
was a beloved friend
who I had known for many years,

00:08:56.812 --> 00:09:01.265
and who had had a psychotic episode
in her freshman year of college,

00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:04.091
and then plummeted
into a horrific depression.

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:05.754
She had bipolar illness,

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:08.265
or manic depression, as it was then known.

00:09:08.289 --> 00:09:12.074
And then she did very well
for many years on lithium,

00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:15.247
and then eventually,
she was taken off her lithium

00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:17.082
to see how she would do without it,

00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:19.057
and she had another psychosis,

00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:23.441
and then plunged into the worst depression
that I had ever seen

00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:26.282
in which she sat
in her parents' apartment,

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:29.578
more or less catatonic,
essentially without moving,

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.515
day after day after day.

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:35.427
And when I interviewed her
about that experience some years later --

00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:38.552
she's a poet and psychotherapist
named Maggie Robbins --

00:09:38.576 --> 00:09:41.622
when I interviewed her, she said,

00:09:41.646 --> 00:09:45.165
"I was singing 'Where Have
All The Flowers Gone,'

00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:48.086
over and over, to occupy my mind.

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:51.351
I was singing to blot out
the things my mind was saying,

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:56.135
which were, 'You are nothing.
You are nobody.

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:58.090
You don't even deserve to live.'

00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:01.097
And that was
when I really started thinking

00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:02.475
about killing myself."

00:10:03.193 --> 00:10:07.103
You don't think in depression
that you've put on a gray veil

00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:10.491
and are seeing the world
through the haze of a bad mood.

00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:13.991
You think that the veil
has been taken away,

00:10:14.015 --> 00:10:15.619
the veil of happiness,

00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:17.580
and that now you're seeing truly.

00:10:18.247 --> 00:10:21.007
It's easier to help
schizophrenics who perceive

00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:25.005
that there's something foreign
inside of them that needs to be exorcised,

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:27.355
but it's difficult with depressives,

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:30.181
because we believe
we are seeing the truth.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.585
But the truth lies.

00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:35.961
I became obsessed with that sentence:

00:10:35.985 --> 00:10:38.117
"But the truth lies."

00:10:38.435 --> 00:10:40.875
And I discovered,
as I talked to depressive people,

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:43.471
that they have
many delusional perceptions.

00:10:43.815 --> 00:10:45.553
People will say, "No one loves me."

00:10:45.577 --> 00:10:46.789
And you say, "I love you,

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.311
your wife loves you,
your mother loves you."

00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:52.696
You can answer that one pretty readily,
at least for most people.

00:10:53.124 --> 00:10:55.290
But people who are depressed
will also say,

00:10:55.314 --> 00:10:59.361
"No matter what we do,
we're all just going to die in the end."

00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:01.614
Or they'll say,
"There can be no true communion

00:11:01.638 --> 00:11:03.000
between two human beings.

00:11:03.024 --> 00:11:05.408
Each of us is trapped in his own body."

00:11:05.805 --> 00:11:07.425
To which you have to say,

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:08.928
"That's true,

00:11:08.952 --> 00:11:12.460
but I think we should focus right now
on what to have for breakfast."

00:11:12.484 --> 00:11:14.645
(Laughter)

00:11:14.669 --> 00:11:16.314
A lot of the time,

00:11:16.338 --> 00:11:19.312
what they are expressing
is not illness, but insight,

00:11:19.336 --> 00:11:21.867
and one comes to think
what's really extraordinary

00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:25.023
is that most of us know
about those existential questions

00:11:25.047 --> 00:11:27.091
and they don't distract us very much.

00:11:27.428 --> 00:11:29.250
There was a study I particularly liked

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:33.017
in which a group of depressed
and a group of non-depressed people

00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:35.765
were asked to play a video
game for an hour,

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:37.409
and at the end of the hour,

00:11:37.433 --> 00:11:41.043
they were asked how many little monsters
they thought they had killed.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:45.052
The depressive group was usually accurate
to within about 10 percent,

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:46.647
and the non-depressed people

00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:51.125
guessed between 15 and 20 times
as many little monsters --

00:11:51.149 --> 00:11:52.300
(Laughter)

00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:54.076
as they had actually killed.

00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:59.161
A lot of people said, when I chose
to write about my depression,

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:02.650
that it must be very difficult
to be out of that closet,

00:12:02.674 --> 00:12:03.983
to have people know.

00:12:04.007 --> 00:12:06.276
They said, "Do people
talk to you differently?"

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.379
I said, "Yes, people
talk to me differently.

00:12:08.403 --> 00:12:10.165
They talk to me differently insofar

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:12.856
as they start telling me
about their experience,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.691
or their sister's experience,

00:12:14.715 --> 00:12:16.356
or their friend's experience.

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:18.927
Things are different because now I know

00:12:18.951 --> 00:12:23.056
that depression is the family secret
that everyone has.

00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:27.341
I went a few years ago to a conference,

00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:29.796
and on Friday of the three-day conference,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.825
one of the participants
took me aside, and she said,

00:12:32.849 --> 00:12:39.098
"I suffer from depression
and I'm a little embarrassed about it,

00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:40.964
but I've been taking this medication,

00:12:40.988 --> 00:12:44.102
and I just wanted to ask you
what you think?"

00:12:44.126 --> 00:12:46.746
And so I did my best to give her
such advice as I could.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.257
And then she said, "You know,
my husband would never understand this.

00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:54.549
He's really the kind of guy to whom
this wouldn't make any sense,

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:56.697
so, you know, it's just between us."

00:12:56.721 --> 00:12:58.273
And I said, "Yes, that's fine."

00:12:58.733 --> 00:13:00.592
On Sunday of the same conference,

00:13:00.616 --> 00:13:02.492
her husband took me aside,

00:13:02.516 --> 00:13:03.830
(Laughter)

00:13:03.854 --> 00:13:05.615
and he said, "My wife wouldn't think

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.950
that I was really much
of a guy if she knew this,

00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:11.732
but I've been dealing with this depression
and I'm taking some medication,

00:13:11.756 --> 00:13:14.181
and I wondered what you think?"

00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:16.495
They were hiding the same medication

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:19.894
in two different places
in the same bedroom.

00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:21.116
(Laughter)

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.078
And I said that I thought
communication within the marriage

00:13:24.102 --> 00:13:26.150
might be triggering
some of their problems.

00:13:26.174 --> 00:13:28.666
(Laughter)

00:13:30.593 --> 00:13:32.156
But I was also struck

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.698
by the burdensome nature
of such mutual secrecy.

00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:38.002
Depression is so exhausting.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.972
It takes up so much
of your time and energy,

00:13:40.996 --> 00:13:42.527
and silence about it,

00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:44.808
it really does make the depression worse.

00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:46.485
And then I began thinking

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:48.832
about all the ways
people make themselves better.

00:13:48.856 --> 00:13:51.317
I'd started off as a medical conservative.

00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:53.975
I thought there were a few
kinds of therapy that worked,

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.444
it was clear what they were --

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:56.968
there was medication,

00:13:56.992 --> 00:13:58.659
there were certain psychotherapies,

00:13:58.683 --> 00:14:01.104
there was possibly
electroconvulsive treatment,

00:14:01.128 --> 00:14:03.717
and that everything else was nonsense.

00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:05.669
But then I discovered something.

00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:07.326
If you have brain cancer,

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.538
and you say that standing on your head
for 20 minutes every morning

00:14:10.562 --> 00:14:11.715
makes you feel better,

00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:14.717
it may make you feel better,
but you still have brain cancer,

00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:16.814
and you'll still probably die from it.

00:14:17.387 --> 00:14:19.673
But if you say that you have depression,

00:14:19.697 --> 00:14:22.037
and standing on your head
for 20 minutes every day

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.257
makes you feel better, then it's worked,

00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:26.722
because depression
is an illness of how you feel,

00:14:26.746 --> 00:14:28.076
and if you feel better,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.659
then you are effectively
not depressed anymore.

00:14:31.112 --> 00:14:33.199
So I became much more tolerant

00:14:33.223 --> 00:14:35.611
of the vast world
of alternative treatments.

00:14:35.936 --> 00:14:38.248
And I get letters,
I get hundreds of letters

00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:41.082
from people writing to tell me
about what's worked for them.

00:14:41.106 --> 00:14:44.671
Someone was asking me
backstage today about meditation.

00:14:44.695 --> 00:14:48.367
My favorite of the letters that I got
was the one that came from a woman

00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:51.312
who wrote and said
that she had tried therapy, medication,

00:14:51.336 --> 00:14:53.166
she had tried pretty much everything,

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.096
and she had found a solution
and hoped I would tell the world,

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.692
and that was making
little things from yarn.

00:14:59.716 --> 00:15:02.609
(Laughter)

00:15:02.633 --> 00:15:04.169
She sent me some of them.

00:15:04.193 --> 00:15:06.223
(Laughter)

00:15:06.247 --> 00:15:08.112
And I'm not wearing them right now.

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.286
(Laughter)

00:15:09.845 --> 00:15:12.336
I suggested to her
that she also should look up

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.766
obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.

00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:19.669
And yet, when I went to look
at alternative treatments,

00:15:19.693 --> 00:15:22.121
I also gained perspective
on other treatments.

00:15:22.605 --> 00:15:25.323
I went through
a tribal exorcism in Senegal

00:15:25.347 --> 00:15:27.336
that involved a great deal of ram's blood

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.398
and that I'm not going
to detail right now,

00:15:29.422 --> 00:15:31.422
but a few years afterwards
I was in Rwanda,

00:15:31.446 --> 00:15:33.343
working on a different project,

00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:35.952
and I happened to describe
my experience to someone,

00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:37.135
and he said,

00:15:37.159 --> 00:15:39.617
"Well, that's West Africa,
and we're in East Africa,

00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:41.898
and our rituals are
in some ways very different,

00:15:41.922 --> 00:15:43.223
but we do have some rituals

00:15:43.247 --> 00:15:46.047
that have something in common
with what you're describing."

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.238
And he said,

00:15:47.262 --> 00:15:50.473
"But we've had a lot of trouble
with Western mental health workers,

00:15:50.497 --> 00:15:53.115
especially the ones who came
right after the genocide."

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:55.189
I said, "What kind
of trouble did you have?"

00:15:55.213 --> 00:15:58.965
And he said, "Well,
they would do this bizarre thing.

00:15:58.989 --> 00:16:01.037
They didn't take people out
in the sunshine

00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:02.550
where you begin to feel better.

00:16:02.574 --> 00:16:05.726
They didn't include drumming
or music to get people's blood going.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.656
They didn't involve the whole community.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.916
They didn't externalize
the depression as an invasive spirit.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.953
Instead what they did was they took people
one at a time into dingy little rooms

00:16:15.977 --> 00:16:17.358
and had them talk for an hour

00:16:17.382 --> 00:16:19.526
about bad things
that had happened to them."

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.593
(Laughter)

00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:24.986
(Applause)

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.439
He said, "We had to ask them
to leave the country."

00:16:27.463 --> 00:16:30.405
(Laughter)

00:16:30.429 --> 00:16:33.007
Now at the other end
of alternative treatments,

00:16:33.031 --> 00:16:35.126
let me tell you about Frank Russakoff.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:40.852
Frank Russakoff had the worst depression
perhaps that I've ever seen in a man.

00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:42.845
He was constantly depressed.

00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:44.314
He was, when I met him,

00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:48.144
at a point at which every month,
he would have electroshock treatment.

00:16:48.168 --> 00:16:50.719
Then he would feel
sort of disoriented for a week.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.522
Then he would feel okay for a week.

00:16:52.546 --> 00:16:54.640
Then he would have a week
of going downhill.

00:16:54.664 --> 00:16:57.254
And then he would have another
electroshock treatment.

00:16:57.278 --> 00:16:58.851
And he said to me when I met him,

00:16:58.875 --> 00:17:01.240
"It's unbearable to go
through my weeks this way.

00:17:01.264 --> 00:17:02.711
I can't go on this way,

00:17:02.735 --> 00:17:04.845
and I've figured out
how I'm going to end it

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:06.202
if I don't get better."

00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:10.328
"But," he said to me,
"I heard about a protocol at Mass General

00:17:10.352 --> 00:17:13.574
for a procedure called a cingulotomy,
which is a brain surgery,

00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:15.867
and I think I'm going to give that a try."

00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:19.184
And I remember being amazed
at that point to think that someone

00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:22.205
who clearly had so many bad experiences

00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:24.365
with so many different treatments

00:17:24.389 --> 00:17:27.429
still had buried in him,
somewhere, enough optimism

00:17:27.453 --> 00:17:29.238
to reach out for one more.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.957
And he had the cingulotomy,
and it was incredibly successful.

00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:35.593
He's now a friend of mine.

00:17:35.617 --> 00:17:38.942
He has a lovely wife
and two beautiful children.

00:17:38.966 --> 00:17:41.891
He wrote me a letter
the Christmas after the surgery,

00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:43.080
and he said,

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.707
"My father sent me two presents this year,

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.258
First, a motorized CD rack
from The Sharper Image

00:17:48.282 --> 00:17:49.680
that I didn't really need,

00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:51.941
but I knew he was giving it
to me to celebrate

00:17:51.965 --> 00:17:55.214
the fact that I'm living on my own
and have a job I seem to love.

00:17:55.635 --> 00:17:58.876
And the other present
was a photo of my grandmother,

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.376
who committed suicide.

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.860
As I unwrapped it, I began to cry,

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:05.741
and my mother came over and said,

00:18:05.765 --> 00:18:08.757
'Are you crying because
of the relatives you never knew?'

00:18:09.162 --> 00:18:12.710
And I said, 'She had
the same disease I have.'

00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:15.854
I'm crying now as I write to you.

00:18:15.878 --> 00:18:19.165
It's not that I'm so sad,
but I get overwhelmed,

00:18:19.189 --> 00:18:21.386
I think, because I could
have killed myself,

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.838
but my parents kept me going,
and so did the doctors,

00:18:24.862 --> 00:18:26.692
and I had the surgery.

00:18:26.716 --> 00:18:28.798
I'm alive and grateful.

00:18:29.531 --> 00:18:34.132
We live in the right time,
even if it doesn't always feel like it."

00:18:35.856 --> 00:18:37.775
I was struck by the fact that depression

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:42.805
is broadly perceived to be
a modern, Western, middle-class thing,

00:18:42.829 --> 00:18:46.960
and I went to look at how it operated
in a variety of other contexts,

00:18:46.984 --> 00:18:49.175
and one of the things
I was most interested in

00:18:49.199 --> 00:18:51.114
was depression among the indigent.

00:18:51.138 --> 00:18:52.686
And so I went out to try to look

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.463
at what was being done
for poor people with depression.

00:18:55.487 --> 00:18:57.614
And what I discovered is that poor people

00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:00.166
are mostly not being
treated for depression.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.864
Depression is the result
of a genetic vulnerability,

00:19:02.888 --> 00:19:06.238
which is presumably
evenly distributed in the population,

00:19:06.262 --> 00:19:07.975
and triggering circumstances,

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:11.753
which are likely to be more severe
for people who are impoverished.

00:19:11.777 --> 00:19:15.280
And yet it turns out that if you have
a really lovely life

00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:16.886
but feel miserable all the time,

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.696
you think, "Why do I feel like this?

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.989
I must have depression."

00:19:20.013 --> 00:19:22.149
And you set out to find treatment for it.

00:19:22.173 --> 00:19:24.105
But if you have a perfectly awful life,

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:25.872
and you feel miserable all the time,

00:19:25.896 --> 00:19:28.906
the way you feel
is commensurate with your life,

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.785
and it doesn't occur to you to think,

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:32.346
"Maybe this is treatable."

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.572
And so we have an epidemic in this country

00:19:35.596 --> 00:19:38.254
of depression among impoverished people

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:40.850
that's not being picked up
and that's not being treated

00:19:40.874 --> 00:19:42.822
and that's not being addressed,

00:19:42.846 --> 00:19:44.917
and it's a tragedy of a grand order.

00:19:45.219 --> 00:19:46.819
And so I found an academic

00:19:46.843 --> 00:19:50.068
who was doing a research project
in slums outside of D.C.,

00:19:50.092 --> 00:19:53.235
where she picked up women
who had come in for other health problems

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:55.014
and diagnosed them with depression,

00:19:55.038 --> 00:19:58.110
and then provided six months
of the experimental protocol.

00:19:58.134 --> 00:20:00.439
One of them, Lolly, came in,

00:20:00.463 --> 00:20:02.736
and this is what she said
the day she came in.

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:07.634
She said, and she was a woman,
by the way, who had seven children.

00:20:07.658 --> 00:20:10.443
She said, "I used to have a job
but I had to give it up

00:20:10.467 --> 00:20:12.682
because I couldn't go out of the house.

00:20:13.134 --> 00:20:15.074
I have nothing to say to my children.

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.929
In the morning,
I can't wait for them to leave,

00:20:17.953 --> 00:20:21.155
and then I climb in bed
and pull the covers over my head,

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.054
and three o'clock when they come home,

00:20:23.078 --> 00:20:24.520
it just comes so fast."

00:20:24.544 --> 00:20:26.838
She said, "I've been taking
a lot of Tylenol,

00:20:26.862 --> 00:20:29.365
anything I can take
so that I can sleep more.

00:20:29.389 --> 00:20:33.386
My husband has been telling me
I'm stupid, I'm ugly.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.164
I wish I could stop the pain."

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:39.531
Well, she was brought
into this experimental protocol,

00:20:39.555 --> 00:20:41.746
and when I interviewed her
six months later,

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.995
she had taken a job working in childcare

00:20:46.019 --> 00:20:50.069
for the U.S. Navy,
she had left the abusive husband,

00:20:50.093 --> 00:20:52.116
and she said to me,

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.395
"My kids are so much happier now."

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:57.101
She said, "There's one room
in my new place for the boys

00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:59.012
and one room for the girls,

00:20:59.036 --> 00:21:01.375
but at night, they're just
all up on my bed,

00:21:01.399 --> 00:21:03.987
and we're doing homework
all together and everything.

00:21:04.011 --> 00:21:05.685
One of them wants to be a preacher,

00:21:05.709 --> 00:21:07.602
one of them wants to be a firefighter,

00:21:07.626 --> 00:21:10.326
and one of the girls says
she's going to be a lawyer.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.554
They don't cry like they used to,

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:14.388
and they don't fight like they did.

00:21:15.144 --> 00:21:17.969
That's all I need now, is my kids.

00:21:18.826 --> 00:21:20.771
Things keep on changing,

00:21:20.795 --> 00:21:25.171
the way I dress,
the way I feel, the way I act.

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:29.710
I can go outside not being afraid anymore,

00:21:29.734 --> 00:21:33.222
and I don't think
those bad feelings are coming back,

00:21:33.246 --> 00:21:36.182
and if it weren't
for Dr. Miranda and that,

00:21:36.206 --> 00:21:39.728
I would still be at home
with the covers pulled over my head,

00:21:39.752 --> 00:21:41.605
if I were still alive at all.

00:21:42.097 --> 00:21:45.603
I asked the Lord to send me an angel,

00:21:45.627 --> 00:21:47.404
and He heard my prayers."

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:53.288
I was really moved by these experiences,

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.827
and I decided that I wanted
to write about them

00:21:55.851 --> 00:21:58.668
not only in a book I was working on,
but also in an article,

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:01.271
and I got a commission
from The New York Times Magazine

00:22:01.295 --> 00:22:03.414
to write about depression
among the indigent.

00:22:03.438 --> 00:22:04.675
And I turned in my story,

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:08.159
and my editor called me and said,
"We really can't publish this."

00:22:08.668 --> 00:22:09.827
And I said, "Why not?"

00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:11.922
And she said, "It just is too far-fetched.

00:22:11.946 --> 00:22:15.609
These people who are sort of
at the very bottom rung of society

00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:17.648
and then they get
a few months of treatment

00:22:17.672 --> 00:22:20.045
and they're virtually ready
to run Morgan Stanley?

00:22:20.069 --> 00:22:21.585
It's just too implausible."

00:22:22.013 --> 00:22:24.594
She said, "I've never even heard
of anything like it."

00:22:24.618 --> 00:22:27.071
And I said, "The fact
that you've never heard of it

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:29.198
is an indication that it is news."

00:22:29.907 --> 00:22:33.930
(Laughter)

00:22:33.954 --> 00:22:37.293
(Applause)

00:22:37.317 --> 00:22:39.434
"And you are a news magazine."

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.010
So after a certain amount of negotiation,
they agreed to it.

00:22:43.034 --> 00:22:46.920
But I think a lot of what they said
was connected in some strange way

00:22:46.944 --> 00:22:50.525
to this distaste that people still have
for the idea of treatment,

00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:52.407
the notion that somehow if we went out

00:22:52.431 --> 00:22:55.254
and treated a lot of people
in indigent communities,

00:22:55.278 --> 00:22:57.134
that would be exploitative,

00:22:57.158 --> 00:22:58.856
because we would be changing them.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.687
There is this false moral imperative
that seems to be all around us,

00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:04.819
that treatment of depression,

00:23:04.843 --> 00:23:07.118
the medications and so on,
are an artifice,

00:23:07.142 --> 00:23:09.465
and that it's not natural.

00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:12.432
And I think that's very misguided.

00:23:12.456 --> 00:23:15.789
It would be natural
for people's teeth to fall out,

00:23:15.813 --> 00:23:19.001
but there is nobody militating
against toothpaste,

00:23:19.025 --> 00:23:20.495
at least not in my circles.

00:23:21.915 --> 00:23:23.159
People then say,

00:23:23.183 --> 00:23:26.444
"But isn't depression part of what people
are supposed to experience?

00:23:26.468 --> 00:23:28.200
Didn't we evolve to have depression?

00:23:28.224 --> 00:23:29.975
Isn't it part of your personality?"

00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:32.438
To which I would say, mood is adaptive.

00:23:32.462 --> 00:23:35.539
Being able to have sadness and fear

00:23:35.563 --> 00:23:37.469
and joy and pleasure

00:23:37.493 --> 00:23:41.248
and all of the other moods that we have,
that's incredibly valuable.

00:23:41.272 --> 00:23:43.186
And major depression

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.572
is something that happens
when that system gets broken.

00:23:46.596 --> 00:23:48.200
It's maladaptive.

00:23:48.224 --> 00:23:49.839
People will come to me and say,

00:23:49.863 --> 00:23:52.665
"I think, though, if I just
stick it out for another year,

00:23:52.689 --> 00:23:54.542
I think I can just get through this."

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:57.090
And I always say to them,
"You may get through it,

00:23:57.114 --> 00:23:59.304
but you'll never be 37 again.

00:23:59.733 --> 00:24:03.442
Life is short, and that's a whole year
you're talking about giving up.

00:24:03.982 --> 00:24:05.133
Think it through."

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:08.342
It's a strange poverty
of the English language,

00:24:08.366 --> 00:24:10.450
and indeed of many other languages,

00:24:10.474 --> 00:24:12.844
that we use this same word, depression,

00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:16.582
to describe how a kid feels
when it rains on his birthday,

00:24:16.606 --> 00:24:20.965
and to describe how somebody feels
the minute before they commit suicide.

00:24:21.495 --> 00:24:24.501
People say to me, "Well, is it
continuous with normal sadness?"

00:24:24.525 --> 00:24:27.632
And I say, in a way it's continuous
with normal sadness.

00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:29.830
There is a certain amount of continuity,

00:24:29.854 --> 00:24:31.791
but it's the same way there's continuity

00:24:31.815 --> 00:24:34.021
between having an iron fence
outside your house

00:24:34.045 --> 00:24:35.465
that gets a little rust spot

00:24:35.489 --> 00:24:38.087
that you have to sand off
and do a little repainting,

00:24:38.111 --> 00:24:40.939
and what happens if you leave
the house for 100 years

00:24:40.963 --> 00:24:44.762
and it rusts through
until it's only a pile of orange dust.

00:24:45.082 --> 00:24:46.935
And it's that orange dust spot,

00:24:46.959 --> 00:24:48.724
that orange dust problem,

00:24:48.748 --> 00:24:51.334
that's the one
we're setting out to address.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.254
So now people say,

00:24:54.278 --> 00:24:56.957
"You take these happy pills,
and do you feel happy?"

00:24:56.981 --> 00:24:58.171
And I don't.

00:24:58.594 --> 00:25:01.562
But I don't feel sad
about having to eat lunch,

00:25:01.586 --> 00:25:04.427
and I don't feel sad
about my answering machine,

00:25:04.451 --> 00:25:06.649
and I don't feel sad
about taking a shower.

00:25:07.324 --> 00:25:09.927
I feel more, in fact, I think,

00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:12.357
because I can feel
sadness without nullity.

00:25:12.704 --> 00:25:16.910
I feel sad about professional
disappointments,

00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:19.218
about damaged relationships,

00:25:19.242 --> 00:25:20.759
about global warming.

00:25:21.114 --> 00:25:23.815
Those are the things
that I feel sad about now.

00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:26.549
And I said to myself, well,
what is the conclusion?

00:25:26.573 --> 00:25:29.110
How did those people who have better lives

00:25:29.134 --> 00:25:31.664
even with bigger depression
manage to get through?

00:25:31.964 --> 00:25:34.115
What is the mechanism of resilience?

00:25:34.583 --> 00:25:36.545
And what I came up with over time

00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:39.395
was that the people
who deny their experience,

00:25:39.419 --> 00:25:41.435
and say, "I was depressed a long time ago,

00:25:41.459 --> 00:25:43.230
I never want to think about it again,

00:25:43.254 --> 00:25:44.548
I'm not going to look at it

00:25:44.572 --> 00:25:46.595
and I'm just going
to get on with my life,"

00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:51.217
ironically, those are the people
who are most enslaved by what they have.

00:25:51.241 --> 00:25:53.439
Shutting out the depression
strengthens it.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.470
While you hide from it, it grows.

00:25:57.185 --> 00:25:59.723
And the people who do better

00:25:59.747 --> 00:26:04.300
are the ones who are able to tolerate
the fact that they have this condition.

00:26:04.324 --> 00:26:08.196
Those who can tolerate their depression
are the ones who achieve resilience.

00:26:08.516 --> 00:26:10.128
So Frank Russakoff said to me,

00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:13.874
"If I had a do-over,
I suppose I wouldn't do it this way,

00:26:13.898 --> 00:26:17.366
but in a strange way,
I'm grateful for what I've experienced.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.714
I'm glad to have been
in the hospital 40 times.

00:26:21.023 --> 00:26:23.634
It taught me so much about love,

00:26:23.658 --> 00:26:26.579
and my relationship
with my parents and my doctors

00:26:26.603 --> 00:26:30.149
has been so precious to me,
and will be always."

00:26:30.772 --> 00:26:32.674
And Maggie Robbins said,

00:26:32.698 --> 00:26:35.663
"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,

00:26:35.687 --> 00:26:38.677
and I would just talk and talk and talk,

00:26:38.701 --> 00:26:42.734
and the people I was dealing with
weren't very responsive, and I thought,

00:26:42.758 --> 00:26:45.254
'That's not very friendly
or helpful of them.'"

00:26:45.278 --> 00:26:46.518
(Laughter)

00:26:46.542 --> 00:26:48.160
"And then I realized,

00:26:48.184 --> 00:26:50.327
I realized that
they weren't going to do more

00:26:50.351 --> 00:26:52.834
than make those first
few minutes of small talk.

00:26:52.858 --> 00:26:54.897
It was simply going to be an occasion

00:26:54.921 --> 00:26:57.870
where I didn't have AIDS
and I wasn't dying,

00:26:57.894 --> 00:27:00.772
but could tolerate the fact that they did

00:27:00.796 --> 00:27:02.011
and they were.

00:27:02.503 --> 00:27:05.646
Our needs are our greatest assets.

00:27:06.202 --> 00:27:10.367
It turns out I've learned to give
all the things I need."

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.021
Valuing one's depression
does not prevent a relapse,

00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:18.682
but it may make the prospect of relapse

00:27:18.706 --> 00:27:22.219
and even relapse itself
easier to tolerate.

00:27:23.004 --> 00:27:26.662
The question is not so much
of finding great meaning

00:27:26.686 --> 00:27:29.257
and deciding your depression
has been very meaningful.

00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:33.272
It's of seeking that meaning
and thinking, when it comes again,

00:27:33.296 --> 00:27:36.613
"This will be hellish,
but I will learn something from it."

00:27:37.487 --> 00:27:39.727
I have learned in my own depression

00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:41.949
how big an emotion can be,

00:27:41.973 --> 00:27:45.033
how it can be more real than facts,

00:27:45.057 --> 00:27:47.786
and I have found that that experience

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.678
has allowed me to experience
positive emotion

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:53.601
in a more intense and more focused way.

00:27:54.222 --> 00:27:57.805
The opposite of depression
is not happiness,

00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:59.139
but vitality,

00:27:59.163 --> 00:28:02.118
and these days, my life is vital,

00:28:02.142 --> 00:28:04.434
even on the days when I'm sad.

00:28:04.823 --> 00:28:07.938
I felt that funeral in my brain,

00:28:07.962 --> 00:28:12.502
and I sat next to the colossus
at the edge of the world,

00:28:12.526 --> 00:28:16.413
and I have discovered
something inside of myself

00:28:16.437 --> 00:28:18.501
that I would have to call a soul

00:28:18.525 --> 00:28:22.038
that I had never formulated
until that day 20 years ago

00:28:22.062 --> 00:28:25.363
when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.

00:28:26.841 --> 00:28:30.654
I think that while I hated being depressed

00:28:30.678 --> 00:28:33.180
and would hate to be depressed again,

00:28:33.204 --> 00:28:35.267
I've found a way to love my depression.

00:28:35.894 --> 00:28:40.077
I love it because it has forced me
to find and cling to joy.

00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:44.270
I love it because each day I decide,

00:28:44.294 --> 00:28:45.683
sometimes gamely,

00:28:45.707 --> 00:28:48.252
and sometimes against the moment's reason,

00:28:48.276 --> 00:28:50.415
to cleave to the reasons for living.

00:28:50.978 --> 00:28:54.655
And that, I think,
is a highly privileged rapture.

00:28:55.076 --> 00:28:56.332
Thank you.

00:28:56.356 --> 00:29:00.357
(Applause)

00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:01.532
Thank you.

00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:03.928
(Applause)
