00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:02.602
Nine years ago, I worked

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.799
for the U.S. government in Iraq,

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.928
helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.

00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:10.565
And I was there, and I worked in that job

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:12.415
because I believe that technology

00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:15.064
can improve people's lives.

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:17.999
One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:20.819
at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.558
and he said to me, "You Americans,

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:24.909
you can put a man on the moon,

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.454
but when I get home tonight,

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:29.310
I won't be able to turn on my lights."

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.967
At the time, the U.S. government had spent

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:33.327
more than two billion dollars

00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:35.684
on electricity reconstruction.

00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:38.856
How do you ensure technology reaches users?

00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:40.836
How do you put it in their hands

00:00:40.836 --> 00:00:43.072
so that it is useful?

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:46.116
So those are the questions that my colleagues and I

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:48.229
at D-Rev ask ourselves.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.377
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.

00:00:51.377 --> 00:00:53.971
And I took over the organization four years ago

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.272
and really focused it on developing products

00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:58.460
that actually reach users,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.946
and not just any users,

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:04.001
but customers who live on
less than four dollars a day.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.909
One of the key areas we've been working on recently

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.422
is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:10.554
that medical devices have something in common

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:13.120
with Iraq's electricity grid then,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.249
there are some commonalities.

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.958
Despite the advanced technology,

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.726
it's not reaching the people who need it most.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:23.134
So I'm going to tell you about one of
the projects we've been working on,

00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:26.041
the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.197
for above-knee amputees.

00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:31.497
And this project started when
the Jaipur Foot Organization,

00:01:31.497 --> 00:01:34.091
the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,

00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:35.560
came to the Bay Area and they said,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.530
"We need a better knee."

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.678
Chances are, if you're living on
less than four dollars a day,

00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:43.555
and you're an amputee,

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:45.729
you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.142
Most people think it's land mines,

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:48.748
but it's a vehicle accident.

00:01:48.748 --> 00:01:50.604
You're walking by the side of the road

00:01:50.604 --> 00:01:52.028
and you're hit by a truck,

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.889
or you're trying to to jump on a moving train,

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:57.873
you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.

00:01:57.873 --> 00:02:01.038
And the reality is that if
you don't have much money,

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.038
like this young named Kamal right here,

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:05.242
the option you really have

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:07.806
is a bamboo staff to get around.

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.289
And how big a problem is this?

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.215
There's over three million amputees every year

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:16.504
who need a new or replacement knee.

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.373
And what are their options?

00:02:18.373 --> 00:02:20.972
This is a high-end. This is
what we'd call a "smart knee."

00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:22.990
It's got a microprocessor inside.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.075
It can pretty much do anything,

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:26.772
but it's 20,000 dollars,

00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:28.978
and to give you a sense of who wears this,

00:02:28.978 --> 00:02:32.221
veterans, American veterans coming
back from Afghanistan or Iraq

00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.547
would be fit with something like this.

00:02:34.547 --> 00:02:37.064
This is a low-end titanium knee.

00:02:37.064 --> 00:02:39.541
It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.750
is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.300
that mimics a natural human knee.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.703
But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive

00:02:46.703 --> 00:02:49.087
for people like Kamal.

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:51.680
And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.511
This is a knee that's been designed specifically

00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:55.187
for poor people.

00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:57.020
And while you have affordability,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.915
you've lost on functionality.

00:02:58.915 --> 00:03:01.566
The mechanism here is a single axis,

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:03.815
and a single axis is like a door hinge.

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:06.100
So you can think about how unstable that would be.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.005
And this is the type of mechanism

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.894
that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using
when they were looking for a better knee,

00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:14.251
and I just wanted to give you a sense
of what a leg system looks like,

00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:15.590
because I'm showing you all these knees

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.966
and I imagine it's hard to think 
how it all fits together.

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:20.008
So at the top you have a socket,

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:21.954
and this fits over someone's residual limb,

00:03:21.954 --> 00:03:24.514
and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:25.698
And then you have the knee,

00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:27.416
and here I've got a single axis on the knee

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.128
so you can see how it rotates,

00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:33.091
and then a pylon, and then a foot.

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:35.634
And we've been able to develop a knee,

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:37.996
a polycentric knee, so that type of knee

00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:40.571
that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,

00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.314
for 80 dollars retail.

00:03:43.314 --> 00:03:46.878
(Applause)

00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:49.432
But the key is, you can have this great invention,

00:03:49.432 --> 00:03:51.418
you can have this great design, but how do you get it

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:53.190
to the people who most need it?

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.496
How do you ensure it gets to them
and it improves their lives?

00:03:56.496 --> 00:03:59.432
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,

00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:01.816
and we looked at three things that we really believe

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:05.788
gets technologies to customers, to users,

00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:07.164
to people who need it.

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:09.885
And the first thing is that the product 
needs to be world class.

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:11.536
It needs to perform on par

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:14.381
or better than the best products on the market.

00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:16.527
Regardless of your income level,

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:18.065
you want the most beautiful,

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:20.753
the best product that there is.

00:04:20.753 --> 00:04:24.242
I'm going to show you a video now

00:04:24.242 --> 00:04:25.888
of a man named Ash. You can see him walking.

00:04:25.888 --> 00:04:27.800
He's wearing the same knee system here

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.406
with a single axis knee.

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:31.498
And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:35.313
And you'll notice that he's struggling 
with stability as he's walking.

00:04:35.313 --> 00:04:37.968
And something that's not obvious, that you can't see,

00:04:37.968 --> 00:04:40.555
is that it's psychologically draining

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:44.337
to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.

00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:46.041
Now this is a video of Kamal.

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:48.774
You remember Kamal earlier,
holding the bamboo staff.

00:04:48.774 --> 00:04:51.482
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:54.582
and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.

00:04:54.582 --> 00:04:57.998
And you can see his stability is much better.

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.968
So world class isn't just about
technical performance.

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:06.308
It's also about human performance.

00:05:06.308 --> 00:05:08.166
And most medical devices, we've learned,

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:10.694
as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,

00:05:10.694 --> 00:05:12.357
for wealthier economies.

00:05:12.357 --> 00:05:15.619
But the reality is our users, our customers,

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:18.172
they do different things. They sit cross-legged more.

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:21.014
We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.

00:05:21.014 --> 00:05:23.762
And we designed our knee to have
the greatest range of motion

00:05:23.762 --> 00:05:27.846
of almost any other knee on the market.

00:05:27.846 --> 00:05:29.576
So the second thing we learned, and this leads

00:05:29.576 --> 00:05:31.836
into my second point, which is that we believe

00:05:31.836 --> 00:05:34.553
that products need to be
designed to be user-centric.

00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:37.153
And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say

00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:39.053
you need to be user-obsessed.

00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:41.773
So it's not just the end user
that you're thinking about,

00:05:41.773 --> 00:05:43.749
but everyone who interacts with the product,

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:46.463
so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,

00:05:46.463 --> 00:05:49.631
but also the context in which the knee is being fit.

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:51.215
What is the local market like?

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:53.133
How do all these components get to the clinic?

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:55.455
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:57.558
Everything that goes into ensuring

00:05:57.558 --> 00:05:59.541
that this product gets to the end user,

00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:03.962
and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.

00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:05.828
So I wanted to show you some of the iterations

00:06:05.828 --> 00:06:10.421
we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,

00:06:10.421 --> 00:06:12.242
so this is it right here.

00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:13.968
(Clicking)

00:06:13.968 --> 00:06:16.186
Notice anything about it?

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:18.747
It clicks.

00:06:18.747 --> 00:06:21.613
We'd seen that users had actually modified it.

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:25.125
So do you see that black strip right there?

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:28.117
That's a homemade noise dampener.

00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:30.335
We also saw that our users had modified it

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:31.769
in other ways.

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:33.559
You can see there that that particular amputee,

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.788
he had wrapped bandages around the knee.

00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:37.512
He'd made a cosmesis.

00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:39.708
And if you look at the knee,

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:43.162
it's got those pointy edges, right?

00:06:43.162 --> 00:06:45.365
So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt

00:06:45.365 --> 00:06:47.625
or a sari, it's really obvious

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:49.221
that you're wearing a prosthetic limb,

00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:53.413
and in societies where there's social
stigma around being disabled,

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.370
people are particularly acute about this.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.686
So I'm going to show you some
of the modifications we did.

00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:01.601
We did a lot of iterations, not just 
around this, but some other things.

00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:04.029
But here we have the version three, 
the ReMotion Knee,

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:05.848
but if you look in here, you can see

00:07:05.848 --> 00:07:10.566
the noise dampener. It's quieter.

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:14.219
The other thing we did is that
we smoothed the profile.

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:15.651
We made it thinner.

00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:17.359
And something that's not obvious is that we

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:20.560
designed it for mass production.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.256
And this goes into my last point.

00:07:22.256 --> 00:07:24.227
We really, truly believe that if a product

00:07:24.227 --> 00:07:26.564
is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,

00:07:26.564 --> 00:07:28.399
it needs to be market-driven,

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:31.644
and market-driven means that products are sold.

00:07:31.644 --> 00:07:34.767
They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:36.980
Our product needs to be designed to offer value

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.281
to the end user.

00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:40.460
It also has to be designed to be very affordable.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.634
But a product that is valued by a customer

00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:44.345
is used by a customer,

00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:46.518
and use is what creates impact.

00:07:46.518 --> 00:07:48.277
And we believe that as designers,

00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:51.507
it holds us accountable to our customers.

00:07:51.507 --> 00:07:54.123
And with centralized manufacturing,

00:07:54.123 --> 00:07:56.150
you can control the quality control,

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.878
and you can hit that $80 price point

00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:00.368
with profit margins built in.

00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:02.524
And now, those profit margins are critical,

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.193
because if you want to scale, if you want to reach

00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:06.452
all the people in the world who possibly need a knee,

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:09.609
it needs to be economically sustainable.

00:08:09.609 --> 00:08:12.205
So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.

00:08:12.205 --> 00:08:15.781
We have fit over 5,000 amputees,

00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:18.000
and one of the big indicators
we're looking at, of course,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.913
is, does it improve lives?

00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:21.649
Well, the standard is, is someone

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:24.174
still wearing their knee six months later?

00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:26.877
The industry average is about 65 percent.

00:08:26.877 --> 00:08:29.169
Ours is 79 percent,

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:32.113
and we're hoping to get that higher.

00:08:32.113 --> 00:08:35.126
Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:36.736
This is where we want to get, though,

00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:38.254
in the next three years.

00:08:38.254 --> 00:08:40.754
We'll double the impact in 2015,

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:43.872
and we'll double it each of
the following years after that.

00:08:43.872 --> 00:08:45.705
But then we hit a new challenge,

00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:47.724
and that's the number of skilled prosthetists

00:08:47.724 --> 00:08:50.832
who are able to fit knees.

00:08:50.832 --> 00:08:53.513
So I want to end with a story of Pournima.

00:08:53.513 --> 00:08:55.160
Pournima was 18 years old

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.028
when she was in a car accident
where she lost her leg,

00:08:58.028 --> 00:09:01.469
and she traveled 12 hours by train

00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:03.896
to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,

00:09:03.896 --> 00:09:06.489
and while all of the amputees who wear our knees

00:09:06.489 --> 00:09:08.665
affect us as the designers,

00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:12.932
she's particularly meaningful to me 
as an engineer and as a woman,

00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:14.496
because she was in school,

00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:17.220
she had just started school to study engineering.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.375
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again,

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:21.783
I can go back and complete my studies."

00:09:21.783 --> 00:09:24.953
And to me she represents the next generation

00:09:24.953 --> 00:09:27.985
of engineers solving problems

00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:30.430
and ensuring meaningful technologies

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.214
reach their users.

00:09:32.214 --> 00:09:34.252
So thank you.

00:09:34.252 --> 00:09:38.056
(Applause)
