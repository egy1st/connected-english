WEBVTT

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:08.344
It's the fifth time I stand on this shore,

00:00:09.725 --> 00:00:10.966
the Cuban shore,

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:14.851
looking out at that distant horizon,

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:19.205
believing, again,

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:22.430
that I'm going to make it all the way

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:26.505
across that vast,
dangerous wilderness of an ocean.

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:29.271
Not only have I tried four times,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.982
but the greatest swimmers in the world
have been trying since 1950,

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:35.722
and it's still never been done.

00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:40.774
The team is proud of our four attempts.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.860
It's an expedition of some 30 people.

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:47.838
Bonnie is my best friend and head handler,

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:51.124
who somehow summons will,

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:54.907
that last drop of will within me,
when I think it's gone,

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.883
after many, many hours and days out there.

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.892
The shark experts
are the best in the world --

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:03.334
large predators below.

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:09.503
The box jellyfish, the deadliest venom
in all of the ocean,

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.103
is in these waters,

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:14.946
and I have come close to dying from them
on a previous attempt.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.532
The conditions themselves,

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:22.802
besides the sheer distance
of over 100 miles in the open ocean --

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.862
the currents and whirling eddies
and the Gulf Stream itself,

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:31.794
the most unpredictable
of all of the planet Earth.

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:36.882
And by the way -- it's amusing to me

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:42.465
that journalists and people,
before these attempts, often ask me,

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:45.893
"Well, are you going to go with any boats
or any people or anything?"

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:47.380
(Laughter)

00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:49.540
And I'm thinking, what are they imagining?

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:52.584
That I'll just sort of do
some celestial navigation --

00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:53.715
(Laughter)

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.243
And carry a bowie knife in my mouth,

00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.806
and I'll hunt fish and skin them
alive and eat them,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.577
and maybe drag a desalinization plant
behind me for fresh water.

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:10.307
(Laughter)

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:11.588
Yes, I have a team.

00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:14.115
(Laughter)

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.418
And the team is expert,

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:18.590
and the team is courageous,

00:02:18.614 --> 00:02:22.776
and brimming with innovation
and scientific discovery,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.887
as is true of any major
expedition on the planet.

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:30.134
And we've been on a journey.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.179
And the debate has raged, hasn't it,

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:34.559
since the Greeks,

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.700
of isn't it what it's all about?

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:41.307
Isn't life about the journey,
not really the destination?

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:44.130
And here we've been on this journey,

00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:46.402
and the truth is, it's been thrilling.

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:48.173
We haven't reached that other shore,

00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:51.925
and still, our sense
of pride and commitment,

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.088
unwavering commitment.

00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:58.097
When I turned 60,
the dream was still alive

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:03.165
from having tried this in my 20s --
dreamed it and imagined it.

00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:08.908
The most famous body of water
on the Earth today, I imagine,

00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:10.346
Cuba to Florida.

00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:14.281
And it was deep. It was deep in my soul.

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:16.715
When I turned 60,

00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:20.040
it wasn't so much
about the athletic accomplishment,

00:03:20.064 --> 00:03:23.355
it wasn't the ego
of "I want to be the first."

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.633
That's always there and it's undeniable.

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:27.874
But it was deeper.

00:03:27.898 --> 00:03:29.931
It was "how much life is there left?"

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:32.766
Let's face it -- we're all
on a one-way street, aren't we?

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.762
And what are we going to do?

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:39.061
What are we going to do as we go forward,
to have no regrets looking back?

00:03:40.194 --> 00:03:42.832
And all this past year in training,

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:45.543
I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:47.820
to paraphrase it,
floating around in my brain.

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:49.659
It says, "You go ahead.

00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:52.779
You go ahead and sit back
in your comfortable chair

00:03:52.803 --> 00:03:55.731
and you be the critic,
you be the observer,

00:03:56.775 --> 00:04:00.169
while the brave one
gets in the ring and engages

00:04:00.943 --> 00:04:05.400
and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails
over and over and over again,

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:10.146
but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid
and lives life in a bold way."

00:04:10.944 --> 00:04:13.377
And so of course I want to make it across.

00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:18.244
It is the goal, and I should
be so shallow to say that this year,

00:04:18.673 --> 00:04:22.174
the destination was even sweeter
than the journey.

00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:24.101
(Laughter)

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:27.533
(Applause)

00:04:27.557 --> 00:04:29.934
But the journey itself
was worthwhile taking.

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:33.257
And at this point, by this summer,

00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:36.413
everybody -- scientists,
sports scientists,

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:40.070
endurance experts, neurologists,

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.713
my own team, Bonnie --

00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:47.007
said it's impossible.

00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:50.130
It just simply can't be done,
and Bonnie said to me,

00:04:50.154 --> 00:04:52.140
"But if you're going to take the journey,

00:04:52.164 --> 00:04:54.355
I'm going to see you
through to the end of it,

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.542
so I'll be there."

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:57.007
And now we're there.

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:03.005
As we're looking out,
kind of a surreal moment

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.333
before the first stroke,

00:05:04.357 --> 00:05:06.859
standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,

00:05:06.883 --> 00:05:09.552
the Cuban flag is flying above,

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:13.826
all my team is out in their boats,
hands up in the air,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.168
"We're here!

00:05:15.914 --> 00:05:17.093
We're here for you!"

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:21.106
Bonnie and I look at each other and say,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.379
this year, the mantra is --
and I've been using it in training --

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:26.372
Find a way.

00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:28.338
You have a dream

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.862
and you have obstacles
in front of you, as we all do.

00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:35.300
None of us ever get through this life

00:05:36.538 --> 00:05:37.860
without heartache,

00:05:40.058 --> 00:05:41.323
without turmoil,

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.173
and if you believe and you have faith

00:05:45.197 --> 00:05:47.569
and you can get knocked down
and get back up again

00:05:47.593 --> 00:05:50.494
and you believe in perseverance

00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:54.136
as a great human quality,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.449
you find your way.

00:05:55.473 --> 00:05:57.094
And Bonnie grabbed my shoulders,

00:05:57.118 --> 00:06:00.238
and she said, "Let's find
our way to Florida."

00:06:01.374 --> 00:06:03.923
And we started, and for the next 53 hours,

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:08.373
it was an intense,
unforgettable life experience.

00:06:09.647 --> 00:06:11.864
The highs were high, the awe --

00:06:11.888 --> 00:06:14.213
I'm not a religious person,
but I'll tell you,

00:06:14.237 --> 00:06:17.662
to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream

00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:19.566
as if, as you're breathing,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.609
you're looking down miles
and miles and miles,

00:06:24.253 --> 00:06:29.162
to feel the majesty
of this blue planet we live on --

00:06:29.186 --> 00:06:32.576
it's awe-inspiring.

00:06:33.055 --> 00:06:35.533
I have a playlist of about 85 songs,

00:06:35.557 --> 00:06:37.670
and especially in the middle
of the night ...

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:40.810
That night, because we use
no lights -- lights attract jellyfish,

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.030
lights attract sharks,

00:06:42.054 --> 00:06:44.415
lights attract baitfish
that attract sharks,

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:46.916
so we go in the pitch black of the night.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.403
You've never seen black this black.

00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:52.333
You can't see the front of your hand,

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:55.346
and the people on the boat,
Bonnie and my team on the boat --

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.403
they just hear the slapping of the arms,

00:06:57.427 --> 00:06:58.618
and they know where I am,

00:06:58.642 --> 00:07:00.560
because there's no visual at all.

00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:04.697
And I'm out there kind of tripping out
on my little playlist.

00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:07.225
(Laughter)

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:10.293
I've got tight rubber caps,
I don't hear a thing.

00:07:10.317 --> 00:07:13.434
I've got goggles and I'm turning
my head 50 times a minute,

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:14.733
and I'm singing ...

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.099
(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven

00:07:18.123 --> 00:07:19.710
(Laughter)

00:07:19.734 --> 00:07:21.416
doo doo doo doo doo

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.260
It's easy if you try

00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:25.488
doo doo doo doo doo

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:28.046
And I can sing that song
a thousand times in a row.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.305
(Laughter)

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:32.955
Now there's a talent unto itself.

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.783
(Laughter)

00:07:34.807 --> 00:07:37.387
(Applause)

00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:39.785
And each time I get done with,

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:44.629
(Singing) Oh, you may say I'm a dreamer
but I'm not the only one

00:07:46.627 --> 00:07:48.157
222.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.006
(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.112
(Laughter)

00:07:54.136 --> 00:07:55.651
And when I get through the end

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:57.731
of a thousand of John Lennon's "Imagine,"

00:07:57.755 --> 00:08:00.003
I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes ...

00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:01.958
exactly.

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:04.379
(Laughter)

00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:06.355
And then there are the crises.

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:07.529
Of course there are.

00:08:08.957 --> 00:08:12.275
And the vomiting starts,
the seawater -- you're not well.

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:15.908
You're wearing a jellyfish mask
for the ultimate protection.

00:08:15.932 --> 00:08:17.391
It's difficult to swim in.

00:08:17.415 --> 00:08:20.049
It's causing abrasions
on the inside of the mouth,

00:08:20.073 --> 00:08:21.881
but the tentacles can't get you.

00:08:22.707 --> 00:08:25.268
And the hypothermia sets in.

00:08:25.292 --> 00:08:28.677
The water's 85 degrees,
and yet you're losing weight

00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.020
and using calories.

00:08:30.044 --> 00:08:32.482
And as you come over
toward the side of the boat --

00:08:32.506 --> 00:08:34.846
not allowed to touch it,
not allowed to get out,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.000
but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition

00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:40.353
and ask me how I'm doing, am I all right.

00:08:40.377 --> 00:08:43.236
I am seeing the Taj Mahal --

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.481
(Laughter)

00:08:44.505 --> 00:08:45.788
Over here.

00:08:45.812 --> 00:08:49.575
I'm in a very different state --

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:50.971
(Laughter)

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:53.757
And I'm thinking, "Wow!

00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:57.370
I never thought I'd be running
into the Taj Mahal out here.

00:08:57.663 --> 00:08:59.424
It's gorgeous!

00:08:59.448 --> 00:09:02.037
I mean, how long
did it take them to build that?

00:09:02.061 --> 00:09:03.748
It's just ...

00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:06.415
So, uh -- wooo -- you know?

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:09.618
(Laughter)

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:12.494
We kind of have a cardinal rule

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:15.987
that I'm never told how far it is,
because we don't know how far it is.

00:09:16.011 --> 00:09:19.188
What's going to happen to you
between this point and that point?

00:09:19.212 --> 00:09:21.816
What's going to happen
to the weather and the currents

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.800
and, God forbid, you're stung,

00:09:23.824 --> 00:09:27.718
when you don't think you could
be stung in all this armor.

00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:31.623
Bonnie made a decision
coming into that third morning

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.543
that I was suffering,

00:09:34.567 --> 00:09:37.880
and I was hanging on by a thread.

00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:39.704
And she said, "Come here,"

00:09:39.728 --> 00:09:41.815
and I came close
to the boat, and she said,

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:43.037
"Look, look out there."

00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:44.214
And I saw light,

00:09:44.238 --> 00:09:46.240
because the day is easier than the night,

00:09:46.264 --> 00:09:48.094
and I thought we were coming into day.

00:09:48.118 --> 00:09:51.776
I saw a stream of white light
along the horizon,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.078
and I said, "It's going
to be morning soon."

00:09:54.102 --> 00:09:57.366
And she said, "No, those
are the lights of Key West."

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.492
It was 15 more hours,

00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:03.725
which for most swimmers
would be a long time.

00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:06.875
(Laughter)

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:10.216
(Applause)

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.244
You have no idea how many
15-hour training swims I had done.

00:10:14.785 --> 00:10:18.602
So here we go, and I somehow,
without a decision,

00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:20.944
went into no counting of strokes

00:10:20.968 --> 00:10:22.277
and no singing

00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:27.492
and no quoting Stephen Hawking
on the parameters of the universe.

00:10:27.516 --> 00:10:33.743
I just went into thinking
about this dream, and why and how.

00:10:34.188 --> 00:10:36.330
As I said, when I turned 60,

00:10:36.354 --> 00:10:40.358
it wasn't about that concrete
"Can you do it?"

00:10:40.382 --> 00:10:43.318
That's the everyday machinations.

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:46.089
That's the discipline,
and it's the preparation,

00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:47.818
and there's a pride in that.

00:10:47.842 --> 00:10:51.732
But I decided to think, as I went along,

00:10:52.391 --> 00:10:56.256
about -- you know, the phrase usually is,
"reaching for the stars."

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.843
And in my case,
it's reaching for the horizon.

00:10:59.438 --> 00:11:01.309
And when you reach for the horizon,

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:03.451
as I've proven, you may not get there.

00:11:04.036 --> 00:11:09.463
But what a tremendous build
of character and spirit

00:11:10.392 --> 00:11:12.385
that you lay down;

00:11:12.409 --> 00:11:16.299
what a foundation you lay down
in reaching for those horizons.

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:19.742
And now, the shore is coming.

00:11:20.432 --> 00:11:22.976
And there's just a little part
of me that's sad.

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:25.796
The epic journey is going to be over.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.886
So many people come up to me now and say,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.103
"What's next?"

00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:30.549
(Laughter)

00:11:30.573 --> 00:11:31.878
"We love that!"

00:11:31.902 --> 00:11:32.989
(Laughter)

00:11:33.013 --> 00:11:34.893
"That little tracker on the computer?

00:11:34.917 --> 00:11:36.758
When are you going to do the next one?

00:11:36.782 --> 00:11:38.614
We can't wait to follow the next one."

00:11:38.638 --> 00:11:40.818
Well, they were just there for 53 hours,

00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:42.787
and I was there for years.

00:11:43.229 --> 00:11:46.634
And so there won't be another
epic journey in the ocean.

00:11:46.658 --> 00:11:50.209
But the point is, and the point was,

00:11:50.233 --> 00:11:54.486
that every day of our lives is epic.

00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:57.889
And I'll tell you,
when I walked up onto that beach,

00:11:57.913 --> 00:11:59.751
staggered up onto that beach ...

00:11:59.908 --> 00:12:06.335
I had so many times,
in a very puffed-up ego way,

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:08.394
rehearsed what I would say ...

00:12:08.418 --> 00:12:10.065
(Laughter)

00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:11.339
on the beach.

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:14.303
When Bonnie thought the back
of my throat was swelling up,

00:12:14.327 --> 00:12:16.496
she brought the medical team
over to our boat

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.728
to say, "She's really beginning
to have trouble breathing;

00:12:20.752 --> 00:12:23.807
another 12, 24 hours
in the saltwater ..." --

00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:27.576
the whole thing -- I just thought,
in my hallucinatory moment,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.986
that I heard the word "tracheotomy."

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.340
(Laughter)

00:12:32.871 --> 00:12:36.141
Bonnie said to the doctor,
"I'm not worried about her not breathing.

00:12:36.165 --> 00:12:38.306
If she can't talk
when she gets to the shore,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.857
she's going to be pissed off."

00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:45.088
(Laughter)

00:12:45.112 --> 00:12:49.017
But the truth is, all those orations
that I had practiced,

00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:52.917
just to get myself through some
training swims as motivation --

00:12:52.941 --> 00:12:54.409
it wasn't like that.

00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:56.881
It was a very real moment,

00:12:56.905 --> 00:12:58.929
with that crowd, with my team.

00:12:59.368 --> 00:13:01.853
We did it. I didn't do it. We did it.

00:13:01.877 --> 00:13:04.654
And we'll never forget it.
It'll always be part of us.

00:13:05.181 --> 00:13:09.199
The three things I did sort of blurt out
when we got there, was first:

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.386
Never, ever give up.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.952
I live it.

00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:16.275
What's the phrase
from today from Socrates?

00:13:16.867 --> 00:13:18.063
Audience: To be is to do.

00:13:18.087 --> 00:13:19.395
Diana Nyad: To be is to do.

00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:22.408
So I don't stand up and say,
"Don't ever give up."

00:13:22.432 --> 00:13:23.784
I didn't give up.

00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.268
There was action behind these words.

00:13:26.292 --> 00:13:27.986
The second is:

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.286
You can chase your dreams
at any age; you're never too old.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:36.389
Sixty-four; a thing no one,
at any age, any gender, could ever do

00:13:36.413 --> 00:13:37.569
has done it.

00:13:37.593 --> 00:13:39.132
And there's no doubt in my mind

00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:41.824
that I am at the prime of my life today.

00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:44.652
(Applause)

00:13:44.676 --> 00:13:45.924
Yeah.

00:13:45.948 --> 00:13:50.234
(Applause)

00:13:50.258 --> 00:13:51.434
Thank you.

00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:54.224
And the third thing
I said on that beach was,

00:13:54.248 --> 00:13:56.900
it looks like the most solitary
endeavor in the world,

00:13:56.924 --> 00:13:59.027
and in many ways, of course, it is.

00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:02.700
And in other ways,
and the most important ways,

00:14:02.724 --> 00:14:03.912
it's a team.

00:14:03.936 --> 00:14:06.645
And if you think I'm a badass,
you want to meet Bonnie.

00:14:06.669 --> 00:14:08.121
(Laughter)

00:14:08.145 --> 00:14:09.403
Bonnie, where are you?

00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:12.014
Where are you?

00:14:13.236 --> 00:14:14.615
There's Bonnie Stoll.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:17.026
(Applause)

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.344
My buddy.

00:14:18.368 --> 00:14:21.373
(Applause)

00:14:21.397 --> 00:14:23.717
The Henry David Thoreau quote goes,

00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:27.011
"When you achieve your dreams,
it's not so much what you get

00:14:27.035 --> 00:14:29.333
as who you have become in achieving them."

00:14:29.904 --> 00:14:31.815
And yeah, I stand before you now.

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.839
In the three months since that swim ended,

00:14:33.863 --> 00:14:35.667
I've sat down with Oprah,

00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:39.449
and I've been in
President Obama's Oval Office;

00:14:39.473 --> 00:14:42.024
I've been invited to speak
in front of esteemed groups

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.199
such as yourselves;

00:14:43.223 --> 00:14:45.474
I've signed a wonderful
major book contract.

00:14:45.498 --> 00:14:48.209
All of that's great,
and I don't denigrate it.

00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:50.124
I'm proud of it all, but the truth is,

00:14:50.148 --> 00:14:51.441
I'm walking around tall

00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:57.408
because I am that bold, fearless person,
and I will be, every day,

00:14:57.432 --> 00:15:01.581
until it's time for these days to be done.

00:15:01.605 --> 00:15:03.763
Thank you very much
and enjoy the conference.

00:15:03.787 --> 00:15:05.894
Thank you. Thank you!

00:15:05.918 --> 00:15:08.657
(Applause)

00:15:08.681 --> 00:15:12.442
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you! Thank you.

00:15:12.466 --> 00:15:15.171
(Applause)

00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:16.612
Find a way!

00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:18.621
(Applause)
