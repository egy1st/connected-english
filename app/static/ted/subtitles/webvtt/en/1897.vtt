00:00:00.904 --> 00:00:03.428
I want you to, for a moment,

00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:06.522
think about playing a game of Monopoly.

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:12.508
Except in this game,
that combination of skill, talent and luck

00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:15.287
that helped earn you success
in games, as in life,

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:16.712
has been rendered irrelevant,

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:18.892
because this game's been rigged,

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:20.391
and you've got the upper hand.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:22.579
You've got more money,

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:25.140
more opportunities to move
around the board,

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:26.906
and more access to resources.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:29.268
And as you think about that experience,

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:30.718
I want you to ask yourself:

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:36.152
How might that experience of being
a privileged player in a rigged game

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:38.470
change the way you think about yourself

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:41.580
and regard that other player?

00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:45.995
So, we ran a study
on the UC Berkeley campus

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.259
to look at exactly that question.

00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:51.976
We brought in more than 100 pairs
of strangers into the lab,

00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:54.571
and with the flip of a coin,

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:58.636
randomly assigned one of the two
to be a rich player in a rigged game.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.406
They got two times as much money;

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:04.561
when they passed Go,
they collected twice the salary;

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.620
and they got to roll
both dice instead of one,

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:09.938
so they got to move
around the board a lot more.

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:11.568
(Laughter)

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:13.726
And over the course of 15 minutes,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.241
we watched through
hidden cameras what happened.

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:19.353
What I want to do today,
for the first time,

00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:21.525
is show you a little bit of what we saw.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.850
You'll to have to pardon
the sound quality,

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:25.847
because again, these were hidden cameras.

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:27.556
So we've provided subtitles.

00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:30.266
[Video] Rich Player: How many
500s did you have?

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.441
Poor Player: Just one.

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:32.885
RP: Are you serious?
PP: Yeah.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.040
RP: I have three. (Laughs)
I don't know why they gave me so much.

00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:39.429
Paul Piff: So it was quickly apparent
to players that something was up.

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:42.580
One person clearly has
a lot more money than the other person,

00:01:42.604 --> 00:01:45.160
and yet, as the game unfolded,

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:49.714
we saw very notable differences,
dramatic differences begin to emerge

00:01:49.738 --> 00:01:51.147
between the two players.

00:01:51.488 --> 00:01:55.807
The rich player started to move
around the board louder,

00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.855
literally smacking the board
with the piece as he went around.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:00.586
(Game piece smacks board)

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.559
We were more likely
to see signs of dominance

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:07.596
and nonverbal signs, displays of power

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.294
and celebration among the rich players.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.185
We had a bowl of pretzels
positioned off to the side.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.751
It's on the bottom right corner.

00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:19.234
That allowed us to watch
participants' consummatory behavior.

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:22.236
So we're just tracking
how many pretzels participants eat.

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:25.729
[Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick?

00:02:25.753 --> 00:02:27.297
PP: I don't know.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:30.828
Paul Piff: OK, so no surprises,
people are on to us.

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:34.344
They wonder what that bowl of pretzels
is doing there in the first place.

00:02:34.368 --> 00:02:36.002
One even asks, like you just saw,

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:38.684
"Is that bowl of pretzels
there as a trick?"

00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:42.079
And yet, despite that,
the power of the situation

00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:44.313
seems to inevitably dominate,

00:02:44.337 --> 00:02:47.372
and those rich players
start to eat more pretzels.

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:48.782
(Laughter)

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.702
[Video] RP: I love pretzels.

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:55.396
(Laughter)

00:02:58.314 --> 00:03:00.316
Paul Piff: And as the game went on,

00:03:00.448 --> 00:03:02.923
one of the really interesting
and dramatic patterns

00:03:02.947 --> 00:03:05.599
that we observed begin to emerge

00:03:06.254 --> 00:03:09.056
was that the rich players
actually started to become ruder

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.492
toward the other person --

00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:14.705
less and less sensitive to the plight
of those poor, poor players,

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.735
and more and more demonstrative
of their material success,

00:03:19.288 --> 00:03:21.741
more likely to showcase
how well they're doing.

00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:25.717
[Video] RP: I have money ...

00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:27.637
(Laughs) I have money for everything.

00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:29.486
PP: How much is that?

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.737
RP: You owe me 24 dollars.

00:03:33.404 --> 00:03:36.111
You're going to lose all your money soon.

00:03:36.135 --> 00:03:38.271
I'll buy it. I have so much money.

00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:40.321
I have so much money, it takes me forever.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.434
RP 2: I'm going
to buy out this whole board.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:44.539
RP 3: You're going
to run out of money soon.

00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:46.611
I'm pretty much untouchable at this point.

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:48.223
(Laughter)

00:03:48.247 --> 00:03:51.432
Paul Piff: And here's what I think
was really, really interesting:

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:53.646
it's that, at the end of the 15 minutes,

00:03:54.298 --> 00:03:57.672
we asked the players to talk
about their experience during the game.

00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:02.733
And when the rich players talked
about why they had inevitably won

00:04:02.757 --> 00:04:04.429
in this rigged game of Monopoly ...

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:08.527
(Laughter)

00:04:09.468 --> 00:04:15.816
They talked about what they'd done
to buy those different properties

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.805
and earn their success in the game.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.863
(Laughter)

00:04:18.887 --> 00:04:21.287
And they became far less attuned

00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:23.823
to all those different
features of the situation --

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.860
including that flip of a coin --

00:04:26.503 --> 00:04:30.502
that had randomly gotten them
into that privileged position

00:04:30.526 --> 00:04:31.829
in the first place.

00:04:31.853 --> 00:04:34.686
And that's a really,
really incredible insight

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.371
into how the mind
makes sense of advantage.

00:04:40.101 --> 00:04:42.279
Now, this game of Monopoly can be used

00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:47.262
as a metaphor for understanding society
and its hierarchical structure,

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:50.903
wherein some people
have a lot of wealth and a lot of status,

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:52.411
and a lot of people don't;

00:04:52.435 --> 00:04:55.324
they have a lot less wealth
and a lot less status

00:04:55.348 --> 00:04:58.396
and a lot less access to valued resources.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.802
And what my colleagues and I
for the last seven years have been doing

00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:04.666
is studying the effects
of these kinds of hierarchies.

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:09.085
What we've been finding
across dozens of studies

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:12.385
and thousands of participants
across this country

00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:16.366
is that as a person's levels
of wealth increase,

00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:20.863
their feelings of compassion
and empathy go down,

00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:26.764
and their feelings of entitlement,
of deservingness,

00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:30.348
and their ideology
of self-interest increase.

00:05:31.284 --> 00:05:32.877
In surveys, we've found

00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:36.764
that it's actually wealthier individuals
who are more likely to moralize

00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:38.495
greed being good,

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:42.487
and that the pursuit of self-interest
is favorable and moral.

00:05:43.063 --> 00:05:46.693
Now, what I want to do today
is talk about some of the implications

00:05:46.717 --> 00:05:48.612
of this ideology self-interest,

00:05:49.668 --> 00:05:52.312
talk about why we should
care about those implications,

00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:53.935
and end with what might be done.

00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:57.982
Some of the first studies
that we ran in this area

00:05:58.006 --> 00:05:59.342
looked at helping behavior,

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:02.573
something social psychologists
call "pro-social behavior."

00:06:03.453 --> 00:06:04.902
And we were really interested

00:06:04.926 --> 00:06:08.327
in who's more likely
to offer help to another person:

00:06:08.444 --> 00:06:10.674
someone who's rich or someone who's poor.

00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:12.823
In one of the studies,

00:06:12.847 --> 00:06:18.277
we bring rich and poor members
of the community into the lab,

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.213
and give each of them
the equivalent of 10 dollars.

00:06:21.785 --> 00:06:25.997
We told the participants they could keep
these 10 dollars for themselves,

00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:28.909
or they could share
a portion of it, if they wanted to,

00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:31.277
with a stranger, who's totally anonymous.

00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:34.558
They'll never meet that stranger;
the stranger will never meet them.

00:06:34.582 --> 00:06:36.832
And we just monitor how much people give.

00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:42.203
Individuals who made 25,000,
sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year,

00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:45.544
gave 44 percent more
of their money to the stranger

00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:49.273
than did individuals making
150,000, 200,000 dollars a year.

00:06:50.983 --> 00:06:53.020
We've had people play games

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:56.475
to see who's more or less likely to cheat

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.853
to increase their chances
of winning a prize.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.626
In one of the games,
we actually rigged a computer

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.330
so that die rolls over a certain score
were impossible --

00:07:05.354 --> 00:07:09.446
You couldn't get above 12
in this game, and yet ...

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:13.753
the richer you were, the more likely
you were to cheat in this game

00:07:13.777 --> 00:07:16.502
to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize --

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:19.384
sometimes by three to four times as much.

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:22.270
We ran another study

00:07:22.294 --> 00:07:26.085
where we looked at whether people
would be inclined to take candy

00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:29.114
from a jar of candy
that we explicitly identified

00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:31.018
as being reserved for children --

00:07:31.042 --> 00:07:34.638
(Laughter)

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:38.816
I'm not kidding -- I know it sounds
like I'm making a joke.

00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:41.451
We explicitly told participants:

00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:45.808
"This candy is for children participating
in a developmental lab nearby.

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.961
They're in studies. This is for them."

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:50.909
And we just monitored
how much candy participants took.

00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:54.482
Participants who felt rich
took two times as much candy

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.159
as participants who felt poor.

00:07:57.675 --> 00:07:59.632
We've even studied cars.

00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:01.984
Not just any cars,

00:08:02.008 --> 00:08:05.272
but whether drivers
of different kinds of cars

00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:08.314
are more or less inclined
to break the law.

00:08:08.338 --> 00:08:09.850
In one of these studies,

00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:15.285
we looked at whether drivers
would stop for a pedestrian

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:18.169
that we had posed waiting
to cross at a crosswalk.

00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:20.041
Now in California, as you all know,

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:22.469
because I'm sure we all do this,

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:26.014
it's the law to stop for a pedestrian
who's waiting to cross.

00:08:26.434 --> 00:08:28.276
So here's an example of how we did it.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.843
That's our confederate off to the left,
posing as a pedestrian.

00:08:31.867 --> 00:08:35.849
He approaches as the red truck
successfully stops.

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:37.998
In typical California fashion,

00:08:38.022 --> 00:08:40.991
it's overtaken by the bus
who almost runs our pedestrian over.

00:08:41.015 --> 00:08:42.368
(Laughter)

00:08:42.392 --> 00:08:44.597
Now here's an example
of a more expensive car,

00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:48.868
a Prius, driving through,
and a BMW doing the same.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.005
So we did this for hundreds of vehicles

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:56.488
on several days,

00:08:56.512 --> 00:08:58.936
just tracking who stops and who doesn't.

00:09:00.587 --> 00:09:04.840
What we found was as the expensiveness
of a car increased ...

00:09:04.864 --> 00:09:06.936
(Laughter)

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.191
the drivers' tendencies
to break the law increased as well.

00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:13.016
None of the cars -- none of the cars --

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.111
in our least expensive car category

00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:17.293
broke the law.

00:09:17.793 --> 00:09:22.636
Close to 50 percent of the cars
in our most expensive vehicle category

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.859
broke the law.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.798
We've run other studies,

00:09:26.822 --> 00:09:30.709
finding that wealthier individuals
are more likely to lie in negotiations,

00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:32.924
to endorse unethical behavior at work,

00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:35.548
like stealing cash from the cash register,

00:09:35.662 --> 00:09:38.451
taking bribes, lying to customers.

00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:42.290
Now, I don't mean to suggest

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:45.888
that it's only wealthy people
who show these patterns of behavior.

00:09:45.912 --> 00:09:48.718
Not at all -- in fact,
I think that we all,

00:09:48.742 --> 00:09:51.661
in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,

00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:54.534
struggle with these competing motivations

00:09:54.558 --> 00:10:00.249
of when or if to put our own interests
above the interests of other people.

00:10:00.273 --> 00:10:02.549
And that's understandable,

00:10:02.573 --> 00:10:05.470
because the American dream is an idea

00:10:05.494 --> 00:10:10.329
in which we all have an equal opportunity
to succeed and prosper,

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:12.909
as long as we apply
ourselves and work hard.

00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:15.642
And a piece of that means that sometimes,

00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:18.595
you need to put your own interests

00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:22.128
above the interests and well-being
of other people around you.

00:10:22.152 --> 00:10:25.523
But what we're finding
is that the wealthier you are,

00:10:25.547 --> 00:10:29.387
the more likely you are to pursue
a vision of personal success,

00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:31.736
of achievement and accomplishment,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.948
to the detriment of others around you.

00:10:34.927 --> 00:10:38.200
Here I've plotted for you
the mean household income

00:10:38.224 --> 00:10:41.460
received by each fifth
and top five percent of the population

00:10:41.484 --> 00:10:42.912
over the last 20 years.

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:44.813
In 1993,

00:10:44.837 --> 00:10:47.963
the differences between the different
quintiles of the population,

00:10:47.987 --> 00:10:49.175
in terms of income,

00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:51.271
are fairly egregious.

00:10:51.732 --> 00:10:54.422
It's not difficult to discern
that there are differences.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.275
But over the last 20 years,
that significant difference

00:10:57.299 --> 00:10:59.591
has become a Grand Canyon of sorts

00:10:59.615 --> 00:11:02.639
between those at the top
and everyone else.

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:06.297
In fact, the top 20 percent
of our population

00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:09.420
own close to 90 percent
of the total wealth in this country.

00:11:09.444 --> 00:11:13.123
We're at unprecedented levels
of economic inequality.

00:11:15.858 --> 00:11:19.699
What that means is that wealth is not only
becoming increasingly concentrated

00:11:19.723 --> 00:11:22.657
in the hands of a select group
of individuals,

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:27.009
but the American dream
is becoming increasingly unattainable

00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:29.375
for an increasing majority of us.

00:11:30.227 --> 00:11:33.026
And if it's the case,
as we've been finding,

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.499
that the wealthier you are,

00:11:34.523 --> 00:11:37.042
the more entitled you feel to that wealth,

00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:40.064
and the more likely you are
to prioritize your own interests

00:11:40.088 --> 00:11:41.844
above the interests of other people,

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:45.393
and be willing to do things
to serve that self-interest,

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:49.084
well, then, there's no reason to think
that those patterns will change.

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:52.640
In fact, there's every reason
to think that they'll only get worse,

00:11:52.664 --> 00:11:55.850
and that's what it would look like
if things just stayed the same,

00:11:55.874 --> 00:11:58.932
at the same linear rate,
over the next 20 years.

00:12:00.162 --> 00:12:02.902
Now inequality -- economic inequality --

00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:05.125
is something we should
all be concerned about,

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:08.752
and not just because of those
at the bottom of the social hierarchy,

00:12:08.776 --> 00:12:11.120
but because individuals and groups

00:12:11.144 --> 00:12:15.617
with lots of economic
inequality do worse ...

00:12:16.349 --> 00:12:18.643
not just the people
at the bottom, everyone.

00:12:19.206 --> 00:12:21.273
There's a lot of really
compelling research

00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:23.957
coming out from top labs
all over the world,

00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:28.631
showcasing the range of things
that are undermined

00:12:28.655 --> 00:12:31.171
as economic inequality gets worse.

00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:34.024
Social mobility,
things we really care about,

00:12:34.048 --> 00:12:36.506
physical health, social trust,

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.462
all go down as inequality goes up.

00:12:39.486 --> 00:12:44.011
Similarly, negative things
in social collectives and societies,

00:12:44.035 --> 00:12:46.115
things like obesity, and violence,

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:47.737
imprisonment, and punishment,

00:12:47.761 --> 00:12:51.887
are exacerbated as economic
inequality increases.

00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:55.454
Again, these are outcomes
not just experienced by a few,

00:12:55.478 --> 00:12:58.916
but that resound
across all strata of society.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.600
Even people at the top
experience these outcomes.

00:13:02.219 --> 00:13:04.156
So what do we do?

00:13:05.307 --> 00:13:08.889
This cascade of self-perpetuating,

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.398
pernicious, negative effects

00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:14.818
could seem like something
that's spun out of control,

00:13:14.842 --> 00:13:16.730
and there's nothing we can do about it,

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:19.009
certainly nothing
we as individuals could do.

00:13:19.558 --> 00:13:25.647
But in fact, we've been finding
in our own laboratory research

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.100
that small psychological interventions,

00:13:31.695 --> 00:13:34.714
small changes to people's values,

00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:38.188
small nudges in certain directions,

00:13:38.212 --> 00:13:41.346
can restore levels
of egalitarianism and empathy.

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:46.032
For instance, reminding people
of the benefits of cooperation

00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:47.951
or the advantages of community,

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:52.773
cause wealthier individuals
to be just as egalitarian

00:13:52.797 --> 00:13:54.122
as poor people.

00:13:55.369 --> 00:14:00.894
In one study, we had people watch
a brief video, just 46 seconds long,

00:14:00.918 --> 00:14:02.336
about childhood poverty

00:14:03.144 --> 00:14:07.345
that served as a reminder of the needs
of others in the world around them.

00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:10.152
And after watching that,

00:14:10.176 --> 00:14:13.632
we looked at how willing people
were to offer up their own time

00:14:14.242 --> 00:14:18.273
to a stranger presented to them
in the lab, who was in distress.

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:22.246
After watching this video, an hour later,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.650
rich people became
just as generous of their own time

00:14:25.674 --> 00:14:27.820
to help out this other person, a stranger,

00:14:27.844 --> 00:14:29.289
as someone who's poor,

00:14:29.313 --> 00:14:33.571
suggesting that these differences
are not innate or categorical,

00:14:33.595 --> 00:14:37.351
but are so malleable
to slight changes in people's values,

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:40.783
and little nudges of compassion
and bumps of empathy.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:42.749
And beyond the walls of our lab,

00:14:42.773 --> 00:14:46.052
we're even beginning to see
signs of change in society.

00:14:46.893 --> 00:14:50.041
Bill Gates, one of our nation's
wealthiest individuals,

00:14:50.065 --> 00:14:51.993
in his Harvard commencement speech,

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:54.878
talked about the problem
of inequality facing society

00:14:54.902 --> 00:14:57.565
as being the most daunting challenge,

00:14:57.589 --> 00:15:00.423
and talked about what must
be done to combat it,

00:15:00.447 --> 00:15:05.465
saying, "Humanity's greatest advances
are not in its discoveries --

00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:08.521
but in how those discoveries are applied

00:15:08.545 --> 00:15:10.333
to reduce inequity."

00:15:11.356 --> 00:15:13.285
And there's the Giving Pledge,

00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:17.236
in which more than 100
of our nation's wealthiest individuals

00:15:18.077 --> 00:15:21.259
are pledging half
of their fortunes to charity.

00:15:21.886 --> 00:15:26.358
And there's the emergence of dozens
of grassroots movements,

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:28.889
like "We are the 1 percent,"

00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:30.991
"Resource Generation,"

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.445
or "Wealth for Common Good,"

00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:37.808
in which the most privileged
members of the population,

00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:40.776
members of the one percent and elsewhere,

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.539
people who are wealthy,

00:15:42.662 --> 00:15:46.115
are using their own economic resources,

00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:50.372
adults and youth alike --
that's what's most striking to me --

00:15:50.396 --> 00:15:53.957
leveraging their own privilege,
their own economic resources,

00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:56.822
to combat inequality

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:59.288
by advocating for social policies,

00:15:59.866 --> 00:16:01.724
changes in social values

00:16:01.748 --> 00:16:04.006
and changes in people's behavior

00:16:04.143 --> 00:16:07.183
that work against
their own economic interests,

00:16:07.207 --> 00:16:10.385
but that may ultimately
restore the American dream.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.640
Thank you.

00:16:12.664 --> 00:16:17.999
(Applause)
