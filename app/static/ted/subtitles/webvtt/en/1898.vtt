00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:02.762
Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:04.051
(Cheering)

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:05.491
Not good enough.

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:07.880
Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.825
(Loud cheering)

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.350
My name is Maysoon Zayid,

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:14.238
and I am not drunk,

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:16.929
but the doctor who delivered me was.

00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:20.483
He cut my mom six different times

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:23.293
in six different directions,

00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:25.561
suffocating poor little me in the process.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:28.553
As a result, I have cerebral palsy,

00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:31.355
which means I shake all the time.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.379
Look.

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:35.419
It's exhausting.

00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:39.216
I'm like Shakira,
Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.469
(Laughter)

00:00:42.493 --> 00:00:44.065
CP is not genetic.

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:47.213
It's not a birth defect.
You can't catch it.

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:50.411
No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:53.800
and I didn't get it because
my parents are first cousins,

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:55.148
which they are.

00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:59.514
(Laughter)

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:01.728
It only happens from accidents,

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:03.996
like what happened to me on my birth day.

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:06.529
Now, I must warn you,

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:07.829
I'm not inspirational.

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:09.473
(Laughter)

00:01:09.497 --> 00:01:13.443
And I don't want anyone in this room
to feel bad for me,

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:15.673
because at some point in your life,

00:01:15.697 --> 00:01:18.086
you have dreamt of being disabled.

00:01:18.887 --> 00:01:20.443
Come on a journey with me.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.049
It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,

00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:27.365
you're driving around in circles
looking for parking,

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:29.054
and what do you see?

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.190
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.

00:01:32.214 --> 00:01:34.721
(Laughter)

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:37.758
And you're like, "God,
can't I just be a little disabled?"

00:01:37.782 --> 00:01:43.392
(Laughter)

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:44.995
Also, I've got to tell you,

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:48.691
I've got 99 problems,
and palsy is just one.

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:49.738
(Laughter)

00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:52.328
If there was an Oppression Olympics,

00:01:52.352 --> 00:01:54.085
I would win the gold medal.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.242
I'm Palestinian, Muslim,

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.590
I'm female, I'm disabled,

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.483
and I live in New Jersey.

00:02:01.507 --> 00:02:04.454
(Laughter)

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:07.721
(Applause)

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.546
If you don't feel better
about yourself, maybe you should.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.601
(Laughter)

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.952
Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.

00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:16.549
I have always loved the fact

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:20.583
that my hood and my affliction
share the same initials.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.045
I also love the fact

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.264
that if I wanted to walk
from my house to New York City, I could.

00:02:25.764 --> 00:02:28.316
A lot of people with CP don't walk,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.253
but my parents didn't believe in "can't."

00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:33.448
My father's mantra was,

00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:36.528
"You can do it, yes you can can."

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:40.067
(Laughter)

00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:43.119
So, if my three older sisters
were mopping,

00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:44.310
I was mopping.

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:47.143
If my three older sisters
went to public school,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.160
my parents would sue the school system

00:02:49.184 --> 00:02:51.407
and guarantee that I went too,

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:53.197
and if we didn't all get A's,

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:55.349
we all got my mother's slipper.

00:02:55.373 --> 00:02:58.153
(Laughter)

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:01.078
My father taught me how to walk
when I was five years old

00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:03.387
by placing my heels on his feet

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:04.721
and just walking.

00:03:05.364 --> 00:03:07.043
Another tactic that he used

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:09.966
is he would dangle
a dollar bill in front of me

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.687
and have me chase it.

00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:14.035
(Laughter)

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.797
My inner stripper was very strong.

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.410
(Laughter)

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:19.463
Yeah.

00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:21.780
No, by the first day of kindergarten,

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:23.082
I was walking like a champ

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:25.463
who had been punched one too many times.

00:03:25.487 --> 00:03:26.876
(Laughter)

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.396
Growing up, there were
only six Arabs in my town,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.772
and they were all my family.

00:03:31.796 --> 00:03:32.820
(Laughter)

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:34.927
Now there are 20 Arabs in town,

00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:36.769
and they are still all my family.

00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:37.826
(Laughter)

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.555
I don't think anyone
even noticed we weren't Italian.

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.550
(Laughter)

00:03:44.574 --> 00:03:48.287
(Applause)

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.002
This was before 9/11

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:53.018
and before politicians
thought it was appropriate

00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:56.477
to use "I hate Muslims"
as a campaign slogan.

00:03:57.096 --> 00:04:00.287
The people that I grew up with
had no problem with my faith.

00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:02.731
They did, however, seem very concerned

00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:05.411
that I would starve
to death during Ramadan.

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:07.586
I would explain to them
that I have enough fat

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.602
to live off of for three whole months,

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:12.972
so fasting from sunrise
to sunset is a piece of cake.

00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:13.996
(Laughter)

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:16.665
I have tap-danced on Broadway.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.566
Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.669
(Applause)

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.811
My parents couldn't
afford physical therapy,

00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:25.378
so they sent me to dancing school.

00:04:25.402 --> 00:04:27.048
I learned how to dance in heels,

00:04:27.072 --> 00:04:28.990
which means I can walk in heels.

00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:30.151
And I'm from Jersey,

00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:33.188
and we are really concerned
with being chic,

00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:36.487
so if my friends wore heels, so did I.

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:39.505
And when my friends went
and spent their summer vacations

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.317
on the Jersey Shore, I did not.

00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:44.555
I spent my summers in a war zone,

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:46.626
because my parents were afraid

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.524
that if we didn't go back to Palestine
every single summer,

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:52.559
we'd grow up to be Madonna.

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:57.960
(Laughter)

00:04:57.984 --> 00:05:03.049
Summer vacations often consisted
of my father trying to heal me,

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:04.846
so I drank deer's milk,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.888
I had hot cups on my back,

00:05:06.912 --> 00:05:08.873
I was dunked in the Dead Sea,

00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:11.482
and I remember the water burning my eyes

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:13.971
and thinking, "It's working!
It's working!"

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:17.272
(Laughter)

00:05:17.296 --> 00:05:20.208
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:23.971
I have to tell you, it's very boring,

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:25.450
but before I did yoga,

00:05:25.474 --> 00:05:28.121
I was a stand-up comedian
who can't stand up.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.180
And now I can stand on my head.

00:05:31.737 --> 00:05:36.478
My parents reinforced this notion

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:39.191
that I could do anything,

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:41.206
that no dream was impossible,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.785
and my dream was to be

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.818
on the daytime soap opera
"General Hospital."

00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:47.024
(Laughter)

00:05:47.048 --> 00:05:49.475
I went to college
during affirmative action

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.505
and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:53.650
Arizona State University,

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:56.142
because I fit every single quota.

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:57.189
(Laughter)

00:05:57.213 --> 00:06:01.382
I was like the pet lemur
of the theater department.

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:02.929
Everybody loved me.

00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:06.042
I did all the less-than-intelligent
kids' homework,

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.662
I got A's in all of my classes,

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:09.563
A's in all of their classes.

00:06:09.587 --> 00:06:11.114
(Laughter)

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:14.247
Every time I did a scene
from "The Glass Menagerie,"

00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.665
my professors would weep.

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:18.913
But I never got cast.

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:20.928
Finally, my senior year,

00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:24.862
ASU decided to do a show called
"They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."

00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:27.656
It's a play about a girl with CP.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.721
I was a girl with CP.

00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:32.604
So I start shouting from the rooftops,

00:06:32.628 --> 00:06:34.531
"I'm finally going to get a part!

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:36.364
I have cerebral palsy!

00:06:36.388 --> 00:06:38.541
Free at last! Free at last!

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.932
Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"

00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:42.960
I didn't get the part.

00:06:42.984 --> 00:06:45.419
(Laughter)

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:47.562
Sherry Brown got the part.

00:06:48.022 --> 00:06:50.551
I went racing to the head
of the theater department

00:06:50.575 --> 00:06:53.020
crying hysterically,
like someone shot my cat,

00:06:53.044 --> 00:06:54.145
to ask her why,

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.314
and she said it was because
they didn't think I could do the stunts.

00:06:58.762 --> 00:07:01.459
I said, "Excuse me,
if I can't do the stunts,

00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:03.040
neither can the character."

00:07:03.064 --> 00:07:07.208
(Laughter)

00:07:07.232 --> 00:07:10.952
(Applause)

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:15.980
This was a part
that I was literally born to play

00:07:16.004 --> 00:07:20.263
they gave it to a non-palsy actress.

00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:22.942
College was imitating life.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.378
Hollywood has a sordid history

00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:29.395
of casting able-bodied actors
to play disabled onscreen.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.799
Upon graduating, I moved back home,

00:07:32.823 --> 00:07:37.296
and my first acting gig
was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.116
My dream was coming true.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.506
And I knew that I would be promoted

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.029
from "Diner Diner"
to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.

00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:46.311
(Laughter)

00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:48.962
But instead, I remained
a glorified piece of furniture

00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:51.565
that you could only recognize
from the back of my head,

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.164
and it became clear to me

00:07:53.188 --> 00:07:55.083
that casting directors

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:59.065
didn't hire fluffy,
ethnic, disabled actors.

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:01.113
They only hired perfect people.

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:03.452
But there were exceptions to the rule.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.959
I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,

00:08:05.983 --> 00:08:07.895
Roseanne Barr, Ellen,

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.430
and all of these women
had one thing in common:

00:08:10.454 --> 00:08:11.692
they were comedians.

00:08:11.716 --> 00:08:13.542
So I became a comic.

00:08:13.566 --> 00:08:16.821
(Laughter)

00:08:16.845 --> 00:08:19.834
(Applause)

00:08:19.858 --> 00:08:23.511
My first gig was driving famous comics

00:08:23.535 --> 00:08:26.090
from New York City to shows in New Jersey,

00:08:26.114 --> 00:08:29.575
and I'll never forget the face
of the first comic I ever drove

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:33.539
when he realized that he was speeding
down the New Jersey Turnpike

00:08:33.563 --> 00:08:35.736
with a chick with CP driving him.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.761
(Laughter)

00:08:36.785 --> 00:08:39.330
I've performed in clubs all over America,

00:08:39.354 --> 00:08:42.882
and I've also performed
in Arabic in the Middle East,

00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:45.453
uncensored and uncovered.

00:08:45.477 --> 00:08:46.525
(Laughter)

00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:50.266
Some people say I'm the first
stand-up comic in the Arab world.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.447
I never like to claim first,

00:08:52.471 --> 00:08:54.763
but I do know that they never heard

00:08:54.787 --> 00:08:58.653
that nasty little rumor
that women aren't funny,

00:08:58.677 --> 00:09:00.464
and they find us hysterical.

00:09:00.488 --> 00:09:01.939
(Laughter)

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.570
In 2003, my brother
from another mother and father

00:09:07.594 --> 00:09:09.728
Dean Obeidallah and I started

00:09:09.752 --> 00:09:12.096
the New York Arab-American
Comedy Festival,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.070
now in its 10th year.

00:09:14.094 --> 00:09:19.539
Our goal was to change the negative image
of Arab-Americans in media,

00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:22.341
while also reminding casting directors

00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:25.106
that South Asian and Arab
are not synonymous.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.135
(Laughter)

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:34.055
Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:38.436
than conquering the challenge
against the stigma against disability.

00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:41.172
My big break came in 2010.

00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:44.086
I was invited to be a guest
on the cable news show

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.418
"Countdown with Keith Olbermann."

00:09:46.442 --> 00:09:49.420
I walked in looking
like I was going to the prom,

00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:51.554
and they shuffle me into a studio

00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:55.590
and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.

00:09:55.614 --> 00:09:57.134
(Laughter)

00:09:57.158 --> 00:09:58.984
So I looked at the stage manager

00:09:59.008 --> 00:10:02.312
and I'm like, "Excuse me,
can I have another chair?"

00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:04.038
And she looked at me and she went,

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.783
"Five, four, three, two ..."

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:08.577
And we were live, right?

00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:10.945
So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk

00:10:10.969 --> 00:10:14.734
so that I wouldn't roll off
the screen during the segment,

00:10:14.758 --> 00:10:17.593
and when the interview
was over, I was livid.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.759
I had finally gotten
my chance and I blew it,

00:10:19.783 --> 00:10:22.480
and I knew I would never get invited back.

00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:25.972
But not only did Mr. Olbermann
invite me back,

00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:28.298
he made me a full-time contributor,

00:10:28.322 --> 00:10:31.023
and he taped down my chair.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.714
(Laughter)

00:10:33.738 --> 00:10:36.979
(Applause)

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:40.696
One fun fact I learned while on the air
with Keith Olbermann

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.709
was that humans
on the Internet are scumbags.

00:10:44.733 --> 00:10:45.734
(Laughter)

00:10:45.758 --> 00:10:47.322
People say children are cruel,

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:50.266
but I was never made fun of
as a child or an adult.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.961
Suddenly, my disability
on the world wide web is fair game.

00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:57.582
I would look at clips online
and see comments like,

00:10:57.606 --> 00:11:00.242
"Yo, why's she tweakin'?"

00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:02.544
"Yo, is she retarded?"

00:11:02.568 --> 00:11:05.758
And my favorite,
"Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.

00:11:05.782 --> 00:11:07.580
What does she suffer from?

00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:09.302
We should really pray for her."

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.660
One commenter even suggested
that I add my disability to my credits:

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:18.017
screenwriter, comedian, palsy.

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:23.620
Disability is as visual as race.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.480
If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,

00:11:26.504 --> 00:11:29.353
then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.

00:11:29.702 --> 00:11:31.765
The disabled are the largest —

00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:34.568
Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.

00:11:34.592 --> 00:11:39.052
(Applause)

00:11:39.544 --> 00:11:42.567
People with disabilities
are the largest minority in the world,

00:11:42.591 --> 00:11:46.297
and we are the most underrepresented
in entertainment.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.326
The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.008
but I am here in front of you.

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:54.254
However, if I grew up with social media,

00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:55.698
I don't think I would be.

00:11:56.099 --> 00:11:57.554
I hope that together,

00:11:57.578 --> 00:12:00.129
we can create more positive images

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:03.493
of disability in the media
and in everyday life.

00:12:03.882 --> 00:12:06.339
Perhaps if there were
more positive images,

00:12:06.363 --> 00:12:08.958
it would foster less hate on the Internet.

00:12:10.085 --> 00:12:11.261
Or maybe not.

00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:15.293
Maybe it still takes a village
to teach our children well.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.469
My crooked journey has taken me
to some very spectacular places.

00:12:20.493 --> 00:12:23.443
I got to walk the red carpet

00:12:23.467 --> 00:12:26.222
flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.287
and the iconic Loreen Arbus.

00:12:28.311 --> 00:12:30.948
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler

00:12:30.972 --> 00:12:34.959
and work with my idol,
the amazing Dave Matthews.

00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:38.509
I toured the world as a headliner
on Arabs Gone Wild.

00:12:38.533 --> 00:12:44.203
I was a delegate representing
the great state of New Jersey

00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:46.463
at the 2008 DNC.

00:12:46.487 --> 00:12:48.965
And I founded Maysoon's Kids,

00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:53.024
a charity that hopes
to give Palestinian refugee children

00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:55.580
a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.

00:12:55.972 --> 00:12:58.407
But the one moment
that stands out the most

00:12:58.431 --> 00:13:00.932
was when I got -- before this moment --

00:13:00.956 --> 00:13:04.610
(Laughter)

00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:08.406
(Applause)

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.858
But the one moment
that stands out the most

00:13:11.882 --> 00:13:13.984
was when I got to perform

00:13:14.008 --> 00:13:16.210
for the man who floats like a butterfly

00:13:16.234 --> 00:13:17.762
and stings like a bee,

00:13:17.786 --> 00:13:21.075
has Parkinson's and shakes just like me,

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:23.332
Muhammad Ali.

00:13:23.356 --> 00:13:26.425
(Applause)

00:13:29.957 --> 00:13:31.576
(Applause ends)

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.179
It was the only time
that my father ever saw me perform live,

00:13:36.203 --> 00:13:39.362
and I dedicate this talk to his memory.

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:41.758
(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.

00:13:41.782 --> 00:13:44.202
(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid,

00:13:44.226 --> 00:13:47.413
and if I can can, you can can.

00:13:47.437 --> 00:13:49.282
(Cheering)

00:13:49.306 --> 00:13:53.380
(Applause)
