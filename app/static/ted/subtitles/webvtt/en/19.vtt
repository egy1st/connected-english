00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
exactly what technology means in my life.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I gave up all of my possessions,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Laughter)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And I've since then tried to keep technology

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
At the same time, I run a website on cool tools,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
as it relates to the spiritual.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I'm not even sure we know what technology is.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
(Laughter)

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
(Laughter)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But I was interested in another definition of technology.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I came up with a way of framing the question

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that seemed to work for me in my investigations.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The question that I came up with was this question:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
what are its inherent trends and biases?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I'm applying a similar trick to say,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
what if we looked at the universe in our culture

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Obviously, this in an incomplete question,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
just as looking at an organism as only a gene

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is an incomplete way of looking at it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And I think once we ask that question

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
if we keep extending the origins of technology far back,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I think we come back to life at some point.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And like you heard from the previous speakers,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We have really no idea.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and actually discover all the species on Earth.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
just to see what's on life. And if we did that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
we would begin to see some incredible species.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
This is not on another planet. These are things

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that are hidden away on our planet.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
from Jamie and others, these magnificent things --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
what they're doing, each one of them,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
is they're hacking the rules of life.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I can't think of a single general principle of biology

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Every single thing that we can think of --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
because every single one of them is hacking something about it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But a more interesting way,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the current way to take the long view,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But what I like about this is it shows that

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
They've been around just as long and gone through

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
just the same kind of trial and error to get here.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and has a different way of finding out how to do life.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
have we ever been where we don't find life.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We find life at the bottom of every long-term,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
long-distance drilling core into the center of rock

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
More and more of the inert matter of the globe

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
is being touched and animated by life.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to the more specific and specialized.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And actually, we have current data that does show

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
One of the things we see about life is that it moves

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Like those chloroplast cells --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
they're completely surrounded by other life.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And so the general, long-term trends of evolution

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And again, my question is, what does technology want?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And so, remarkably, I discovered

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that there's also a drift toward specialization.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
That we see there's a general hammer,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and hammers become more and more specific over time.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
This is all the contents of a Japanese home.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and count the number of species of technology in our household.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
had only about 7,000 items in his household.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And he was the King of England,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and he sees machines making machines. How depraved!

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and not non-technology, or even life.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I was partly responsible for that cliche

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So the major trends in technology evolution actually

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
That its operations and how it works is so similar

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And so it would be sort of approximately up there,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and to do a morphological analysis,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and try to derive their genealogical history over time.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But the most interesting aspect about this

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and you can actually use it to determine

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that this is a technological system versus a biological system.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that I began to think about what happens with old technology.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They're not around anymore." Well actually, they are.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
(Laughter) --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I took a page that was actually more difficult than others

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
because lots of the pages are filled with things

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
that are still being made. But I took this page

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and I said, how many of these things are still being made?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And the answer is: all of them.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I don't know who needs a corn sheller.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills;

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are --

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
what's important is that this information actually never died out.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
took what I could find, the examples in history

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
where there have been prohibitions against technology,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and then I tried to find out when they came back in,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution --

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life --

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
what they're really about is accelerating and changing

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the way in which evolution happens.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
the evolution of evolvability.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So what's happening over time in life is

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
are increasing. And the real tricks are ways

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And then what we see in the singularity,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that prophesized by Kurzweil and others --

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So if you have life hacking --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
life means hacking, the game of survival --

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
That is what we call an "infinite game."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
That's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and an infinite game is played to keep playing.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The origins of technology was not in 1829,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
That's the definition. There was no temperature.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
what it expanded was the potential for difference.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So as it expands and as things expand what we have

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Those are all basically the same thing.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And those are the things that technology brings us.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And that's why we continue to grab technology --

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
because we want those things. Those things are good.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And each time we make a new opportunity place,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
we're allowing a platform to make new ones.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented --

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
what a loss to society there would be.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Imagine Van Gogh being born

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
before the technologies of cheap oil paints.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
We have a moral obligation to invent technology

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
so that every person on the globe has the potential

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
to realize their true difference.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
That's what technology really wants.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I'm going to skip through some of the objections

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
bad technologies. I don't have an answer to

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Maybe in some ways

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
but it's a really good thing to use

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Our humanity is actually defined by technology.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
That's what we're talking about.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
That's what technology wants.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And so when I think about what technology wants,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this --

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
That recursive nature is the infinite game.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
That is the infinite game. And what technology is

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
is the medium in which we play that infinite game.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And so I think that we should embrace technology

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
because it is an essential part of our journey

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
in finding out who we are.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Thank you.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
(Applause)
