00:00:00.478 --> 00:00:02.213
Three and a half years ago,

00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:05.463
I made one of the best decisions of my life.

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:07.526
As my New Year's resolution,

00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:11.765
I gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight,

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:14.790
and learned to eat mindfully.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.673
Now I eat whenever I'm hungry,

00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:21.736
and I've lost 10 pounds.

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:24.273
This was me at age 13,

00:00:24.273 --> 00:00:26.813
when I started my first diet.

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:29.825
I look at that picture now, and I think,

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:31.659
you did not need a diet,

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.330
you needed a fashion consult.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.737
(Laughter)

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:39.806
But I thought I needed to lose weight,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.268
and when I gained it back,

00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:45.196
of course I blamed myself.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:47.703
And for the next three decades,

00:00:47.703 --> 00:00:50.458
I was on and off various diets.

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:52.530
No matter what I tried,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.361
the weight I'd lost always came back.

00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:58.962
I'm sure many of you know the feeling.

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:00.523
As a neuroscientist,

00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:03.337
I wondered, why is this so hard?

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:05.897
Obviously, how much you weigh depends on

00:01:05.897 --> 00:01:08.487
how much you eat and how much energy you burn.

00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:10.703
What most people don't realize

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.516
is that hunger and energy use

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:14.620
are controlled by the brain,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.135
mostly without your awareness.

00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:21.695
Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes,

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.911
and that is a good thing,

00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.097
because your conscious mind --

00:01:26.097 --> 00:01:27.964
how do we put this politely? --

00:01:27.964 --> 00:01:31.239
it's easily distracted.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:33.944
It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:36.584
when you get caught up in a movie.

00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:38.601
You don't forget how to walk

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:41.516
because you're thinking about
what to have for dinner.

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:43.500
Your brain also has its own sense

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.265
of what you should weigh,

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:48.327
no matter what you consciously believe.

00:01:48.327 --> 00:01:50.367
This is called your set point,

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:52.033
but that's a misleading term,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.743
because it's actually a range

00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:56.307
of about 10 or 15 pounds.

00:01:56.307 --> 00:01:59.530
You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.598
up and down within that range,

00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:06.003
but it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.030
The hypothalamus, the part of the brain

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.943
that regulates body weight,

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:12.366
there are more than a dozen chemical signals

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.982
in the brain that tell your body to gain weight,

00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:18.666
more than another dozen that
tell your body to lose it,

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:21.976
and the system works like a thermostat,

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:24.323
responding to signals from the body

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:27.931
by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism,

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.657
to keep your weight stable as conditions change.

00:02:31.657 --> 00:02:33.759
That's what a thermostat does, right?

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.191
It keeps the temperature in your house the same

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:39.951
as the weather changes outside.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.773
Now you can try to change the temperature

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:46.269
in your house by opening a window in the winter,

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.035
but that's not going to change
the setting on the thermostat,

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:52.234
which will respond by kicking on the furnace

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:54.671
to warm the place back up.

00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:57.993
Your brain works exactly the same way,

00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:01.136
responding to weight loss by using powerful tools

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.290
to push your body back

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.320
to what it considers normal.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.295
If you lose a lot of weight,

00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:12.620
your brain reacts as if you were starving,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.252
and whether you started out fat or thin,

00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:18.217
your brain's response is exactly the same.

00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:20.490
We would love to think that your brain could tell

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.956
whether you need to lose weight or not,

00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:24.091
but it can't.

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:26.984
If you do lose a lot of weight,

00:03:26.984 --> 00:03:29.283
you become hungry,

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:32.169
and your muscles burn less energy.

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.818
Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:36.527
has found that people who have lost

00:03:36.527 --> 00:03:38.726
10 percent of their body weight

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:41.549
burn 250 to 400 calories less

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.057
because their metabolism is suppressed.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.487
That's a lot of food.

00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:48.711
This means that a successful dieter

00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:51.879
must eat this much less forever

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.171
than someone of the same weight

00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:55.474
who has always been thin.

00:03:55.474 --> 00:03:57.264
From an evolutionary perspective,

00:03:57.264 --> 00:03:59.808
your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.

00:03:59.808 --> 00:04:02.944
When food was scarce, our ancestors' survival

00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:05.438
depended on conserving energy,

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:07.691
and regaining the weight when food was available

00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.798
would have protected them
against the next shortage.

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:13.325
Over the course of human history,

00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:16.327
starvation has been a much bigger problem

00:04:16.327 --> 00:04:18.011
than overeating.

00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:22.242
This may explain a very sad fact:

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:25.071
Set points can go up,

00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:27.943
but they rarely go down.

00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:30.132
Now, if your mother ever mentioned

00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:32.428
that life is not fair,

00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:35.221
this is the kind of thing she was talking about.

00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:38.259
(Laughter)

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.444
Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point.

00:04:41.444 --> 00:04:42.988
Even after you've kept the weight off

00:04:42.988 --> 00:04:44.817
for as long as seven years,

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:48.790
your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.080
If that weight loss had been due to a long famine,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.409
that would be a sensible response.

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.090
In our modern world of drive-thru burgers,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.547
it's not working out so well for many of us.

00:05:00.547 --> 00:05:04.290
That difference between our ancestral past

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.693
and our abundant present

00:05:06.693 --> 00:05:08.982
is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff

00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:11.042
of the University of Ottawa

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:13.743
would like to take some of his patients back to a time

00:05:13.743 --> 00:05:15.842
when food was less available,

00:05:15.842 --> 00:05:17.543
and it's also the reason

00:05:17.543 --> 00:05:19.927
that changing the food environment

00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:24.043
is really going to be the most effective solution

00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:26.153
to obesity.

00:05:26.153 --> 00:05:29.430
Sadly, a temporary weight gain

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.475
can become permanent.

00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:34.109
If you stay at a high weight for too long,

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:36.583
probably a matter of years for most of us,

00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:41.021
your brain may decide that that's the new normal.

00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:45.081
Psychologists classify eaters into two groups,

00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:46.699
those who rely on their hunger

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.268
and those who try to control their eating

00:05:49.268 --> 00:05:55.331
through willpower, like most dieters.

00:05:55.331 --> 00:06:01.842
Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.

00:06:01.842 --> 00:06:04.025
The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters

00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:06.656
are less likely to be overweight,

00:06:06.656 --> 00:06:10.358
and they spend less time thinking about food.

00:06:10.358 --> 00:06:14.002
Controlled eaters are more vulnerable

00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:16.865
to overeating in response to advertising,

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:20.728
super-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:22.473
And a small indulgence,

00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:25.679
like eating one scoop of ice cream,

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:31.289
is more likely to lead to a food binge

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.186
in controlled eaters.

00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:35.113
Children are especially vulnerable

00:06:35.113 --> 00:06:38.242
to this cycle of dieting and then binging.

00:06:38.242 --> 00:06:41.071
Several long-term studies have shown

00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:45.223
that girls who diet in their early teenage years

00:06:45.223 --> 00:06:48.548
are three times more likely to become overweight

00:06:48.548 --> 00:06:50.085
five years later,

00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:52.904
even if they started at a normal weight,

00:06:52.904 --> 00:06:55.553
and all of these studies found

00:06:55.553 --> 00:06:57.860
that the same factors

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.254
that predicted weight gain

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.254
also predicted the development of eating disorders.

00:07:04.254 --> 00:07:05.822
The other factor, by the way,

00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:07.251
those of you who are parents,

00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:10.480
was being teased by family members

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.991
about their weight.

00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:13.827
So don't do that.

00:07:13.827 --> 00:07:15.565
(Laughter)

00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:18.201
I left almost all my graphs at home,

00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:20.494
but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,

00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:22.907
because I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.

00:07:22.907 --> 00:07:25.386
(Laughter)

00:07:25.386 --> 00:07:27.734
This is a study that looked at the risk of death

00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:29.600
over a 14-year period

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.102
based on four healthy habits:

00:07:32.102 --> 00:07:34.222
eating enough fruits and vegetables,

00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:36.448
exercise three times a week,

00:07:36.448 --> 00:07:37.824
not smoking,

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.794
and drinking in moderation.

00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:41.723
Let's start by looking at the normal weight

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:43.311
people in the study.

00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:45.198
The height of the bars is the risk of death,

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.579
and those zero, one, two, three, four numbers

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:48.825
on the horizontal axis

00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:50.858
are the number of those healthy habits

00:07:50.858 --> 00:07:52.418
that a given person had.

00:07:52.418 --> 00:07:55.407
And as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,

00:07:55.407 --> 00:07:58.319
the less likely people were to die during the study.

00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:59.641
Now let's look at what happens

00:07:59.641 --> 00:08:01.487
in overweight people.

00:08:01.487 --> 00:08:03.559
The ones that had no healthy habits

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:05.330
had a higher risk of death.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.094
Adding just one healthy habit

00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:10.556
pulls overweight people back into the normal range.

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:13.298
For obese people with no healthy habits,

00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:16.008
the risk is very high, seven times higher

00:08:16.008 --> 00:08:18.144
than the healthiest groups in the study.

00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:22.084
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:24.602
In fact, if you look only at the group

00:08:24.602 --> 00:08:26.876
with all four healthy habits,

00:08:26.876 --> 00:08:29.488
you can see that weight makes very little difference.

00:08:29.488 --> 00:08:31.544
You can take control of your health

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:33.418
by taking control of your lifestyle,

00:08:33.418 --> 00:08:34.899
even If you can't lose weight

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:36.635
and keep it off.

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:40.745
Diets don't have very much reliability.

00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:42.522
Five years after a diet,

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.310
most people have regained the weight.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.792
Forty percent of them have gained even more.

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:49.217
If you think about this,

00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:51.564
the typical outcome of dieting

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.452
is that you're more likely to gain weight

00:08:53.452 --> 00:08:56.221
in the long run than to lose it.

00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:59.075
If I've convinced you that dieting

00:08:59.075 --> 00:09:01.104
might be a problem,

00:09:01.104 --> 00:09:03.742
the next question is, what do you do about it?

00:09:03.742 --> 00:09:08.198
And my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.

00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:10.733
I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:12.725
or take up yoga.

00:09:12.725 --> 00:09:15.277
I'm talking about mindful eating:

00:09:15.277 --> 00:09:18.785
learning to understand your body's signals

00:09:18.785 --> 00:09:21.174
so that you eat when you're hungry

00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:23.516
and stop when you're full,

00:09:23.516 --> 00:09:25.694
because a lot of weight gain boils down

00:09:25.694 --> 00:09:28.760
to eating when you're not hungry.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.244
How do you do it?

00:09:30.244 --> 00:09:32.078
Give yourself permission to eat

00:09:32.078 --> 00:09:34.283
as much as you want, and then work on figuring out

00:09:34.283 --> 00:09:36.035
what makes your body feel good.

00:09:36.035 --> 00:09:39.764
Sit down to regular meals without distractions.

00:09:39.764 --> 00:09:41.563
Think about how your body feels

00:09:41.563 --> 00:09:43.617
when you start to eat and when you stop,

00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:46.104
and let your hunger decide

00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:47.572
when you should be done.

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:49.993
It took about a year for me to learn this,

00:09:49.993 --> 00:09:51.764
but it's really been worth it.

00:09:51.764 --> 00:09:54.849
I am so much more relaxed around food

00:09:54.849 --> 00:09:57.712
than I have ever been in my life.

00:09:57.712 --> 00:10:00.277
I often don't think about it.

00:10:00.277 --> 00:10:03.010
I forget we have chocolate in the house.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.954
It's like aliens have taken over my brain.

00:10:05.954 --> 00:10:08.712
It's just completely different.

00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:11.378
I should say that

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:14.171
this approach to eating probably
won't make you lose weight

00:10:14.171 --> 00:10:17.088
unless you often eat when you're not hungry,

00:10:17.088 --> 00:10:20.986
but doctors don't know of any approach

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:25.461
that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,

00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:28.831
and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on

00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:30.990
preventing weight gain

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.213
instead of promoting weight loss.

00:10:34.213 --> 00:10:35.749
Let's face it:

00:10:35.749 --> 00:10:39.960
If diets worked, we'd all be thin already.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.860
(Laughter)

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.497
Why do we keep doing the same thing

00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:46.380
and expecting different results?

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.063
Diets may seem harmless,

00:10:48.063 --> 00:10:51.781
but they actually do a lot of collateral damage.

00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:54.216
At worst, they ruin lives:

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:56.532
Weight obsession leads to eating disorders,

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:59.475
especially in young kids.

00:10:59.475 --> 00:11:04.353
In the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls

00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:06.130
say they've been on a diet.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.391
Our daughters have learned to measure their worth

00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:11.494
by the wrong scale.

00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:13.519
Even at its best,

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.247
dieting is a waste of time and energy.

00:11:16.247 --> 00:11:20.469
It takes willpower which you could be using

00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:23.091
to help your kids with their homework

00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:26.707
or to finish that important work project,

00:11:26.707 --> 00:11:30.194
and because willpower is limited,

00:11:30.194 --> 00:11:34.817
any strategy that relies on its consistent application

00:11:34.817 --> 00:11:37.600
is pretty much guaranteed

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.693
to eventually fail you

00:11:39.693 --> 00:11:43.542
when your attention moves on to something else.

00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:47.474
Let me leave you with one last thought.

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:50.377
What if we told all those dieting girls

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:53.378
that it's okay to eat when they're hungry?

00:11:53.378 --> 00:11:55.628
What if we taught them to work with their appetite

00:11:55.628 --> 00:11:57.753
instead of fearing it?

00:11:57.753 --> 00:12:01.180
I think most of them would be happier and healthier,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.195
and as adults,

00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:06.968
many of them would probably be thinner.

00:12:06.968 --> 00:12:09.081
I wish someone had told me that

00:12:09.081 --> 00:12:12.502
back when I was 13.

00:12:12.502 --> 00:12:14.508
Thanks.

00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:22.867
(Applause)
