WEBVTT

00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:07.154
So this is a picture of my dad and me,
at the beach in Far Rockaway,

00:00:07.178 --> 00:00:08.640
or actually Rockaway Park.

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:11.330
I'm the one with the blond hair.

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:13.296
My dad's the guy with the cigarette.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.471
It was the 60's.

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:16.133
A lot of people smoked back then.

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:19.674
In the summer of 2009,
my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:26.025
Cancer is one of those things
that actually touches everybody.

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:28.677
If you're a man in the US,

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.747
you've got about a one in two chance

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.706
of being diagnosed with cancer
during your lifetime.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.515
If you're a woman, you've got
about a one in three chance

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.208
of being diagnosed with cancer.

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:42.159
Everybody knows somebody
who's been diagnosed with cancer.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:44.935
Now, my dad's doing better today,

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:49.992
and part of the reason for that is that
he was able to participate in the trial

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:53.249
of an experimental new drug
that happened to be specially formulated

00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:55.526
and very good for his particular
kind of cancer.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.323
There are over 200 kinds of cancer.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.920
And what I want to talk about today

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:03.816
is how we can help
more people like my dad,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.794
because we have to change the way
we think about raising money

00:01:06.818 --> 00:01:08.212
to fund cancer research.

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:11.207
So a while after my dad was diagnosed,

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:14.006
I was having coffee
with my friend Andrew Lo.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.673
He's the head of the Laboratory
for Financial Engineering at MIT,

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:19.635
where I also have a position,

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.261
and we were talking about cancer.

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:23.679
And Andrew had been doing
his own bits of research,

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:25.797
and one of the things
that he had been told

00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.266
and that he'd learned
from studying the literature

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.371
was that there's actually
a big bottleneck.

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.535
It's very difficult to develop new drugs,

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:36.919
and the reason it's difficult
to develop new drugs

00:01:36.943 --> 00:01:39.364
is because in the early stages
of drug development,

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:41.893
the drugs are very risky,
and they're very expensive.

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:44.790
So Andrew asked me
if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:46.924
work on some of the math and the analytics

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:49.485
and see if we could figure out
something we could do.

00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:51.585
Now I'm not a scientist.

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.657
You know, I don't know
how to build a drug.

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:58.576
And none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo
or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.315
none of those guys are scientists either.

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:04.368
We don't know the first thing
about how to make a cancer drug.

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:07.027
But we know a little bit
about risk mitigation

00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.167
and a little bit
about financial engineering,

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:11.299
and so we started thinking,
what could we do?

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.889
I'm going to tell you about some work

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:15.998
we've been doing
over the last couple years

00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:18.293
that we think could
fundamentally change the way

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:21.190
research for cancer
and lots of other things gets done.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.139
We want to let the research
drive the funding,

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:25.715
not the other way around.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.740
So in order to get started,

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.887
let me tell you
how you get a drug financed.

00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:34.312
Imagine that you're in your lab --
you're a scientist, you're not like me --

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.308
and you've developed a new compound

00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:40.188
that you think might be therapeutic
for somebody with cancer.

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:43.868
Well, what you do is, you test in animals,
you test in test tubes,

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:46.952
but there's this notion
of going from the bench to the bedside,

00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:50.628
and in order to get from the bench,
the lab, to the bedside, to the patients,

00:02:50.652 --> 00:02:52.482
you've got to get the drug tested.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.110
And the way the drug gets tested

00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:56.355
is through a series of,
basically, experiments,

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.410
through these large,
they're called trials,

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:00.789
that they do to determine
whether the drug is safe

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.826
and whether it works and all these things.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.930
So the FDA has a very specific protocol.

00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:06.645
In the first phase of this testing,

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.278
which is called testing for toxicity,
it's called Phase I.

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:13.369
In the first phase,
you give the drug to healthy people

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.730
and you see if it actually
makes them sick.

00:03:16.578 --> 00:03:18.972
In other words, are the side
effects just so severe

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:20.784
that no matter how much good it does,

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:22.266
it's not going to be worth it?

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.981
Does it cause heart attacks,
kill people, liver failure?

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.158
And it turns out,
that's a pretty high hurdle.

00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:29.544
About a third of all drugs
drop out at that point.

00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:32.522
In the next phase, you test
to see if the drug's effective,

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.336
and you give it to people with cancer

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.091
and you see if it makes them better.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:38.433
And that's also a higher hurdle.
People drop out.

00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:41.263
And in the third phase,
you test it on a very large sample,

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.395
and you're trying to determine
what the right dose is,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.621
is it better than what's available today?
If not, then why build it?

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:49.835
When you're done with all that,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.445
what you have is a very small
percentage of drugs

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.295
that start the process
actually come out the other side.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.033
So those blue bottles --
those blue bottles save lives,

00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:02.117
and they're also worth billions,
sometimes billions a year.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.375
So now here's a question:

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.641
if I were to ask you, for example,

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:11.630
to make a one-time investment of, say,
200 million dollars

00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:13.298
to buy one of those bottles,

00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:16.674
so 200 million dollars up front, one time,
to buy one of those bottles,

00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:18.314
I won't tell you which one it is,

00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:22.239
and in 10 years, I'll tell you whether
you have one of the blue ones.

00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:24.394
Does that sound like a good
deal for anybody?

00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:25.656
No. No, right?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.214
And of course, it's a very,
very risky trial position,

00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:30.380
and that's why it's very hard
to get funding,

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:33.200
but to a first approximation,
that's actually the proposal.

00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:35.834
You have to fund these things
from the early stages on.

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:37.125
It takes a long time.

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:40.566
So Andrew said to me, he said,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.036
"What if we stop thinking
about these as drugs?

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.846
What if we start thinking
about them as financial assets?"

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.514
They've got really weird payoff
structures and all that,

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.878
but let's throw everything we know
about financial engineering at them.

00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:54.362
Let's see if we can use
all the tricks of the trade

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:57.733
to figure out how to make these drugs
work as financial assets.

00:04:58.344 --> 00:04:59.790
Let's create a giant fund.

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.033
In finance, we know what to do
with assets that are risky.

00:05:03.057 --> 00:05:06.169
You put them in a portfolio
and you try to smooth out the returns.

00:05:06.193 --> 00:05:09.236
So we did some math, and it turned out
you could make this work,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.692
but in order to make it work,
you need about 80 to 150 drugs.

00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:14.881
Now the good news is,
there's plenty of drugs

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:16.365
that are waiting to be tested.

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.322
We've been told that there's a backlog
of about 20 years of drugs

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:22.799
that are waiting to be tested
but can't be funded.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:25.220
In fact, that early stage
of the funding process,

00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:27.216
that Phase I and preclinical stuff,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.109
that's actually, in the industry,
called the Valley of Death

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:31.870
because it's where drugs go to die.

00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:34.148
It's very hard to for them
to get through there,

00:05:34.172 --> 00:05:36.399
and of course, if you can't
get through there,

00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:38.057
you can't get to the later stages.

00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:40.133
So we did this math,
and we figured out, OK,

00:05:40.157 --> 00:05:43.455
well, you need about 80 to, say, 150,
or something like that, drugs.

00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:46.553
And then we did a little more
math, and we said, OK,

00:05:46.577 --> 00:05:49.839
well, that's a fund of about three
to 15 billion dollars.

00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:53.347
So we kind of created a new problem
by solving the old one.

00:05:53.905 --> 00:05:56.588
We got rid of the risk,
but now we need a lot of capital,

00:05:56.612 --> 00:05:59.723
and you can only get that kind
of capital in the capital markets.

00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:02.240
Venture capitalists
and philanthropies don't have it.

00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:05.471
But we have to figure out
how to get people in the capital markets,

00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:08.987
who traditionally don't invest in this,
to want to invest in this stuff.

00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:11.329
So again, financial engineering
was helpful here.

00:06:11.353 --> 00:06:13.153
Imagine the megafund starts empty,

00:06:13.177 --> 00:06:17.186
and what it does is it issues
some debt and some equity,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.606
and that generates cash flow.

00:06:18.964 --> 00:06:22.709
That cash flow is used, then, to buy
that big portfolio of drugs that you need,

00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:26.046
and those drugs start working their way
through that approval process,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.461
and each time they go through
a phase of approval,

00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:29.680
they gain value.

00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:32.062
Most of them don't make it,
but a few of them do,

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:34.592
and with the ones that gain
value, you can sell some,

00:06:34.616 --> 00:06:35.854
and when you sell them,

00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:38.216
you have money to pay
the interest on those bonds,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.291
but also to fund the next round of trials.

00:06:40.315 --> 00:06:41.540
It's almost self-funding.

00:06:41.564 --> 00:06:43.844
You do that for the course
of the transaction,

00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:46.297
and when you're done,
you liquidate the portfolio,

00:06:46.321 --> 00:06:49.643
pay back the bonds, and you can give
the equity holders a nice return.

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.842
That was the theory,
and we talked about it,

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:53.336
we did a bunch of experiments,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.528
and then we said,
let's really try to test it.

00:06:55.552 --> 00:06:58.436
We spent the next two years
doing research.

00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:03.283
We talked to hundreds of experts
in drug financing and venture capital.

00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:05.973
We talked to people
who have developed drugs.

00:07:05.997 --> 00:07:07.832
We talked to pharmaceutical companies.

00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:10.686
We actually looked at the data for drugs,

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.882
over 2,000 drugs that had been approved
or denied or withdrawn,

00:07:14.906 --> 00:07:17.257
and we also ran millions of simulations.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.760
And all that actually took a lot of time.

00:07:20.784 --> 00:07:24.077
But when we were done, we found something
that was sort of surprising.

00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:25.927
It was feasible to structure that fund

00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:28.043
such that when you were done
structuring it,

00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:32.006
you could actually produce low-risk bonds
that would be attractive to bond holders,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.770
that would give you yields
of about five to eight percent,

00:07:34.794 --> 00:07:36.259
and you could produce equity

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:38.978
that would give equity holders
about a 12 percent return.

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:42.384
Now those returns aren't going
to be attractive to a venture capitalist.

00:07:42.408 --> 00:07:43.941
They want to make those big bets

00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:45.758
and get those billion dollar payoffs.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:49.433
But it turns out there are lots of other
folks that would be interested.

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:53.036
That's right in the investment sweet spot
of pension funds and 401(k) plans

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.358
and all this other stuff.

00:07:54.687 --> 00:07:57.159
So we published some articles
in the academic press,

00:07:57.183 --> 00:08:01.998
in medical journals, in finance journals.

00:08:02.022 --> 00:08:05.467
But it wasn't until we actually
got the popular press interested in this

00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:07.696
that we began to get some traction.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.956
We wanted to do more
than just make people aware of it.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.560
We wanted people to get involved.

00:08:12.584 --> 00:08:15.697
So we took all of our computer code
and made that available online

00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:18.409
under an open-source license
to anybody that wanted it.

And you guys can download it today

00:08:20.152 --> 00:08:23.279
if you want to run your own experiments
to see if this would work.

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:24.788
And that was really effective,

00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:27.176
because people that didn't
believe our assumptions

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.351
could try their own
and see how it would work.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.361
Now there's an obvious problem, which is,

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:33.660
is there enough money
in the world to fund this?

00:08:33.684 --> 00:08:36.601
I've told you there's enough drugs,
but is there enough money?

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.531
There's 100 trillion dollars of capital

00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:41.549
currently invested
in fixed-income securities.

00:08:42.632 --> 00:08:44.465
That's a hundred thousand billion.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.927
There's plenty of money.

00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:50.957
(Laughter)

00:08:52.088 --> 00:08:54.831
But we realized it's more than
just money that's required.

00:08:54.855 --> 00:08:56.855
We had to get people motivated, involved,

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.529
and get them to understand this.

00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:02.310
And we started thinking about all
the different things that could go wrong.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:05.196
What are all the challenges
that might get in the way?

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.440
And we had a long list.

00:09:06.464 --> 00:09:09.443
We assigned a bunch of people,
including ourselves,

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:11.053
different pieces of this problem.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.721
And we said, could you start
a work stream on credit risk?

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:17.390
Could you start a work stream
on the regulatory aspects?

00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:21.447
Could you start a work stream
on how you would manage so many projects?

00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:25.143
And we had all these experts get together
and do these different work streams,

00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:27.015
and then we held a conference.

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:29.269
The conference was held
over this past summer.

00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:31.073
It was an invitation-only conference.

00:09:31.097 --> 00:09:33.347
It was sponsored
by the American Cancer Society

00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:36.780
and done in collaboration
with the National Cancer Institute.

00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:39.762
We had experts from every field
we thought would be important,

00:09:39.786 --> 00:09:42.783
including the government, and people
that run research centers,

00:09:42.807 --> 00:09:45.244
and for two days they heard the reports

00:09:45.268 --> 00:09:47.860
from those five work streams,
and talked about it.

00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:50.722
It was the first time the people
who could make this happen

00:09:50.746 --> 00:09:53.813
sat across the table from each other
and had these conversations.

00:09:53.837 --> 00:09:57.334
Now these conferences,
it's typical to have a dinner,

00:09:57.358 --> 00:10:00.130
and at that dinner,
you get to know each other,

00:10:00.154 --> 00:10:01.895
sort of like what we're doing here.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:03.565
I happened to look out the window,

00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:04.885
and hand on my heart,

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:07.721
on the night of this conference --
it was the summertime --

00:10:07.745 --> 00:10:09.989
and that's what I saw, a double rainbow.

00:10:10.013 --> 00:10:11.956
So I'd like to think it was a good sign.

00:10:12.082 --> 00:10:16.283
Since the conference, we've got people
working between Paris and San Francisco,

00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:18.176
lots of different folks working on this

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.651
to try to see if we can
really make it happen.

00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:24.335
We're not looking to start a fund,
but we want somebody else to do this.

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:26.529
Because, again, I'm not a scientist.

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:28.432
I can't build a drug.

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:32.082
I'm never going to have enough money
to fund even one of those trials.

00:10:32.443 --> 00:10:35.268
But all of us together, with our 401(k)s,

00:10:35.292 --> 00:10:37.860
with our 529 plans,
with our pension plans,

00:10:37.884 --> 00:10:40.767
all of us together can actually
fund hundreds of trials

00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:42.375
and get paid well for doing it

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:45.146
and save millions of lives like my dad.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.321
Thank you.

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:51.920
(Applause)
