WEBVTT

00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:03.178
This is an image of the planet Earth.

00:00:03.178 --> 00:00:06.271
It looks very much like the Apollo pictures

00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:07.882
that are very well known.

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.952
There is something different;

00:00:09.952 --> 00:00:11.399
you can click on it,

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:12.597
and if you click on it,

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.669
you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.668
For instance, this is a bird's-eye view

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:20.334
of the EPFL campus.

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.442
In many cases, you can also see

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:26.182
how a building looks from a nearby street.

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:27.604
This is pretty amazing.

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:31.031
But there's something missing in this wonderful tour:

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.219
It's time.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.289
i'm not really sure when this picture was taken.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.701
I'm not even sure it was taken

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:43.784
at the same moment as the bird's-eye view.

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:45.993
In my lab, we develop tools

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:47.757
to travel not only in space

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:50.315
but also through time.

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:52.185
The kind of question we're asking is

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.578
Is it possible to build something

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:55.756
like Google Maps of the past?

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:59.066
Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.869
and just change the year,

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:02.660
seeing how it was 100 years before,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.329
1,000 years before?

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.452
Is that possible?

00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:08.704
Can I reconstruct social networks of the past?

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:11.753
Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages?

00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:15.529
So, can I build time machines?

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:18.094
Maybe we can just say, "No, it's not possible."

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:21.904
Or, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:25.094
This is what I call the information mushroom.

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:26.677
Vertically, you have the time.

00:01:26.677 --> 00:01:29.417
and horizontally, the amount of digital information available.

00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:32.899
Obviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.447
And obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have.

00:01:36.447 --> 00:01:38.765
If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.259
or Facebook of the past,

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.833
we need to enlarge this space,

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:43.771
we need to make that like a rectangle.

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:45.281
How do we do that?

00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:47.379
One way is digitization.

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:49.174
There's a lot of material available --

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.460
newspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.228
I can digitize all these.

00:01:57.228 --> 00:01:59.965
I can extract information from these.

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:03.508
Of course, the more you go in the past,
the less information you will have.

00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:06.154
So, it might not be enough.

00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:08.562
So, I can do what historians do.

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:10.086
I can extrapolate.

00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:14.556
This is what we call, in computer science, simulation.

00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:16.307
If I take a log book,

00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:18.711
I can consider, it's not just a log book

00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:21.683
of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.326
I can consider it is actually a log book

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:25.908
which is representative of
many journeys of that period.

00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:28.153
I'm extrapolating.

00:02:28.153 --> 00:02:30.191
If I have a painting of a facade,

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:32.942
I can consider it's not just that particular building,

00:02:32.942 --> 00:02:36.874
but probably it also shares the same grammar

00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:40.915
of buildings where we lost any information.

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:43.773
So if we want to construct a time machine,

00:02:43.773 --> 00:02:45.112
we need two things.

00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:47.346
We need very large archives,

00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:50.088
and we need excellent specialists.

00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:51.962
The Venice Time Machine,

00:02:51.962 --> 00:02:53.767
the project I'm going to talk to you about,

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:56.787
is a joint project between the EPFL

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:59.765
and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari.

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:01.930
There's something very peculiar about Venice,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.604
that its administration has been

00:03:04.604 --> 00:03:06.798
very, very bureaucratic.

00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:08.991
They've been keeping track of everything,

00:03:08.991 --> 00:03:11.906
almost like Google today.

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:13.420
At the Archivio di Stato,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.184
you have 80 kilometers of archives

00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:17.193
documenting every aspect

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:19.439
of the life of Venice over
more than 1,000 years.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.359
You have every boat that goes out,

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.435
every boat that comes in.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.232
You have every change that was made in the city.

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:28.523
This is all there.

00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:32.431
We are setting up a 10-year digitization program

00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:34.108
which has the objective of transforming

00:03:34.108 --> 00:03:35.492
this immense archive

00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:37.918
into a giant information system.

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.775
The type of objective we want to reach

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:44.501
is 450 books a day that can be digitized.

00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:46.748
Of course, when you digitize, that's not enough,

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:48.035
because these documents,

00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:50.674
most of them are in Latin, in Tuscan,

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.204
in Venetian dialect,

00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:53.879
so you need to transcribe them,

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.560
to translate them in some cases,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.680
to index them,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.844
and this is obviously not easy.

00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:02.688
In particular, traditional optical
character recognition method

00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:04.112
that can be used for printed manuscripts,

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:08.116
they do not work well on the handwritten document.

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:10.246
So the solution is actually to take inspiration

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:13.147
from another domain: speech recognition.

00:04:13.147 --> 00:04:15.202
This is a domain of something 
that seems impossible,

00:04:15.202 --> 00:04:17.739
which can actually be done,

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.933
simply by putting additional constraints.

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:21.519
If you have a very good model

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.045
of a language which is used,

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:25.131
if you have a very good model of a document,

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:26.563
how well they are structured.

00:04:26.563 --> 00:04:27.916
And these are administrative documents.

00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:30.063
They are well structured in many cases.

00:04:30.063 --> 00:04:33.371
If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets

00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:36.248
where a smaller subset
actually shares similar features,

00:04:36.248 --> 00:04:40.279
then there's a chance of success.

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.196
If we reach that stage, then there's something else:

00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:48.718
we can extract from this document events.

00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:51.016
Actually probably 10 billion events

00:04:51.016 --> 00:04:52.947
can be extracted from this archive.

00:04:52.947 --> 00:04:54.671
And this giant information system

00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:56.487
can be searched in many ways.

00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:57.855
You can ask questions like,

00:04:57.855 --> 00:05:00.615
"Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?"

00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:02.837
"How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:04.561
in 1434?"

00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:06.021
"What was the salary

00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:08.066
of a glass maker in Murano

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:09.472
maybe over a decade?"

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:10.894
You can ask even bigger questions

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.632
because it will be semantically coded.

00:05:13.632 --> 00:05:15.772
And then what you can do is put that in space,

00:05:15.772 --> 00:05:17.945
because much of this information is spatial.

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:19.880
And from that, you can do things like

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.993
reconstructing this extraordinary journey

00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:25.349
of that city that managed to
have a sustainable development

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.475
over a thousand years,

00:05:27.475 --> 00:05:29.095
managing to have all the time

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:31.956
a form of equilibrium with its environment.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.204
You can reconstruct that journey,

00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:36.100
visualize it in many different ways.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.799
But of course, you cannot understand 
Venice if you just look at the city.

00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:41.195
You have to put it in a larger European context.

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:44.016
So the idea is also to document all the things

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:46.439
that worked at the European level.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.403
We can reconstruct also the journey

00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:50.393
of the Venetian maritime empire,

00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:53.559
how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea,

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:57.305
how it became the most powerful medieval empire

00:05:57.305 --> 00:05:58.866
of its time,

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:01.038
controlling most of the sea routes

00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:03.971
from the east to the south.

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:07.621
But you can even do other things,

00:06:07.621 --> 00:06:09.898
because in these maritime routes,

00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:11.873
there are regular patterns.

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.382
You can go one step beyond

00:06:14.382 --> 00:06:16.502
and actually create a simulation system,

00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:19.317
create a Mediterranean simulator

00:06:19.317 --> 00:06:21.910
which is capable actually of reconstructing

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.112
even the information we are missing,

00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:27.100
which would enable us to have 
questions you could ask

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.088
like if you were using a route planner.

00:06:30.088 --> 00:06:33.159
"If I am in Corfu in June 1323

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.685
and want to go to Constantinople,

00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:37.828
where can I take a boat?"

00:06:37.828 --> 00:06:39.195
Probably we can answer this question

00:06:39.195 --> 00:06:43.668
with one or two or three days' precision.

00:06:43.668 --> 00:06:45.275
"How much will it cost?"

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:48.867
"What are the chance of encountering pirates?"

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.678
Of course, you understand,

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:53.287
the central scientific challenge
of a project like this one

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:57.016
is qualifying, quantifying and representing

00:06:57.016 --> 00:07:00.346
uncertainty and inconsistency
at each step of this process.

00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:03.058
There are errors everywhere,

00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:05.547
errors in the document, it's
the wrong name of the captain,

00:07:05.547 --> 00:07:08.760
some of the boats never actually took to sea.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.617
There are errors in translation, interpretative biases,

00:07:13.624 --> 00:07:17.090
and on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.039
you're going to have errors in recognition,

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.000
errors in extraction,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.481
so you have very, very uncertain data.

00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:30.238
So how can we detect and
correct these inconsistencies?

00:07:30.238 --> 00:07:33.898
How can we represent that form of uncertainty?

00:07:33.898 --> 00:07:35.995
It's difficult. One thing you can do

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:38.221
is document each step of the process,

00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:40.669
not only coding the historical information

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.348
but what we call the meta-historical information,

00:07:43.348 --> 00:07:46.011
how is historical knowledge constructed,

00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:48.009
documenting each step.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.654
That will not guarantee that we actually converge

00:07:49.654 --> 00:07:52.104
toward a single story of Venice,

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.242
but probably we can actually reconstruct

00:07:54.242 --> 00:07:57.290
a fully documented potential story of Venice.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.749
Maybe there's not a single map.

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:00.869
Maybe there are several maps.

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:03.085
The system should allow for that,

00:08:03.085 --> 00:08:05.944
because we have to deal with
a new form of uncertainty,

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:10.585
which is really new for this type of giant databases.

00:08:10.585 --> 00:08:12.775
And how should we communicate

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.769
this new research to a large audience?

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:19.432
Again, Venice is extraordinary for that.

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.603
With the millions of visitors that come every year,

00:08:21.603 --> 00:08:23.366
it's actually one of the best places

00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:26.354
to try to invent the museum of the future.

00:08:26.354 --> 00:08:29.658
Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map

00:08:29.658 --> 00:08:30.944
of a given year,

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:33.902
and vertically, you see the document

00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:35.413
that served the reconstruction,

00:08:35.413 --> 00:08:38.813
paintings, for instance.

00:08:38.813 --> 00:08:41.393
Imagine an immersive system that permits

00:08:41.393 --> 00:08:44.895
to go and dive and reconstruct
the Venice of a given year,

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:47.610
some experience you could share within a group.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.856
On the contrary, imagine actually that you start

00:08:49.856 --> 00:08:52.063
from a document, a Venetian manuscript,

00:08:52.063 --> 00:08:55.112
and you show, actually, what
you can construct out of it,

00:08:55.112 --> 00:08:56.884
how it is decoded,

00:08:56.884 --> 00:08:59.299
how the context of that document can be recreated.

00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:01.184
This is an image from an exhibit

00:09:01.184 --> 00:09:03.460
which is currently conducted in Geneva

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.814
with that type of system.

00:09:05.814 --> 00:09:07.989
So to conclude, we can say that

00:09:07.989 --> 00:09:11.068
research in the humanities is about to undergo

00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:12.870
an evolution which is maybe similar

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.452
to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago.

00:09:17.452 --> 00:09:22.128
It's really a question of scale.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.433
We see projects which are

00:09:25.433 --> 00:09:29.276
much beyond any single research team can do,

00:09:29.276 --> 00:09:31.519
and this is really new for the humanities,

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:35.388
which very often take the habit of working

00:09:35.388 --> 00:09:39.396
in small groups or only with a couple of researchers.

00:09:39.396 --> 00:09:41.514
When you visit the Archivio di Stato,

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:44.336
you feel this is beyond what any single team can do,

00:09:44.336 --> 00:09:48.170
and that should be a joint and common effort.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.276
So what we must do for this paradigm shift

00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:53.178
is actually foster a new generation

00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:54.715
of "digital humanists"

00:09:54.715 --> 00:09:56.805
that are going to be ready for this shift.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.764
I thank you very much.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:02.764
