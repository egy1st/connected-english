00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.555
(Music)

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:11.221
For any of you who have visited
or lived in New York City,

00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:16.116
these shots might start to look familiar.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.800
This is Central Park,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.536
one of the most beautifully designed

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:22.432
public spaces in America.

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:24.934
But to anyone who hasn't visited,

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:28.565
these images can't really fully convey.

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:30.610
To really understand Central Park,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.769
you have to physically be there.

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.874
Well, the same is true of the music,

00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:40.671
which my brother and I composed and mapped

00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:43.757
specifically for Central Park.

00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:48.815
(Music)

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.641
I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:54.798
that my brother Hays and I are doing --

00:00:54.798 --> 00:00:58.244
That's us there. That's both of us actually â€”

00:00:58.244 --> 00:01:02.051
specifically about a concept that we've been
developing over the last few years,

00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:05.660
this idea of location-aware music.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.614
Now, my brother and I, we're musicians

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:09.253
and music producers.

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:10.889
We've been working together since,

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:12.901
well, since we were kids, really.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.500
But recently, we've become
more and more interested

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.420
in projects where art

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.248
and technology intersect,

00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:22.475
from creating sight-specific audio

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:24.347
and video installation

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:27.349
to engineering interactive concerts.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.996
But today I want to focus on this concept

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:33.738
of composition for physical space.

00:01:33.738 --> 00:01:36.187
But before I go too much further into that,

00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:37.900
let me tell you a little bit about how we got started

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.737
with this idea.

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:41.792
My brother and I were living in New York City

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:43.579
when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.808
did their temporary installation, The Gates,

00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:47.629
in Central Park.

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.273
Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:52.475
decorated the park for a number of weeks,

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:54.407
and unlike work that's exhibited

00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:55.955
in a more neutral space,

00:01:55.955 --> 00:01:59.110
like on the walls of a gallery or a museum,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.421
this was work that was really in dialogue

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.801
with this place,

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:04.733
and in a lot of ways, The Gates

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.189
was really a celebration

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.922
of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design.

00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:11.184
This was an experience that stayed with us

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:13.453
for a long time, and years later,

00:02:13.453 --> 00:02:16.278
my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C.,

00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:18.555
and we started to ask the question,

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.319
would it be possible,

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.760
in the same way that The Gates

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.958
responded to the physical layout of the park,

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.800
to compose music for a landscape?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.447
Which brought us to this.

00:02:32.447 --> 00:02:37.369
(Music)

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:41.005
On Memorial Day, we released "The National Mall,"

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:43.493
a location-aware album

00:02:43.493 --> 00:02:46.210
released exclusively as a mobile app

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.921
that uses the device's built-in GPS functionality

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:52.706
to sonically map the entire park

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:58.460
in our hometown of Washington, D.C.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.481
Hundreds of musical segments

00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:03.742
are geo-tagged throughout the entire park

00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:06.586
so that as a listener traverses the landscape,

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:09.995
a musical score is actually unfolding around them.

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:12.235
So this is not a playlist or a list of songs

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:14.790
intended for the park,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.786
but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms

00:03:17.786 --> 00:03:20.083
that fit together like pieces of a puzzle

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:21.646
and blend seamlessly

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:24.112
based on a listener's chosen trajectory.

00:03:24.112 --> 00:03:25.483
So think of this as

00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:28.024
a choose-your-own-adventure of an album.

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:29.616
Let's take a closer look.

00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:31.404
Let's look at one example here.

00:03:31.404 --> 00:03:33.682
So using the app,

00:03:33.682 --> 00:03:35.956
as you make your way towards the grounds

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:37.778
surrounding the Washington Monument,

00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:41.989
you hear the sounds of instruments warming up,

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.997
which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron

00:03:44.997 --> 00:03:49.759
spelling out a very simple melody.

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:55.595
This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.

00:03:55.595 --> 00:03:59.992
Keep walking, and a full choir joins in,

00:03:59.992 --> 00:04:02.094
until you finally reach the top of the hill

00:04:02.094 --> 00:04:04.844
and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.130
and all sorts of musical craziness,

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.943
as if all of these sounds are radiating out

00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:11.783
from this giant obelisk that punctuates

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:14.712
the center of the park.

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:17.501
But were you to walk in the opposite direction,

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:22.872
this entire sequence happens in reverse.

00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:26.072
And were you to actually exit
the perimeter of the park,

00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:28.294
the music would fade to silence,

00:04:28.294 --> 00:04:31.671
and the play button would disappear.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.719
We're sometimes contacted by 
people in other parts of the world

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:36.646
who can't travel to the United States,

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:38.797
but would like to hear this record.

00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:41.440
Well, unlike a normal album,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.728
we haven't been able to accommodate this request.

00:04:43.728 --> 00:04:46.726
When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:48.922
we just can't make that happen,

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:51.100
and the reason is because

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.085
this isn't a promotional app

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:55.534
or a game to promote or accompany

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:57.819
the release of a traditional record.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.553
In this case, the app is the work itself,

00:05:01.553 --> 00:05:03.436
and the architecture of the landscape

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:08.079
is intrinsic to the listening experience.

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:10.947
Six months later, we did a location-aware album

00:05:10.947 --> 00:05:12.488
for Central Park,

00:05:12.488 --> 00:05:15.760
a park that is over two times
the size of the National Mall,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.144
with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow

00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:21.556
to the Ramble to the Reservoir.

00:05:21.556 --> 00:05:23.559
Currently, my brother and I are working on

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.876
projects all over the country,

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:28.124
but last spring we started a project,

00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:29.785
here actually at Stanford's

00:05:29.785 --> 00:05:32.377
Experimental Media Art Department,

00:05:32.377 --> 00:05:35.335
where we're creating our largest
location-aware album to date,

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.425
one that will span the entirety of Highway 1

00:05:37.425 --> 00:05:39.715
here on the Pacific Coast.

00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:43.865
But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:46.368
is really just one idea.

00:05:46.368 --> 00:05:48.706
But it speaks to a larger vision

00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:50.855
for a music industry that's sometimes struggled

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:53.687
to find its footing in this digital age,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.152
that they begin to see these new technologies

00:05:56.152 --> 00:05:58.397
not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles

00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:00.254
to an existing model,

00:06:00.254 --> 00:06:01.992
but to dream up entirely new ways

00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:03.709
for people to interact with

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:05.451
and experience music.

00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:07.495
Thank you.

00:06:07.495 --> 00:06:11.495
(Applause)
