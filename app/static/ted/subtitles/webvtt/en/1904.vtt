00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:03.924
The entire model of capitalism

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:06.103
and the economic model that you and I

00:00:06.103 --> 00:00:07.782
did business in,

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:09.609
and, in fact, continue to do business in,

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.232
was built around what probably Milton Friedman

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:14.950
put more succinctly.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.530
And Adam Smith, of course, 
the father of modern economics

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.879
actually said many, many years ago,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:21.397
the invisible hand,

00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:23.053
which is, "If you continue to operate

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:25.166
in your own self-interest

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.922
you will do the best good for society."

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:32.653
Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:35.455
and I've talked about a lot of good 
things that have happened,

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:38.841
but equally, it has not been able to meet up

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.777
with some of the challenges that we've seen

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:42.438
in society.

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:44.652
The model that at least I was brought up in

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:46.932
and a lot of us doing
business were brought up in

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:48.641
was one which talked about

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:51.069
what I call the three G's of growth:

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:52.658
growth that is consistent,


00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:54.184
quarter on quarter;

00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:55.622
growth that is competitive,

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.952
better than the other person;

00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:58.514
and growth that is profitable,

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.003
so you continue to make

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.922
more and more shareholder value.

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:05.714
And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough

00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:08.374
and we have to move from this 3G model

00:01:08.374 --> 00:01:10.688
to a model of what I call

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:12.234
the fourth G:

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:16.123
the G of growth that is responsible.

00:01:16.123 --> 00:01:19.560
And it is this that has to become

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800
a very important part

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.675
of creating value.

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:26.400
Of not just creating economic value

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.854
but creating social value.

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.654
And companies that will thrive are those

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:35.019
that will actually embrace the fourth G.

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.044
And the model of 4G is quite simple:

00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:41.816
Companies cannot afford 
to be just innocent bystanders

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:44.151
in what's happening around in society.

00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:47.718
They have to begin to play their role

00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:49.878
in terms of serving the communities

00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:51.976
which actually sustain them.

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:53.673
And we have to move to a model

00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:55.766
of an and/and model which is

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:59.248
how do we make money and do good?

00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:01.056
How do we make sure

00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:02.636
that we have a great business

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:05.508
but we also have a great environment around us?

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:06.828
And that model

00:02:06.828 --> 00:02:09.797
is all about doing well and doing good.

00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:12.118
But the question is easier said than done.

00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:14.255
But how do we actually get that done?

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:15.601
And I do believe

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.691
that the answer to that is going to be leadership.

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:20.048
It is going to be to redefine

00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:21.918
the new business models

00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:23.264
which understand

00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:25.269
that the only license to operate

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.406
is to combine these things.

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:29.338
And for that you need businesses

00:02:29.338 --> 00:02:32.097
that can actually define their role

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:34.182
in society

00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:35.826
in terms of a much larger purpose

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:38.657
than the products and brands that they sell.

00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:41.890
And companies that actually define a true north,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.636
things that are nonnegotiable

00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:46.196
whether times are good, bad, ugly --

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:47.463
doesn't matter.

00:02:47.463 --> 00:02:49.629
There are things that you stand for.

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.121
Values and purpose are going to be the two

00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:56.256
drivers of software

00:02:56.256 --> 00:02:57.968
that are going to create

00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:00.034
the companies of tomorrow.

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:01.440
And I'm going to now shift

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.458
to talking a little bit about my own experiences.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:08.338
I joined Unilever in 1976

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:11.471
as a management trainee in India.

00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:13.806
And on my first day of work

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:16.140
I walked in and my boss tells me,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.247
"Do you know why you're here?"

00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:21.544
I said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap."

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:24.630
And he said, 
"No, you're here to change lives."

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.922
You're here to change lives.

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:28.552
You know, I thought it was rather facetious.

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:31.367
We are a company that sells soap and soup.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:34.239
What are we doing about changing lives?

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.254
And it's then I realized

00:03:38.254 --> 00:03:40.577
that simple acts

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:43.009
like selling a bar of soap

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.498
can save more lives

00:03:44.498 --> 00:03:45.975
than pharmaceutical companies.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.597
I don't know how many of you know

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:50.932
that five million children don't reach the age of five

00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:53.808
because of simple infections that can be prevented

00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:56.748
by an act of washing their hands with soap.

00:03:56.748 --> 00:03:58.200
We run the largest

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.429
hand-washing program

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:00.334
in the world.

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:02.495
We are running a program on hygiene and health

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:04.997
that now touches half a billion people.

00:04:04.997 --> 00:04:06.597
It's not about selling soap,

00:04:06.597 --> 00:04:08.558
there is a larger purpose out there.

00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:10.616
And brands indeed can be

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:12.623
at the forefront of social change.

00:04:12.623 --> 00:04:14.280
And the reason for that is,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.890
when two billion people use your brands

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.542
that's the amplifier.

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.743
Small actions can make a big difference.

00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:23.281
Take another example,

00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:26.551
I was walking around in 
one of our villages in India.

00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.194
Now those of you who have done this

00:04:28.194 --> 00:04:33.368
will realize that this is no walk in the park.

00:04:33.368 --> 00:04:35.943
And we had this lady

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:40.083
who was one of our small distributors --

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:43.695
beautiful, very, very modest, her home --

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:46.103
and she was out there,

00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:47.655
dressed nicely,

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:49.815
her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind

00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:52.041
and her sister-in-law behind her.

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:54.113
The social order was changing

00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:55.863
because this lady

00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:57.999
is part of our Project Shakti

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.283
that is actually teaching women

00:05:00.283 --> 00:05:02.154
how to do small business

00:05:02.154 --> 00:05:03.333
and how to carry the message

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.976
of nutrition and hygiene.

00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:08.183
We have 60,000 such women

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.035
now in India.

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:12.488
It's not about selling soap,

00:05:12.488 --> 00:05:13.941
it's about making sure

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:15.981
that in the process of doing so

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:18.174
you can change people's lives.

00:05:18.174 --> 00:05:21.371
Small actions, big difference.

00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:23.090
Our R&amp;D folks

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.719
are not only working to give us 
some fantastic detergents,

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.488
but they're working to make sure we use less water.

00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:31.652
A product that we've just launched recently,

00:05:31.652 --> 00:05:35.180
One Rinse product that allows you to save water

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.356
every time you wash your clothes.

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:40.381
And if we can convert all our users to using this,

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:42.614
that's 500 billion liters of water.

00:05:42.614 --> 00:05:44.908
By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water

00:05:44.908 --> 00:05:48.092
for a whole huge continent.

00:05:48.092 --> 00:05:49.768
So just think about it.

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:53.335
There are small actions that 
can make a big difference.

00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:54.953
And I can go on and on.

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:57.050
Our food chain, our brilliant products --

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.419
and I'm sorry I'm giving you 
a word from the sponsors --

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.121
Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.

00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:05.181
We are committed to making sure that

00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:07.138
all our agricultural raw materials

00:06:07.138 --> 00:06:09.944
are sourced from sustainable sources,

00:06:09.944 --> 00:06:12.044
100-percent sustainable sources.

00:06:12.044 --> 00:06:13.592
We were the first

00:06:13.592 --> 00:06:15.801
to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil

00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:17.763
from sustainable sources.

00:06:17.763 --> 00:06:21.683
I don't know how many of you know that palm oil,

00:06:21.683 --> 00:06:24.096
and not buying it from sustainable sources,

00:06:24.096 --> 00:06:26.701
can create deforestation that is responsible

00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:29.243
for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:31.759
We were the first to embrace that,

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.157
and it's all because we market soap and soup.

00:06:36.157 --> 00:06:38.355
And the point I'm making here

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:41.878
is that companies like yours, companies like mine

00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:44.001
have to define a purpose

00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.282
which embraces responsibility

00:06:46.282 --> 00:06:48.982
and understands that we have to play our part

00:06:48.982 --> 00:06:51.819
in the communities in which we operate.

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.719
We introduced something called

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.463
The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said,

00:06:56.463 --> 00:06:59.349
"Our purpose is to make 
sustainable living commonplace,

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:01.176
and we are gong to change the lives

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:03.901
of one billion people over 2020."

00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:05.701
Now the question here is,

00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:07.225
where do we go from here?

00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:09.145
And the answer to that is very simple:

00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:11.278
We're not going to change the world alone.

00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:13.868
There are plenty of you and plenty of us

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:15.338
who understand this.

00:07:15.338 --> 00:07:16.503
The question is,

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:19.134
we need partnerships, we need coalitions

00:07:19.134 --> 00:07:21.590
and importantly, we need that leadership

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.550
that will allow us to take this from here

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.839
and to be the change

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:27.375
that we want to see around us.

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:28.695
Thank you very much.

00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:32.510
(Applause)
