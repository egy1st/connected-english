00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.779
It's a pleasure to be here

00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:03.728
in Edinburgh, Scotland,

00:00:03.728 --> 00:00:06.891
the birthplace of the needle and syringe.

00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:09.732
Less than a mile from here in this direction,

00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:11.706
in 1853 a Scotsman

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:14.134
filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe.

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:16.236
His name was Alexander Wood,

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:19.987
and it was at the Royal College of Physicians.

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:22.465
This is the patent.

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:25.176
What blows my mind when I look at it even today

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.349
is that it looks almost identical

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.106
to the needle in use today.

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:32.666
Yet, it's 160 years old.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.161
So we turn to the field of vaccines.

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.390
Most vaccines are delivered with

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.534
the needle and syringe, 
this 160-year-old technology.

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:43.445
And credit where it's due -- on many levels,

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:47.096
vaccines are a successful technology.

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:50.985
After clean water and sanitation,

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:55.259
vaccines are the one technology that has increased

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:57.789
our life span the most.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.264
That's a pretty hard act to beat.

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:02.057
But just like any other technology,

00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:03.902
vaccines have their shortcomings,

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:06.538
and the needle and syringe

00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:08.741
is a key part within that narrative --

00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:11.670
this old technology.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.969
So let's start with the obvious:

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.451
Many of us don't like the needle and syringe.

00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.365
I share that view.

00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:22.557
However, 20 percent of the population

00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:24.833
have a thing called needle phobia.

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.594
That's more than disliking the needle;

00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:29.063
that is actively avoiding being vaccinated

00:01:29.063 --> 00:01:30.927
because of needle phobia.

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:34.934
And that's problematic in terms 
of the rollout of vaccines.

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:37.079
Now, related to this is another key issue,

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.412
which is needlestick injuries.

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:41.384
And the WHO has figures

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:45.219
that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.611
take place due to cross-contamination

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:48.895
with needlestick injuries.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:51.577
These are early deaths that take place.

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:54.558
Now, these are two things that 
you probably may have heard of,

00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:56.438
but there are two other shortcomings

00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:58.922
of the needle and syringe you 
may not have heard about.

00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:00.903
One is it could be holding back

00:02:00.903 --> 00:02:02.382
the next generation of vaccines

00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:04.671
in terms of their immune responses.

00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.598
And the second is that it could be responsible

00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:12.210
for the problem of the cold chain
that I'll tell you about as well.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.792
I'm going to tell you about some work

00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:15.860
that my team and I are doing in Australia

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.601
at the University of Queensland

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:21.998
on a technology designed to 
tackle those four problems.

00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:26.343
And that technology is called the Nanopatch.

00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:32.817
Now, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch.

00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:34.466
To the naked eye

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:36.650
it just looks like a square

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.549
smaller than a postage stamp,

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.215
but under a microscope

00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:44.533
what you see are thousands of tiny projections

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:46.754
that are invisible to the human eye.

00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:48.511
And there's about 4,000 projections

00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:51.893
on this particular square compared to the needle.

00:02:51.907 --> 00:02:54.551
And I've designed those projections

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:58.601
to serve a key role, which is to 
work with the skin's immune system.

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:00.996
So that's a very important function

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:02.452
tied in with the Nanopatch.

00:03:02.452 --> 00:03:04.699
Now we make the Nanopatch

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.236
with a technique

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:09.615
called deep reactive ion etching.

00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.659
And this particular technique 
is one that's been borrowed

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.286
from the semiconductor industry,

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:15.122
and therefore is low cost

00:03:15.122 --> 00:03:17.316
and can be rolled out in large numbers.

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:22.382
Now we dry-coat vaccines to 
the projections of the Nanopatch

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:24.201
and apply it to the skin.

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:28.757
Now, the simplest form of application

00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:30.779
is using our finger,

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.399
but our finger has some limitations,

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.483
so we've devised an applicator.

00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:36.970
And it's a very simple device --

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.088
you could call it a sophisticated finger.

00:03:39.088 --> 00:03:42.128
It's a spring-operated device.

00:03:42.128 --> 00:03:45.950
What we do is when we apply 
the Nanopatch to the skin as so --

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.819
(Click) --

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.736
immediately a few things happen.

00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:54.783
So firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch

00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:56.460
breach through the tough outer layer

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.506
and the vaccine is very quickly released --

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.854
within less than a minute, in fact.

00:04:00.854 --> 00:04:03.420
Then we can take the Nanopatch off

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.358
and discard it.

00:04:05.358 --> 00:04:11.244
And indeed we can make 
a reuse of the applicator itself.

00:04:11.244 --> 00:04:13.980
So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.556
and immediately you can see some key advantages.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.496
We've talked about it being needle-free --

00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:20.730
these are projections that you can't even see --

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.441
and, of course, we get around

00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:25.514
the needle phobia issue as well.

00:04:25.514 --> 00:04:27.445
Now, if we take a step back and think about

00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:30.841
these other two really important advantages:

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:34.877
One is improved immune 
responses through delivery,

00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:38.471
and the second is getting rid of the cold chain.

00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:40.843
So let's start with the first one, 
this immunogenicity idea.

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:42.849
It takes a little while to get our heads around,

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.578
but I'll try to explain it in simple terms.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.428
So I'll take a step back and explain to you

00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:51.838
how vaccines work in a simple way.

00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:54.415
So vaccines work by introducing into our body

00:04:54.415 --> 00:04:56.518
a thing called an antigen

00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:59.695
which is a safe form of a germ.

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:01.715
Now that safe germ, that antigen,

00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:05.220
tricks our body into mounting an immune response,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.288
learning and remembering 
how to deal with intruders.

00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:11.656
When the real intruder comes along

00:05:11.656 --> 00:05:13.417
the body quickly mounts an immune response

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:15.053
to deal with that vaccine

00:05:15.053 --> 00:05:16.953
and neutralizes the infection.

00:05:16.953 --> 00:05:18.643
So it does that well.

00:05:18.643 --> 00:05:20.980
Now, the way it's done today 
with the needle and syringe,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.431
most vaccines are delivered that way --

00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:25.115
with this old technology and the needle.

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:30.264
But it could be argued that the needle 
is holding back our immune responses;

00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:33.706
it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin.

00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:36.702
To describe this idea,

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:39.191
we need to take a journey through the skin,

00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:41.815
starting with one of those projections

00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:44.260
and applying the Nanopatch to the skin.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.660
And we see this kind of data.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.469
Now, this is real data --

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.815
that thing that we can see there is one projection

00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:53.271
from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin

00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:55.196
and those colors are different layers.

00:05:55.196 --> 00:05:56.480
Now, to give you an idea of scale,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.420
if the needle was shown here, it would be too big.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.945
It would be 10 times bigger

00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:02.867
than the size of that screen,
going 10 times deeper as well.

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:05.082
It's off the grid entirely.

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:08.275
You can see immediately that we 
have those projections in the skin.

00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:11.327
That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,

00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:13.834
but the brown layer and the magenta layer

00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:17.022
are jammed full of immune cells.

00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:18.878
As one example, in the brown layer

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.232
there's a certain type of cell 
called a Langerhans cell --

00:06:21.232 --> 00:06:23.445
every square millimeter of our body

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:26.465
is jammed full of those Langerhans cells,

00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:28.568
those immune cells, and 
there's others shown as well

00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:30.363
that we haven't stained in this image.

00:06:30.363 --> 00:06:32.543
But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch

00:06:32.543 --> 00:06:34.280
achieves that penetration indeed.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.709
We target thousands upon thousands 
of these particular cells

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:40.047
just residing within a hair's width

00:06:40.047 --> 00:06:43.328
of the surface of the skin.

00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:47.090
Now, as the guy that's invented
this thing and designed it to do that,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.526
I found that exciting. But so what?

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:52.478
So what if you've targeted cells?

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:55.281
In the world of vaccines, what does that mean?

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.702
The world of vaccines is getting better.

00:06:57.702 --> 00:06:59.426
It's getting more systematic.

00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:01.648
However, you still don't really know

00:07:01.648 --> 00:07:03.392
if a vaccine is going to work

00:07:03.392 --> 00:07:04.731
until you roll your sleeves up

00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:06.946
and vaccinate and wait.

00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:09.648
It's a gambler's game even today.

00:07:09.648 --> 00:07:12.160
So, we had to do that gamble.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.640
We obtained an influenza vaccine,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.256
we applied it to our Nanopatches

00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:18.727
and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,

00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:20.460
and we waited --

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.288
and this is in the live animal.

00:07:22.288 --> 00:07:24.139
We waited a month,

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.951
and this is what we found out.

00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:28.276
This is a data slide showing the immune responses

00:07:28.276 --> 00:07:30.599
that we've generated with a Nanopatch

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.375
compared to the needle and syringe into muscle.

00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:37.969
So on the horizontal axis we have 
the dose shown in nanograms.

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:40.674
On the vertical axis we have 
the immune response generated,

00:07:40.674 --> 00:07:46.189
and that dashed line indicates 
the protection threshold.

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:48.642
If we're above that line it's considered protective;

00:07:48.642 --> 00:07:51.568
if we're below that line it's not.

00:07:51.568 --> 00:07:54.136
So the red line is mostly below that curve

00:07:54.136 --> 00:07:57.660
and indeed there's only one point that 
is achieved with the needle that's protective,

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.869
and that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:03.402
But notice immediately the distinctly different curve

00:08:03.402 --> 00:08:06.466
that we achieve with the blue line.

00:08:06.466 --> 00:08:08.366
That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;

00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:10.103
the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is

00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:13.464
a completely different immunogenicity curve.

00:08:13.464 --> 00:08:15.297
That's a real fresh opportunity.

00:08:15.297 --> 00:08:17.675
Suddenly we have a brand new lever

00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:19.203
in the world of vaccines.

00:08:19.203 --> 00:08:20.714
We can push it one way,

00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:23.305
where we can take a vaccine 
that works but is too expensive

00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:24.964
and can get protection

00:08:24.964 --> 00:08:27.788
with a hundredth of the dose 
compared to the needle.

00:08:27.788 --> 00:08:31.839
That can take a vaccine that's suddenly 
10 dollars down to 10 cents,

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:35.019
and that's particularly important 
within the developing world.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:36.886
But there's another angle to this as well --

00:08:36.886 --> 00:08:39.938
you can take vaccines that currently don't work

00:08:39.938 --> 00:08:41.134
and get them over that line

00:08:41.134 --> 00:08:43.092
and get them protective.

00:08:43.092 --> 00:08:45.320
And certainly in the world of vaccines

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.540
that can be important.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.038
Let's consider the big three:

00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:50.735
HIV, malaria, tuberculosis.

00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:53.327
They're responsible for about 
7 million deaths per year,

00:08:53.327 --> 00:08:56.534
and there is no adequate vaccination 
method for any of those.

00:08:56.534 --> 00:08:59.066
So potentially, with this new lever 
that we have with the Nanopatch,

00:08:59.066 --> 00:09:00.901
we can help make that happen.

00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:05.771
We can push that lever to help get those 
candidate vaccines over the line.

00:09:05.771 --> 00:09:07.589
Now, of course, we've worked within my lab

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.379
with many other vaccines that have attained

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:12.197
similar responses and similar curves to this,

00:09:12.197 --> 00:09:15.962
what we've achieved with influenza.

00:09:15.962 --> 00:09:18.121
I'd like to now switch to talk about

00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.453
another key shortcoming of today's vaccines,

00:09:21.453 --> 00:09:24.873
and that is the need to maintain the cold chain.

00:09:24.873 --> 00:09:27.547
As the name suggests -- the cold chain --

00:09:27.547 --> 00:09:30.487
it's the requirements of keeping 
a vaccine right from production

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.163
all the way through to when the vaccine is applied,

00:09:33.163 --> 00:09:36.261
to keep it refrigerated.

00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:39.507
Now, that presents some logistical challenges

00:09:39.507 --> 00:09:42.497
but we have ways to do it.

00:09:42.497 --> 00:09:47.033
This is a slightly extreme case in point

00:09:47.033 --> 00:09:49.516
but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,

00:09:49.516 --> 00:09:51.906
in particular in resource-poor settings,

00:09:51.906 --> 00:09:55.192
of what's required to get vaccines

00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:56.910
refrigerated and maintain the cold chain.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.724
If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,

00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:02.931
but interestingly it can be too cold

00:10:02.931 --> 00:10:05.492
and the vaccine can break down as well.

00:10:05.492 --> 00:10:08.874
Now, the stakes are very high.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:11.409
The WHO estimates that within Africa,

00:10:11.409 --> 00:10:14.060
up to half the vaccines used there

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.913
are considered to not be working properly

00:10:15.913 --> 00:10:18.903
because at some point the 
cold chain has fallen over.

00:10:18.903 --> 00:10:21.469
So it's a big problem, and it's tied 
in with the needle and syringe

00:10:21.469 --> 00:10:26.702
because it's a liquid form vaccine, and 
when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration.

00:10:26.702 --> 00:10:29.213
A key attribute of our Nanopatch

00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:31.186
is that the vaccine is dry,

00:10:31.186 --> 00:10:33.975
and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration.

00:10:33.975 --> 00:10:36.387
Within my lab we've shown that we can keep

00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:39.067
the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:42.783
for more than a year without 
any loss in activity at all.

00:10:42.783 --> 00:10:45.170
That's an important improvement.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:51.770
(Applause)

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.233
We're delighted about it as well.

00:10:54.233 --> 00:10:58.529
And the thing about it is that
we have well and truly proven

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:01.192
the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting.

00:11:01.192 --> 00:11:05.165
And as a scientist, I love that and I love science.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.673
However, as an engineer,

00:11:07.673 --> 00:11:09.386
as a biomedical engineer

00:11:09.386 --> 00:11:11.589
and also as a human being,

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:12.820
I'm not going to be satisfied

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.513
until we've rolled this thing 
out, taken it out of the lab

00:11:15.513 --> 00:11:17.944
and got it to people in large numbers

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:21.480
and particularly the people that need it the most.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.182
So we've commenced this particular journey,

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:26.843
and we've commenced this 
journey in an unusual way.

00:11:26.843 --> 00:11:29.832
We've started with Papua New Guinea.

00:11:29.832 --> 00:11:35.637
Now, Papua New Guinea is an example 
of a developing world country.

00:11:35.637 --> 00:11:38.773
It's about the same size as France,

00:11:38.773 --> 00:11:41.608
but it suffers from many of the key barriers

00:11:41.608 --> 00:11:45.676
existing within the world of today's vaccines.

00:11:45.676 --> 00:11:47.289
There's the logistics:

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:51.647
Within this country there are only 800 
refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled.

00:11:51.647 --> 00:11:55.940
Many of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby,
many of them are breaking down

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.856
and many are not in the Highlands 
where they are required.

00:11:58.856 --> 00:12:00.319
That's a challenge.

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:05.502
But also, Papua New Guinea has the 
world's highest incidence of HPV,

00:12:05.502 --> 00:12:09.733
human papillomavirus, the 
cervical cancer [risk factor].

00:12:09.733 --> 00:12:12.434
Yet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers

00:12:12.434 --> 00:12:14.348
because it's too expensive.

00:12:14.348 --> 00:12:17.094
So for those two reasons, with 
the attributes of the Nanopatch,

00:12:17.094 --> 00:12:19.709
we've got into the field and 
worked with the Nanopatch,

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:22.160
and taken it to Papua New Guinea

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.143
and we'll be following that up shortly.

00:12:26.143 --> 00:12:29.625
Now, doing this kind of work is not easy.

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:30.973
It's challenging,

00:12:30.973 --> 00:12:34.297
but there's nothing else in 
the world I'd rather be doing.

00:12:34.297 --> 00:12:36.320
And as we look ahead

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.062
I'd like to share with you a thought:

00:12:40.062 --> 00:12:44.070
It's the thought of a future where

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.003
the 17 million deaths per year

00:12:46.003 --> 00:12:48.347
that we currently have due to infectious disease

00:12:48.347 --> 00:12:50.981
is a historical footnote.

00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:53.077
And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved

00:12:53.077 --> 00:12:56.545
by improved, radically improved vaccines.

00:12:56.545 --> 00:12:58.828
Now standing here today in front of you

00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:00.501
at the birthplace of the needle and syringe,

00:13:00.501 --> 00:13:03.298
a device that's 160 years old,

00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:05.634
I'm presenting to you an alternative approach

00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:07.883
that could really help make that happen --

00:13:07.883 --> 00:13:11.865
and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes 
of being needle-free, pain-free,

00:13:11.865 --> 00:13:16.296
the ability for removing the cold chain
and improving the immunogenicity.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.249
Thank you.

00:13:18.249 --> 00:13:21.417
(Applause)
