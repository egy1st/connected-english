00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:03.271
Pat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage.

00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:06.214
Sheryl Sandberg: First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:08.132
and see so many women.

00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:13.262
It's so not my regular experience, 
as I know anyone else's.

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:18.654
PM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media,

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:23.310
which we assumed it would be, but 
that you had very much on your mind

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.464
the missing leadership positions, particularly 
in the sector of technology and social media.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:37.238
But how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave?

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:39.809
SS: So I was really scared to get on 
this stage and talk about women,

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.461
because I grew up in the business 
world, as I think so many of us did.

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:49.793
You never talk about being a woman, because 
someone might notice that you're a woman, right?

00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:53.953
They might notice. Or worse, if you say "woman," 
people on the other end of the table

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:57.043
think you're asking for special 
treatment, or complaining.

00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:00.751
Or worse, about to sue them. 
And so I went through -- (Laughter)

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:02.929
Right? I went through my entire business career,

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.557
and never spoke about being a woman, 
never spoke about it publicly.

00:01:06.557 --> 00:01:09.460
But I also had noticed that it wasn't working.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.899
I came out of college over 
20 years ago, and I thought

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.798
that all of my peers were men and women, 
all the people above me were all men,

00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:17.896
but that would change,

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:22.429
because your generation had done such 
an amazing job fighting for equality,

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.041
equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't.

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:29.376
Because year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer,

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:31.328
and now, often the only woman in a room.

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:33.418
And I talked to a bunch of people about,

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:36.839
should I give a speech at TEDWomen 
about women, and they said, oh no, no.

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:42.033
It will end your business career. You 
cannot be a serious business executive

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:45.471
and speak about being a woman. 
You'll never be taken seriously again.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:50.346
But fortunately, there were the few, the proud -- like you -- who told me I should give the speech,

00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:53.002
and I asked myself the question 
Mark Zuckerberg might --

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.840
the founder of Facebook and my boss --

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.419
asks all of us, which is, what 
would I do if I wasn't afraid?

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:03.227
And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't 
afraid is I would get on the TED stage,

00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:10.746
and talk about women, and leadership. 
And I did, and survived. (Applause)

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:14.581
PM: I would say, not only survived. 
I'm thinking of that moment, Sheryl,

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:18.914
when you and I were standing backstage 
together, and you turned to me,

00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:20.652
and you told me a story.

00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:24.531
And I said -- very last minute -- you know, 
you really should share that story.

00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:26.281
SS: Oh, yeah.
PM: What was that story?

00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.546
SS: Well, it's an important part of the 
journey. So I had -- TEDWomen --

00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:33.355
the original one was in D.C. -- so I live here, 
so I had gotten on a plane the day before,

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:38.404
and my daughter was three, she was 
clinging to my leg: "Mommy, don't go."

00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:42.137
And Pat's a friend, and so, not related 
to the speech I was planning on giving,

00:02:42.137 --> 00:02:46.599
which was chock full of facts and 
figures, and nothing personal,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.865
I told Pat the story. I said, well, 
I'm having a hard day.

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.469
Yesterday my daughter was clinging 
to my leg, and "Don't go."

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.213
And you looked at me and said, 
you have to tell that story.

00:02:53.213 --> 00:02:57.448
I said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding?

00:02:57.448 --> 00:02:59.905
I'm going to get on a stage and admit 
my daughter was clinging to my leg?

00:02:59.905 --> 00:03:04.072
And you said yes, because if you want to talk 
about getting more women into leadership roles,

00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:07.209
you have to be honest about how hard it is.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.945
And I did. And I think that's a really 
important part of the journey.

00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:17.243
The same thing happened when I wrote my book. 
I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter,

00:03:17.243 --> 00:03:21.209
I thought it was fabulous. It was 
chock-full of data and figures,

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:29.069
I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai 
tribes, and their sociological patterns.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.132
My husband read it and he was like, this 
is like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter)

00:03:34.132 --> 00:03:41.497
No one -- and I apologize to Wheaties if there's 
someone -- no one, no one will read this book.

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:45.682
And I realized through the process that I 
had to be more honest and more open,

00:03:45.682 --> 00:03:50.428
and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still 
not feeling as self-confident as I should,

00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:56.647
in many situations. My first and 
failed marriage. Crying at work.

00:03:56.647 --> 00:04:00.319
Felling like I didn't belong there, 
feeling guilty to this day.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.714
And part of my journey, starting on this stage, 
going to "Lean In," going to the foundation,

00:04:04.714 --> 00:04:08.602
is all about being more open and 
honest about those challenges,

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:10.610
so that other women can be more open and honest,

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.242
and all of us can work together towards real equality.

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:17.584
PM: I think that one of the most 
striking parts about the book,

00:04:17.584 --> 00:04:23.449
and in my opinion, one of the reasons it's hit such 
a nerve and is resonating around the world,

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.234
is that you are personal in the book, 
and that you do make it clear that,

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:33.392
while you've observed some things that are 
very important for other women to know,

00:04:33.392 --> 00:04:37.951
that you've had the same challenges 
that many others of us have,

00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:44.746
as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and 
possibly the people who don't believe the same.

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:49.384
So talk about that process: deciding 
you'd go public with the private part,

00:04:49.384 --> 00:04:53.101
and then you would also put yourself in 
the position of something of an expert

00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:56.542
on how to resolve those challenges.

00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:58.726
SS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was --

00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:02.474
you know, I never really expected to write 
a book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer,

00:05:02.474 --> 00:05:07.143
and it was viewed a lot, and it really 
started impacting people's lives.

00:05:07.143 --> 00:05:10.663
I got this great --- one of the first 
letters I got was from a woman

00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:15.789
who said that she was offered a really big 
promotion at work, and she turned it down,

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.142
and she told her best friend she turned 
it down, and her best friend said,

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:19.975
you really need to watch this TED Talk.

00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:24.391
And so she watched this TED Talk, and she 
went back the next day, she took the job,

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:29.239
she went home, and she handed her 
husband the grocery list. (Laughter)

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.831
And she said, I can do this.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.984
And what really mattered to me -- it wasn't 
only women in the corporate world,

00:05:33.984 --> 00:05:36.954
even though I did hear from a lot of 
them, and it did impact a lot of them,

00:05:36.954 --> 00:05:40.784
it was also people of all different circumstances.

00:05:40.784 --> 00:05:44.531
There was a doctor I met who was an 
attending physician at Johns Hopkins,

00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:48.124
and he said that until he saw my TED 
Talk, it never really occurred to him

00:05:48.124 --> 00:05:50.498
that even though half the students in 
his med school classes were women,

00:05:50.498 --> 00:05:53.409
they weren't speaking as much as 
the men as he did his rounds.

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:59.635
So he started paying attention, and as he waited for 
raised hands, he realized the men's hands were up.

00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:01.920
So he started encouraging the 
women to raise their hands more,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.197
and it still didn't work.

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:06.751
So he told everyone, no more 
hand raising, I'm cold-calling.

00:06:06.751 --> 00:06:10.955
So he could call evenly on men and women. 
And what he proved to himself was that

00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.588
the women knew the answers just as well or better,

00:06:13.588 --> 00:06:15.476
and he was able to go back 
to them and tell them that.

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:20.595
And then there was the woman, stay-at-home 
mom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood,

00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:24.631
with not a great school, she said that TED 
Talk -- she's never had a corporate job,

00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:30.406
but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school 
and fight for a better teacher for her child.

00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:34.698
And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.

00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:38.752
And I realized that other women and 
men could find their voice through it,

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.474
which is why I went from the talk to the book.

00:06:41.474 --> 00:06:47.799
PM: And in the book, you not only found your 
voice, which is clear and strong in the book,

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:51.363
but you also share what you've learned --

00:06:51.363 --> 00:06:54.506
the experiences of other people in the lessons.

00:06:54.506 --> 00:06:58.688
And that's what I'm thinking about 
in terms of putting yourself in a --

00:06:58.688 --> 00:07:03.642
you became a sort of expert in how you lean in.

00:07:03.642 --> 00:07:08.034
So what did that feel like, and 
become like in your life?


00:07:08.034 --> 00:07:14.246
To launch not just a book, not just 
a best-selling, best-viewed talk,

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:20.090
but a movement, where people began to 
literally describe their actions at work as,

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.772
I'm leaning in.

00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:29.986
SS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored, 
I'm happy, and it's the very beginning.

00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:34.500
So I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is 
an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.713
I have read every study, I have 
pored over the materials,

00:07:37.713 --> 00:07:41.341
and the lessons are very clear. 
Because here's what we know:

00:07:41.341 --> 00:07:46.053
What we know is that stereotypes are holding women 
back from leadership roles all over the world.

00:07:46.053 --> 00:07:48.656
It's so striking. "Lean In" is very global, 
I've been all over the world,

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:51.051
talking about it, and -- cultures are so different.

00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:56.044
Even within our own country, to Japan, 
to Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe,

00:07:56.044 --> 00:08:00.231
they're so different. Except for one thing: gender.

00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:02.151
All over the world, no matter what our cultures are,

00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:06.481
we think men should be strong, 
assertive, aggressive, have voice;

00:08:06.481 --> 00:08:10.998
we think women should speak 
when spoken to, help others.

00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:14.703
Now we have, all over the world,

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:18.496
women are called "bossy." 
There is a word for "bossy,"

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:20.814
for little girls, in every language there's one.

00:08:20.814 --> 00:08:23.024
It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys,

00:08:23.024 --> 00:08:25.952
because if a little boy leads, 
there's no negative word for it,

00:08:25.952 --> 00:08:30.741
it's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy.

00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:32.736
Now I know there aren't a lot of 
men here, but bear with me.

00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:35.270
If you're a man, you'll have 
to represent your gender.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.834
Please raise your hand if you've been 
told you're too aggressive at work.

00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:46.718
(Laughter) There's always a few, it runs about 
five percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen.

00:08:46.718 --> 00:08:53.281
If you're a woman, please raise your hand if you've 
ever been told you're too aggressive at work.

00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:56.894
(Laughter) That is what audiences have 
said in every country in the world,

00:08:56.894 --> 00:08:59.760
and it's deeply supported by the data.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.099
Now, do we think women are more 
aggressive than men? Of course not.

00:09:04.099 --> 00:09:06.449
It's just that we judge them through a different lens,

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:11.300
and a lot of the character traits that you must 
exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.164
are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss,

00:09:14.164 --> 00:09:15.786
and in a woman, she's bossy.

00:09:15.786 --> 00:09:19.872
And the good news about this is that we 
can change this by acknowledging it.

00:09:19.872 --> 00:09:22.262
One of the happiest moments 
I had in this whole journey is,

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:27.195
after the book came out, I stood on a stage 
with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.

00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:30.854
He read the book. He stood on a stage with me, he 
invited me in front of his whole management team,

00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:34.246
men and women, and he said, I thought we 
were good at this. I thought I was good at this.

00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:39.312
And then I read this book, and I 
realized that we -- my company --

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.296
we have called all of our 
senior women too aggressive,

00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:43.745
and I'm standing on this stage, and I'm sorry.

00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:47.490
And I want you to know we're 
never going to do it again.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.874
PM: Can we send that to a lot of other 
people that we know? (Applause)

00:09:50.874 --> 00:09:54.775
SS: And so John is doing that because 
he believes it's good for his company,

00:09:54.775 --> 00:09:57.813
and so this kind of acknowledgement 
of these biases can change it.

00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:01.477
And so next time you all see 
someone call a little girl "bossy,"

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:04.025
you walk right up to that person, 
big smile, and you say,

00:10:04.025 --> 00:10:10.560
"That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has 
executive leadership skills." (Laughter)

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.765
PM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter. 
SS: Absolutely.

00:10:13.765 --> 00:10:16.834
PM: And you did focus in the book -- and 
the reason, as you said, in writing it,

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:18.759
was to create a dialogue about this.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:22.273
I mean, let's just put it out there, 
face the fact that women are --

00:10:22.273 --> 00:10:25.948
in a time when we have more open 
doors, and more opportunities --

00:10:25.948 --> 00:10:29.248
are still not getting to the leadership positions.

00:10:29.248 --> 00:10:31.446
So in the months that have come since the book,

00:10:31.446 --> 00:10:34.004
in which "Lean In" focused on that and said,

00:10:34.004 --> 00:10:38.304
here are some of the challenges that remain, and 
many of them we have to own within ourselves

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:41.066
and look at ourselves. What has changed?

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:43.152
Have you seen changes?

00:10:43.152 --> 00:10:45.415
SS: Well, there's certainly more 
dialogue, which is great.

00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:48.463
But what really matters to me, 
and I think all of us, is action.

00:10:48.463 --> 00:10:52.247
So everywhere I go, CEOs, 
they're mostly men, say to me,

00:10:52.247 --> 00:10:54.866
you're costing me so much money

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:58.038
because all the women want to 
be paid as much as the men.

00:10:58.038 --> 00:11:02.319
And to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter)

00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:05.557
At all. I mean, the women should 
be paid as much as the men.

00:11:05.557 --> 00:11:08.694
Everywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.

00:11:08.694 --> 00:11:12.691
Everywhere I go, women say they're getting 
better relationships with their spouses,

00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:16.671
asking for more help at home, asking for the 
promotions they should be getting at work,

00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:19.669
and importantly, believing it 
themselves. Even little things.

00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:23.701
One of the governors of one of the states told me 
that he didn't realize that more women were, in fact,

00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:25.930
literally sitting on the side 
of the room, which they are,

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:31.417
and now he made a rule that all the women 
on his staff need to sit at the table.

00:11:31.417 --> 00:11:33.573
The foundation I started along 
with the book "Lean In"

00:11:33.573 --> 00:11:36.925
helps women, or men, start circles -- small groups,

00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:40.174
it can be 10, it can be however many 
you want, which meet once a month.

00:11:40.174 --> 00:11:43.495
I would have hoped that by now, we'd have 
about 500 circles. That would've been great.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:46.417
You know, 500 times roughly 10.

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:49.647
There are over 12,000 circles 
in 50 countries in the world.

00:11:49.647 --> 00:11:51.207
PM: Wow, that's amazing.

00:11:51.207 --> 00:11:54.282
SS: And these are people who 
are meeting every single month.

00:11:54.282 --> 00:11:56.621
I met one of them, I was in Beijing.

00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:01.321
A group of women, they're all about 29 or 30, 
they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing,

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:05.314
several of them grew up in very poor, rural China.

00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:11.122
These women are 29, they are told by 
their society that they are "left over,"

00:12:11.122 --> 00:12:13.135
because they are not yet married,

00:12:13.135 --> 00:12:15.918
and the process of coming together 
once a month at a meeting

00:12:15.918 --> 00:12:19.218
is helping them define who they are for themselves.

00:12:19.218 --> 00:12:23.554
What they want in their careers. The 
kind of partners they want, if at all.

00:12:23.554 --> 00:12:25.541
I looked at them, we went around 
and introduced ourselves,

00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:27.380
and they all said their names 
and where they're from,

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.860
and I said, I'm Sheryl Sandberg, 
and this was my dream.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.700
And I kind of just started crying.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.457
Right, which, I admit, I do. Right? 
I've talked about it before.

00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:42.027
But the fact that a woman so far away out in 
the world, who grew up in a rural village,

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:46.138
who's being told to marry someone 
she doesn't want to marry,

00:12:46.138 --> 00:12:49.075
can now go meet once a month with 
a group of people and refuse that,

00:12:49.075 --> 00:12:52.069
and find life on her own terms.

00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:54.012
That's the kind of change we have to hope for.

00:12:54.012 --> 00:12:57.559
PM: Have you been surprised by 
the global nature of the message?


00:12:57.559 --> 00:13:00.864
Because I think when the book first 
came out, many people thought,

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:04.616
well, this is a really important handbook 
for young women on their way up.

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:08.930
They need to look at this, anticipate 
the barriers, and recognize them,

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.580
put them out in the open, have the dialogue about it,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.699
but that it's really for women who are that. 
Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world.

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:21.077
And yet the book is being read, as you 
say, in rural and developing countries.

00:13:21.082 --> 00:13:28.359
What part of that has surprised you, and 
perhaps led to a new perspective on your part?

00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:31.515
SS: The book is about self-confidence, 
and about equality.

00:13:31.515 --> 00:13:35.415
And it turns out, everywhere in the world, 
women need more self-confidence,

00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:37.636
because the world tells us we're not equal to men.

00:13:37.636 --> 00:13:41.049
Everywhere in the world, we live in 
a world where the men get "and,"

00:13:41.049 --> 00:13:42.360
and women get "or."

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.034
I've never met a man who's been 
asked how he does it all. (Laughter)

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:49.247
Again, I'm going to turn to the men in the audience:

00:13:49.247 --> 00:13:52.279
Please raise your hand if you've 
been asked, how do you do it all?

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:53.728
(Laughter)

00:13:53.728 --> 00:13:55.159
Men only.

00:13:55.159 --> 00:14:00.037
Women, women. Please raise your hand 
if you've been asked how you do it all?

00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:06.396
We assume men can do it all, 
slash -- have jobs and children.

00:14:06.396 --> 00:14:08.174
We assume women can't, and that's ridiculous,

00:14:08.174 --> 00:14:11.750
because the great majority of women everywhere 
in the world, including the United States,

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.046
work full time and have children.

00:14:14.046 --> 00:14:19.218
And I think people don't fully understand 
how broad the message is.

00:14:19.218 --> 00:14:23.580
There is a circle that's been started 
for rescued sex workers in Miami.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.931
They're using "Lean In" to help 
people make the transition

00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:33.672
back to what would be a fair life, really rescuing 
them from their pimps, and using it.

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:37.421
There are dress-for-success groups 
in Texas which are using the book,

00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:39.080
for women who have never been to college.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.008
And we know there are groups 
all the way to Ethiopia.

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:48.891
And so these messages of equality -- of how women 
are told they can't have what men can have --

00:14:48.891 --> 00:14:53.124
how we assume that leadership is for men, 
how we assume that voice is for men,

00:14:53.124 --> 00:14:56.262
these affect all of us, and I 
think they are very universal.

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:57.923
And it's part of what TEDWomen does.

00:14:57.923 --> 00:15:01.706
It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in,

00:15:01.706 --> 00:15:05.954
which is more women, more voice, more equality.

00:15:05.954 --> 00:15:12.735
PM: If you were invited now to 
make another TEDWomen talk,

00:15:12.735 --> 00:15:18.029
what would you say that is a result 
of this experience, for you personally,

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:20.648
and what you've learned about women, and men,

00:15:20.648 --> 00:15:24.334
as you've made this journey?

00:15:24.334 --> 00:15:27.432
SS: I think I would say -- I tried to say this strongly,

00:15:27.432 --> 00:15:29.886
but I think I can say it more strongly --

00:15:29.886 --> 00:15:33.290
I want to say that the status quo is not enough.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.270
That it's not good enough, that it's 
not changing quickly enough.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.397
Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book, 
another year of data came out from the U.S. Census.

00:15:41.397 --> 00:15:43.186
And you know what we found?

00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:45.963
No movement in the wage gap 
for women in the United States.

00:15:45.963 --> 00:15:48.509
Seventy-seven cents to the dollar.

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:50.543
If you are a black woman, 64 cents.

00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:53.051
If you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents.

00:15:53.051 --> 00:15:55.479
Do you know when the last 
time those numbers went up?

00:15:55.479 --> 00:15:59.786
2002.

00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:02.670
We are stagnating, we are 
stagnating in so many ways.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.478
And I think we are not really being honest about that,

00:16:05.478 --> 00:16:08.724
for so many reasons. It's so 
hard to talk about gender.

00:16:08.724 --> 00:16:12.541
We shy away from the word "feminist," 
a word I really think we need to embrace.

00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:15.733
We have to get rid of the 
word bossy and bring back --

00:16:15.733 --> 00:16:18.893
(Applause)

00:16:18.893 --> 00:16:23.215
I think I would say in a louder voice, 
we need to get rid of the word "bossy"

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:26.276
and bring back the word "feminist," 
because we need it.

00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:27.761
(Applause)

00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:30.803
PM: And we all need to do a lot more leaning in.

00:16:30.803 --> 00:16:32.004
SS: A lot more leaning in.

00:16:32.004 --> 00:16:33.234
PM: Thank you, Sheryl.

00:16:33.234 --> 00:16:34.468
Thanks for leaning in and saying yes.

00:16:34.468 --> 00:16:36.630
SS: Thank you.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.899
(Applause)
