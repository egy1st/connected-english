WEBVTT

00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.458
Two years ago, I have to say there was no problem.

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:07.516
Two years ago, I knew exactly 
what an icon looked like.

00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:09.871
It looks like this.

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.700
Everybody's icon, but also the default position

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.523
of a curator of Italian Renaissance 
paintings, which I was then.

00:00:16.523 --> 00:00:20.215
And in a way, this is also another default selection.

00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:24.762
Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.062
of the "Lady with an Ermine."

00:00:26.062 --> 00:00:28.605
And I use that word, soulful, deliberately.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.988
Or then there's this, or rather these:

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:33.642
the two versions of Leonardo's "Virgin of the Rocks"

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:37.918
that were about to come together 
in London for the very first time.

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:42.102
In the exhibition that I was then in 
the absolute throes of organizing.

00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:45.539
I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo,

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.357
and I had been for three years.

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:51.779
So, he was occupying every part of my brain.

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:54.620
Leonardo had taught me, during that three years,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.468
about what a picture can do.

00:00:56.468 --> 00:01:01.786
About taking you from your own 
material world into a spiritual world.

00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:04.677
He said, actually, that he believed 
the job of the painter

00:01:04.677 --> 00:01:09.128
was to paint everything that was visible 
and invisible in the universe.

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:13.125
That's a huge task. And yet, 
somehow he achieves it.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.896
He shows us, I think, the human soul.

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:20.342
He shows us the capacity of ourselves

00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:23.770
to move into a spiritual realm.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.298
To see a vision of the universe that's 
more perfect than our own.

00:01:28.298 --> 00:01:31.874
To see God's own plan, in some sense.

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:35.945
So this, in a sense, was really 
what I believed an icon was.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:39.803
At about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell,

00:01:39.803 --> 00:01:42.354
director here of the Metropolitan Museum,

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:45.678
about what my next move might be.

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:48.449
The move, in fact, back to an earlier life,

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:50.407
one I'd begun at the British Museum,

00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:52.926
back to the world of three dimensions --

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:55.158
of sculpture and of decorative arts --

00:01:55.158 --> 00:01:59.376
to take over the department of European sculpture 
and decorative arts, here at the Met.

00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:00.816
But it was an incredibly busy time.

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:04.223
All the conversations were done 
at very peculiar times of the day --

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:07.136
over the phone.

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:09.200
In the end, I accepted the job

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.573
without actually having been here.

00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:13.125
Again, I'd been there a couple of years before,

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:15.637
but on that particular visit.

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:19.729
So, it was just before the time that 
the Leonardo show was due to open

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.751
when I finally made it back to the Met, to New York,

00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:25.207
to see my new domain.

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:29.150
To see what European sculpture 
and decorative arts looked like,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.941
beyond those Renaissance collections 
with which I was so already familiar.

00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:36.938
And I thought, on that very first day, 
I better tour the galleries.

00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:38.390
Fifty-seven of these galleries --

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.246
like 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:49.367
I walked through and I started in my comfort zone
in the Italian Renaissance.

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:51.288
And then I moved gradually around,

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:54.390
feeling a little lost sometimes.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.443
My head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:01.465
that was about to open, and I came across this.

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:09.395
And I thought to myself: What the hell have I done?

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:12.748
There was absolutely no connection in my mind

00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:15.847
at all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on,

00:03:15.847 --> 00:03:18.216
it was a kind of repulsion.

00:03:18.216 --> 00:03:21.454
This object felt utterly and completely alien.

00:03:21.454 --> 00:03:26.917
Silly at a level that I hadn't yet 
understood silliness to be.

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:29.116
And then it was made worse --

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:30.961
there were two of them.

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:34.100
(Laughter)

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.067
So, I started thinking about why it was, in fact,

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.523
that I disliked this object so much.

00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:43.329
What was the anatomy of my distaste?

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.797
Well, so much gold, so vulgar.

00:03:46.797 --> 00:03:50.651
You know, so nouveau riche, frankly.

00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:53.564
Leonardo himself had preached 
against the use of gold,

00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:56.999
so it was absolutely anathema at that moment.

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:02.427
And then there's little pretty sprigs 
of flowers everywhere. (Laughter)

00:04:02.427 --> 00:04:05.946
And finally, that pink. That damned pink.

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:08.842
It's such an extraordinarily artificial color.

00:04:08.842 --> 00:04:12.370
I mean, it's a color that I can't think of 
anything that you actually see in nature,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.458
that looks that shade.

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:19.198
The object even has its own tutu. (Laughter)

00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:21.558
This little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit

00:04:21.558 --> 00:04:23.593
that sits at the bottom of the vase.

00:04:23.593 --> 00:04:25.966
It reminded me, in an odd kind of way,

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:28.065
of my niece's fifth birthday party.

00:04:28.065 --> 00:04:32.587
Where all the little girls would come 
either as a princess or a fairy.

00:04:32.587 --> 00:04:34.468
There was one who would come as a fairy princess.

00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:36.890
You should have seen the looks.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.583
(Laughter)

00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:41.925
And I realize that this object was in my mind,

00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:44.865
born from the same mind, from the same womb,

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:50.089
practically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter)

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.611
And then there's the elephants. (Laughter)

00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:55.757
Those extraordinary elephants

00:04:55.757 --> 00:04:58.481
with their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions

00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:03.778
and Greta Garbo eyelashes, with 
these golden tusks and so on.

00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:05.554
I realized this was an elephant that had

00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:11.287
absolutely nothing to do with a majestic 
march across the Serengeti.

00:05:11.287 --> 00:05:16.782
It was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter)

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:19.628
But something more profound 
was happening as well.

00:05:19.628 --> 00:05:21.057
These objects, it seemed to me,

00:05:21.057 --> 00:05:25.366
were quintessentially the kind that I 
and my liberal left friends in London

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.901
had always seen as summing up

00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:30.740
something deplorable about the French aristocracy

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.912
in the 18th century.

00:05:32.912 --> 00:05:35.701
The label had told me that these pieces were made

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:38.412
by the Sèvres Manufactory,

00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:41.637
made of porcelain in the late 1750s,

00:05:41.637 --> 00:05:44.768
and designed by a designer called 
Jean-Claude Duplessis,

00:05:44.768 --> 00:05:46.964
actually somebody of extraordinary distinction

00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:49.441
as I later learned.

00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:54.249
But for me, they summed up a kind of,

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.663
that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy

00:05:57.663 --> 00:06:01.136
in the 18th century.

00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:03.602
I and my colleagues had always thought

00:06:03.602 --> 00:06:06.558
that these objects, in way, summed up the idea of,

00:06:06.558 --> 00:06:08.922
you know -- no wonder there was a revolution.

00:06:08.922 --> 00:06:13.465
Or, indeed, thank God there was a revolution.

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:15.224
There was a sort of idea really, that,

00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:17.897
if you owned a vase like this,

00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:21.621
then there was really only one fate possible.

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:25.685
(Laughter)

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:30.349
So, there I was -- in a sort of paroxysm of horror.

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:34.309
But I took the job and I went 
on looking at these vases.

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:37.840
I sort of had to because they're 
on a through route in the Met.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.472
So, almost anywhere I went, there they were.

00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:43.241
They had this kind of odd sort of fascination,

00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:46.259
like a car accident.

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.983
Where I couldn't stop looking.

00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:51.205
And as I did so, I started thinking:

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:55.733
Well, what are we actually looking at here?

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:59.064
And what I started with was understanding this

00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:02.616
as really a supreme piece of design.

00:07:02.616 --> 00:07:03.713
It took me a little time.

00:07:03.713 --> 00:07:05.151
But, that tutu for example --

00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.273
actually, this is a piece that 
does dance in its own way.

00:07:08.273 --> 00:07:09.915
It has an extraordinary lightness

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:12.430
and yet, it is also amazing balanced.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.905
It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients.

00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:17.544
And then the play between --

00:07:17.544 --> 00:07:22.156
actually really quite carefully disposed 
color and gilding, and the sculptural surface,

00:07:22.156 --> 00:07:24.431
is really rather remarkable.

00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:27.261
And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:30.651
four times, at least four times 
in order to arrive at this.

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:33.705
How many moments for accident can you think of

00:07:33.705 --> 00:07:35.209
that could have happened to this piece?

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:37.771
And then remember, not just one, but two.

00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:42.036
So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched

00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:44.548
vases of this kind.

00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:45.954
And then this question of uselessness.

00:07:45.954 --> 00:07:50.913
Well actually, the end of the trunks 
were originally candle holders.

00:07:50.913 --> 00:07:54.663
So what you would have had 
were candles on either side.

00:07:54.663 --> 00:07:57.219
Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface.

00:07:57.219 --> 00:07:59.951
On the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold.

00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:02.697
It would have glittered in an interior,

00:08:02.697 --> 00:08:05.779
a little like a little firework.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.431
And at that point, actually, 
a firework went off in my brain.

00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:12.266
Somebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' --

00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:15.376
which in a sense for me, encapsulated this object --

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:19.422
actually comes from the same 
root as the word 'fantasy.'

00:08:19.422 --> 00:08:22.038
And that what this object was just as much in a way,

00:08:22.038 --> 00:08:24.490
in its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.697
is a portal to somewhere else.

00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:30.892
This is an object of the imagination.

00:08:30.892 --> 00:08:37.701
If you think about the mad 18th-century 
operas of the time -- set in the Orient.

00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:44.200
If you think about divans and perhaps even 
opium-induced visions of pink elephants,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.501
then at that point, this object starts to make sense.

00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:51.557
This is an object which is all about escapism.

00:08:51.557 --> 00:08:54.754
It's about an escapism that happens --

00:08:54.754 --> 00:08:56.775
that the aristocracy in France sought

00:08:56.775 --> 00:08:58.561
very deliberately

00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:03.129
to distinguish themselves from ordinary people.

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:05.093
It's not an escapism that

00:09:05.093 --> 00:09:08.960
we feel particularly happy with today, however.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.945
And again, going on thinking about this,

00:09:11.945 --> 00:09:15.119
I realize that in a way we're all victims

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:17.130
of a certain kind of tyranny

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.151
of the triumph of modernism

00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:21.877
whereby form and function in an object

00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:25.282
have to follow one another, or are deemed to do so.

00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:28.246
And the extraneous ornament is seen as really,

00:09:28.246 --> 00:09:31.266
essentially, criminal.

00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:34.417
It's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeois
values rather than aristocratic ones.

00:09:34.417 --> 00:09:36.240
And that seems fine.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:43.697
Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of 
sequestration of imagination.

00:09:43.697 --> 00:09:46.387
So just as in the 20th century, so many people

00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:48.375
had the idea that their faith

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:51.057
took place on the Sabbath day,

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.431
and the rest of their lives --

00:09:52.431 --> 00:09:56.409
their lives of washing machines and orthodontics --

00:09:56.409 --> 00:09:58.441
took place on another day.

00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:02.209
Then, I think we've started doing the same.

00:10:02.209 --> 00:10:05.541
We've allowed ourselves to

00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:07.898
lead our fantasy lives in front of screens.

00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:11.880
In the dark of the cinema, with the
television in the corner of the room.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.958
We've eliminated, in a sense, that constant

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:20.886
of the imagination that these vases 
represented in people's lives.

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:24.922
So maybe it's time we got this back a little.

00:10:24.922 --> 00:10:27.272
I think it's beginning to happen.

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:28.538
In London, for example,

00:10:28.538 --> 00:10:30.687
with these extraordinary buildings

00:10:30.687 --> 00:10:33.678
that have been appearing over the last few years.

00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:36.081
Redolent, in a sense, of science fiction,

00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:38.195
turning London into a kind of fantasy playground.

00:10:38.195 --> 00:10:43.049
It's actually amazing to look out of 
a high building nowadays there.

00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:44.853
But even then, there's a resistance.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:49.189
London has called these buildings the 
Gherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie --

00:10:49.189 --> 00:10:52.494
bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth.

00:10:52.494 --> 00:10:56.574
There's an idea that we don't want these

00:10:56.574 --> 00:11:01.435
anxious-making, imaginative journeys 
to happen in our daily lives.

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:04.703
I feel lucky in a way,

00:11:04.703 --> 00:11:07.251
I've encountered this object.

00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:09.692
(Laughter)

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:12.994
I found him on the Internet when 
I was looking up a reference.

00:11:12.994 --> 00:11:15.888
And there he was.

00:11:15.888 --> 00:11:19.202
And unlike the pink elephant vase,

00:11:19.202 --> 00:11:21.175
this was a kind of love at first sight.

00:11:21.175 --> 00:11:24.031
In fact, reader, I married him. I bought him.

00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:27.895
And he now adorns my office.

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:31.436
He's a Staffordshire figure made 
in the middle of the 19th century.

00:11:31.436 --> 00:11:36.242
He represents the actor, Edmund Kean, 
playing Shakespeare's Richard III.

00:11:36.242 --> 00:11:38.695
And it's based, actually, on a more 
elevated piece of porcelain.

00:11:38.695 --> 00:11:40.849
So I loved, on an art historical level,

00:11:40.849 --> 00:11:45.509
I loved that layered quality that he has.

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:48.002
But more than that, I love him.

00:11:48.002 --> 00:11:49.680
In a way that I think would have been impossible

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.292
without the pink Sèvres vase in my Leonardo days.

00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:55.509
I love his orange and pink breeches.

00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:58.259
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war,

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:02.691
having just finished the washing up. (Laughter)

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:05.168
He seems also to have forgotten his sword.

00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:07.787
I love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy.

00:12:07.787 --> 00:12:10.978
In a way, he's become my sort of alter ego.

00:12:10.978 --> 00:12:13.279
He's, I hope, a little bit dignified,

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:18.453
but mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter)

00:12:18.453 --> 00:12:21.671
And energetic, I hope, too.

00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:26.826
I let him into my life because the Sèvres
pink elephant vase allowed me to do so.

00:12:26.826 --> 00:12:28.394
And before that Leonardo,

00:12:28.394 --> 00:12:33.500
I understood that this object could become 
part of a journey for me every day,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.245
sitting in my office.

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:39.234
I really hope that others, all of you,

00:12:39.234 --> 00:12:40.809
visiting objects in the museum,

00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:43.263
and taking them home and 
finding them for yourselves,

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:47.577
will allow those objects to flourish 
in your imaginative lives.

00:12:47.577 --> 00:12:49.130
Thank you very much.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.013
(Applause)
