WEBVTT

00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:05.207
My job is to design, build and study
robots that communicate with people.

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:08.850
But this story doesn't start with robotics
at all, it starts with animation.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:11.243
When I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,"

00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:13.973
I was amazed by how much
emotion they could put

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.825
into something as trivial as a desk lamp.

00:00:17.477 --> 00:00:19.822
I mean, look at them --
at the end of this movie,

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:22.625
you actually feel something
for two pieces of furniture.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:23.930
(Laughter)

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:25.982
And I said, I have
to learn how to do this.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.233
So I made a really bad career decision.

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:29.451
(Laughter)

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:31.668
And that's what my mom
was like when I did it.

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:33.833
(Laughter)

00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:37.278
I left a very cozy tech job in Israel
at a nice software company

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:39.594
and I moved to New York
to study animation.

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:40.769
And there I lived

00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:43.611
in a collapsing apartment building
in Harlem with roommates.

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:45.659
I'm not using this phrase
metaphorically --

00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:48.412
the ceiling actually collapsed
one day in our living room.

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:51.678
Whenever they did news stories
about building violations in New York,

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:54.118
they would put the report
in front of our building,

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:56.879
as kind of, like, a backdrop
to show how bad things are.

00:00:56.903 --> 00:00:58.840
Anyway, during the day, I went to school

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:02.291
and at night I would sit and draw
frame by frame of pencil animation.

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:04.500
And I learned two surprising lessons.

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:09.014
One of them was that
when you want to arouse emotions,

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:11.213
it doesn't matter so much
how something looks;

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.435
it's all in the motion, in the timing
of how the thing moves.

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:18.006
And the second was something
one of our teachers told us.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.323
He actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."

00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:24.519
And he said, "As an animator,
you're not a director -- you're an actor."

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:27.918
So, if you want to find
the right motion for a character,

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:30.387
don't think about it --
go use your body to find it.

00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:33.344
Stand in front of a mirror,
act it out in front of a camera --

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:36.306
whatever you need -- and then
put it back in your character.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.908
A year later I found myself at MIT
in the Robotic Life Group.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.790
It was one of the first groups
researching the relationships

00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:44.128
between humans and robots.

00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:48.108
And I still had this dream
to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.

00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:51.124
But I found that robots didn't move
at all in this engaging way

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:53.323
that I was used to
from my animation studies.

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:55.811
Instead, they were all --
how should I put it --

00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:57.289
they were all kind of robotic.

00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:59.187
(Laughter)

00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:02.947
And I thought, what if I took
whatever I learned in animation school,

00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:05.574
and used that to design
my robotic desk lamp.

00:02:05.598 --> 00:02:07.643
So I went and designed frame by frame

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:11.627
to try to make this robot as graceful
and engaging as possible.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.908
And here when you see the robot
interacting with me on a desktop --

00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:17.968
and I'm actually redesigning the robot,

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:19.796
so, unbeknownst to itself,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.395
it's kind of digging its own
grave by helping me.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.425
(Laughter)

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.688
I wanted it to be less of a mechanical
structure giving me light,

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.730
and more of a helpful,
kind of quiet apprentice

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.923
that's always there when you need it
and doesn't really interfere.

00:02:33.947 --> 00:02:37.282
And when, for example, I'm looking
for a battery that I can't find,

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:40.253
in a subtle way, it'll show me
where the battery is.

00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:43.705
So you can see my confusion here.

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:45.654
I'm not an actor.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.618
And I want you to notice
how the same mechanical structure

00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:53.729
can, at one point,
just by the way it moves,

00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:55.897
seem gentle and caring
and in the other case,

00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:58.292
seem violent and confrontational.

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:01.163
And it's the same structure,
just the motion is different.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.991
Actor: "You want to know something?
Well, you want to know something?

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:13.904
He was already dead!

00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:17.830
Just laying there, eyes glazed over!"

00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:18.875
(Laughter)

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:21.955
But, moving in a graceful way
is just one building block

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.574
of this whole structure
called human-robot interaction.

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:28.051
I was, at the time, doing my PhD,
I was working on human-robot teamwork,

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.137
teams of humans and robots
working together.

00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.796
I was studying the engineering,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.352
the psychology,
the philosophy of teamwork,

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:35.527
and at the same time,

00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:38.045
I found myself in my own kind
of teamwork situation,

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.321
with a good friend of mine,
who's actually here.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.749
And in that situation,
we can easily imagine robots

00:03:42.773 --> 00:03:44.673
in the near future being there with us.

00:03:44.697 --> 00:03:46.387
It was after a Passover Seder.

00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:48.466
We were folding up
a lot of folding chairs,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.148
and I was amazed at how quickly
we found our own rhythm.

00:03:51.172 --> 00:03:54.282
Everybody did their own part,
we didn't have to divide our tasks.

00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:56.752
We didn't have to communicate
verbally about this --

00:03:56.776 --> 00:03:57.965
it all just happened.

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.869
And I thought, humans and robots
don't look at all like this.

00:04:00.893 --> 00:04:04.024
When humans and robots interact,
it's much more like a chess game:

00:04:04.048 --> 00:04:07.169
the human does a thing, the robot
analyzes whatever the human did,

00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:09.836
the robot decides what to do next,
plans it and does it.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.215
Then the human waits,
until it's their turn again.

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.970
So it's much more like a chess game,
and that makes sense,

00:04:14.994 --> 00:04:18.105
because chess is great for mathematicians
and computer scientists.

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.557
It's all about information, analysis,
decision-making and planning.

00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:25.311
But I wanted my robot
to be less of a chess player,

00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:27.128
and more like a doer

00:04:27.152 --> 00:04:29.153
that just clicks and works together.

00:04:29.177 --> 00:04:32.546
So I made my second
horrible career choice:

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.123
I decided to study acting for a semester.

00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:38.066
I took off from the PhD,
I went to acting classes.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.128
I actually participated in a play --

00:04:40.152 --> 00:04:42.454
I hope there’s no video
of that around still.

00:04:42.478 --> 00:04:43.516
(Laughter)

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.834
And I got every book
I could find about acting,

00:04:45.858 --> 00:04:48.987
including one from the 19th century
that I got from the library.

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:52.624
And I was really amazed, because my name
was the second name on the list --

00:04:52.648 --> 00:04:54.648
the previous name was in 1889.

00:04:54.672 --> 00:04:55.687
(Laughter)

00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:57.960
And this book was
kind of waiting for 100 years

00:04:57.984 --> 00:05:00.316
to be rediscovered for robotics.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.916
And this book shows actors

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.178
how to move every muscle in the body

00:05:04.202 --> 00:05:06.918
to match every kind of emotion
that they want to express.

00:05:06.942 --> 00:05:09.968
But the real revelation was
when I learned about method acting.

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:12.245
It became very popular
in the 20th century.

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:13.420
And method acting said

00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:15.744
you don't have to plan
every muscle in your body;

00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:18.713
instead, you have to use your body
to find the right movement.

00:05:18.737 --> 00:05:21.617
You have to use your sense memory
to reconstruct the emotions

00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.679
and kind of think with your body
to find the right expression --

00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:26.578
improvise, play off your scene partner.

00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:28.047
And this came at the same time

00:05:28.071 --> 00:05:31.177
as I was reading about this trend
in cognitive psychology,

00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:34.453
called embodied cognition,
which also talks about the same ideas.

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:35.992
We use our bodies to think;

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:38.973
we don't just think with our brains
and use our bodies to move,

00:05:38.997 --> 00:05:40.915
but our bodies feed back into our brain

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.104
to generate the way that we behave.

00:05:43.128 --> 00:05:44.724
And it was like a lightning bolt.

00:05:44.748 --> 00:05:45.962
I went back to my office,

00:05:45.986 --> 00:05:48.391
I wrote this paper,
which I never really published,

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:50.947
called "Acting Lessons
for Artificial Intelligence."

00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:52.352
And I even took another month

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:54.820
to do what was then the first theater play

00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:56.797
with a human and a robot acting together.

00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.214
That's what you saw
before with the actors.

00:06:00.564 --> 00:06:01.715
And I thought:

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:04.676
How can we make an artificial
intelligence model --

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.683
a computer, computational model --

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:09.214
that will model some of these
ideas of improvisation,

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:11.068
of taking risks, of taking chances,

00:06:11.092 --> 00:06:12.619
even of making mistakes?

00:06:12.643 --> 00:06:15.256
Maybe it can make for better
robotic teammates.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.884
So I worked for quite
a long time on these models

00:06:17.908 --> 00:06:20.303
and I implemented them
on a number of robots.

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:22.628
Here you can see a very early example

00:06:22.652 --> 00:06:26.231
with the robots trying to use
this embodied artificial intelligence

00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:28.718
to try to match my movements
as closely as possible.

00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:30.205
It's sort of like a game.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.739
Let's look at it.

00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:39.191
You can see when I psych
it out, it gets fooled.

00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:42.293
And it's a little bit
like what you might see actors do

00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:43.951
when they try to mirror each other

00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:46.340
to find the right synchrony between them.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.196
And then, I did another experiment,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.279
and I got people off the street
to use the robotic desk lamp,

00:06:52.303 --> 00:06:55.405
and try out this idea
of embodied artificial intelligence.

00:06:55.921 --> 00:07:00.519
So, I actually used two kinds
of brains for the same robot.

00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:02.495
The robot is the same lamp that you saw,

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:03.858
and I put two brains in it.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.609
For one half of the people,

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.569
I put in a brain
that's kind of the traditional,

00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:09.822
calculated robotic brain.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.486
It waits for its turn,
it analyzes everything, it plans.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.192
Let's call it the calculated brain.

00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:17.463
The other got more the stage
actor, risk-taker brain.

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:19.609
Let's call it the adventurous brain.

00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:22.570
It sometimes acts without knowing
everything it has to know.

00:07:22.594 --> 00:07:24.886
It sometimes makes mistakes
and corrects them.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.828
And I had them do this very tedious task
that took almost 20 minutes,

00:07:28.852 --> 00:07:30.328
and they had to work together,

00:07:30.352 --> 00:07:32.905
somehow simulating, like, a factory job

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:35.016
of repetitively doing the same thing.

00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:38.776
What I found is that people
actually loved the adventurous robot.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.577
They thought it was more intelligent,

00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:42.707
more committed,
a better member of the team,

00:07:42.731 --> 00:07:44.796
contributed to the success
of the team more.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.528
They even called it "he" and "she,"

00:07:46.552 --> 00:07:48.673
whereas people with the calculated brain

00:07:48.697 --> 00:07:51.499
called it "it," and nobody
ever called it "he" or "she."

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:55.169
When they talked about it after the task,
with the adventurous brain,

00:07:55.193 --> 00:07:58.976
they said, "By the end, we were good
friends and high-fived mentally."

00:07:59.397 --> 00:08:00.690
Whatever that means.

00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:02.620
(Laughter)

00:08:02.644 --> 00:08:03.997
Sounds painful.

00:08:04.021 --> 00:08:06.759
Whereas the people
with the calculated brain

00:08:06.783 --> 00:08:09.141
said it was just like a lazy apprentice.

00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:11.910
It only did what it was supposed
to do and nothing more,

00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:14.283
which is almost what people
expect robots to do,

00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:17.862
so I was surprised that people
had higher expectations of robots

00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:21.392
than what anybody in robotics
thought robots should be doing.

00:08:22.027 --> 00:08:24.042
And in a way, I thought,
maybe it's time --

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:27.028
just like method acting
changed the way people thought

00:08:27.052 --> 00:08:28.648
about acting in the 19th century,

00:08:28.672 --> 00:08:31.749
from going from the very calculated,
planned way of behaving,

00:08:31.773 --> 00:08:35.271
to a more intuitive, risk-taking,
embodied way of behaving --

00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:38.491
maybe it's time for robots
to have the same kind of revolution.

00:08:39.994 --> 00:08:43.593
A few years later, I was at my next
research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,

00:08:43.617 --> 00:08:46.441
and I was working in a group
dealing with robotic musicians.

00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:48.825
And I thought, music:
that's the perfect place

00:08:48.849 --> 00:08:52.992
to look at teamwork, coordination,
timing, improvisation --

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:55.459
and we just got this robot
playing marimba.

00:08:55.483 --> 00:08:57.739
And the marimba, for everybody like me,

00:08:57.763 --> 00:09:00.502
it was this huge, wooden xylophone.

00:09:00.526 --> 00:09:02.589
And when I was looking at this,

00:09:02.613 --> 00:09:05.611
I looked at other works
in human-robot improvisation --

00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:08.382
yes, there are other works
in human-robot improvisation --

00:09:08.406 --> 00:09:10.755
and they were also a little bit
like a chess game.

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:11.930
The human would play,

00:09:11.954 --> 00:09:14.127
the robot analyzed what was played,

00:09:14.151 --> 00:09:16.230
and would improvise their own part.

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:19.392
So, this is what musicians called
a call-and-response interaction,

00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:23.163
and it also fits very well
robots and artificial intelligence.

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:26.440
But I thought, if I use the same ideas
I used in the theater play

00:09:26.464 --> 00:09:28.208
and in the teamwork studies,

00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:31.882
maybe I can make the robots
jam together like a band.

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:36.174
Everybody's riffing off each other,
nobody is stopping for a moment.

00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:39.072
And so I tried to do the same
things, this time with music,

00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:41.930
where the robot doesn't really know
what it's about to play,

00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:44.971
it just sort of moves its body
and uses opportunities to play,

00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:47.534
and does what my jazz teacher
when I was 17 taught me.

00:09:47.558 --> 00:09:48.955
She said, when you improvise,

00:09:48.979 --> 00:09:51.995
sometimes you don't know
what you're doing, and you still do it.

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:55.345
So I tried to make a robot that doesn't
actually know what it's doing,

00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:56.590
but is still doing it.

00:09:56.614 --> 00:09:59.125
So let's look at a few seconds
from this performance,

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:01.276
where the robot listens
to the human musician

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.465
and improvises.

00:10:02.489 --> 00:10:05.464
And then, look how the human
musician also responds

00:10:05.488 --> 00:10:06.761
to what the robot is doing

00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:09.429
and picking up from its behavior,

00:10:09.453 --> 00:10:13.409
and at some point can even be surprised
by what the robot came up with.

00:10:13.433 --> 00:10:15.627
(Music)

00:10:55.618 --> 00:10:57.618
(Music ends)

00:10:59.134 --> 00:11:04.868
(Applause)

00:11:04.892 --> 00:11:07.142
Being a musician
is not just about making notes,

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.514
otherwise nobody
would ever go see a live show.

00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:11.660
Musicians also communicate
with their bodies,

00:11:11.684 --> 00:11:13.701
with other band members,
with the audience,

00:11:13.725 --> 00:11:15.739
they use their bodies
to express the music.

00:11:15.763 --> 00:11:18.460
And I thought, we already have
a robot musician on stage,

00:11:18.484 --> 00:11:20.796
why not make it be
a full-fledged musician?

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.494
And I started designing
a socially expressive head

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:24.861
for the robot.

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.955
The head doesn’t actually
touch the marimba,

00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:28.938
it just expresses what the music is like.

00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:31.458
These are some napkin sketches
from a bar in Atlanta

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:34.025
that was dangerously
located exactly halfway

00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:35.860
between my lab and my home.

00:11:35.884 --> 00:11:39.822
So I spent, I would say, on average,
three to four hours a day there.

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:41.033
I think.

00:11:41.057 --> 00:11:42.584
(Laughter)

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:45.799
And I went back to my animation
tools and tried to figure out

00:11:45.823 --> 00:11:48.193
not just what a robotic
musician would look like,

00:11:48.217 --> 00:11:50.842
but especially what a robotic
musician would move like,

00:11:50.866 --> 00:11:54.268
to sort of show that it doesn't like
what the other person is playing --

00:11:54.292 --> 00:11:58.117
and maybe show whatever beat
it's feeling at the moment.

00:11:58.141 --> 00:12:02.644
So we ended up actually getting the money
to build this robot, which was nice.

00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:05.272
I'm going to show you now
the same kind of performance,

00:12:05.296 --> 00:12:07.336
this time with a socially expressive head.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.160
And notice one thing --

00:12:09.184 --> 00:12:10.855
how the robot is really showing us

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:12.785
the beat it's picking up from the human,

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:16.736
while also giving the human a sense
that the robot knows what it's doing.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.680
And also how it changes the way it moves

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.656
as soon as it starts its own solo.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.576
(Music)

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.620
Now it's looking at me,
showing that it's listening.

00:12:27.644 --> 00:12:30.367
(Music)

00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:52.102
Now look at the final chord
of the piece again.

00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:55.043
And this time the robot
communicates with its body

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:57.180
when it's busy doing its own thing,

00:12:57.204 --> 00:13:02.055
and when it's ready to coordinate
the final chord with me.

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:04.816
(Music)

00:13:09.783 --> 00:13:11.783
(Music ending)

00:13:14.103 --> 00:13:15.104
(Final chord)

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:20.882
(Applause)

00:13:20.906 --> 00:13:22.061
Thanks.

00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:23.666
I hope you see

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:28.086
how much this part of the body
that doesn't touch the instrument

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.702
actually helps
with the musical performance.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.169
And at some point -- we are in Atlanta,

00:13:33.193 --> 00:13:36.443
so obviously some rapper
will come into our lab at some point --

00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:41.260
and we had this rapper come in and do
a little jam with the robot.

00:13:41.284 --> 00:13:45.332
Here you can see the robot
basically responding to the beat.

00:13:45.356 --> 00:13:46.507
Notice two things:

00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:50.140
one, how irresistible it is to join
the robot while it's moving its head.

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:52.767
You kind of want to move
your own head when it does it.

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:56.377
And second, even though the rapper
is really focused on his iPhone,

00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:59.511
as soon as the robot turns
to him, he turns back.

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:02.171
So even though it's just
in the periphery of his vision,

00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:04.315
in the corner of his eye,
it's very powerful.

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:06.173
And the reason is that we can't ignore

00:14:06.197 --> 00:14:08.221
physical things moving in our environment.

00:14:08.245 --> 00:14:09.415
We are wired for that.

00:14:09.439 --> 00:14:11.083
So if you have a problem --

00:14:11.107 --> 00:14:15.782
maybe your partner is looking
at their iPhone or smartphone too much --

00:14:15.806 --> 00:14:18.640
you might want to have a robot
there to get their attention.

00:14:18.664 --> 00:14:19.665
(Laughter)

00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:21.758
(Music)

00:14:34.113 --> 00:14:36.113
(Music ends)

00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:45.086
(Applause)

00:14:45.633 --> 00:14:49.467
Just to introduce the last robot
that we've worked on,

00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:51.841
it came out of something
surprising that we found:

00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:55.023
Some point people didn't care
about the robot being intelligent,

00:14:55.047 --> 00:14:56.449
able to improvise and listen,

00:14:56.473 --> 00:15:00.879
and do all these embodied intelligence
things that I spent years developing.

00:15:00.903 --> 00:15:03.584
They really liked that the robot
was enjoying the music.

00:15:03.608 --> 00:15:04.609
(Laughter)

00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:07.178
And they didn't say the robot
was moving to the music,

00:15:07.202 --> 00:15:08.690
they said "enjoying" the music.

00:15:08.714 --> 00:15:10.840
And we thought,
why don't we take this idea,

00:15:10.864 --> 00:15:13.605
and I designed a new piece of furniture.

00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:16.201
This time it wasn't a desk lamp,
it was a speaker dock,

00:15:16.225 --> 00:15:18.865
one of those things
you plug your smartphone in.

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:20.039
And I thought,

00:15:20.063 --> 00:15:23.563
what would happen if your speaker dock
didn't just play the music for you,

00:15:23.587 --> 00:15:25.633
but would actually enjoy it, too?

00:15:25.657 --> 00:15:29.818
And so again, here are some
animation tests from an early stage.

00:15:29.842 --> 00:15:31.226
(Laughter)

00:15:31.835 --> 00:15:34.706
And this is what the final
product looked like.

00:15:46.247 --> 00:15:48.428
(Music)

00:16:06.848 --> 00:16:08.848
(Music ends)

00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:12.081
So, a lot of bobbing heads.

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:15.716
(Applause)

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.630
A lot of bobbing heads in the audience,

00:16:17.654 --> 00:16:20.362
so we can still see
robots influence people.

00:16:20.386 --> 00:16:23.171
And it's not just fun and games.

00:16:23.195 --> 00:16:25.396
I think one of the reasons I care so much

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.653
about robots that use
their body to communicate

00:16:27.677 --> 00:16:29.383
and use their body to move is --

00:16:29.407 --> 00:16:32.797
I'm going to let you in on a little
secret we roboticists are hiding --

00:16:32.821 --> 00:16:35.614
is that every one of you
is going to be living with a robot

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:37.230
at some point in your life.

00:16:37.254 --> 00:16:40.187
Somewhere in your future,
there will be a robot in your life.

00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:42.079
If not in yours, your children's lives.

00:16:42.103 --> 00:16:47.093
And I want these robots to be more fluent,
more engaging, more graceful

00:16:47.117 --> 00:16:48.846
than currently they seem to be.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.157
And for that I think maybe robots
need to be less like chess players

00:16:52.181 --> 00:16:54.822
and more like stage actors
and more like musicians.

00:16:54.846 --> 00:16:57.659
Maybe they should be able
to take chances and improvise.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:00.707
Maybe they should be able
to anticipate what you're about to do.

00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:04.079
Maybe they even need to be able
to make mistakes and correct them,

00:17:04.103 --> 00:17:05.991
because in the end, we are human.

00:17:06.015 --> 00:17:09.569
And maybe as humans,
robots that are a little less than perfect

00:17:09.593 --> 00:17:11.324
are just perfect for us.

00:17:11.348 --> 00:17:12.507
Thank you.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:19.367
(Applause)
