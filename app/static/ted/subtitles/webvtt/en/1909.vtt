00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:03.158
So when I was in Morocco,

00:00:03.158 --> 00:00:05.692
in Casablanca, not so long ago,

00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:10.168
I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza.

00:00:10.168 --> 00:00:13.505
Faiza showed me photos of her infant son

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:19.640
and she told me the story of his conception,
pregnancy, and delivery.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.600
It was a remarkable tale,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.280
but Faiza saved the best for last.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.850
"You know, I am a virgin," she told me.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.254
"I have two medical certificates to prove it."

00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:35.878
This is the modern Middle East,

00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:38.510
where two millennia after the coming of Christ,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.738
virgin births are still a fact of life.

00:00:42.738 --> 00:00:48.395
Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard 
over the years, traveling across the Arab region

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.683
talking to people about sex.

00:00:51.683 --> 00:00:54.899
Now, I know this might sound like a dream job,

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.167
or possibly a highly dubious occupation,

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:01.523
but for me, it's something else altogether.

00:01:01.523 --> 00:01:04.111
I'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim.

00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.902
But I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots.

00:01:07.902 --> 00:01:10.536
Like so many who straddle East and West,

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:15.459
I've been drawn, over the years, to try to better
understand my origins.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:19.579
That I chose to look at sex comes from 
my background in HIV/AIDS,

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.666
as a writer and a researcher and an activist.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:28.790
Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic
in the Middle East and North Africa,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.335
which is one of only two regions in the world
where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise.

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:38.376
Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:41.100
with which to study any society,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.609
because what happens in our intimate lives

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.783
is reflected by forces on a bigger stage:

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:53.857
in politics and economics, in religion and tradition, 
in gender and generations.

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:57.144
As I found, if you really want to know a people,

00:01:57.144 --> 00:02:01.668
you start by looking inside their bedrooms.

00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:05.860
Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.521
But running across it are three red lines --

00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:13.735
these are topics you are not supposed 
to challenge in word or deed.

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:16.150
The first of these is politics.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.578
But the Arab Spring has changed all that,

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:23.600
in uprisings which have blossomed 
across the region since 2011.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.461
Now while those in power, old and new,

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.263
continue to cling to business as usual,

00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:31.869
millions are still pushing back,

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:36.984
and pushing forward to what they hope
will be a better life.

00:02:36.984 --> 00:02:40.164
That second red line is religion.

00:02:40.164 --> 00:02:42.995
But now religion and politics are connected,

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:46.139
with the rise of such groups as the 
Muslim Brotherhood.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.599
And some people, at least, are starting 
to ask questions

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.667
about the role of Islam in public and private life.

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:58.418
You know, as for that third red line, 
that off-limits subject,

00:02:58.418 --> 00:03:00.196
what do you think it might be?

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:01.258
Audience: Sex.

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:02.558
Shereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you.

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:03.414
Audience: Sex.

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:05.036
SEF: Again, please don't be shy.

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.088
Audience: Sex.

00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:13.145
SEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter)

00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:19.353
Across the Arab region, the only accepted
context for sex is marriage --

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:23.131
approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:25.671
and registered by the state.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.554
Marriage is your ticket to adulthood.

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:32.379
If you don't tie the knot, you can't 
move out of your parents' place,

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.680
and you're not supposed to be having sex,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.827
and you're definitely not supposed 
to be having children.

00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:41.193
It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress

00:03:41.193 --> 00:03:45.658
which resists any assault, any alternative.

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:49.666
And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:54.639
against premarital sex, against condoms,

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.583
against abortion, against homosexuality,

00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:59.754
you name it.

00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:02.978
Faiza was living proof of this.

00:04:02.978 --> 00:04:07.259
Her virginity statement was 
not a piece of wishful thinking.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:12.582
Although the major religions of the region
extoll premarital chastity,

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:15.886
in a patriarchy, boys will be boys.

00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:17.839
Men have sex before marriage,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.629
and people more or less turn a blind eye.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.845
Not so for women,

00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:26.889
who are expected to be virgins 
on their wedding night --

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.139
that is, to turn up with your hymen intact.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.814
This is not a question of individual concern,

00:04:34.814 --> 00:04:39.956
this is a matter of family honor, 
and in particular, men's honor.

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:41.714
And so women and their relatives

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:46.073
will go to great lengths to preserve 
this tiny piece of anatomy --

00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:48.278
from female genital mutilation,

00:04:48.278 --> 00:04:52.639
to virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.645
Faiza chose a different route:

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:58.028
non-vaginal sex.

00:04:58.028 --> 00:05:00.637
Only she became pregnant all the same.

00:05:00.637 --> 00:05:03.377
But Faiza didn't actually realize this,

00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:07.152
because there's so little 
sexuality education in schools,

00:05:07.152 --> 00:05:11.174
and so little communication in the family.

00:05:11.174 --> 00:05:13.929
When her condition became hard to hide,

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:18.376
Faiza's mother helped her flee 
her father and brothers.

00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:21.397
This is because honor killings are a real threat

00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:25.171
for untold numbers of women in the Arab region.

00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:30.221
And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at 
a hospital in Casablanca,

00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:32.898
the man who offered to help her,

00:05:32.898 --> 00:05:36.262
instead tried to rape her.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.459
Sadly, Faiza is not alone.

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:43.245
In Egypt, where my research is focused,

00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:48.843
I have seen plenty of trouble 
in and out of the citadel.

00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:52.182
There are legions of young men

00:05:52.182 --> 00:05:54.289
who can't afford to get married,

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.713
because marriage has become 
a very expensive proposition.

00:05:57.713 --> 00:06:01.272
They are expected to bear the burden
of costs in married life,

00:06:01.272 --> 00:06:03.576
but they can't find jobs.

00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:06.750
This is one of the major drivers 
of the recent uprisings,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.915
and it is one of the reasons for the 
rising age of marriage

00:06:09.915 --> 00:06:12.946
in much of the Arab region.

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:15.721
There are career women who want to get married,

00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:17.319
but can't find a husband,

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.504
because they defy gender expectations,

00:06:20.504 --> 00:06:24.291
or as one young female doctor 
in Tunisia put it to me,

00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:26.998
"The women, they are becoming more and more open.

00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:32.801
But the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage."

00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:36.691
And then there are men and women who 
cross the heterosexual line,

00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:38.593
who have sex with their own sex,

00:06:38.593 --> 00:06:41.602
or who have a different gender identity.

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:45.555
They are on the receiving end of laws
which punish their activities,

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:47.613
even their appearance.

00:06:47.613 --> 00:06:51.448
And they face a daily struggle with social stigma,

00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:53.083
with family despair,

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:57.251
and with religious fire and brimstone.

00:06:57.251 --> 00:07:01.449
Now, it's not as if it's all rosy 
in the marital bed either.

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.975
Couples who are looking for greater happiness,

00:07:03.975 --> 00:07:06.614
greater sexual happiness in their married lives,

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:08.973
but are at a loss of how to achieve it,

00:07:08.973 --> 00:07:13.495
especially wives, who are afraid 
of being seen as bad women

00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:16.699
if they show some spark in the bedroom.

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.623
And then there are those whose marriages

00:07:18.623 --> 00:07:21.729
are actually a veil for prostitution.

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:23.887
They have been sold by their families,

00:07:23.887 --> 00:07:26.768
often to wealthy Arab tourists.

00:07:26.768 --> 00:07:32.369
This is just one face of a booming 
sex trade across the Arab region.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:36.557
Now raise your hand if any of 
this is sounding familiar to you,

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:40.527
from your part of the world.

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:46.537
Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world
has a monopoly on sexual hangups.

00:07:46.537 --> 00:07:49.507
And although we don't yet have
an Arab Kinsey Report

00:07:49.507 --> 00:07:53.920
to tell us exactly what's happening 
inside bedrooms across the Arab region,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.863
It's pretty clear that 
something is not right.

00:07:57.863 --> 00:08:00.551
Double standards for men and women,

00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:03.810
sex as a source of shame,

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.961
family control limiting individual choices,

00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:11.708
and a vast gulf between appearance and reality:

00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.278
what people are doing

00:08:13.294 --> 00:08:15.639
and what they're willing to admit to,

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:19.615
and a general reluctance to move 
beyond private whispers

00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:23.703
to a serious and sustained public discussion.

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:27.192
As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me,

00:08:27.192 --> 00:08:30.517
"Here, sex is the opposite of sport.

00:08:30.517 --> 00:08:32.683
Football, everybody talks about it,

00:08:32.683 --> 00:08:34.653
but hardly anyone plays.

00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:36.626
But sex, everybody is doing it,

00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:40.775
but nobody wants to talk about it."
(Laughter)

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:51.348
(Music) (In Arabic)

00:08:51.348 --> 00:08:54.007
SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice,

00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:58.101
which if you follow it,
will make you happy in life.

00:08:58.101 --> 00:09:00.476
When your husband reaches out to you,

00:09:00.476 --> 00:09:03.288
when he seizes a part of your body,

00:09:03.288 --> 00:09:06.654
sigh deeply and look at him lustily.

00:09:06.654 --> 00:09:09.177
When he penetrates you with his penis,

00:09:09.177 --> 00:09:14.470
try to talk flirtatiously and 
move yourself in harmony with him.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.913
Hot stuff!

00:09:15.928 --> 00:09:17.922
And it might sound that these handy hints

00:09:17.922 --> 00:09:21.033
come from "The Joy of Sex" or YouPorn.

00:09:21.033 --> 00:09:24.885
But in fact, they come from
a 10th-century Arabic book

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:27.217
called "The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,"

00:09:27.217 --> 00:09:31.365
which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia,

00:09:31.365 --> 00:09:34.438
and everything in between.

00:09:34.438 --> 00:09:38.496
The Encyclopedia is just one 
in a long line of Arabic erotica,

00:09:38.496 --> 00:09:41.725
much of it written by religious scholars.

00:09:41.725 --> 00:09:44.086
Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad,

00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:46.503
there is a rich tradition in Islam

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.083
of talking frankly about sex:

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:52.378
not just its problems, but also its pleasures,

00:09:52.378 --> 00:09:56.953
and not just for men, but also for women.

00:09:56.953 --> 00:10:02.820
A thousand years ago, we used to have 
whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.973
Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature,

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:10.565
position and preference, a body of language

00:10:10.565 --> 00:10:17.096
that was rich enough to make up the body 
of the woman you see on this page.

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:20.699
Today, this history is largely unknown 
in the Arab region.

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:25.503
Even by educated people, who often
feel more comfortable talking about sex

00:10:25.503 --> 00:10:30.481
in a foreign language than they do
in their own tongue.

00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.204
Today's sexual landscape looks
a lot like Europe and America

00:10:34.204 --> 00:10:36.937
on the brink of the sexual revolution.

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:39.985
But while the West has opened on sex,

00:10:39.985 --> 00:10:46.618
what we found is that Arab societies appear
to have been moving in the opposite direction.

00:10:46.618 --> 00:10:48.873
In Egypt and many of its neighbors,

00:10:48.873 --> 00:10:51.750
this closing down is part of a wider closing

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.333
in political, social and cultural thought.

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:59.389
And it is the product of a complex historical process,

00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:03.182
one which has gained ground with the rise 
of Islamic conservatism

00:11:03.182 --> 00:11:06.183
since the late 1970s.

00:11:06.183 --> 00:11:09.858
"Just say no" is what conservatives 
around the world

00:11:09.858 --> 00:11:14.320
say to any challenge to the sexual status quo.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.606
In the Arab region, they brand these attempts
as a Western conspiracy

00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:22.908
to undermine traditional Arab
and Islamic values.

00:11:22.908 --> 00:11:24.907
But what's really at stake here

00:11:24.907 --> 00:11:28.801
is one of their most powerful tools of control:

00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:32.958
sex wrapped up in religion.

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.103
But history shows us that 
even as recently

00:11:36.103 --> 00:11:39.012
as our fathers' and grandfathers' day,

00:11:39.012 --> 00:11:41.961
there have been times of greater pragmatism,

00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:47.481
and tolerance, and a willingness
to consider other interpretations:

00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:54.400
be it abortion, or masturbation, or even 
the incendiary topic of homosexuality.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.266
It is not black and white,
as conservatives would have us believe.

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:02.473
In these, as in so many other matters,

00:12:02.473 --> 00:12:05.894
Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray.

00:12:05.894 --> 00:12:08.308
(Laughter)

00:12:08.308 --> 00:12:09.457
Over my travels,

00:12:09.457 --> 00:12:12.065
I've met men and women 
across the Arab region

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:15.058
who've been exploring that spectrum --

00:12:15.058 --> 00:12:17.762
sexologists who are trying
to help couples

00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:21.684
find greater happiness in their marriages,

00:12:21.684 --> 00:12:27.366
innovators who are managing to get 
sexuality education into schools,

00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:29.733
small groups of men and women,

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:32.449
lesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual,

00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:34.130
who are reaching out to their peers

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.788
with online initiatives and real-world support.

00:12:38.788 --> 00:12:42.751
Women, and increasingly men,
who are starting to speak out

00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:45.837
and push back against sexual violence

00:12:45.837 --> 00:12:49.393
on the streets and in the home.

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:54.126
Groups that are trying to help sex workers
protect themselves against HIV

00:12:54.126 --> 00:12:56.993
and other occupational hazards,

00:12:56.993 --> 00:13:00.921
and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza

00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:06.702
find a place in society, and critically,
stay with their kids.

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:10.113
Now these efforts are small, 
they're often underfunded,

00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:13.416
and they face formidable opposition.

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:16.944
But I am optimistic that, in the long run,

00:13:16.944 --> 00:13:20.321
times are changing, and they and their ideas

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:22.250
will gain ground.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:27.902
Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region
through dramatic confrontation,

00:13:27.902 --> 00:13:31.289
beating or indeed baring of breasts,

00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:33.754
but rather through negotiation.

00:13:33.754 --> 00:13:37.424
What we're talking here is not about a 
sexual revolution,

00:13:37.424 --> 00:13:41.898
but a sexual evolution, 
learning from other parts of the world,

00:13:41.898 --> 00:13:44.274
adapting to local conditions,

00:13:44.274 --> 00:13:50.161
forging our own path,
not following one blazed by another.

00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:56.604
That path, I hope, will one day lead us 
to the right to control our own bodies,

00:13:56.604 --> 00:13:59.674
and to access the information 
and services we need

00:13:59.674 --> 00:14:04.078
to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives.

00:14:04.078 --> 00:14:06.648
The right to express our ideas freely,

00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:11.303
to marry whom we choose, 
to choose our own partners,

00:14:11.303 --> 00:14:16.155
to be sexually active or not,
to decide whether to have children and when,

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:22.534
all this without violence or force or discrimination.

00:14:22.534 --> 00:14:25.938
Now we are very far from this 
across the Arab region,

00:14:25.938 --> 00:14:29.045
and so much needs to change:

00:14:29.045 --> 00:14:32.973
law, education, media, the economy,

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:35.846
the list goes on and on,

00:14:35.846 --> 00:14:40.164
and it is the work of a generation, at least.

00:14:40.164 --> 00:14:43.326
But it begins with a journey that I myself have made,

00:14:43.326 --> 00:14:46.295
asking hard questions of received wisdoms

00:14:46.295 --> 00:14:48.103
in sexual life.

00:14:48.103 --> 00:14:52.616
And it is a journey which has
only served to strengthen my faith,

00:14:52.616 --> 00:14:56.134
and my appreciation of local histories and cultures

00:14:56.134 --> 00:15:01.929
by showing me possibilities 
where I once only saw absolutes.

00:15:01.929 --> 00:15:05.386
Now given the turmoil in many
countries in the Arab region,

00:15:05.386 --> 00:15:08.463
talking about sex, 
challenging the taboos,

00:15:08.463 --> 00:15:13.799
seeking alternatives might sound like
something of a luxury.

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:16.591
But at this critical moment in history,

00:15:16.591 --> 00:15:20.969
if we do not anchor freedom and justice,

00:15:20.969 --> 00:15:22.601
dignity and equality,

00:15:22.601 --> 00:15:27.843
privacy and autonomy in our personal lives,
in our sexual lives,

00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:32.144
we will find it very hard to achieve in public life.

00:15:32.144 --> 00:15:38.899
The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows,
and that is true for us all.

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:42.310
no matter where we live and love.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.826
Thank you.

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:48.267
(Applause)
