WEBVTT

00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:04.386
So, I guess it is a result
of globalization

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.014
that you can find Coca-Cola tins
on top of Everest

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:09.976
and a Buddhist monk in Monterey.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.374
(Laughter)

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.975
And so I just came,
two days ago, from the Himalayas

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.419
to your kind invitation.

00:00:19.443 --> 00:00:23.572
So I would like to invite you, also,
for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:31.190
And to show the place
where meditators, like me,

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:35.186
who began with being a molecular biologist
in Pasteur Institute,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.464
and found their way to the mountains.

00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:44.651
So these are a few images
I was lucky to take and be there.

00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:51.608
There's Mount Kailash
in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.976
This is from Marlboro country.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.369
(Laughter)

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.895
This is a turquoise lake.

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:03.000
A meditator.

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:08.976
This is the hottest day of the year
somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.976
And the night before, we camped,
and my Tibetan friends said,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.581
"We are going to sleep outside."

00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:18.848
And I said, "Why? We have
enough space in the tent."

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:20.696
They said, "Yes, but it's summertime."

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.389
(Laughter)

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:27.976
So now, we are going
to speak of happiness.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.795
As a Frenchman, I must say

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.867
that there are
a lot of French intellectuals

00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:35.952
that think happiness
is not at all interesting.

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:36.976
(Laughter)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.525
I just wrote an essay on happiness,
and there was a controversy.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.800
And someone wrote an article saying,

00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:45.850
"Don't impose on us
the dirty work of happiness."

00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:46.976
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.206
"We don't care about being happy.
We need to live with passion.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.581
We like the ups and downs of life.

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:57.047
We like our suffering because it's so good
when it ceases for a while."

00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:00.642
(Laughter)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.470
This is what I see from the balcony
of my hermitage in the Himalayas.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.379
It's about two meters by three,
and you are all welcome any time.

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:11.611
(Laughter)

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:15.097
Now, let's come
to happiness or well-being.

00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.976
And first of all, you know,
despite what the French intellectuals say,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.430
it seems that no one wakes up
in the morning thinking,

00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:25.976
"May I suffer the whole day?"

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.335
(Laughter)

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.976
Which means that somehow,
consciously or not,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.349
directly or indirectly,
in the short or the long term,

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:40.875
whatever we do, whatever we hope,
whatever we dream --

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:46.705
somehow, is related to a deep, profound
desire for well-being or happiness.

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:51.345
As Pascal said,
even the one who hangs himself,

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:55.623
somehow, is looking
for cessation of suffering.

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:58.008
He finds no other way.

00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:02.485
But then, if you look
in the literature, East and West,

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:07.431
you can find incredible diversity
of definition of happiness.

00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:11.976
Some people say, I only believed
in remembering the past,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.976
imagining the future, never the present.

00:03:14.457 --> 00:03:17.370
Some people say happiness is right now;

00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:20.289
it's the quality of the freshness
of the present moment.

00:03:21.682 --> 00:03:25.519
And that led Henri Bergson,
the French philosopher, to say,

00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:29.398
"All the great thinkers of humanity
have left happiness in the vague

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:33.000
so that each of them
could define their own terms."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Well, that would be fine if it was just
a secondary preoccupation in life.

00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:42.770
But now, if it is something
that is going to determine

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:45.571
the quality of every instant of our life,

00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:49.590
then we better know what it is,
have some clearer idea.

00:03:50.674 --> 00:03:55.976
And probably, the fact
that we don't know that is why, so often,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.265
although we seek happiness,
it seems we turn our back to it.

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.084
Although we want to avoid suffering,

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:03.244
it seems we are running
somewhat towards it.

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.204
And that can also come
from some kind of confusions.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.570
One of the most common ones
is happiness and pleasure.

00:04:11.594 --> 00:04:15.576
But if you look at
the characteristics of those two,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.838
pleasure is contingent upon time,
upon its object,

00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:22.260
upon the place.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It is something that -- changes of nature.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.557
Beautiful chocolate cake:
first serving is delicious,

00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:34.558
second one not so much,
then we feel disgust.

00:04:34.582 --> 00:04:37.357
(Laughter)

00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:38.904
That's the nature of things.

00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:40.128
We get tired.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.280
I used to be a fan of Bach.

00:04:43.304 --> 00:04:45.305
I used to play it on the guitar, you know.

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:47.138
I can hear it two, three, five times.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:51.674
If I had to hear it 24 hours,
non-stop, it might be very tiring.

00:04:52.262 --> 00:04:56.052
If you are feeling very cold,
you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.

00:04:56.443 --> 00:04:58.592
After some moments,
you just go a little back,

00:04:58.616 --> 00:04:59.937
and then it starts burning.

00:05:00.643 --> 00:05:04.156
It sort of uses itself
as you experience it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.976
And also, again, it can --
also, it's something that you --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.191
it is not something
that is radiating outside.

00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:15.481
Like, you can feel intense pleasure

00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:18.455
and some others around you
can be suffering a lot.

00:05:20.154 --> 00:05:22.976
Now, what, then, will be happiness?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.882
And happiness, of course, is such
a vague word, so let's say well-being.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:33.740
And so, I think the best definition,
according to the Buddhist view,

00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:39.318
is that well-being is not just
a mere pleasurable sensation.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.048
It is a deep sense
of serenity and fulfillment.

00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:53.397
A state that actually pervades

00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:57.142
and underlies all emotional states,

00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:00.031
and all the joys and sorrows
that can come one's way.

00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:03.611
For you, that might be surprising.

00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:06.492
Can we have this kind of well-being
while being sad?

00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:08.474
In a way, why not?

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:12.000
Because we are speaking
of a different level.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.892
Look at the waves coming near the shore.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.731
When you are at the bottom
of the wave, you hit the bottom.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.601
You hit the solid rock.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:27.270
When you are surfing on the top,
you are all elated.

00:06:27.294 --> 00:06:30.181
So you go from elation
to depression -- there's no depth.

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:34.761
Now, if you look at the high sea,

00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:38.208
there might be beautiful,
calm ocean, like a mirror.

00:06:38.533 --> 00:06:40.655
There might be storms,

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:45.009
but the depth of the ocean
is still there, unchanged.

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:47.976
So now, how is that?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.741
It can only be a state of being,
not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:56.511
Even joy -- that can be
the spring of happiness.

00:06:56.535 --> 00:07:00.065
But there's also wicked joy,
you can rejoice in someone's suffering.

00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:04.770
So how do we proceed
in our quest for happiness?

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:08.917
Very often, we look outside.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.914
We think that if we could gather
this and that, all the conditions,

00:07:13.938 --> 00:07:16.976
something that we say,
"Everything to be happy --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.256
to have everything to be happy."

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.696
That very sentence already reveals
the doom, destruction of happiness.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.975
To have everything.

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.222
If we miss something, it collapses.

00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:32.624
And also, when things go wrong,
we try to fix the outside so much,

00:07:32.648 --> 00:07:38.160
but our control
of the outer world is limited,

00:07:38.184 --> 00:07:41.049
temporary, and often, illusory.

00:07:42.103 --> 00:07:45.064
So now, look at inner conditions.

00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:46.489
Aren't they stronger?

00:07:46.513 --> 00:07:49.278
Isn't it the mind that translates

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.791
the outer condition
into happiness and suffering?

00:07:52.148 --> 00:07:53.976
And isn't that stronger?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.749
We know, by experience,

00:07:55.773 --> 00:07:59.107
that we can be
what we call "a little paradise,"

00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:02.140
and yet, be completely unhappy within.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.188
The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,

00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:08.976
and there was a lot of construction
going on everywhere.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So one evening, he said,
"Look, you are doing all these things,

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:14.976
but isn't it nice, also,
to build something within?"

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.976
And he said, "[Without] that --
even if you get a high-tech flat

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.250
on the 100th floor of a super-modern
and comfortable building,

00:08:25.274 --> 00:08:26.976
if you are deeply unhappy within,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
all you are going to look for
is a window from which to jump."

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.976
So now, at the opposite,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.436
we know a lot of people who,
in very difficult circumstances,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:43.831
manage to keep serenity, inner strength,
inner freedom, confidence.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.239
So now, if the inner conditions
are stronger --

00:08:47.263 --> 00:08:49.886
of course, the outer
conditions do influence,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.494
and it's wonderful to live
longer, healthier,

00:08:53.518 --> 00:08:56.311
to have access to information, education,

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.288
to be able to travel, to have freedom.

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:01.505
It's highly desirable.

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:03.088
However, this is not enough.

00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:07.448
Those are just auxiliary, help conditions.

00:09:08.303 --> 00:09:11.782
The experience that translates
everything is within the mind.

00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:14.168
So then, when we ask oneself

00:09:14.192 --> 00:09:18.572
how to nurture
the condition for happiness,

00:09:18.596 --> 00:09:24.040
the inner conditions, and which are those
which will undermine happiness.

00:09:24.808 --> 00:09:27.784
So then, this just needs
to have some experience.

00:09:28.189 --> 00:09:31.244
We have to know from ourselves,
there are certain states of mind

00:09:31.268 --> 00:09:34.577
that are conducive to this flourishing,
to this well-being,

00:09:34.601 --> 00:09:37.190
what the Greeks called
eudaimonia, flourishing.

00:09:38.888 --> 00:09:42.556
There are some which are adverse
to this well-being.

00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:47.304
And so, if we look
from our own experience,

00:09:47.328 --> 00:09:51.537
anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,

00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:56.326
obsessive desire, strong grasping,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.103
they don't leave us in such a good state
after we have experienced it.

00:10:00.697 --> 00:10:03.697
And also, they are detrimental
to others' happiness.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.686
So we may consider that the more
those are invading our mind,

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.361
and, like a chain reaction,

00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:14.618
the more we feel miserable,
we feel tormented.

00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:19.089
At the opposite,
everyone knows deep within

00:10:19.113 --> 00:10:21.312
that an act of selfless generosity,

00:10:21.336 --> 00:10:25.621
if from the distance, without anyone
knowing anything about it,

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:29.847
we could save a child's life,
make someone happy.

00:10:29.871 --> 00:10:33.421
We don't need the recognition.
We don't need any gratitude.

00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:36.166
Just the mere fact of doing that

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.923
fills such a sense of adequation
with our deep nature.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.806
And we would like to be
like that all the time.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.581
So is that possible,

00:10:45.605 --> 00:10:49.205
to change our way of being,
to transform one's mind?

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.976
Aren't those negative emotions,
or destructive emotions,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.086
inherent to the nature of mind?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.070
Is change possible in our emotions,
in our traits, in our moods?

00:11:02.864 --> 00:11:05.442
For that we have to ask,
what is the nature of mind?

00:11:05.912 --> 00:11:10.474
And if we look from
the experiential point of view,

00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:12.976
there is a primary
quality of consciousness

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.493
that's just the mere fact
to be cognitive, to be aware.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.660
Consciousness is like a mirror
that allows all images to rise on it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.134
You can have ugly faces,
beautiful faces in the mirror.

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:29.630
The mirror allows that,
but the mirror is not tainted,

00:11:29.654 --> 00:11:33.055
is not modified,
is not altered by those images.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.933
Likewise, behind every single thought

00:11:36.957 --> 00:11:41.049
there is the bare consciousness,
pure awareness.

00:11:41.807 --> 00:11:43.122
This is the nature.

00:11:43.146 --> 00:11:47.747
It cannot be tainted intrinsically
with hatred or jealousy because then,

00:11:47.771 --> 00:11:49.378
if it was always there --

00:11:49.402 --> 00:11:53.306
like a dye that would permeate
the whole cloth --

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.198
then it would be found
all the time, somewhere.

00:11:56.222 --> 00:12:00.075
We know we're not always angry,
always jealous, always generous.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.976
So, because the basic
fabric of consciousness

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.292
is this pure cognitive quality
that differentiates it from a stone,

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:11.563
there is a possibility for change
because all emotions are fleeting.

00:12:12.142 --> 00:12:14.278
That is the ground for mind training.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.814
Mind training is based on the idea
that two opposite mental factors

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:21.663
cannot happen at the same time.

00:12:22.103 --> 00:12:24.052
You could go from love to hate.

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:27.293
But you cannot, at the same time,
toward the same object,

00:12:27.317 --> 00:12:30.696
the same person, want to harm
and want to do good.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.443
You cannot, in the same gesture,
shake hand and give a blow.

00:12:35.427 --> 00:12:38.687
So, there are natural
antidotes to emotions

00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:41.107
that are destructive
to our inner well-being.

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:44.468
So that's the way to proceed.

00:12:44.946 --> 00:12:47.787
Rejoicing compared to jealousy.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.810
A kind of sense of inner freedom

00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:54.536
as opposite to intense
grasping and obsession.

00:12:55.744 --> 00:13:00.105
Benevolence, loving kindness
against hatred.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.985
But, of course, each emotion then
would need a particular antidote.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.976
Another way is to try to find
a general antidote to all emotions,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.126
and that's by looking at the very nature.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.339
Usually, when we feel annoyed,
hatred or upset with someone,

00:13:19.363 --> 00:13:21.656
or obsessed with something,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.214
the mind goes again
and again to that object.

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:26.064
Each time it goes to the object,

00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:29.143
it reinforces that obsession
or that annoyance.

00:13:29.746 --> 00:13:32.986
So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.

00:13:33.714 --> 00:13:35.474
So what we need to look for now is,

00:13:35.498 --> 00:13:38.087
instead of looking outward,
we look inward.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.184
Look at anger itself.

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:41.746
It looks very menacing,

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:46.208
like a billowing monsoon cloud
or thunderstorm.

00:13:46.657 --> 00:13:48.920
We think we could sit on the cloud,

00:13:48.944 --> 00:13:51.000
but if you go there, it's just mist.

00:13:51.325 --> 00:13:54.467
Likewise, if you look
at the thought of anger,

00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:57.680
it will vanish like frost
under the morning sun.

00:13:58.378 --> 00:14:01.237
If you do this again
and again, the propensity,

00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:03.976
the tendencies for anger to arise again

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.854
will be less and less
each time you dissolve it.

00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:09.362
And, at the end, although it may rise,

00:14:09.386 --> 00:14:10.976
it will just cross the mind,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.671
like a bird crossing the sky
without leaving any track.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.846
So this is the principal of mind training.

00:14:18.198 --> 00:14:21.703
Now, it takes time,

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:28.698
because it took time for all those faults
in our mind, the tendencies, to build up,

00:14:28.722 --> 00:14:30.976
so it will take time
to unfold them as well.

00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:32.976
But that's the only way to go.

00:14:33.447 --> 00:14:37.238
Mind transformation --
that is the very meaning of meditation.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.976
It means familiarization
with a new way of being,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.654
new way of perceiving things,

00:14:42.678 --> 00:14:44.976
which is more in adequation with reality,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.976
with interdependence, with the stream
and continuous transformation,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.146
which our being and our consciousness is.

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:53.936
So, the interface with cognitive science,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.120
since we need to come to that,
it was, I suppose, the subject of --

00:14:57.144 --> 00:15:00.668
we have to deal in such a short time --
with brain plasticity.

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:03.665
The brain was thought
to be more or less fixed.

00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:06.331
All the nominal connections,
in numbers and quantities,

00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:09.296
were thought, until the last 20 years,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.787
to be more or less fixed
when we reached adult age.

00:15:13.224 --> 00:15:15.976
Now, recently, it has been found
that it can change a lot.

00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:20.397
A violinist, as we heard, who has done
10,000 hours of violin practice,

00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:25.242
some area that controls the movements
of fingers in the brain changes a lot,

00:15:25.266 --> 00:15:28.218
increasing reinforcement
of the synaptic connections.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.574
So can we do that with human qualities?

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:36.325
With loving kindness,
with patience, with openness?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.116
So that's what those great
meditators have been doing.

00:15:41.218 --> 00:15:44.728
Some of them who came to the labs,

00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:48.652
like in Madison, Wisconsin,
or in Berkeley,

00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:51.966
did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.

00:15:52.776 --> 00:15:56.304
They do, like, three years' retreat,
where they do meditate 12 hours a day.

00:15:56.328 --> 00:15:59.788
And then, the rest of their life,
they will do three or four hours a day.

00:15:59.812 --> 00:16:02.789
They are real Olympic
champions of mind training.

00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:04.314
(Laughter)

00:16:05.814 --> 00:16:09.658
This is the place where the meditators --
you can see it's kind of inspiring.

00:16:09.682 --> 00:16:13.369
Now, here with 256 electrodes.

00:16:15.817 --> 00:16:18.509
(Laughter)

00:16:18.896 --> 00:16:20.077
So what did they find?

00:16:20.101 --> 00:16:22.976
Of course, same thing.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.697
The scientific embargo --

00:16:24.721 --> 00:16:28.895
a paper has been submitted to "Nature,"
hopefully, it will be accepted.

00:16:29.246 --> 00:16:33.237
It deals with the state of compassion,
unconditional compassion.

00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:36.976
We asked meditators, who have
been doing that for years and years,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.693
to put their mind in a state
where there's nothing but loving kindness,

00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:43.693
total availability to sentient being.

00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:46.777
Of course, during the training,
we do that with objects.

00:16:46.801 --> 00:16:49.087
We think of people suffering,
of people we love,

00:16:49.111 --> 00:16:52.125
but at some point, it can be
a state which is all pervading.

00:16:53.164 --> 00:16:55.683
Here is the preliminary result,

00:16:55.707 --> 00:16:58.037
which I can show
because it's already been shown.

00:16:58.061 --> 00:17:02.961
The bell curve shows 150 controls,

00:17:02.985 --> 00:17:05.174
and what is being looked at

00:17:05.198 --> 00:17:08.566
is the difference between the right
and the left frontal lobe.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.425
In very short, people
who have more activity

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:14.112
in the right side of the prefrontal cortex

00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:17.129
are more depressed, withdrawn.

00:17:17.612 --> 00:17:20.262
They don't describe
a lot of positive affect.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.940
It's the opposite on the left side:

00:17:23.964 --> 00:17:25.976
more tendency to altruism,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.139
to happiness, to express,
and curiosity and so forth.

00:17:30.737 --> 00:17:34.830
So there's a basic line for people.
And also, it can be changed.

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:37.378
If you see a comic movie,
you go off to the left side.

00:17:37.402 --> 00:17:40.818
If you are happy about something,
you'll go more to the left side.

00:17:40.842 --> 00:17:43.747
If you have a bout of depression,
you'll go to the right side.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:50.256
Here, the -0.5 is the full
standard deviation

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.976
of a meditator
who meditated on compassion.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.825
It's something that is totally out
of the bell curve.

00:17:57.132 --> 00:18:00.976
So, I've no time to go
into all the different scientific results.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.538
Hopefully, they will come.

00:18:02.562 --> 00:18:05.333
But they found that --
this is after three and a half hours

00:18:05.357 --> 00:18:07.300
in an fMRI,

00:18:07.324 --> 00:18:10.417
it's like coming out of a space ship.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.976
Also, it has been shown in other labs --

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.976
for instance,
Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.535
that some meditators are able, also,

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:23.976
to control their emotional response
more than it could be thought.

00:18:24.397 --> 00:18:26.412
Like the startle experiments, for example.

00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:27.967
If you sit a guy on a chair

00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:30.420
with all this apparatus
measuring your physiology,

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:32.412
and there's kind of a bomb that goes off,

00:18:32.436 --> 00:18:34.976
it's such an instinctive response that,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.592
in 20 years, they never saw
anyone who would not jump.

00:18:39.456 --> 00:18:41.976
Some meditators,
without trying to stop it,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.374
but simply by being completely open,

00:18:44.398 --> 00:18:49.976
thinking that that bang is just going
to be a small event like a shooting star,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.637
they are able not to move at all.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.976
So the whole point of that is not,
sort of, to make, like,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.801
a circus thing of showing exceptional
beings who can jump, or whatever.

00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:05.672
It's more to say
that mind training matters.

00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:09.474
That this is not just a luxury.

00:19:09.498 --> 00:19:13.896
This is not a supplementary
vitamin for the soul.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.652
This is something
that's going to determine

00:19:17.676 --> 00:19:19.737
the quality of every instant of our lives.

00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:23.381
We are ready to spend 15 years
achieving education.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.976
We love to do jogging, fitness.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.921
We do all kinds of things
to remain beautiful.

00:19:30.912 --> 00:19:37.889
Yet, we spend surprisingly little time
taking care of what matters most --

00:19:37.913 --> 00:19:40.157
the way our mind functions --

00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:43.928
which, again, is the ultimate thing

00:19:43.952 --> 00:19:46.118
that determines
the quality of our experience.

00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:49.490
Now, compassion
is supposed to be put in action.

00:19:49.872 --> 00:19:52.311
That's what we try to do
in different places.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.651
Just this one example
is worth a lot of work.

00:19:57.296 --> 00:20:00.178
This lady with bone TB,
left alone in a tent,

00:20:00.202 --> 00:20:02.933
was going to die with her only daughter.

00:20:03.428 --> 00:20:05.609
One year later, how she is.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.453
Different schools and clinics
we've been doing in Tibet.

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:18.685
And just, I leave you
with the beauty of those looks

00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:22.718
that tells more about happiness
than I could ever say.

00:20:22.742 --> 00:20:23.885
(Laughter)

00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:25.369
And jumping monks of Tibet.

00:20:25.393 --> 00:20:26.976
(Laughter)

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.648
Flying monks.

00:20:35.974 --> 00:20:37.140
Thank you very much.
