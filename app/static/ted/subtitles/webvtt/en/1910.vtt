00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:03.417
Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:06.968
are of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar,

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:10.768
in our four-family home in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:13.843
Her apartment was an oasis.

00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:15.888
It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee,

00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:19.769
which was really warm milk 
with just a touch of caffeine.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.303
She loved life.

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:24.798
And although she worked in a factory,

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:27.970
she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.299
And I remember poring over those pictures with her

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:35.411
and then dancing with her to her favorite music.

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:40.033
And then, when I was eight and she was 60,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.086
something changed.

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:44.440
She no longer worked or traveled.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.131
She no longer danced.

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:48.884
There were no more coffee times.

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:51.068
My mother missed work and took her to doctors

00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:53.454
who couldn't make a diagnosis.

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:58.791
And my father, who worked at night, 
would spend every afternoon with her,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.876
just to make sure she ate.

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:06.576
Her care became all-consuming for our family.

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:08.223
And by the time a diagnosis was made,

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:10.928
she was in a deep spiral.

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:14.489
Now many of you will recognize her symptoms.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:17.152
My grandmother had depression.

00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:20.472
A deep, life-altering depression,

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:23.562
from which she never recovered.

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:27.253
And back then, so little 
was known about depression.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:30.658
But even today, 50 years later,

00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:33.932
there's still so much more to learn.

00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:38.840
Today, we know that women 
are 70 percent more likely

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.831
to experience depression over their lifetimes

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:44.112
compared with men.

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:46.952
And even with this high prevalence,

00:01:46.952 --> 00:01:53.239
women are misdiagnosed between 
30 and 50 percent of the time.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.172
Now we know that women are more likely

00:01:56.172 --> 00:02:01.560
to experience the symptoms 
of fatigue, sleep disturbance,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.105
pain and anxiety compared with men.

00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:06.804
And these symptoms are often overlooked

00:02:06.804 --> 00:02:09.767
as symptoms of depression.

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:13.550
And it isn't only depression in which 
these sex differences occur,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.069
but they occur across so many diseases.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.064
So it's my grandmother's struggles

00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:23.797
that have really led me on a lifelong quest.

00:02:23.797 --> 00:02:27.025
And today, I lead a center in which the mission

00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:30.804
is to discover why these sex differences occur

00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:32.906
and to use that knowledge

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:35.865
to improve the health of women.

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:39.998
Today, we know that every cell has a sex.

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:43.951
Now, that's a term coined 
by the Institute of Medicine.

00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:47.712
And what it means is that 
men and women are different

00:02:47.712 --> 00:02:52.154
down to the cellular and molecular levels.

00:02:52.154 --> 00:02:57.094
It means that we're different 
across all of our organs.

00:02:57.094 --> 00:03:02.589
From our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:06.473
Now, it was only 20 years ago

00:03:06.473 --> 00:03:10.300
that we hardly had any data on women's health

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.183
beyond our reproductive functions.

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:16.084
But then in 1993,

00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:20.696
the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.

00:03:20.696 --> 00:03:23.299
And what this law did was it mandated

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.772
that women and minorities 
be included in clinical trials

00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:31.823
that were funded by the National Institutes of Health.

00:03:31.823 --> 00:03:34.750
And in many ways, the law has worked.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.420
Women are now routinely 
included in clinical studies,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.671
and we've learned that there are major differences

00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:42.764
in the ways that women and men

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.300
experience disease.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.465
But remarkably,

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:52.559
what we have learned about these 
differences is often overlooked.

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:56.384
So, we have to ask ourselves the question:

00:03:56.384 --> 00:04:00.897
Why leave women's health to chance?

00:04:00.897 --> 00:04:03.540
And we're leaving it to chance in two ways.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.237
The first is that there is so much more to learn

00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:09.646
and we're not making the investment

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:13.814
in fully understanding the extent 
of these sex differences.

00:04:13.814 --> 00:04:18.536
And the second is that we aren't 
taking what we have learned,

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:22.240
and routinely applying it in clinical care.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.229
We are just not doing enough.

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.488
So, I'm going to share with you three examples

00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:32.194
of where sex differences have 
impacted the health of women,

00:04:32.194 --> 00:04:34.864
and where we need to do more.

00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:36.876
Let's start with heart disease.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:42.078
It's the number one killer of women 
in the United States today.

00:04:42.078 --> 00:04:44.974
This is the face of heart disease.

00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:47.255
Linda is a middle-aged woman,

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:49.840
who had a stent placed in one of the arteries

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.940
going to her heart.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.191
When she had recurring symptoms 
she went back to her doctor.

00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:57.829
Her doctor did the gold standard test:

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:00.116
a cardiac catheterization.

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:02.533
It showed no blockages.

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:04.605
Linda's symptoms continued.

00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:07.078
She had to stop working.

00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:09.830
And that's when she found us.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.978
When Linda came to us, we did 
another cardiac catheterization

00:05:13.978 --> 00:05:17.395
and this time, we found clues.

00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:19.869
But we needed another test

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.463
to make the diagnosis.

00:05:22.463 --> 00:05:27.043
So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound,

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:29.348
where you use soundwaves to look at the artery

00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:32.079
from the inside out.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:34.017
And what we found

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:36.468
was that Linda's disease didn't look like

00:05:36.468 --> 00:05:39.538
the typical male disease.

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:42.734
The typical male disease looks like this.

00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:46.046
There's a discrete blockage or stenosis.

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:50.347
Linda's disease, like the disease of so many women,

00:05:50.347 --> 00:05:52.189
looks like this.

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.726
The plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely

00:05:55.726 --> 00:05:59.698
along the artery, and it's harder to see.

00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:03.104
So for Linda, and for so many women,

00:06:03.104 --> 00:06:06.796
the gold standard test wasn't gold.

00:06:06.796 --> 00:06:09.783
Now, Linda received the right treatment.

00:06:09.783 --> 00:06:11.961
She went back to her life and, fortunately, today

00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:13.713
she is doing well.

00:06:13.713 --> 00:06:15.319
But Linda was lucky.

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.945
She found us, we found her disease.

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:20.856
But for too many women, that's not the case.

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:23.171
We have the tools.

00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:26.852
We have the technology to make the diagnosis.

00:06:26.852 --> 00:06:30.249
But it's all too often that these sex diffferences

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:32.553
are overlooked.

00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:34.726
So what about treatment?

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:37.436
A landmark study that was published two years ago

00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:39.858
asked the very important question:

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:44.913
What are the most effective treatments 
for heart disease in women?

00:06:44.913 --> 00:06:48.572
The authors looked at papers 
written over a 10-year period,

00:06:48.572 --> 00:06:51.050
and hundreds had to be thrown out.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.823
And what they found out was that 
of those that were tossed out,

00:06:55.823 --> 00:06:59.477
65 percent were excluded

00:06:59.477 --> 00:07:03.841
because even though women 
were included in the studies,

00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:10.197
the analysis didn't differentiate 
between women and men.

00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:13.418
What a lost opportunity.

00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:15.449
The money had been spent

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:17.596
and we didn't learn how women fared.

00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:20.397
And these studies could not contribute one iota

00:07:20.397 --> 00:07:22.814
to the very, very important question,

00:07:22.814 --> 00:07:25.205
what are the most effective treatments

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:28.100
for heart disease in women?

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.592
I want to introduce you to 
Hortense, my godmother,

00:07:33.592 --> 00:07:37.035
Hung Wei, a relative of a colleague,

00:07:37.035 --> 00:07:39.226
and somebody you may recognize --

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:42.873
Dana, Christopher Reeve's wife.

00:07:42.873 --> 00:07:47.233
All three women have something 
very important in common.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:50.808
All three were diagnosed with lung cancer,

00:07:50.808 --> 00:07:53.737
the number one cancer killer of women

00:07:53.737 --> 00:07:56.438
in the United States today.

00:07:56.438 --> 00:08:00.314
All three were nonsmokers.

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:05.480
Sadly, Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.620
Today, what we know is that women who are
nonsmokers are three times more likely

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.357
to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men

00:08:14.357 --> 00:08:16.343
who are nonsmokers.

00:08:16.343 --> 00:08:20.033
Now interestingly, when women are 
diagnosed with lung cancer,

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:23.212
their survival tends to be better than that of men.

00:08:23.212 --> 00:08:25.087
Now, here are some clues.

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:27.486
Our investigators have found that there are

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:32.158
certain genes in the lung tumor 
cells of both women and men.

00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:34.350
And these genes are activated

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.440
mainly by estrogen.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.258
And when these genes are over-expressed,

00:08:39.258 --> 00:08:41.989
it's associated with improved survival

00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:44.656
only in young women.

00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:46.330
Now this is a very early finding

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.973
and we don't yet know whether it has relevance

00:08:49.973 --> 00:08:52.414
to clinical care.

00:08:52.414 --> 00:08:56.273
But it's findings like this that may provide hope

00:08:56.273 --> 00:08:59.040
and may provide an opportunity to save lives

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.587
of both women and men.

00:09:01.587 --> 00:09:02.968
Now, let me share with you an example

00:09:02.968 --> 00:09:06.946
of when we do consider sex differences,
it can drive the science.

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:09.274
Several years ago a new lung cancer drug

00:09:09.274 --> 00:09:10.920
was being evaluated,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.292
and when the authors looked 
at whose tumors shrank,

00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:18.725
they found that 82 percent were women.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.688
This led them to ask the question: Well, why?

00:09:21.688 --> 00:09:23.243
And what they found

00:09:23.243 --> 00:09:26.723
was that the genetic mutations 
that the drug targeted

00:09:26.723 --> 00:09:29.450
were far more common in women.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.149
And what this has led to

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:33.331
is a more personalized approach

00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:37.485
to the treatment of lung cancer 
that also includes sex.

00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:39.580
This is what we can accomplish

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.406
when we don't leave women's health to chance.

00:09:43.406 --> 00:09:46.614
We know that when you invest in research,

00:09:46.614 --> 00:09:48.140
you get results.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.648
Take a look at the death rate 
from breast cancer over time.

00:09:52.648 --> 00:09:54.573
And now take a look at the death rates

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:57.905
from lung cancer in women over time.

00:09:57.905 --> 00:10:01.515
Now let's look at the dollars 
invested in breast cancer --

00:10:01.515 --> 00:10:04.484
these are the dollars invested per death --

00:10:04.484 --> 00:10:08.712
and the dollars invested in lung cancer.

00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:13.633
Now, it's clear that our investment in breast cancer

00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:15.422
has produced results.

00:10:15.422 --> 00:10:17.755
They may not be fast enough,

00:10:17.755 --> 00:10:19.981
but it has produced results.

00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:21.785
We can do the same

00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:26.776
for lung cancer and for every other disease.

00:10:26.776 --> 00:10:30.102
So let's go back to depression.

00:10:30.102 --> 00:10:32.412
Depression is the number one cause

00:10:32.412 --> 00:10:37.004
of disability in women in the world today.

00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:39.139
Our investigators have found

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.955
that there are differences in the brains

00:10:40.955 --> 00:10:42.432
of women and men

00:10:42.432 --> 00:10:45.551
in the areas that are connected with mood.

00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:47.624
And when you put men and women

00:10:47.624 --> 00:10:49.499
in a functional MRI scanner --

00:10:49.499 --> 00:10:54.046
that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated --

00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:58.089
so you put them in the scanner 
and you expose them to stress.

00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:01.976
You can actually see the difference.

00:11:01.976 --> 00:11:04.505
And it's findings like this

00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:07.486
that we believe hold some of the clues

00:11:07.486 --> 00:11:11.239
for why we see these very significant sex differences

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:13.493
in depression.

00:11:13.493 --> 00:11:15.051
But even though we know

00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:17.918
that these differences occur,

00:11:17.918 --> 00:11:20.571
66 percent

00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:24.567
of the brain research that begins in animals

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:26.893
is done in either male animals

00:11:26.893 --> 00:11:31.240
or animals in whom the sex is not identified.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.859
So, I think we have to ask again the question:

00:11:34.859 --> 00:11:39.661
Why leave women's health to chance?

00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:42.489
And this is a question that haunts those of us

00:11:42.489 --> 00:11:44.300
in science and medicine

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:50.659
who believe that we are on the verge 
of being able to dramatically improve

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:52.335
the health of women.

00:11:52.335 --> 00:11:54.821
We know that every cell has a sex.

00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:57.763
We know that these differences 
are often overlooked.

00:11:57.763 --> 00:12:02.051
And therefore we know that women 
are not getting the full benefit

00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:05.950
of modern science and medicine today.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.601
We have the tools

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:11.483
but we lack the collective will and momentum.

00:12:11.483 --> 00:12:14.227
Women's health is an equal rights issue

00:12:14.227 --> 00:12:17.781
as important as equal pay.

00:12:17.781 --> 00:12:19.965
And it's an issue of the quality

00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:23.120
and the integrity of science and medicine.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:30.583
(Applause)

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:35.128
So imagine the momentum we could achieve

00:12:35.128 --> 00:12:37.239
in advancing the health of women

00:12:37.239 --> 00:12:40.098
if we considered whether these 
sex differences were present

00:12:40.098 --> 00:12:43.687
at the very beginning of designing research.

00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:47.566
Or if we analyzed our data by sex.

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:49.514
So, people often ask me:

00:12:49.514 --> 00:12:51.285
What can I do?

00:12:51.285 --> 00:12:53.619
And here's what I suggest:

00:12:53.619 --> 00:12:57.792
First, I suggest that you think about women's health

00:12:57.792 --> 00:12:59.535
in the same way

00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:05.580
that you think and care about other 
causes that are important to you.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.762
And second, and equally as important,

00:13:08.762 --> 00:13:10.974
that as a woman,

00:13:10.974 --> 00:13:13.615
you have to ask your doctor

00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:18.027
and the doctors who are caring 
for those who you love:

00:13:18.027 --> 00:13:22.903
Is this disease or treatment different in women?

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:26.491
Now, this is a profound question 
because the answer is likely yes,

00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:30.188
but your doctor may not know 
the answer, at least not yet.

00:13:30.188 --> 00:13:34.564
But if you ask the question, 
your doctor will very likely

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.846
go looking for the answer.

00:13:36.846 --> 00:13:39.183
And this is so important,

00:13:39.183 --> 00:13:41.345
not only for ourselves,

00:13:41.345 --> 00:13:43.998
but for all of those whom we love.

00:13:43.998 --> 00:13:48.482
Whether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister,

00:13:48.482 --> 00:13:52.179
a friend or a grandmother.

00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:54.322
It was my grandmother's suffering

00:13:54.322 --> 00:13:56.255
that inspired my work

00:13:56.255 --> 00:13:59.240
to improve the health of women.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.590
That's her legacy.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:06.259
Our legacy can be to improve the health of women

00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:08.398
for this generation

00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:11.420
and for generations to come.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.569
Thank you.

00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:16.851
(Applause)
