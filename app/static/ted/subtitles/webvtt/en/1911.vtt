00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.739
I have spent the last years

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:05.398
trying to resolve two enigmas:

00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:09.759
Why is productivity so disappointing

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.641
in all the companies where I work?

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.335
I have worked with more than 500 companies.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:17.780
Despite all the technological advances --

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.072
computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.433
the Internet.

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:24.831
Enigma number two:

00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:27.863
Why is there so little engagement at work?

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:29.967
Why do people feel so miserable,

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.617
even actively disengaged?

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:35.141
Disengaging their colleagues.

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:39.872
Acting against the interest of their company.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:43.976
Despite all the affiliation events,

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:47.973
the celebration, the people initiatives,

00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:50.572
the leadership development programs to train

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:54.956
managers on how to better motivate their teams.

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:56.694
At the beginning, I thought there was

00:00:56.694 --> 00:00:58.663
a chicken and egg issue:

00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:01.215
Because people are less engaged, 
they are less productive.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.452
Or vice versa, because they are less productive,

00:01:03.452 --> 00:01:05.643
we put more pressure and they are less engaged.

00:01:05.643 --> 00:01:07.511
But as we were doing our analysis

00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:09.432
we realized that there was a common root cause

00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:10.815
to these two issues

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:15.371
that relates, in fact, to the basic 
pillars of management.

00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:18.541
The way we organize is based on two pillars.

00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:21.294
The hard -- structure, processes, systems.

00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:22.518
The soft --

00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:27.973
feelings, sentiments, interpersonal
relationships, traits, personality.

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:29.445
And whenever a company

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:33.155
reorganizes, restructures, reengineers,

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:35.603
goes through a cultural transformation program,

00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:37.633
it chooses these two pillars.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:39.682
Now, we try to refine them,

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:41.578
we try to combine them.

00:01:41.578 --> 00:01:43.206
The real issue is --

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.243
and this is the answer to the two enigmas --

00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:48.177
these pillars are obsolete.

00:01:48.177 --> 00:01:50.859
Everything you read in business books is based

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.524
either on one or the other

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:53.791
or their combination.

00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.105
They are obsolete.

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.402
How do they work

00:01:57.402 --> 00:01:59.689
when you try to use these approaches

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.837
in front of the new complexity of business?

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:04.834
The hard approach, basically 
is that you start from strategy,

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:08.463
requirements, structures, processes, 
systems, KPIs, scorecards,

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:11.340
committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.450
you name it.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.881
I forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees, 
middle offices and interfaces.

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:19.876
What happens basically on the left,

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:23.140
you have more complexity, the 
new complexity of business.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.427
We need quality, cost, reliability, speed.

00:02:27.427 --> 00:02:29.813
And every time there is a new requirement,

00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:31.292
we use the same approach.

00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:34.405
We create dedicated structure processed systems,

00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:37.643
basically to deal with the 
new complexity of business.

00:02:37.643 --> 00:02:41.382
The hard approach creates just complicatedness

00:02:41.382 --> 00:02:43.220
in the organization.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.798
Let's take an example.

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:47.694
An automotive company, the engineering division

00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:49.486
is a five-dimensional matrix.

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:51.518
If you open any cell of the matrix,

00:02:51.518 --> 00:02:54.531
you find another 20-dimensional matrix.

00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:57.394
You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,

00:02:57.394 --> 00:02:59.352
Mr. Anti-Collision Properties.

00:02:59.352 --> 00:03:01.182
For any new requirement,

00:03:01.182 --> 00:03:03.057
you have a dedicated function

00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:05.846
in charge of aligning engineers against

00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:07.394
the new requirement.

00:03:07.394 --> 00:03:09.993
What happens when the new 
requirement emerges?

00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:12.085
Some years ago, a new requirement

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:13.932
appeared on the marketplace:

00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:16.083
the length of the warranty period.

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:19.018
So therefore the new requirement is repairability,

00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:20.518
making cars easy to repair.

00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:24.524
Otherwise when you bring the car 
to the garage to fix the light,

00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:26.781
if you have to remove the engine

00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:28.110
to access the lights,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.549
the car will have to stay one week in the garage

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.436
instead of two hours, and the 
warranty budget will explode.

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:36.381
So, what was the solution using the hard approach?

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:39.431
If repairability is the new requirement,

00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:41.520
the solution is to create a new function,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.693
Mr. Repairability.

00:03:43.693 --> 00:03:47.636
And Mr. Repairability creates 
the repairability process.

00:03:47.636 --> 00:03:51.494
With a repairability scorecard, 
with a repairability metric

00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:54.308
and eventually repairability incentive.

00:03:54.308 --> 00:03:58.072
That came on top of 25 other KPIs.

00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:01.578
What percentage of these people is variable compensation?

00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:05.405
Twenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs,

00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:09.502
repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent.

00:04:09.502 --> 00:04:11.562
What difference did it make in their actions,

00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:14.184
their choices to simplify? Zero.

00:04:14.184 --> 00:04:17.849
But what occurs for zero impact? 
Mr. Repairability, process,

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.522
scorecard, evaluation, coordination 
with the 25 other coordinators

00:04:22.522 --> 00:04:24.418
to have zero impact.

00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:26.959
Now, in front of the new complexity of business,

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:29.896
the only solution is not drawing boxes

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:32.322
with reporting lines.

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:35.407
It is basically the interplay.

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:37.978
How the parts work together.

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:42.710
The connections, the interactions, the synapses.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.213
It is not the skeleton of boxes, 
it is the nervous system

00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:50.250
of adaptiveness and intelligence.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.150
You know, you could call it cooperation, basically.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.689
Whenever people cooperate,

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.617
they use less resources. In everything.

00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:02.149
You know, the repairability issue

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:04.901
is a cooperation problem.

00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:08.122
When you design cars, please take into account

00:05:08.122 --> 00:05:10.830
the needs of those who will repair the cars

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.937
in the after sales garages.

00:05:13.937 --> 00:05:16.554
When we don't cooperate we need more time,

00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:20.336
more equipment, more systems, more teams.

00:05:20.336 --> 00:05:25.427
We need -- When procurement, supply 
chain, manufacturing don't cooperate

00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:28.205
we need more stock, more inventories, 
more working capital.

00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:30.146
Who will pay for that?

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:32.108
Shareholders? Customers?

00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:33.439
No, they will refuse.

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.248
So who is left? 
The employees,

00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:38.956
who have to compensate through their super

00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:42.276
individual efforts for the lack of cooperation.

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:45.944
Stress, burnout, they are 
overwhelmed, accidents.

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:48.768
No wonder they disengage.

00:05:48.768 --> 00:05:52.565
How do the hard and the soft
try to foster cooperation?

00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:57.195
The hard: In banks, when there is a problem

00:05:57.195 --> 00:06:00.255
between the back office and the front office,

00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:02.345
they don't cooperate. What is the solution?

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:05.440
They create a middle office.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.476
What happens one year later?

00:06:07.476 --> 00:06:09.484
Instead of one problem 
between the back and the front,

00:06:09.484 --> 00:06:10.838
now I have two problems.

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:11.961
Between the back and the middle

00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.177
and between the middle and the front.

00:06:14.177 --> 00:06:16.642
Plus I have to pay for the middle office.

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:19.900
The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.336
It can only add new boxes, 
new bones in the skeleton.

00:06:24.336 --> 00:06:25.971
The soft approach:

00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:29.800
To make people cooperate, we need 
to make them like each other.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.494
Improve interpersonal feelings,

00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:34.450
the more people like each other, 
the more they will cooperate.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.221
It is totally wrong.

00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:38.621
It is even counterproductive.

00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:41.037
Look, at home I have two TVs. Why?

00:06:41.037 --> 00:06:43.909
Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.549
(Laughter)

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:48.453
Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife.

00:06:48.453 --> 00:06:52.463
And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife

00:06:52.463 --> 00:06:55.130
is precisely because I love my wife.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.355
If I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough:

00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:00.850
You will watch my favorite football game,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.405
if you are not happy, how is the book or the door?

00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:04.608
(Laughter)

00:07:04.608 --> 00:07:06.489
The more we like each other,

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:09.102
the more we avoid the real cooperation

00:07:09.102 --> 00:07:13.276
that would strain our relationships 
by imposing tough tradeoffs.

00:07:13.276 --> 00:07:16.283
And we go for a second TV or we escalate

00:07:16.283 --> 00:07:19.207
the decision above for arbitration.

00:07:19.207 --> 00:07:23.916
Definitely, these approaches are obsolete.

00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:27.699
To deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system,

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.961
we have created what we call 
the smart simplicity approach

00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:32.481
based on simple rules.

00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.743
Simple rule number one:

00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:37.768
Understand what others do.

00:07:37.768 --> 00:07:39.665
What is their real work?

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:43.300
We need to go beyond the boxes,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.318
the job descriptions, beyond the surface

00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:50.823
of the container, to understand the real content.

00:07:50.823 --> 00:07:53.531
Me, designer, if I put a wire here,

00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:55.534
I know that it will mean that we will have to

00:07:55.534 --> 00:07:58.100
remove the engine to access the lights.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.948
Second, you need to reenforce integrators.

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:04.808
Integrators are not middle 
offices, they are managers,

00:08:04.808 --> 00:08:06.569
existing managers that you reinforce

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.003
so that they have power and interest

00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:11.166
to make others cooperate.

00:08:11.166 --> 00:08:14.898
How can you reinforce your 
managers as integrators?

00:08:14.898 --> 00:08:16.373
By removing layers.

00:08:16.373 --> 00:08:17.737
When there are too many layers

00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:19.287
people are too far from the action,

00:08:19.287 --> 00:08:21.401
therefore they need KPIs, metrics,

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:25.729
they need poor proxies for reality.

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:27.331
They don't understand reality

00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:30.431
and they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs.

00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:32.883
By removing rules -- the bigger we are,

00:08:32.883 --> 00:08:34.516
the more we need integrators,

00:08:34.516 --> 00:08:36.837
therefore the less rules we must have,

00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:40.731
to give discretionary power to managers.

00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:41.858
And we do the opposite --

00:08:41.858 --> 00:08:44.044
the bigger we are, the more rules we create.

00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:47.294
And we end up with the Encyclopedia 
Britannica of rules.

00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:49.394
You need to increase the quanitity of power

00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:51.122
so that you can empower everybody

00:08:51.122 --> 00:08:54.108
to use their judgment, their intelligence.

00:08:54.108 --> 00:08:56.259
You must give more cards to people

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:59.616
so that they have the critical mass of cards

00:08:59.616 --> 00:09:01.575
to take the risk to cooperate,

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.330
to move out of insulation.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.694
Otherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage.

00:09:05.694 --> 00:09:07.940
These rules, they come from game theory

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.168
and organizational sociology.

00:09:10.168 --> 00:09:13.020
You can increase the shadow of the future.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.921
Create feedback loops that expose people

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:18.522
to the consequences of their actions.

00:09:18.522 --> 00:09:20.466
This is what the automotive company did

00:09:20.466 --> 00:09:23.256
when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact.

00:09:23.256 --> 00:09:24.891
They said to the design engineers:

00:09:24.891 --> 00:09:29.586
Now, in three years, when the new 
car is launched on the market,

00:09:29.586 --> 00:09:32.530
you will move to the after sales 
network, and become in charge

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.905
of the warranty budget,

00:09:34.905 --> 00:09:38.284
and if the warranty budget explodes,

00:09:38.284 --> 00:09:40.951
it will explode in your face. (Laughter)

00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:46.892
Much more powerful than 0.8 
percent variable compensation.

00:09:46.892 --> 00:09:50.614
You need also to increase reciprocity,

00:09:50.614 --> 00:09:54.329
by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.

00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:56.801
When you remove these buffers,

00:09:56.801 --> 00:09:59.798
you hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:01.180
We will cooperate.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.720
Remove the second TV.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.964
There are many second TVs at work

00:10:04.964 --> 00:10:06.265
that don't create value,

00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:10.953
they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.

00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:13.382
You need to reward those who cooperate

00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:15.061
and blame those who don't cooperate.

00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:18.130
The CEO of The Lego Group,

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.953
Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it.

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:23.858
He says, blame is not for failure,

00:10:23.858 --> 00:10:28.393
it is for failing to help or ask for help.

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:30.772
It changes everything.

00:10:30.772 --> 00:10:33.292
Suddenly it becomes in my
interest to be transparent

00:10:33.292 --> 00:10:35.332
on my real weaknesses, my real forecast,

00:10:35.332 --> 00:10:37.418
because I know I will not be blamed if I fail,

00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:41.286
but if I fail to help or ask for help.

00:10:41.286 --> 00:10:44.213
When you do this, it has a lot of implications

00:10:44.213 --> 00:10:47.158
on organizational design.

00:10:47.158 --> 00:10:49.576
You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines;

00:10:49.576 --> 00:10:50.966
you look at their interplay.

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:53.945
It has a lot of implications on financial policies

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.159
that we use.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:57.781
On human resource management practices.

00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:00.205
When you do that, you can manage complexity,

00:11:00.205 --> 00:11:01.798
the new complexity of business,

00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:04.731
without getting complicated.

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:08.381
You create more value with lower cost.

00:11:08.381 --> 00:11:12.955
You simultaneously improve 
performance and satisfaction at work

00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:15.684
because you have removed the common root cause

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.300
that hinders both.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.010
Complicatedness: This is your 
battle, business leaders.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.837
The real battle is not against competitors.

00:11:24.837 --> 00:11:27.258
This is rubbish, very abstract.

00:11:27.258 --> 00:11:29.921
When do we meet competitors to fight them?

00:11:29.921 --> 00:11:32.822
The real battle is against ourselves,

00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:36.176
against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.

00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:39.333
Only you can fight, can do it.

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:41.420
Thank you.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.112
(Applause)
