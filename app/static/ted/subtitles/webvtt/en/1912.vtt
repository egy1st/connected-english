00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:02.074
Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.

00:00:02.074 --> 00:00:03.567
I've always had stage fright,

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:05.395
and not just a little bit,

00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:07.186
it's a big bit.

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:09.979
And it didn't even matter until I was 27.

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.537
That's when I started writing songs, and even then

00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:14.339
I only played them for myself.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.084
Just knowing my roommates were in the 
same house made me uncomfortable.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.891
But after a couple of years, 
just writing songs wasn't enough.

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.910
I had all these stories and ideas,
and I wanted to share them with people,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.216
but physiologically, I couldn't do it.

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:30.142
I had this irrational fear.

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:32.301
But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:33.491
the more I wanted to perform.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.548
So on the week of my 30th birthday,

00:00:35.548 --> 00:00:38.501
I decided I was going to go to this local open mic,

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.216
and put this fear behind me.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:43.073
Well, when I got there, it was packed.

00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:45.047
There were like 20 people there.

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:46.930
(Laughter)

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.537
And they all looked angry.

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:53.138
But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,

00:00:53.138 --> 00:00:54.630
and I felt pretty good.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.691
Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,

00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:03.155
when my whole body rebelled, and 
this wave of anxiety just washed over me.

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.710
Now, when you experience fear, 
your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.553
So you have a rush of adrenaline, 
your heart rate increases,

00:01:09.553 --> 00:01:11.006
your breathing gets faster.

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:17.178
Next your non-essential systems start 
to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter)

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:20.542
So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed
away from your extremities,

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:23.142
so your fingers don't work anymore.

00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:26.274
Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract,
your Spidey sense tingles,

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:31.448
basically your whole body is trigger-happy.
(Laughter)

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:36.231
That condition is not conducive 
to performing folk music.

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:37.800
(Laughter)

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.432
I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:44.242
Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:46.614
between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:48.685
on a Tuesday night open mic?

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:50.116
(Laughter)

00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:54.173
I have never been more terrified -- until now.

00:01:54.173 --> 00:02:00.004
(Laughter and cheers)

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.757
So then it was my turn,

00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:08.843
and somehow, I get myself onto 
the stage, I start my song,

00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:11.480
I open my mouth to sing the first line,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.443
and this completely horrible vibrato --

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:15.930
you know, when your voice wavers -- 
comes streaming out.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.543
And this is not the good kind of vibrato, 
like an opera singer has,

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:21.237
this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.

00:02:21.237 --> 00:02:22.888
I mean, it's a nightmare.

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:25.356
I'm embarrassed, the audience 
is clearly uncomfortable,

00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:27.709
they're focused on my discomfort.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.484
It was so bad.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:35.421
But that was my first real experience 
as a solo singer-songwriter.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.436
And something good did happen --
I had the tiniest little glimpse

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:40.919
of that audience connection that I was hoping for.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.927
And I wanted more. But I knew 
I had to get past this nervousness.

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:48.097
That night I promised myself: 
I would go back every week

00:02:48.097 --> 00:02:50.032
until I wasn't nervous anymore.

00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:52.915
And I did. I went back every single week,

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:56.730
and sure enough, week after week,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.900
it didn't get any better. The same 
thing happened every week. (Laughter)

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.848
I couldn't shake it.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:04.521
And that's when I had an epiphany.

00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:10.532
And I remember it really well, because I 
don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter)

00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:14.161
All I had to do was write a song 
that exploits my nervousness.

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.283
That only seems authentic when I have stage fright,

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:17.571
and the more nervous I was,

00:03:17.571 --> 00:03:20.160
the better the song would be. Easy.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.989
So I started writing a song about having stage fright.

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.050
First, fessing up to the problem,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.878
the physical manifestations, how I would feel,

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:30.307
how the listener might feel.

00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:32.915
And then accounting for things like my shaky voice,

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:35.847
and I knew I would be singing about a 
half-octave higher than normal,

00:03:35.847 --> 00:03:37.961
because I was nervous.

00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.033
By having a song that explained 
what was happening to me,

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.520
while it was happening,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.383
that gave the audience permission to think about it.

00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:47.144
They didn't have to feel bad 
for me because I was nervous,

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:48.862
they could experience that with me,

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:54.111
and we were all one big happy, nervous, 
uncomfortable family. (Laughter)

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:58.920
By thinking about my audience, 
by embracing and exploiting my problem,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.855
I was able to take something 
that was blocking my progress,

00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:05.792
and turn it into something that 
was essential for my success.

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:08.812
And having the stage fright song let 
me get past that biggest issue

00:04:08.812 --> 00:04:10.630
right in the beginning of a performance.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.174
And then I could move on, 
and play the rest of my songs

00:04:12.174 --> 00:04:15.428
with just a little bit more ease.

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:21.704
And eventually, over time, I didn't 
have to play the stage fright song at all.

00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:27.424
Except for when I was really 
nervous, like now. (Laughter)

00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:31.670
Would it be okay if I played the 
stage fright song for you?

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.662
(Applause)

00:04:40.753 --> 00:04:43.715
Can I have a sip of water?

00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:47.666
(Music)

00:04:48.143 --> 00:04:50.520
Thank you.

00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:58.363
♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫

00:04:58.363 --> 00:05:03.991
♫ this stage fright is real. ♫

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:07.202
♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:11.548
♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫

00:05:11.548 --> 00:05:15.468
♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫

00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:19.396
♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫

00:05:19.396 --> 00:05:22.863
♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫

00:05:22.863 --> 00:05:25.909
♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.424
♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫

00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:29.825
(Laughter)

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:37.704
♫ And maybe I'll try to imagine 
you all without clothes. ♫

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:45.577
♫ But singing in front of all naked strangers
scares me more than anyone knows. ♫

00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:49.530
♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.775
♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫

00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:58.313
♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫

00:05:58.313 --> 00:06:03.203
♫ I mean, you're not even really naked. ♫

00:06:03.203 --> 00:06:06.546
♫ And I'm the one with the problem. ♫

00:06:06.546 --> 00:06:13.814
♫ And you tell me, don't worry 
so much, you'll be great. ♫

00:06:13.814 --> 00:06:16.618
♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫

00:06:16.618 --> 00:06:18.936
♫ and I know how I get. ♫

00:06:18.936 --> 00:06:23.080
♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.529
♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.361
♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn't 
help me when I sing. ♫

00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:35.249
♫ But we shouldn't talk about 
these things right now, ♫

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:42.136
♫ really, I'm up on stage, and 
you're in the crowd. Hi. ♫

00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:51.359
♫ And I'm not making fun of 
unnurtured, irrational fear, ♫

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:54.275
♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫

00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:58.807
♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫

00:06:58.807 --> 00:07:03.945
♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:08.231
♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫

00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:12.194
♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫

00:07:12.194 --> 00:07:16.548
♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫

00:07:16.548 --> 00:07:20.315
♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:23.722
♫ my vocal cords movin', ♫

00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:32.085
♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound. ♫

00:07:36.024 --> 00:07:41.827
(Applause)
