WEBVTT

00:00:00.207 --> 00:00:03.558
I'd like to reimagine education.

00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:05.148
The last year

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:08.054
has seen the invention of a new four-letter word.

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:09.967
It starts with an M.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:14.424
MOOC: massive open online courses.

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:15.901
Many organizations

00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.659
are offering these online courses

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:22.689
to students all over the world, in the millions, for free.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.249
Anybody who has an Internet connection

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.777
and the will to learn can access these great courses

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:28.871
from excellent universities

00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:32.128
and get a credential at the end of it.

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:34.752
Now, in this discussion today,

00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:35.987
I'm going to focus

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:39.255
on a different aspect of MOOCs.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.606
We are taking what we are learning

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:44.171
and the technologies we are developing in the large

00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:46.271
and applying them in the small

00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:49.250
to create a blended model of education

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.043
to really reinvent and reimagine

00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:53.470
what we do in the classroom.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.980
Now, our classrooms could use change.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.401
So, here's a classroom

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.426
at this little three-letter institute

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:03.210
in the Northeast of America, MIT.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.529
And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:08.996
and this is a classroom today.

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:12.116
What's changed?

00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:14.663
The seats are in color.

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:17.791
Whoop-de-do.

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.502
Education really hasn't changed

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:22.197
in the past 500 years.

00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:24.528
The last big innovation in education

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:28.010
was the printing press and the textbooks.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.420
Everything else has changed around us.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.243
You know, from healthcare to transportation,

00:01:31.243 --> 00:01:35.736
everything is different,
but education hasn't changed.

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:38.409
It's also been a real issue in terms of access.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.036
So what you see here

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.538
is not a rock concert.

00:01:42.538 --> 00:01:45.084
And the person you see at the end of the stage

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.144
is not Madonna.

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:48.773
This is a classroom

00:01:48.773 --> 00:01:53.191
at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.

00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:57.127
Now, we've all heard of distance education,

00:01:57.127 --> 00:01:58.495
but the students way in the back,

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:00.607
200 feet away from the instructor,

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:05.502
I think they are undergoing long-distance education.

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:07.177
Now, I really believe

00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:09.392
that we can transform education,

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:12.238
both in quality and scale and access,

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:14.546
through technology.

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:18.241
For example, at edX,

00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:20.494
we are trying to transform education

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:23.654
through online technologies.

00:02:23.654 --> 00:02:26.913
Given education has been calcified for 500 years,

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.104
we really cannot think about reengineering it,

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:30.249
micromanaging it.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.557
We really have to completely reimagine it.

00:02:32.557 --> 00:02:36.598
It's like going from ox carts to the airplane.

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:38.121
Even the infrastructure has to change.

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:39.734
Everything has to change.

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:43.099
We need to go from lectures on the blackboard

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.707
to online exercises, online videos.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.188
We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:49.837
and gamification.

00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:51.748
We have to go to completely online grading

00:02:51.748 --> 00:02:54.501
and peer interaction and discussion boards.

00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:56.782
Everything really has to change.

00:02:56.782 --> 00:02:59.288
So at edX and a number of other organizations,

00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:01.447
we are applying these technologies to education

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:04.633
through MOOCs to really
increase access to education.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.350
And you heard of this example,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.966
where, when we launched our very first course --

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:10.732
and this was an MIT-hard

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.320
circuits and electronics course --

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.014
about a year and a half ago,

00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:20.317
155,000 students from 162 countries

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.020
enrolled in this course.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.706
And we had no marketing budget.

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:28.194
Now, 155,000 is a big number.

00:03:28.194 --> 00:03:29.933
This number is bigger

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:32.564
than the total number of alumni of MIT

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:36.389
in its 150-year history.

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.547
7,200 students passed the course,

00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:41.010
and this was a hard course.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.464
7,200 is also a big number.

00:03:44.464 --> 00:03:48.006
If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:50.883
I would have to teach for 40 years

00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:53.485
before I could teach this many students.

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:55.023
Now these large numbers

00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:57.181
are just one part of the story.

00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:59.843
So today, I want to discuss a different aspect,

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:01.068
the other side of MOOCs,

00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:03.247
take a different perspective.

00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:06.182
We are taking what we develop
and learn in the large

00:04:06.182 --> 00:04:07.727
and applying it in the small

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.723
to the classroom, to create
a blended model of learning.

00:04:11.723 --> 00:04:16.326
But before I go into that, let me tell you a story.

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:20.410
When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.777
she stopped speaking English,

00:04:23.777 --> 00:04:26.838
and she began speaking this new language.

00:04:26.838 --> 00:04:29.644
I call it teen-lish.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.856
It's a digital language.

00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:38.570
It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.886
"Honey, come over for dinner."

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:43.481
"Hmm."

00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:45.615
"Did you hear me?"

00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:47.878
Silence. (Laughter)

00:04:47.878 --> 00:04:49.250
"Can you listen to me?"

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.622
&amp;quot;Hmm.&amp;quot;

00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:52.578
So we had a real issue with communicating,

00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:54.846
and we were just not communicating,

00:04:54.846 --> 00:04:57.860
until one day I had this epiphany.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.523
I texted her. (Laughter)

00:05:00.523 --> 00:05:02.841
I got an instant response.

00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:04.526
I said, no, that must have been by accident.

00:05:04.526 --> 00:05:05.613
She must have thought, you know,

00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:07.900
some friend of hers was calling her.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.997
So I texted her again. Boom, another response.

00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:12.806
I said, this is great.

00:05:12.806 --> 00:05:14.862
And so since then, our life has changed.

00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:16.420
I text her, she responds.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.922
It's just been absolutely great.

00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:24.777
(Applause)

00:05:24.777 --> 00:05:26.747
So our millennial generation

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:28.381
is built differently.

00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:30.882
Now, I'm older, and my
youthful looks might belie that,

00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:34.738
but I'm not in the millennial generation.

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:36.370
But our kids are really different.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.229
The millennial generation is completely comfortable

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.469
with online technology.

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.498
So why are we fighting it in the classroom?

00:05:41.498 --> 00:05:43.131
Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it.

00:05:43.131 --> 00:05:44.820
In fact, I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.469
I can't text very well --

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:48.636
but I'm willing to bet that with evolution,

00:05:48.636 --> 00:05:50.881
our kids and their grandchildren

00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:52.711
will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs

00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:54.094
to text much better,

00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:56.954
that evolution will fix all of that stuff.

00:05:56.954 --> 00:05:58.725
But what if we embraced technology,

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:01.329
embraced the millennial generation's

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:02.594
natural predilections,

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:05.639
and really think about creating
these online technologies,

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.073
blend them into their lives.

00:06:07.073 --> 00:06:08.896
So here's what we can do.

00:06:08.896 --> 00:06:11.388
So rather than driving our kids into a classroom,

00:06:11.388 --> 00:06:13.960
herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning --

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.718
I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,

00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:18.800
so why are we forcing our kids to do that?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.974
So instead what you do

00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:21.994
is you have them watch videos

00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:23.805
and do interactive exercises

00:06:23.805 --> 00:06:26.494
in the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,

00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:28.355
in the dining room, in the bathroom,

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:30.932
wherever they're most creative.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.927
Then they come into the classroom

00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:36.351
for some in-person interaction.

00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.188
They can have discussions amongst themselves.

00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:39.764
They can solve problems together.

00:06:39.764 --> 00:06:40.910
They can work with the professor

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.904
and have the professor answer their questions.

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:47.767
In fact, with edX, when we
were teaching our first course

00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:50.193
on circuits and electronics around the world,

00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:52.572
this was happening unbeknownst to us.

00:06:52.572 --> 00:06:54.111
Two high school teachers

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.793
at the Sant High School in Mongolia

00:06:57.793 --> 00:06:59.940
had flipped their classroom,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.219
and they were using our video lectures

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:04.092
and interactive exercises,

00:07:04.092 --> 00:07:05.703
where the learners in the high school,

00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:07.288
15-year-olds, mind you,

00:07:07.288 --> 00:07:09.122
would go and do these things in their own homes

00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:10.469
and they would come into class,

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:12.405
and as you see from this image here,

00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:13.491
they would interact with each other

00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.828
and do some physical laboratory work.

00:07:15.828 --> 00:07:17.149
And the only way we discovered this

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:18.572
was they wrote a blog

00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:22.595
and we happened to stumble upon that blog.

00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:24.702
We were also doing other pilots.

00:07:24.702 --> 00:07:27.184
So we did a pilot experimental blended courses,

00:07:27.184 --> 00:07:30.156
working with San Jose State University in California,

00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:32.003
again, with the circuits and electronics course.

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:34.471
You'll hear that a lot. That course has become

00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:37.947
sort of like our petri dish of learning.

00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:40.215
So there, the students would, again,

00:07:40.215 --> 00:07:42.942
the instructors flipped the classroom,

00:07:42.942 --> 00:07:44.663
blended online and in person,

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:46.971
and the results were staggering.

00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:49.613
Now don't take these results to the bank just yet.

00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:52.101
Just wait a little bit longer as we
experiment with this some more,

00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:54.262
but the early results are incredible.

00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:56.659
So traditionally, semester upon semester,

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.000
for the past several years, this course,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.689
again, a hard course,

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.805
had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent

00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:05.305
every semester.

00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:08.003
With this blended class late last year,

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:11.984
the failure rate fell to nine percent.

00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:15.747
So the results can be extremely, extremely good.

00:08:15.747 --> 00:08:18.974
Now before we go too far into this,

00:08:18.974 --> 00:08:21.626
I'd like to spend some time discussing

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.775
some key ideas.

00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:23.986
What are some key ideas

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:26.843
that makes all of this work?

00:08:26.843 --> 00:08:29.070
One idea is active learning.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.510
The idea here is, rather than have students

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.696
walk into class and watch lectures,

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:36.738
we replace this with what we call lessons.

00:08:36.738 --> 00:08:38.982
Lessons are interleaved sequences

00:08:38.982 --> 00:08:41.663
of videos and interactive exercises.

00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:44.842
So a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video

00:08:44.842 --> 00:08:47.882
and follow that with an interactive exercise.

00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:51.027
Think of this as the ultimate
Socratization of education.

00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:53.007
You teach by asking questions.

00:08:53.007 --> 00:08:54.511
And this is a form of learning

00:08:54.511 --> 00:08:55.788
called active learning,

00:08:55.788 --> 00:08:59.067
and really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,

00:08:59.067 --> 00:09:00.585
by Craik and Lockhart,

00:09:00.585 --> 00:09:02.106
where they said and discovered

00:09:02.106 --> 00:09:04.486
that learning and retention really relates strongly

00:09:04.486 --> 00:09:06.235
to the depth of mental processing.

00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:07.727
Students learn much better

00:09:07.727 --> 00:09:10.915
when they are interacting with the material.

00:09:10.915 --> 00:09:13.693
The second idea is self-pacing.

00:09:13.693 --> 00:09:15.329
Now, when I went to a lecture hall,

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:16.619
and if you were like me,

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:18.585
by the fifth minute I would lose the professor.

00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:22.165
I wasn't all that smart, and I would
be scrambling, taking notes,

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:25.356
and then I would lose the lecture
for the rest of the hour.

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.826
Instead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:31.694
we offer videos and interactive
engagements to students?

00:09:31.694 --> 00:09:33.425
They can hit the pause button.

00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:35.916
They can rewind the professor.

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:39.015
Heck, they can even mute the professor.

00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:41.069
So this form of self-pacing

00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:43.694
can be very helpful to learning.

00:09:43.694 --> 00:09:47.048
The third idea that we have is instant feedback.

00:09:47.048 --> 00:09:48.525
With instant feedback,

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:50.380
the computer grades exercises.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.675
I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.969
Your computer is grading all the exercises.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.503
And we've all submitted homeworks,

00:09:56.503 --> 00:09:58.544
and your grades come back two weeks later,

00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:00.168
you've forgotten all about it.

00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:02.245
I don't think I've still received
some of my homeworks

00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:03.730
from my undergraduate days.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.077
Some are never graded.

00:10:05.077 --> 00:10:06.571
So with instant feedback,

00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:08.061
students can try to apply answers.

00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:10.470
If they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.118
They can try it again and try it again,

00:10:12.118 --> 00:10:14.051
and this really becomes much more engaging.

00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:15.634
They get the instant feedback,

00:10:15.634 --> 00:10:18.553
and this little green check mark that you see here

00:10:18.553 --> 00:10:22.143
is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.

00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:25.031
Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night

00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:28.491
dreaming of the green check mark.

00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:30.293
In fact, one of our learners

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:33.074
who took the circuits course early last year,

00:10:33.074 --> 00:10:35.006
he then went on to take a software course

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:37.307
from Berkeley at the end of the year,

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:39.453
and this is what the learner had to say

00:10:39.453 --> 00:10:40.725
on our discussion board

00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:42.251
when he just started that course

00:10:42.251 --> 00:10:44.772
about the green check mark:

00:10:44.772 --> 00:10:46.829
&amp;quot;Oh god; have I missed you.&amp;quot;

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:49.527
When's the last time you've seen students

00:10:49.527 --> 00:10:53.988
posting comments like this about homework?

00:10:53.988 --> 00:10:56.384
My colleague Ed Bertschinger,

00:10:56.384 --> 00:10:58.554
who heads up the physics department at MIT,

00:10:58.554 --> 00:11:01.398
has this to say about instant feedback:

00:11:01.398 --> 00:11:04.399
He indicated that instant feedback

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:10.174
turns teaching moments into learning outcomes.

00:11:10.174 --> 00:11:12.466
The next big idea is gamification.

00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:14.367
You know, all learners engage really well

00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:15.876
with interactive videos and so on.

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:17.141
You know, they would sit down and shoot

00:11:17.141 --> 00:11:19.485
alien spaceships all day long until they get it.

00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:22.272
So we applied these gamification
techniques to learning,

00:11:22.272 --> 00:11:24.495
and we can build these online laboratories.

00:11:24.495 --> 00:11:26.742
How do you teach creativity?
How do you teach design?

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.421
We can do this through online labs

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.698
and use computing power

00:11:29.698 --> 00:11:31.287
to build these online labs.

00:11:31.287 --> 00:11:33.675
So as this little video shows here,

00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:35.140
you can engage students

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.747
much like they design with Legos.

00:11:36.747 --> 00:11:38.665
So here, the learners are building a circuit

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:40.556
with Lego-like ease.

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:44.647
And this can also be graded by the computer.

00:11:44.647 --> 00:11:47.581
Fifth is peer learning.

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:50.416
So here, we use discussion forums and discussions

00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:52.516
and Facebook-like interaction

00:11:52.516 --> 00:11:54.380
not as a distraction,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.227
but to really help students learn.

00:11:57.227 --> 00:11:58.944
Let me tell you a story.

00:11:58.944 --> 00:12:02.170
When we did our circuits course

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.036
for the 155,000 students,

00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:05.701
I didn't sleep for three nights

00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:07.588
leading up to the launch of the course.

00:12:07.588 --> 00:12:10.147
I told my TAs, okay, 24/7,

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:11.413
we're going to be up

00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:13.287
monitoring the forum, answering questions.

00:12:13.287 --> 00:12:15.260
They had answered questions for 100 students.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.121
How do you do that for 150,000?

00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:20.457
So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,

00:12:20.457 --> 00:12:21.678
and I think there's this question

00:12:21.678 --> 00:12:23.649
from a student from Pakistan,

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:24.977
and he asked a question, and I said,

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:26.433
okay, let me go and type up an answer,

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:28.041
I don't type all that fast,

00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:29.605
and I begin typing up the answer,

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:31.299
and before I can finish,

00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:33.973
another student from Egypt
popped in with an answer,

00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:35.891
not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,

00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:37.859
and before I can finish, a student from the U.S.

00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:39.468
had popped in with a different answer.

00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:42.268
And then I sat back, fascinated.

00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:44.215
Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were

00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:46.166
discussing and interacting with each other,

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.684
and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:50.152
having this epiphany,

00:12:50.152 --> 00:12:51.408
and by 4 a.m. in the morning,

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:53.161
they had discovered the right answer.

00:12:53.161 --> 00:12:54.888
And all I had to do was go and bless it,

00:12:54.888 --> 00:12:56.854
"Good answer."

00:12:56.854 --> 00:12:59.206
So this is absolutely amazing,

00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:01.016
where students are learning from each other,

00:13:01.016 --> 00:13:03.833
and they're telling us that they are learning

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.130
by teaching.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.110
Now this is all not just in the future.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.862
This is happening today.

00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:12.179
So we are applying these blended learning pilots

00:13:12.179 --> 00:13:14.920
in a number of universities and 
high schools around the world,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.706
from Tsinghua in China

00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:19.138
to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia

00:13:19.138 --> 00:13:20.749
to Berkeley in California --

00:13:20.749 --> 00:13:22.108
all over the world.

00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:24.132
And these kinds of technologies really help,

00:13:24.132 --> 00:13:25.681
the blended model can really help

00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:27.779
revolutionize education.

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:31.190
It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.870
the business aspect.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.186
We can also license these MOOC courses

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:36.925
to other universities,

00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:39.489
and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,

00:13:39.489 --> 00:13:41.878
where the university that
licenses it with the professor

00:13:41.878 --> 00:13:43.715
can use these online courses

00:13:43.715 --> 00:13:45.916
like the next-generation textbook.

00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:48.371
They can use as much or as little as they like,

00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:53.857
and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.

00:13:53.857 --> 00:13:55.907
Finally, I would like to have you

00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:58.748
dream with me for a little bit.

00:13:58.748 --> 00:14:02.917
I would like us to really reimagine education.

00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:07.042
We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.

00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:09.717
We have to move from books to tablets

00:14:09.717 --> 00:14:11.543
like the Aakash in India

00:14:11.543 --> 00:14:13.891
or the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.

00:14:13.891 --> 00:14:15.898
The Aakash is 40 dollars.

00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:18.812
We have to move from
bricks-and-mortar school buildings

00:14:18.812 --> 00:14:21.433
to digital dormitories.

00:14:21.433 --> 00:14:22.881
But I think at the end of the day,

00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:25.123
I think we will still need one lecture hall

00:14:25.123 --> 00:14:27.685
in our universities.

00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:30.509
Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren

00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:33.904
that your grandparents sat in that room

00:14:33.904 --> 00:14:37.128
in neat little rows like cornstalks

00:14:37.128 --> 00:14:39.681
and watched this professor at the end

00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:42.328
talk about content and, you know,

00:14:42.328 --> 00:14:44.975
you didn't even have a rewind button?

00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:47.203
Thank you.

00:14:47.203 --> 00:14:49.194
(Applause)

00:14:49.194 --> 00:14:55.945
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
