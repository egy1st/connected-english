00:00:03.393 --> 00:00:04.621
Science,

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.958
science has allowed us to know so much

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:10.984
about the far reaches of the universe,

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:14.179
which is at the same time tremendously important

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.245
and extremely remote,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.704
and yet much, much closer,

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:20.795
much more directly related to us,

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.263
there are many things we don't really understand.

00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:25.392
And one of them is the extraordinary

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.718
social complexity of the animals around us,

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:30.734
and today I want to tell you a few stories

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.742
of animal complexity.

00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:36.092
But first, what do we call complexity?

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:37.579
What is complex?

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.006
Well, complex is not complicated.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.454
Something complicated comprises many small parts,

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:46.884
all different, and each of them

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.003
has its own precise role in the machinery.

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.814
On the opposite, a complex system

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:55.455
is made of many, many similar parts,

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.463
and it is their interaction

00:00:57.463 --> 00:01:00.783
that produces a globally coherent behavior.

00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:04.619
Complex systems have many interacting parts

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.045
which behave according to simple, individual rules,

00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:11.394
and this results in emergent properties.

00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:13.282
The behavior of the system as a whole

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:14.950
cannot be predicted

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.102
from the individual rules only.

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:18.912
As Aristotle wrote,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.972
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:24.434
But from Aristotle, let's move onto

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:28.124
a more concrete example of complex systems.

00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:30.080
These are Scottish terriers.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.831
In the beginning, the system is disorganized.

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.632
Then comes a perturbation: milk.

00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:41.482
Every individual starts pushing in one direction

00:01:41.482 --> 00:01:44.791
and this is what happens.

00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:47.617
The pinwheel is an emergent property

00:01:47.617 --> 00:01:49.520
of the interactions between puppies

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.430
whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.037
and therefore to push in a random direction.

00:01:57.037 --> 00:02:01.012
So it's all about finding the simple rules

00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:03.770
from which complexity emerges.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.710
I call this simplifying complexity,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.845
and it's what we do at the chair of systems design

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:10.822
at ETH Zurich.

00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:14.527
We collect data on animal populations,

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:18.338
analyze complex patterns, try to explain them.

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.957
It requires physicists who work with biologists,

00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:23.680
with mathematicians and computer scientists,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.500
and it is their interaction that produces

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.214
cross-boundary competence

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.792
to solve these problems.

00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:32.064
So again, the whole is greater

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:33.464
than the sum of the parts.

00:02:33.464 --> 00:02:35.614
In a way, collaboration

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:39.105
is another example of a complex system.

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:40.981
And you may be asking yourself

00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:43.798
which side I'm on, biology or physics?

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:45.909
In fact, it's a little different,

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.498
and to explain, I need to tell you

00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:49.840
a short story about myself.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.567
When I was a child,

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:55.676
I loved to build stuff, to
create complicated machines.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.413
So I set out to study electrical engineering

00:02:58.413 --> 00:02:59.965
and robotics,

00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:02.058
and my end-of-studies project

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:04.984
was about building a robot called ER-1 --

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.914
it looked like thisâ€”

00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:09.285
that would collect information from its environment

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:12.783
and proceed to follow a white line on the ground.

00:03:12.783 --> 00:03:15.162
It was very, very complicated,

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:18.146
but it worked beautifully in our test room,

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:21.599
and on demo day, professors had 
assembled to grade the project.

00:03:21.607 --> 00:03:24.509
So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room.

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.819
It turned out, the light in that room

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.638
was slightly different.

00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:30.969
The robot's vision system got confused.

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.730
At the first bend in the line,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.469
it left its course, and crashed into a wall.

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.556
We had spent weeks building it,

00:03:38.556 --> 00:03:40.229
and all it took to destroy it

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.885
was a subtle change in the color of the light

00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:44.481
in the room.

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:45.996
That's when I realized that

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:48.323
the more complicated you make a machine,

00:03:48.323 --> 00:03:50.362
the more likely that it will fail

00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:52.925
due to something absolutely unexpected.

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:54.755
And I decided that, in fact,

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:57.768
I didn't really want to create complicated stuff.

00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:00.710
I wanted to understand complexity,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.698
the complexity of the world around us

00:04:02.698 --> 00:04:05.103
and especially in the animal kingdom.

00:04:05.103 --> 00:04:08.423
Which brings us to bats.

00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:11.474
Bechstein's bats are a common
species of European bats.

00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:12.887
They are very social animals.

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:16.178
Mostly they roost, or sleep, together.

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:17.857
And they live in maternity colonies,

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.397
which means that every spring,

00:04:19.397 --> 00:04:22.655
the females meet after the winter hibernation,

00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:24.744
and they stay together for about six months

00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:27.230
to rear their young,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.035
and they all carry a very small chip,

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.906
which means that every time one of them

00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:34.963
enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes,

00:04:34.963 --> 00:04:36.606
we know where she is,

00:04:36.606 --> 00:04:37.775
and more importantly,

00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:40.338
we know with whom she is.

00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:44.032
So I study roosting associations in bats,

00:04:44.032 --> 00:04:46.477
and this is what it looks like.

00:04:46.477 --> 00:04:48.919
During the day, the bats roost

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.223
in a number of sub-groups in different boxes.

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:53.152
It could be that on one day,

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:55.372
the colony is split between two boxes,

00:04:55.372 --> 00:04:56.672
but on another day,

00:04:56.672 --> 00:04:58.913
it could be together in a single box,

00:04:58.913 --> 00:05:01.229
or split between three or more boxes,

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.156
and that all seems rather erratic, really.

00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:07.359
It's called fission-fusion dynamics,

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:09.072
the property for an animal group

00:05:09.072 --> 00:05:11.250
of regularly splitting and merging

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.911
into different subgroups.

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.473
So what we do is take all these data

00:05:15.473 --> 00:05:17.135
from all these different days

00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:18.639
and pool them together

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.256
to extract a long-term association pattern

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:23.761
by applying techniques with network analysis

00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.382
to get a complete picture

00:05:25.382 --> 00:05:27.919
of the social structure of the colony.

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.184
Okay? So that's what this picture looks like.

00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:34.578
In this network, all the circles

00:05:34.578 --> 00:05:37.355
are nodes, individual bats,

00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:38.938
and the lines between them

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:42.602
are social bonds, associations between individuals.

00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:45.280
It turns out this is a very interesting picture.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.262
This bat colony is organized

00:05:47.262 --> 00:05:49.130
in two different communities

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.969
which cannot be predicted

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.218
from the daily fission-fusion dynamics.

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:56.768
We call them cryptic social units.

00:05:56.768 --> 00:05:58.384
Even more interesting, in fact:

00:05:58.384 --> 00:06:00.748
Every year, around October,

00:06:00.748 --> 00:06:02.309
the colony splits up,

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:05.007
and all bats hibernate separately,

00:06:05.007 --> 00:06:06.468
but year after year,

00:06:06.468 --> 00:06:09.541
when the bats come together again in the spring,

00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:12.131
the communities stay the same.

00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:14.851
So these bats remember their friends

00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:16.681
for a really long time.

00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:19.155
With a brain the size of a peanut,

00:06:19.155 --> 00:06:21.280
they maintain individualized,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.422
long-term social bonds,

00:06:23.422 --> 00:06:25.146
We didn't know that was possible.

00:06:25.146 --> 00:06:26.905
We knew that primates

00:06:26.905 --> 00:06:29.473
and elephants and dolphins could do that,

00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:32.101
but compared to bats, they have huge brains.

00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:34.500
So how could it be

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.451
that the bats maintain this complex,

00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:38.139
stable social structure

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.671
with such limited cognitive abilities?

00:06:41.671 --> 00:06:44.560
And this is where complexity brings an answer.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.701
To understand this system,

00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.498
we built a computer model of roosting,

00:06:49.498 --> 00:06:51.516
based on simple, individual rules,

00:06:51.516 --> 00:06:53.951
and simulated thousands and thousands of days

00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:55.970
in the virtual bat colony.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.094
It's a mathematical model,

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.048
but it's not complicated.

00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:03.146
What the model told us is that, in a nutshell,

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:06.332
each bat knows a few other colony members

00:07:06.332 --> 00:07:08.820
as her friends, and is just slightly more likely

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.330
to roost in a box with them.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.774
Simple, individual rules.

00:07:13.774 --> 00:07:15.486
This is all it takes to explain

00:07:15.486 --> 00:07:17.875
the social complexity of these bats.

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.593
But it gets better.

00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:22.441
Between 2010 and 2011,

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:25.894
the colony lost more than two thirds of its members,

00:07:25.894 --> 00:07:28.880
probably due to the very cold winter.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.024
The next spring, it didn't form two communities

00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:33.295
like every year,

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:35.498
which may have led the whole colony to die

00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:37.593
because it had become too small.

00:07:37.593 --> 00:07:42.966
Instead, it formed a single, cohesive social unit,

00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:45.698
which allowed the colony to survive that season

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.802
and thrive again in the next two years.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.580
What we know is that the bats

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.487
are not aware that their colony is doing this.

00:07:53.487 --> 00:07:57.033
All they do is follow simple association rules,

00:07:57.033 --> 00:07:58.382
and from this simplicity

00:07:58.382 --> 00:08:00.823
emerges social complexity

00:08:00.823 --> 00:08:03.663
which allows the colony to be resilient

00:08:03.663 --> 00:08:06.644
against dramatic changes
in the population structure.

00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:09.338
And I find this incredible.

00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:11.422
Now I want to tell you another story,

00:08:11.422 --> 00:08:12.977
but for this we have to travel from Europe

00:08:12.977 --> 00:08:16.025
to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:18.052
This is where meerkats live.

00:08:18.052 --> 00:08:19.552
I'm sure you know meerkats.

00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:21.658
They're fascinating creatures.

00:08:21.658 --> 00:08:24.647
They live in groups with a
very strict social hierarchy.

00:08:24.647 --> 00:08:26.106
There is one dominant pair,

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:27.488
and many subordinates,

00:08:27.488 --> 00:08:29.202
some acting as sentinels,

00:08:29.202 --> 00:08:30.539
some acting as babysitters,

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.436
some teaching pups, and so on.

00:08:32.436 --> 00:08:35.757
What we do is put very small GPS collars

00:08:35.757 --> 00:08:37.282
on these animals

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:39.157
to study how they move together,

00:08:39.157 --> 00:08:42.874
and what this has to do with their social structure.

00:08:42.874 --> 00:08:44.364
And there's a very interesting example

00:08:44.364 --> 00:08:47.080
of collective movement in meerkats.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.447
In the middle of the reserve which they live in

00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:50.656
lies a road.

00:08:50.656 --> 00:08:53.889
On this road there are cars, so it's dangerous.

00:08:53.889 --> 00:08:56.173
But the meerkats have to cross it

00:08:56.173 --> 00:08:58.747
to get from one feeding place to another.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:03.498
So we asked, how exactly do they do this?

00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:05.334
We found that the dominant female

00:09:05.334 --> 00:09:07.955
is mostly the one who leads the group to the road,

00:09:07.955 --> 00:09:11.227
but when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road,

00:09:11.227 --> 00:09:13.578
she gives way to the subordinates,

00:09:13.578 --> 00:09:15.355
a manner of saying,

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:18.037
"Go ahead, tell me if it's safe."

00:09:18.037 --> 00:09:19.701
What I didn't know, in fact,

00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:22.843
was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow

00:09:22.843 --> 00:09:25.768
for this change at the edge of the group to happen

00:09:25.768 --> 00:09:29.618
and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it.

00:09:29.618 --> 00:09:33.609
So I built a model, a model of simulated meerkats

00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:35.522
crossing a simulated road.

00:09:35.522 --> 00:09:37.394
It's a simplistic model.

00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:40.234
Moving meerkats are like random particles

00:09:40.234 --> 00:09:42.456
whose unique rule is one of alignment.

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:44.862
They simply move together.

00:09:44.862 --> 00:09:48.046
When these particles get to the road,

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.988
they sense some kind of obstacle,

00:09:49.988 --> 00:09:52.072
and they bounce against it.

00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:53.228
The only difference

00:09:53.228 --> 00:09:55.270
between the dominant female, here in red,

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.755
and the other individuals,

00:09:56.755 --> 00:09:59.309
is that for her, the height of the obstacle,

00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:01.814
which is in fact the risk perceived from the road,

00:10:01.814 --> 00:10:03.763
is just slightly higher,

00:10:03.763 --> 00:10:05.424
and this tiny difference

00:10:05.424 --> 00:10:07.262
in the individual's rule of movement

00:10:07.262 --> 00:10:09.708
is sufficient to explain what we observe,

00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:12.268
that the dominant female

00:10:12.268 --> 00:10:13.702
leads her group to the road

00:10:13.702 --> 00:10:15.372
and then gives way to the others

00:10:15.372 --> 00:10:18.235
for them to cross first.

00:10:18.235 --> 00:10:21.886
George Box, who was an English statistician,

00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:24.848
once wrote, "All models are false,

00:10:24.848 --> 00:10:26.907
but some models are useful."

00:10:26.907 --> 00:10:30.104
And in fact, this model is obviously false,

00:10:30.104 --> 00:10:34.072
because in reality, meerkats are
anything but random particles.

00:10:34.072 --> 00:10:35.709
But it's also useful,

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:38.458
because it tells us that extreme simplicity

00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:41.816
in movement rules at the individual level

00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:44.167
can result in a great deal of complexity

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:46.105
at the level of the group.

00:10:46.105 --> 00:10:50.161
So again, that's simplifying complexity.

00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:51.609
I would like to conclude

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.426
on what this means for the whole species.

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:56.090
When the dominant female

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.656
gives way to a subordinate,

00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:59.773
it's not out of courtesy.

00:10:59.773 --> 00:11:01.280
In fact, the dominant female

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.799
is extremely important for the cohesion of the group.

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:07.311
If she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk.

00:11:07.311 --> 00:11:09.547
So this behavior of risk avoidance

00:11:09.547 --> 00:11:12.348
is a very old evolutionary response.

00:11:12.348 --> 00:11:16.217
These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.450
that is thousands of generations old,

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.864
and they're adapting it to a modern risk,

00:11:20.864 --> 00:11:24.189
in this case a road built by humans.

00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:26.584
They adapt very simple rules,

00:11:26.584 --> 00:11:28.873
and the resulting complex behavior

00:11:28.873 --> 00:11:31.829
allows them to resist human encroachment

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:34.277
into their natural habitat.

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.079
In the end,

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:38.779
it may be bats which change their social structure

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:41.163
in response to a population crash,

00:11:41.163 --> 00:11:42.562
or it may be meerkats

00:11:42.562 --> 00:11:45.764
who show a novel adaptation to a human road,

00:11:45.764 --> 00:11:48.449
or it may be another species.

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:51.242
My message here -- and it's not a complicated one,

00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:54.006
but a simple one of wonder and hope --

00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:57.099
my message here is that animals

00:11:57.099 --> 00:11:59.523
show extraordinary social complexity,

00:11:59.523 --> 00:12:01.964
and this allows them to adapt

00:12:01.964 --> 00:12:05.445
and respond to changes in their environment.

00:12:05.445 --> 00:12:08.213
In three words, in the animal kingdom,

00:12:08.213 --> 00:12:10.987
simplicity leads to complexity

00:12:10.987 --> 00:12:12.470
which leads to resilience.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.754
Thank you.

00:12:14.754 --> 00:12:21.434
(Applause)

00:12:30.694 --> 00:12:32.647
Dania Gerhardt: Thank you very much, Nicolas,

00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:35.926
for this great start. Little bit nervous?

00:12:35.926 --> 00:12:37.570
Nicolas Perony: I'm okay, thanks.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.030
DG: Okay, great. I'm sure a 
lot of people in the audience

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.894
somehow tried to make associations

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.718
between the animals you were talking about --

00:12:43.718 --> 00:12:45.774
the bats, meerkats -- and humans.

00:12:45.774 --> 00:12:46.982
You brought some examples:

00:12:46.982 --> 00:12:48.717
The females are the social ones,

00:12:48.717 --> 00:12:50.430
the females are the dominant ones,

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.103
I'm not sure who thinks how.

00:12:52.103 --> 00:12:54.998
But is it okay to do these associations?

00:12:54.998 --> 00:12:57.798
Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard

00:12:57.798 --> 00:13:01.071
that can be valid across all species?

00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:02.674
NP: Well, I would say there are also

00:13:02.674 --> 00:13:04.626
counter-examples to these stereotypes.

00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:07.766
For examples, in sea horses or in koalas, in fact,

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:11.464
it is the males who take care of the young always.

00:13:11.464 --> 00:13:16.505
And the lesson is that it's often difficult,

00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:18.257
and sometimes even a bit dangerous,

00:13:18.257 --> 00:13:20.929
to draw parallels between humans and animals.

00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:23.035
So that's it.

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:25.881
DG: Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.

00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:27.961
Thank you, Nicolas Perony.
