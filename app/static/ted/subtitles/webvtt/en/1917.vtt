Conficker fitters,

(Applause)

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:56.033
Maya Penn: I've been drawing ever
since I could hold a crayon,

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.116
and I've been making animated flip books

00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:00.056
since I was three years old.

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:03.250
At that age, I also learned
about what an animator was.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.583
There was a program on TV about jobs

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.345
most kids don't know about.

00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:09.101
When I understood that an animator

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.933
makes the cartoons I saw on TV,

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:14.714
I immediately said, "That's what I want to be."

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:17.016
I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud,

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:20.900
but that was a greatly defining moment in my life.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.227
Animation and art has always been my first love.

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:27.350
It was my love for technology that sparked the idea

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.216
for "Malicious Dishes."

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:30.955
There was a virus on my computer,

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:32.602
and I was trying to get rid of it,

00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:34.478
and all of a sudden, I just thought,

00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:37.418
what if viruses have their own
little world inside the computer?

00:01:37.418 --> 00:01:39.537
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:41.130
and do virusy things?

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.502
And thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born.

00:01:44.502 --> 00:01:46.645
At four years old, my dad showed me

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:49.513
how to take apart a computer
and put it back together again.

00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:52.123
That started my love for technology.

00:01:52.123 --> 00:01:55.154
I built my first website myself in HTML,

00:01:55.154 --> 00:01:57.671
and I'm learning JavaScript and Python.

00:01:57.671 --> 00:01:59.410
I'm also working on an animated series

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.665
called "The Pollinators."

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:02.881
It's about bees and other
pollinators in our environment

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.250
and why they're so important.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.860
If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.769
then all creatures, including ourselves,

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.285
that depend on these plants, would starve.

00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:14.493
So I decided to take these cool creatures

00:02:14.493 --> 00:02:18.312
and make a superhero team.

00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:22.867
(Applause)

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:29.376
(Foot stomp)

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:33.517
(Music)

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:38.154
(Roar)

00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:40.631
Pollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known!

00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:43.049
I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.820
(Music)

00:02:55.032 --> 00:02:57.524
Thank you. (Applause)

00:02:57.524 --> 00:03:00.602
All of my animations start with ideas,

00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:04.337
but what are ideas?

00:03:04.337 --> 00:03:07.340
Ideas can spark a movement.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.009
Ideas are opportunities and innovation.

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.628
Ideas truly are what make the world go round.

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.055
If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:19.038
where we are now with technology, medicine,

00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:23.125
art, culture, and how we even live our lives.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:25.387
At eight years old, I took my ideas

00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:28.331
and started my own business called Maya's Ideas,

00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:31.107
and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:32.853
(Laughter)

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:36.304
And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.

00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:38.974
I'm 13 now, and although I started my business

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:40.386
in 2008,

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:43.696
my artistic journey started way before then.

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:45.986
I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to

00:03:45.986 --> 00:03:49.006
incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.

00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:51.009
I would find different fabrics around the house,

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.264
and say, &amp;quot;This could be a scarf or a hat,&amp;quot;

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:56.374
and I had all these ideas for designs.

00:03:56.374 --> 00:03:58.227
I noticed when I wore my creations,

00:03:58.227 --> 00:03:59.675
people would stop me and say,

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:01.732
"Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?"

00:04:01.732 --> 00:04:04.915
And I thought, I can start my own business.

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:06.789
Now I didn't have any business plans

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.557
at only eight years old.

00:04:08.557 --> 00:04:10.584
I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:11.839
that were safe for the environment

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:13.877
and I wanted to give back.

00:04:13.877 --> 00:04:15.700
My mom taught me how to sew,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.697
and on my back porch, I would sit and make

00:04:17.697 --> 00:04:19.218
little headbands out of ribbon,

00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:21.818
and I would write down the names
and the price of each item.

00:04:21.818 --> 00:04:23.888
I started making more items like hats,

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.094
scarves and bags.

00:04:26.094 --> 00:04:28.489
Soon, my items began selling all over the world,

00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:31.318
and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia,

00:04:31.318 --> 00:04:33.925
Canada and more.

00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:36.509
Now, I had a lot to learn about my business,

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.184
like branding and marketing,

00:04:38.184 --> 00:04:39.942
staying engaged with my customers,

00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:43.423
and seeing what sold the most and the least.

00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:45.837
Soon, my business really started to take off.

00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:50.084
Then one day, Forbes magazine 
contacted me when I was 10 years old.

00:04:50.084 --> 00:04:51.677
(Laughter)

00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:54.014
They wanted to feature me and my company

00:04:54.014 --> 00:04:56.036
in their article.

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:58.117
Now a lot of people ask me,

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:00.543
why is your business eco-friendly?

00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:03.067
I've had a passion for protecting the environment

00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:05.108
and its creatures since I was little.

00:05:05.108 --> 00:05:07.025
My parents taught me at an early age

00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:10.319
about giving back and being a
good steward to the environment.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.385
I heard about how the dyes in some clothing

00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:14.531
or the process of even making the items

00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.110
was harmful to the people and the planet,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.259
so I started doing my own research,

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.364
and I discovered that even
after dyeing has being completed,

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.390
there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.004
on the environment.

00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:27.987
For example, the grinding of materials,

00:05:27.987 --> 00:05:30.718
or the dumping of dried powder materials.

00:05:30.718 --> 00:05:32.418
These actions can pollute the air,

00:05:32.418 --> 00:05:36.181
making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.

00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:37.645
So when I started my business,

00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:40.001
I knew two things:

00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:42.713
All of my items had to be eco-friendly,

00:05:42.713 --> 00:05:44.982
and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made

00:05:44.982 --> 00:05:46.642
went to local and global charities

00:05:46.642 --> 00:05:48.719
and environmental organizations.

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.587
(Applause)

00:05:52.587 --> 00:05:55.136
I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs

00:05:55.136 --> 00:05:57.398
that not only seeks to have a successful business,

00:05:57.398 --> 00:06:00.174
but also a sustainable future.

00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:02.163
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers

00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:04.993
without compromising the
ability of future generations

00:06:04.993 --> 00:06:07.581
to live in a greener tomorrow.

00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.180
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.636
and that makes me even more passionate to save it.

00:06:12.636 --> 00:06:15.014
But it's never enough to just
to get it through your heads

00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:17.196
about the things that are happening in our world.

00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:19.496
It takes to get it through your hearts,

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:21.104
because when you get it through your heart,

00:06:21.104 --> 00:06:23.275
that is when movements are sparked.

00:06:23.275 --> 00:06:24.574
That is when opportunities

00:06:24.574 --> 00:06:26.246
and innovation are created,

00:06:26.246 --> 00:06:29.279
and that is why ideas come to life.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:34.306
Thank you, and peace and blessings.

00:06:34.312 --> 00:06:39.944
(Applause)

00:06:39.944 --> 00:06:42.715
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:46.015
Pat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about

00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:48.838
the amazing parents who are behind

00:06:48.838 --> 00:06:51.055
this incredible woman. Where are they?

00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:54.053
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah!

00:06:54.053 --> 00:06:57.807
(Applause)
