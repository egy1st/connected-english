00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:03.727
The urban explosion

00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:07.952
of the last years of economic boom

00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:11.463
also produced dramatic marginalization,

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:13.737
resulting in the explosion of slums

00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:16.352
in many parts of the world.

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:19.599
This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.434
surrounded by sectors of poverty

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:25.816
and the socioeconomic inequalities
they have engendered

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:29.378
is really at the center of today's urban crisis.

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:31.736
But I want to begin tonight

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:34.174
by suggesting that this urban crisis

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:38.054
is not only economic or environmental.

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:40.952
It's particularly a cultural crisis,

00:00:40.952 --> 00:00:43.837
a crisis of the institutions

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:47.573
unable to reimagine the stupid ways

00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:49.997
which we have been growing,

00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:53.310
unable to challenge the oil-hungry,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.067
selfish urbanization that have perpetuated

00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:59.529
cities based on consumption,

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:04.960
from southern California to New York to Dubai.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.958
So I just really want to share with you a reflection

00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.282
that the future of cities today

00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:13.989
depends less on buildings

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:16.404
and, in fact, depends more

00:01:16.404 --> 00:01:21.154
on the fundamental reorganization
of socioeconomic relations,

00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:23.158
that the best ideas in the shaping

00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:24.988
of the city in the future

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:29.037
will not come from enclaves of economic power

00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:30.415
and abundance,

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:36.046
but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:38.886
from which an urgent imagination

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:42.910
can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.490
And let me illustrate what I mean

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.395
by understanding or engaging sites of conflict

00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:54.476
as harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:57.009
to the Tijuana-San Diego border region,

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.214
which has been the laboratory to
rethink my practice as an architect.

00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:03.726
This is the wall, the border wall,

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:06.237
that separates San Diego and Tijuana,

00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:09.078
Latin America and the United States,

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:11.115
a physical emblem

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:13.765
of exclusionary planning policies

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:16.276
that have perpetuated the division

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:18.709
of communities, jurisdictions

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.844
and resources across the world.

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:24.547
In this border region, we find

00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:26.964
some of the wealthiest real estate,

00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:29.431
as I once found in the edges of San Diego,

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:31.655
barely 20 minutes away

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:35.781
from some of the poorest 
settlements in Latin America.

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:39.144
And while these two cities have the same population,

00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:42.980
San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.742
in the last decades,

00:02:44.742 --> 00:02:48.132
immediately thrusting us to confront

00:02:48.132 --> 00:02:50.179
the tensions and conflicts

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:51.927
between sprawl and density,

00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:53.918
which are at the center of today's discussion

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:56.746
about environmental sustainability.

00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:59.478
So I've been arguing in the last years

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:03.183
that, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.844
to the sprawls of San Diego

00:03:04.844 --> 00:03:08.374
when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,

00:03:08.374 --> 00:03:10.793
that we should pay attention and learn

00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:13.106
from the many migrant communities

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:15.621
on both sides of this border wall

00:03:15.621 --> 00:03:18.958
so that we can translate their informal processes

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.017
of urbanization.

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:24.139
What do I mean by the informal in this case?

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.967
I'm really just talking about

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.623
the compendium of social practices of adaptation

00:03:29.623 --> 00:03:32.462
that enable many of these migrant communities

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:37.016
to transgress imposed political and economic recipes

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.569
of urbanization.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.819
I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.194
of the bottom-up,

00:03:44.194 --> 00:03:47.391
whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana

00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:51.135
that build themselves, in fact,
with the waste of San Diego,

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:53.893
or the many migrant neighborhoods
in Southern California

00:03:53.893 --> 00:03:56.969
that have begun to be retrofitted with difference

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.626
in the last decades.

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:00.834
So I've been interested as an artist

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.418
in the measuring, the observation,

00:04:03.418 --> 00:04:05.690
of many of the trans-border informal flows

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.380
across this border:

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.817
in one direction, from south to north,

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:12.410
the flow of immigrants into the United States,

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.419
and from north to south the flow of waste

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.450
from southern California into Tijuana.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.718
I'm referring to the recycling

00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:24.170
of these old post-war bungalows

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.629
that Mexican contractors bring to the border

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.474
as American developers are disposing of them

00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:33.042
in the process of building a more inflated version

00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:35.118
of suburbia in the last decades.

00:04:35.118 --> 00:04:38.033
So these are houses waiting to cross the border.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.385
Not only people cross the border here,

00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:43.652
but entire chunks of one city move to the next,

00:04:43.652 --> 00:04:47.546
and when these houses are placed
on top of these steel frames,

00:04:47.546 --> 00:04:50.123
they leave the first floor to become the second

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.177
to be in-filled with more house,

00:04:52.177 --> 00:04:53.835
with a small business.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.712
This layering of spaces and economies

00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:58.994
is very interesting to notice.

00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.509
But not only houses, also small debris

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.856
from one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:06.242
Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires

00:05:06.242 --> 00:05:08.871
that are used in the slums to build retaining walls.

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:11.224
But look at what people have done here in conditions

00:05:11.224 --> 00:05:13.452
of socioeconomic emergency.

00:05:13.452 --> 00:05:16.613
They have figured out how to peel off the tire,

00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:18.978
how to thread it and interlock it

00:05:18.978 --> 00:05:23.106
to construct a more efficient retaining wall.

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:26.318
Or the garage doors that are brought

00:05:26.318 --> 00:05:28.826
from San Diego in trucks

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:33.555
to become the new skin of emergency housing

00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:35.394
in many of these slums

00:05:35.394 --> 00:05:37.724
surrounding the edges of Tijuana.

00:05:37.724 --> 00:05:39.140
So while, as an architect,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.067
this is a very compelling thing to witness,

00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:42.761
this creative intelligence,

00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:44.774
I also want to keep myself in check.

00:05:44.774 --> 00:05:46.810
I don't want to romanticize poverty.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.801
I just want to suggest

00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:50.942
that this informal urbanization

00:05:50.942 --> 00:05:54.541
is not just the image of precariousness,

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.623
that informality here, the informal,

00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:02.153
is really a set of socioeconomic
and political procedures

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.862
that we could translate as artists,

00:06:04.862 --> 00:06:07.207
that this is about a bottom-up urbanization

00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:08.732
that performs.

00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:11.558
See here, buildings are not important

00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:13.521
just for their looks,

00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:16.962
but, in fact, they are important for what they can do.

00:06:16.962 --> 00:06:20.061
They truly perform as they transform through time

00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:22.224
and as communities negotiate

00:06:22.224 --> 00:06:25.733
the spaces and boundaries and resources.

00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:28.854
So while waste flows southbound,

00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:31.382
people go north in search of dollars,

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.917
and most of my research has had to do

00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:37.812
with the impact of immigration

00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:40.286
in the alteration of the homogeneity

00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:42.612
of many neighborhoods in the United States,

00:06:42.612 --> 00:06:44.576
particularly in San Diego.

00:06:44.576 --> 00:06:46.961
And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest

00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:49.614
that the future of Southern California

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:52.137
depends on the retrofitting

00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:55.344
of the large urbanization -- I mean, on steroids --

00:06:55.344 --> 00:06:57.832
with the small programs,

00:06:57.832 --> 00:06:59.608
social and economic.

00:06:59.608 --> 00:07:01.713
I'm referring to how immigrants,

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.511
when they come to these neighborhoods,

00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:06.562
they begin to alter the one-dimensionality

00:07:06.562 --> 00:07:08.544
of parcels and properties

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:12.931
into more socially and
economically complex systems,

00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:16.668
as they begin to plug an
informal economy into a garage,

00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:18.982
or as they build an illegal granny flat

00:07:18.982 --> 00:07:21.484
to support an extended family.

00:07:21.484 --> 00:07:26.559
This socioeconomic entrepreneurship

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.662
on the ground within these neighborhoods

00:07:29.662 --> 00:07:33.208
really begins to suggest ways of translating that

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:37.355
into new, inclusive and more equitable

00:07:37.355 --> 00:07:39.394
land use policies.

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:42.125
So many stories emerge from these dynamics

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:44.986
of alteration of space,

00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:46.834
such as &amp;quot;the informal Buddha,&amp;quot;

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:49.407
which tells the story of a small house

00:07:49.407 --> 00:07:52.408
that saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico,

00:07:52.408 --> 00:07:54.412
but it was retrofitted in the end

00:07:54.412 --> 00:07:56.662
into a Buddhist temple,

00:07:56.662 --> 00:07:57.891
and in so doing,

00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:01.147
this small house transforms or mutates

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.845
from a singular dwelling

00:08:02.845 --> 00:08:05.667
into a small, or a micro, socioeconomic

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:09.623
and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood.

00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:12.370
So these action neighborhoods, as I call them,

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.398
really become the inspiration

00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:17.794
to imagine other interpretations of citizenship

00:08:17.794 --> 00:08:19.974
that have less to do, in fact,

00:08:19.974 --> 00:08:21.956
with belonging to the nation-state,

00:08:21.956 --> 00:08:25.802
and more with upholding the notion of citizenship

00:08:25.802 --> 00:08:27.696
as a creative act

00:08:27.696 --> 00:08:30.547
that reorganizes institutional protocols

00:08:30.547 --> 00:08:32.877
in the spaces of the city.

00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:35.732
As an artist, I've been interested, in fact,

00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:38.461
in the visualization of citizenship,

00:08:38.461 --> 00:08:42.026
the gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories,

00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:45.094
in order to narrativize the relationship

00:08:45.094 --> 00:08:48.224
between social processes and spaces.

00:08:48.224 --> 00:08:51.343
This is a story of a group of teenagers

00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:54.266
that one night, a few months ago,

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:57.198
decided to invade this space under the freeway

00:08:57.198 --> 00:09:00.412
to begin constructing their own skateboard park.

00:09:00.412 --> 00:09:03.553
With shovels in hand, they started to dig.

00:09:03.553 --> 00:09:06.410
Two weeks later, the police stopped them.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.111
They barricaded the place,

00:09:08.111 --> 00:09:10.063
and the teenagers were evicted,

00:09:10.063 --> 00:09:12.776
and the teenagers decided to fight back,

00:09:12.776 --> 00:09:15.243
not with bank cards or slogans

00:09:15.243 --> 00:09:17.996
but with constructing a critical process.

00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:20.711
The first thing they did was to recognize

00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:23.691
the specificity of political jurisdiction

00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:26.418
inscribed in that empty space.

00:09:26.418 --> 00:09:28.496
They found out that they had been lucky

00:09:28.496 --> 00:09:30.310
because they had not begun to dig

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.693
under Caltrans territoy.

00:09:32.693 --> 00:09:35.925
Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway,

00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:38.490
so it would have been very
difficult to negotiate with them.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.370
They were lucky, they said, because they began

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.777
to dig under an arm of the freeway

00:09:42.777 --> 00:09:45.040
that belongs to the local municipality.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.939
They were also lucky, they said,

00:09:46.939 --> 00:09:48.677
because they began to dig in a sort of

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:51.019
Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction,

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:54.496
between port authority, airport authority,

00:09:54.496 --> 00:09:57.309
two city districts, and a review board.

00:09:57.309 --> 00:10:00.087
All these red lines are the invisible

00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:02.665
political institutions that were inscribed

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:05.699
in that leftover empty space.

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:08.654
With this knowledge, these teenagers

00:10:08.654 --> 00:10:11.337
as skaters confronted the city.

00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:13.491
They came to the city attorney's office.

00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:15.440
The city attorney told them

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.336
that in order to continue the negotiation

00:10:17.336 --> 00:10:19.279
they had to become an NGO,

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:21.540
and of course they didn't know what an NGO was.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.479
They had to talk to their friends in Seattle

00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:26.390
who had gone through the same experience.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.574
And they began to realize the necessity

00:10:28.574 --> 00:10:30.913
to organize themselves even deeper

00:10:30.913 --> 00:10:35.047
and began to fundraise, to organize budgets,

00:10:35.047 --> 00:10:37.371
to really be aware of all the knowledge

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:40.604
embedded in the urban code in San Diego

00:10:40.604 --> 00:10:42.822
so that they could begin to redefine

00:10:42.822 --> 00:10:46.642
the very meaning of public space in the city,

00:10:46.642 --> 00:10:49.134
expanding it to other categories.

00:10:49.134 --> 00:10:51.769
At the end, the teenagers won the case

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:54.242
with that evidence, and they were able

00:10:54.242 --> 00:10:56.857
to construct their skateboard park

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:58.467
under that freeway.

00:10:58.467 --> 00:11:00.912
Now for many of you, this story

00:11:00.912 --> 00:11:03.152
might seem trivial or naive.

00:11:03.152 --> 00:11:05.101
For me as an architect, it has become

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:07.439
a fundamental narrative,

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:09.292
because it begins to teach me

00:11:09.292 --> 00:11:11.247
that this micro-community

00:11:11.247 --> 00:11:14.739
not only designed another category of public space

00:11:14.739 --> 00:11:18.544
but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:21.641
that were necessary to be inscribed in that space

00:11:21.641 --> 00:11:24.602
for its long-term sustainability.

00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:26.087
They also taught me

00:11:26.087 --> 00:11:28.122
that similar to the migrant communities

00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:29.651
on both sides of the border,

00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:33.368
they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool,

00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:35.172
because they had to produce a process

00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:38.789
that enabled them to reorganize resources

00:11:38.789 --> 00:11:40.623
and the politics of the city.

00:11:40.623 --> 00:11:43.148
In that act, that informal,

00:11:43.148 --> 00:11:45.403
bottom-up act of transgression,

00:11:45.403 --> 00:11:47.552
really began to trickle up

00:11:47.552 --> 00:11:50.670
to transform top-down policy.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.173
Now this journey from the bottom-up

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:57.353
to the transformation of the top-down

00:11:57.353 --> 00:11:59.871
is where I find hope today.

00:11:59.871 --> 00:12:04.120
And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.063
with space and with policy

00:12:07.063 --> 00:12:09.088
in many cities in the world,

00:12:09.088 --> 00:12:11.802
in primarily the urgency

00:12:11.802 --> 00:12:14.076
of a collective imagination

00:12:14.076 --> 00:12:15.550
as these communities

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.957
reimagine their own forms of governance,

00:12:17.957 --> 00:12:20.648
social organization, and infrastructure,

00:12:20.648 --> 00:12:22.576
really is at the center

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:24.664
of the new formation

00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:27.976
of democratic politics of the urban.

00:12:27.976 --> 00:12:31.253
It is, in fact, this that could become the framework

00:12:31.253 --> 00:12:34.274
for producing new social

00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:37.330
and economic justice in the city.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.948
I want to say this and emphasize it,

00:12:38.948 --> 00:12:42.597
because this is the only way I see

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:44.810
that can enable us to move

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.035
from urbanizations of consumption

00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:51.393
to neighborhoods of production today.

00:12:51.393 --> 00:12:53.281
Thank you.

00:12:53.281 --> 00:12:57.281
(Applause)
