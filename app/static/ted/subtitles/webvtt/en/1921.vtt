WEBVTT

00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:03.953
Hi. So today, I'd like to share
some works in progress.

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:06.170
Since we are still realizing these works,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.921
we are largely working within the realm

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.026
of intuition and mystery, still.

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:11.789
So I'm going to try and describe

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.916
some of the experiences that we're looking for

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.639
through each of the works.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.945
So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.940
A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.332
and catches a glimpse of these panels

00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:26.507
in a messy composition on the wall.

00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:29.059
Within seconds, as if the panels have noticed

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.684
the presence of the viewer,

00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:33.728
they appear to panic and sort of get into

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:35.242
a strict symmetry.

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:36.985
(Laughter)

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:39.133
So this is the sketch of the two states.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.791
One is total chaos. The other is absolute order.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.142
And we were interested in seeing how little change

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:47.798
it takes to move from one state to the other state.

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:51.528
This also reminded us of two
very different pictorial traditions.

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:54.081
One is the altar tablets of the 15th century,

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.315
and the other is about 100 years ago,

00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.271
Malevich's abstract compositions.

00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.287
So I'm just going to take you to a video.

00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:02.660
To give you a sense of scale,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.875
the largest panel is about two meters high.

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:07.693
That's about this much. 
And the smallest one is an A4.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:09.905
So a viewer enters the space,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:12.001
and they snap to attention.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.989
And after a while, if the viewer continues

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:15.717
to remain in the space,

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:17.705
the panels will sort of become immune

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:19.418
to the presence of the viewer

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:22.453
and become lax and autonomous again,

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:25.828
until they sort of sense a presence
in the room or a movement,

00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:28.527
when they will again snap to attention.

00:01:28.527 --> 00:01:30.006
(Laughter)

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.405
So here it appears as if it's the viewer

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.650
that's sort of instigating the sense
of order among the panels,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.675
but it could also be the other way around,

00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:40.019
that the panels are so stuck within

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:42.013
their preconditioned behaviors

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:47.541
that they sort of thrust the
viewer with the role of a tyrant.

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.039
So this brings me to a quieter, small work

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.608
called Handheld.

00:01:51.608 --> 00:01:53.342
The viewer sees a piece of paper

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.812
that's mounted on the far end of the wall,

00:01:55.812 --> 00:01:58.440
but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.712
A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,

00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:02.029
that's held on either side

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:03.970
by two small hands

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.237
that appear to be carved with a great deal

00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:09.710
of attention and care from a small block of wood.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.706
The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:15.168
is sort of moving very slightly,

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.029
as if these two hands are trying

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.531
to hold the paper very still

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.710
for a long period of time,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.645
and somehow are not managing to.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.618
So this instability in the movement

00:02:25.618 --> 00:02:29.136
very closely resembles the unsteady nature

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.698
of images seen through a handheld camera.

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:34.386
So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.806
One is through a still camera

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.884
and the other is through a handheld camera.

00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:40.485
And you immediately see how the unsteady nature

00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:43.529
of the video suggests the presence

00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:46.031
of an observer and a subjective point of view.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:47.860
So we've just removed the camera

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.141
and transferred that movement onto the panel.

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:51.658
So here's a video.

00:02:51.674 --> 00:02:54.113
You have to imagine the other hand.
It's not there yet.

00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:56.860
But to us, we're sort of trying to evoke

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.399
a self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:01.990
with outstretched arms

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.492
behind this enormous piece of paper.

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:07.077
That sort of likens it to the amount of strain

00:03:07.077 --> 00:03:09.381
to be at the service of the observer and present

00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:12.631
this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer

00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:15.394
in front of them.

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:17.554
The next work is Decoy.

00:03:17.554 --> 00:03:19.342
This is a cardboard model, so the object

00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:21.246
is about as tall as I am.

00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:23.135
It has a rounded body, two arms,

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.346
and a very tall, head-like antenna,

00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:29.243
and its sole purpose is to
attract attention towards itself.

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.029
So when a viewer passes by,

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.844
it sort of tilts from side to side,

00:03:33.844 --> 00:03:36.017
and moves its arms more and more frantically

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:39.384
as the person gets closer.

00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:41.908
So here is the first test scenario.

00:03:41.908 --> 00:03:43.797
You see the two movements integrated,

00:03:43.797 --> 00:03:45.786
and the object seems to be employing

00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:50.858
its entire being in this expression of desperation.

00:03:50.858 --> 00:03:53.522
But the idea is that once it's
got the person's attention,

00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:57.594
it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.

00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:00.708
(Laughter)

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:03.740
So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.857
It appears to be mass-manufactured

00:04:05.857 --> 00:04:07.559
like it came out of a factory

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:09.836
like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:11.339
Because we are always working

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.747
from a very personal space,

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:15.174
we like how this consumer aesthetic

00:04:15.174 --> 00:04:17.246
sort of depersonalizes the object

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:18.977
and gives us a bit of distance

00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:20.897
in its appearance, at least.

00:04:20.897 --> 00:04:23.237
And so to us this is a kind of sinister being

00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:25.356
which is trying to distract you from the things

00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:26.951
that actually need your attention,

00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:31.701
but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.

00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:33.897
The next work is an object,

00:04:33.897 --> 00:04:36.321
that's also a kind of sound instrument.

00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:38.108
In the shape of an amphitheater

00:04:38.108 --> 00:04:40.048
that's scaled to the size of an audience

00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:42.114
as perceived from somebody from the stage.

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:43.728
So from where I'm standing,

00:04:43.728 --> 00:04:45.390
each of you appears to be this big,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.443
and the audience sort of takes the entire

00:04:47.443 --> 00:04:49.456
field of my vision.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:53.418
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.604
They're mechanically enabled to clap

00:04:55.604 --> 00:04:57.374
of their own free will.

00:04:57.374 --> 00:04:59.407
This means that each of them can decide

00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:00.987
if and when they want to clap,

00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:02.619
how hard, for how long,

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.306
how they want to be influenced by
those around them or influence others,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:10.286
and if they want to contribute to innovation.

00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:12.803
So when the viewer steps in front of the audience,

00:05:12.803 --> 00:05:14.487
there will be a response.

00:05:14.487 --> 00:05:17.085
It could be a few claps or a strong applause,

00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:19.269
and then nothing happens until the viewer

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:22.345
leaves the stage, and again
the audience will respond.

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:24.670
It could be anything from a few feeble claps

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.352
from members in the audience,

00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:30.680
or it could be a very loud ovation.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.642
So to us, I think we're really looking

00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:34.939
at an audience as its own object

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.655
or its own organism

00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:40.405
that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:41.785
an instrument.

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:43.541
So the viewer can play it

00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:45.977
by eliciting quite complex and varied,

00:05:45.977 --> 00:05:48.673
nuanced musical or sound patterns,

00:05:48.673 --> 00:05:50.949
but cannot really provoke the audience

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.337
into any particular kind of response.

00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:56.081
So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness

00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.322
and uneasiness involved.

00:05:58.322 --> 00:06:02.431
It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.

00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:04.551
So here if you see we're quite excited about

00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.373
the image of the head splitting
to form the two hands.

00:06:08.373 --> 00:06:10.284
So here's a small visual animation,

00:06:10.284 --> 00:06:14.616
as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.643
against each other to kind of make sense

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:19.178
of the duality and the tension.

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:21.746
And here is a prototype.

00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:26.548
So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.

00:06:26.548 --> 00:06:29.551
Okay, this is the last work.
It's called the Framerunners.

00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:32.070
It comes out of the idea of a window.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.381
This is an actual window in our studio,

00:06:34.381 --> 00:06:36.299
and as you can see, it's made up of three

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:38.581
different thicknesses of wooden sections.

00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:40.854
So we used the same window vocabulary

00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:43.681
to construct our own frame or grid

00:06:43.681 --> 00:06:45.623
that's suspended in the room and that can

00:06:45.623 --> 00:06:47.436
be viewed from two sides.

00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:50.410
This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.975
They're also made up of three different sizes,

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:55.401
as if to suggest a kind of perspective

00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:58.112
or landscape on the single plain.

00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:00.557
Each of these figures can also run backward

00:07:00.557 --> 00:07:02.122
and forward in the track

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:05.679
and hide behind two adjacent tracks.

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:07.789
So in contrast to this very tight grid,

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:10.210
we wanted to give these figures a very comical

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.299
and slapstick-like quality,

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.138
as if a puppeteer has taken them

00:07:14.138 --> 00:07:16.879
and physically animated them down the path.

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.159
So we like the idea of these figures

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:20.695
sort of skipping along

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:22.783
like they're oblivious and carefree

00:07:22.783 --> 00:07:25.331
and happy-go-lucky and content,

00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:28.531
until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:32.799
and they will hide behind the fastest wall.

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:36.633
So to us, this work also presents
its own contradiction.

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:38.457
These figures are sort of entrapped

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.604
within this very strong grid,

00:07:40.604 --> 00:07:43.360
which is like a prison, but also a fortress,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.294
because it allows them to be oblivious

00:07:45.294 --> 00:07:47.999
and naive and carefree and quite oblivious

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:50.568
of the external world.

00:07:50.568 --> 00:07:53.373
So all these real life qualities that I talk about

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:55.655
are sort of translated to a very specific

00:07:55.655 --> 00:07:57.416
technical configuration,

00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:59.459
and we were very lucky to collaborate

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:02.627
with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:04.892
So you see they extracted the motion cogs

00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:06.982
from our animations and created a wiggle

00:08:06.982 --> 00:08:08.936
that integrated the head-bobbing movement

00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:10.704
and the back-and-forth movement.

00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:12.226
So it's really quite small.

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.518
You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.

00:08:14.518 --> 00:08:16.329
So imagine our excitement when we saw it

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.494
really working in the studio, and here it is.
