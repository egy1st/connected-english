00:00:00.704 --> 00:00:04.236
How many of you love rhythm?

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:06.628
Oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah. (Cheers)

00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:11.581
(Drumming)

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:19.538
I mean, I love all kinds of rhythm.

00:00:19.538 --> 00:00:21.873
I like to play jazz,

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:24.271
a little funk,

00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:28.010
and hip hop,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.434
a little pop, a little R&amp;B,

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:40.480
a little Latin,

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:45.536
African.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.304
And this groove right here,

00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:04.013
comes from the Crescent City,

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:06.460
the old second line.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.970
(Cheers)

00:01:13.942 --> 00:01:19.313
Now, one thing all those rhythms have in common

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:20.998
is math,

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:23.700
and I call it a-rhythm-etic.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.607
Can you repeat after me? A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:30.780
Clayton Cameron: A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.595
CC: A-rhythm a-rhythm.
Audience: A-rhythm a-rhythm.

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.143
CC: A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:01:34.143 --> 00:01:35.580
CC: Yeah.

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:43.929
Now all those styles of rhythm

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.096
are all counted in four

00:01:47.096 --> 00:01:50.983
and then subdivided by three.

00:01:50.983 --> 00:01:52.836
What?

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:56.433
Yeah. Three is a magic number.

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.923
Three is a groovin' number.

00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:02.775
Three is a hip-hop kind of number.

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:05.204
But what does subdividing by three mean?

00:02:05.204 --> 00:02:07.021
And counting off by four?

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:09.368
Well, look, think of it this way.

00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:13.105
A measure of music as a dollar.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:19.067
Now a dollar has four quarters, right?

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:22.923
And so does a 4/4 measure of music.

00:02:22.923 --> 00:02:26.566
It has four quarter notes.

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:28.802
Now, how do you subdivide?

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:33.194
Now let's envision this:

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:36.947
three dollars' worth of quarters.

00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:40.967
You would have three groups of four,

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:42.544
and you would count it,

00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:44.556
a-one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four,

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:46.583
one-two-three-four. Together.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.967
All: A-one-two-three-four,
one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four.

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:52.224
CC: Okay, now you feel that?

00:02:52.224 --> 00:02:57.184
Now let's take those three groups of four

00:02:57.184 --> 00:03:01.603
and make them four groups of three.

00:03:01.603 --> 00:03:03.436
And listen to this.

00:03:03.436 --> 00:03:05.491
A-one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four,

00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:07.633
one-two-three-four, with me.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:10.315
One-two-three-four, one-two-three, come on, y'all!

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:15.237
All: One-two-three-four,
one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four, ah.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:16.882
CC: There you go.

00:03:16.882 --> 00:03:21.211
All right, second line.

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:24.900
One-two-three-four, one-two-three.

00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:28.331
One-two-three-four, one-two-three.

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:32.270
One-two-three-four, one-two-three.

00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:36.917
One-two-three-four, one-two-three. Yeah.

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:39.439
Now, that's what I call a-rhythm-etic.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.864
Can you say it? A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:03:41.864 --> 00:03:43.635
CC: A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:45.810
CC: A-rhythm a-rhythm.
Audience: A-rhythm a-rhythm.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.523
CC: A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:03:47.523 --> 00:03:50.215
CC: Yeah. Now pick the swing 
beat, and do the same thing.

00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:54.856
One, two, one, two, a-one-two-three-four.

00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:03.424
Yeah. Mm.

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:07.594
One-two-three, one-two-three,
one-two-three, one-two-three. Whoo.

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:13.579
So I want to take the second line beat

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.640
and the swing beat and put them together,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.231
and it sounds something like this.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.881
Aha.

00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:34.966
A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:36.897
CC: A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:38.743
CC: A-rhythm a-rhythm.
Audience: A-rhythm a-rhythm.

00:04:38.743 --> 00:04:40.206
CC: A-rhythm-etic.
Audience: A-rhythm-etic.

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:43.263
CC: Yeah. Hip-hop.

00:04:44.963 --> 00:04:47.387
Now it's using a faster group of three

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.706
we call a triplet.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.635
Triplet-triplet. Say it with me.

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:54.160
All: Triplet-triplet.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.592
CC: Triplet-triplet. Triplet-triplet.

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:04.108
CC: So I'll take all the rhythms 
that you heard earlier,

00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:07.924
we'll put them together, and they sound like this.

00:05:31.112 --> 00:05:33.475
A-rhythm-etic.

00:05:33.475 --> 00:05:37.475
(Applause)
