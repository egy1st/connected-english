00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:02.416
I'd like to start, if I may,

00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:05.140
with the story of the Paisley snail.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.355
On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:10.729
May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.260
to the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.573
and there at the Wellmeadow CafÃ©,

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:18.699
she had a Scots ice cream float,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.546
a mix of ice cream and ginger beer

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:22.501
bought for her by a friend.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.902
The ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:28.765
labeled "D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley."

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:30.841
She drank some of the ice cream float,

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.675
but as the remaining ginger beer was poured

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:34.071
into her tumbler,

00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:36.524
a decomposed snail

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:39.106
floated to the surface of her glass.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:40.650
Three days later, she was admitted

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.156
to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary

00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:44.214
and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis

00:00:44.214 --> 00:00:46.167
and shock.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:49.435
The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:52.080
set a very important legal precedent:

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.811
Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer,

00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:56.588
was held to have a clear duty of care

00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:58.036
towards May Donoghue,

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:00.138
even though there was no contract between them,

00:01:00.138 --> 00:01:02.955
and, indeed, she hadn't even bought the drink.

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:05.974
One of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this:

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:08.884
You must take care to avoid acts or omissions

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:10.952
which you can reasonably foresee

00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:14.180
would be likely to injure your neighbor.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.523
Indeed, one wonders that without a duty of care,

00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:18.269
how many people would have had to suffer

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:21.993
from gastroenteritis before Stevenson
eventually went out of business.

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:24.374
Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story,

00:01:24.374 --> 00:01:27.607
because it's an important principle.

00:01:27.607 --> 00:01:30.101
Last year, the Hansard Society,
a nonpartisan charity

00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:32.007
which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.244
and encourage greater public involvement in politics

00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:37.831
published, alongside their annual audit

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.704
of political engagement, an additional section

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:43.827
devoted entirely to politics and the media.

00:01:43.827 --> 00:01:46.202
Here are a couple of rather depressing observations

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:48.210
from that survey.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.375
Tabloid newspapers do not appear

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:53.208
to advance the political citizenship of their readers,

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:54.781
relative even to those

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.007
who read no newspapers whatsoever.

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:00.999
Tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.850
with a negative view of politics

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.425
than readers of no newspapers.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.418
They're not just less politically engaged.

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:09.866
They are consuming media that reinforces

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.828
their negative evaluation of politics,

00:02:11.828 --> 00:02:14.931
thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical

00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:18.266
attitude to democracy and their own role within it.

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.426
Little wonder that the report concluded that

00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:23.616
in this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids,

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:25.955
appear not to be living up to the importance

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:28.591
of their role in our democracy.

00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:30.650
Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.097
challenge that view.

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:34.713
But if Hansard are right, and they usually are,

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:36.689
then we've got a very serious problem on our hands,

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.324
and it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes

00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:41.353
focusing upon.

00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:43.036
Since the Paisley snail,

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:45.500
and especially over the past decade or so,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.419
a great deal of thinking has been developed

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.278
around the notion of a duty of care

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:51.817
as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:54.561
Generally a duty of care arises when one individual

00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:57.295
or a group of individuals undertakes an activity

00:02:57.295 --> 00:02:59.825
which has the potential to cause harm to another,

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.539
either physically, mentally or economically.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.010
This is principally focused on obvious areas,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.052
such as our empathetic response
to children and young people,

00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:10.778
to our service personnel, and
to the elderly and infirm.

00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:14.971
It is seldom, if ever, extended
to equally important arguments

00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:19.221
around the fragility of our
present system of government,

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:22.730
to the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.874
are fundamental to the process of building

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:26.603
and embedding an informed,

00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:29.360
participatory democracy.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.781
And the more you think about it,

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:32.612
the stranger that is.

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.074
A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure

00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:35.828
of opening a brand new school

00:03:35.828 --> 00:03:37.399
in the northeast of England.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.938
It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.

00:03:40.938 --> 00:03:42.790
As I walked through their impressive,

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.165
glass-covered atrium,

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:45.983
in front of me, emblazoned on the wall

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:47.531
in letters of fire

00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:50.632
was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction:

00:03:50.632 --> 00:03:53.487
If it's not true, don't say it;

00:03:53.487 --> 00:03:56.570
if it's not right, don't do it.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.558
The head teacher saw me staring at it,

00:03:58.558 --> 00:04:01.350
and he said, "Oh, that's our school motto."

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.077
On the train back to London,

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:04.931
I couldn't get it out of my mind.

00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.490
I kept thinking, can it really have taken us

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.701
over 2,000 years to come to terms

00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:11.566
with that simple notion

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:14.518
as being our minimum expectation of each other?

00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:17.126
Isn't it time that we develop this concept

00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:18.795
of a duty of care

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:21.221
and extended it to include a care

00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.485
for our shared but increasingly
endangered democratic values?

00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:26.342
After all, the absence of a duty of care

00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:27.932
within many professions

00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:30.435
can all too easily amount to
accusations of negligence,

00:04:30.435 --> 00:04:33.542
and that being the case, can we be
really comfortable with the thought

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:35.843
that we're in effect being negligent

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:38.634
in respect of the health of our own societies

00:04:38.634 --> 00:04:41.369
and the values that necessarily underpin them?

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:44.364
Could anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,

00:04:44.364 --> 00:04:47.620
that the same media which
Hansard so roundly condemned

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.907
have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving

00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:54.349
in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.450
would be likely to undermine or even damage

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.284
our inherently fragile democratic settlement.

00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:01.305
Now there will be those who will argue

00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.078
that this could all too easily drift into a form

00:05:03.078 --> 00:05:05.085
of censorship, albeit self-censorship,

00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:07.041
but I don't buy that argument.

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:09.100
It has to be possible

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.200
to balance freedom of expression

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.407
with wider moral and social responsibilities.

00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:16.258
Let me explain why by taking the example

00:05:16.258 --> 00:05:19.161
from my own career as a filmmaker.

00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:20.968
Throughout that career, I never accepted

00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:22.595
that a filmmaker should set about putting

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:25.645
their own work outside or above what he or she

00:05:25.645 --> 00:05:27.595
believed to be a decent set of values

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:30.944
for their own life, their own family,

00:05:30.944 --> 00:05:34.535
and the future of the society in which we all live.

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:35.859
I'd go further.

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:39.153
A responsible filmmaker should
never devalue their work

00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:41.197
to a point at which it becomes less than true

00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:44.637
to the world they themselves wish to inhabit.

00:05:44.637 --> 00:05:48.023
As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers

00:05:48.023 --> 00:05:50.547
are all required to face up to the social expectations

00:05:50.547 --> 00:05:54.302
that come with combining the
intrinsic power of their medium

00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:57.676
with their well-honed professional skills.

00:05:57.676 --> 00:06:00.563
Obviously this is not a mandated duty,

00:06:00.563 --> 00:06:03.045
but for the gifted filmmaker
and the responsible journalist

00:06:03.045 --> 00:06:06.854
or even blogger, it strikes me
as being utterly inescapable.

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:09.464
We should always remember that our notion

00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:12.355
of individual freedom and
its partner, creative freedom,

00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:14.150
is comparatively new

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.412
in the history of Western ideas,

00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:18.330
and for that reason, it's often undervalued

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.693
and can be very quickly undermined.

00:06:20.693 --> 00:06:22.920
It's a prize easily lost,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.683
and once lost, once surrendered,

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:28.000
it can prove very, very hard to reclaim.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.525
And its first line of defense

00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:31.876
has to be our own standards,

00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:35.615
not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:37.438
our own standards and our own integrity.

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:39.432
Our integrity as we deal with those

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:40.980
with whom we work

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.605
and our own standards as we operate within society.

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:46.075
And these standards of ours

00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:49.340
need to be all of a piece with
a sustainable social agenda.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.453
They're part of a collective responsibility,

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.583
the responsibility of the artist or the journalist

00:06:53.583 --> 00:06:55.957
to deal with the world as it really is,

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.406
and this, in turn, must go hand in hand

00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:00.824
with the responsibility of those governing society

00:07:00.824 --> 00:07:02.901
to also face up to that world,

00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.261
and not to be tempted to misappropriate

00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:07.853
the causes of its ills.

00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:10.499
Yet, as has become strikingly clear

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:12.567
over the last couple of years,

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:14.601
such responsibility has to a very great extent

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.644
been abrogated by large sections of the media.

00:07:17.644 --> 00:07:19.584
And as a consequence, across the Western world,

00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:22.883
the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest

00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:25.268
and their appeal to a largely disillusioned,

00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:26.657
older demographic,

00:07:26.657 --> 00:07:28.865
along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.763
that typifies at least some of the young,

00:07:30.763 --> 00:07:32.821
taken together, these and other similarly

00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:34.902
contemporary aberrations

00:07:34.902 --> 00:07:36.949
are threatening to squeeze the life

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.523
out of active, informed debate and engagement,

00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:43.050
and I stress active.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.327
The most ardent of libertarians might argue

00:07:45.327 --> 00:07:48.321
that Donoghue v. Stevenson should
have been thrown out of court

00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:50.439
and that Stevenson would eventually
have gone out of business

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:53.856
if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:57.270
But most of us, I think, accept some small role

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.348
for the state to enforce a duty of care,

00:08:00.348 --> 00:08:03.020
and the key word here is reasonable.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.600
Judges must ask, did they take reasonable care

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.015
and could they have reasonably foreseen

00:08:08.015 --> 00:08:10.213
the consequences of their actions?

00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:13.195
Far from signifying overbearing state power,

00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:16.720
it's that small common sense test of reasonableness

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.379
that I'd like us to apply to those in the media

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:21.650
who, after all, set the tone and the content

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.967
for much of our democratic discourse.

00:08:24.967 --> 00:08:27.687
Democracy, in order to work, requires that

00:08:27.687 --> 00:08:30.635
reasonable men and women take
the time to understand and debate

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.967
difficult, sometimes complex issues,

00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:35.260
and they do so in an atmosphere which strives

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.659
for the type of understanding that leads to,

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.726
if not agreement, then at least a productive

00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:42.093
and workable compromise.

00:08:42.093 --> 00:08:44.450
Politics is about choices,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.441
and within those choices, politics is about priorities.

00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:50.979
It's about reconciling conflicting preferences

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:56.195
wherever and whenever possibly based on fact.

00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:58.666
But if the facts themselves are distorted,

00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:02.389
the resolutions are likely only
to create further conflict,

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:04.276
with all the stresses and strains on society

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:06.492
that inevitably follow.

00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:08.439
The media have to decide:

00:09:08.439 --> 00:09:11.613
Do they see their role as being to inflame

00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:13.943
or to inform?

00:09:13.943 --> 00:09:16.805
Because in the end, it comes down to a combination

00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:19.296
of trust and leadership.

00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:21.873
Fifty years ago this week,
President John F. Kennedy

00:09:21.873 --> 00:09:23.479
made two epoch-making speeches,

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:26.976
the first on disarmament
and the second on civil rights.

00:09:26.976 --> 00:09:29.078
The first led almost immediately

00:09:29.078 --> 00:09:30.659
to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:33.724
and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,

00:09:33.724 --> 00:09:37.310
both of which represented giant leaps forward.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.715
Democracy, well-led and well-informed,

00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:42.208
can achieve very great things,

00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:43.881
but there's a precondition.

00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:47.192
We have to trust that those making those decisions

00:09:47.192 --> 00:09:49.659
are acting in the best interest not of themselves

00:09:49.659 --> 00:09:51.423
but of the whole of the people.

00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:54.502
We need factually-based options,

00:09:54.502 --> 00:09:55.741
clearly laid out,

00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:57.139
not those of a few powerful

00:09:57.139 --> 00:09:59.236
and potentially manipulative corporations

00:09:59.236 --> 00:10:01.603
pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas,

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:04.032
but accurate, unprejudiced information

00:10:04.032 --> 00:10:06.408
with which to make our own judgments.

00:10:06.408 --> 00:10:08.302
If we want to provide decent, fulfilling lives

00:10:08.302 --> 00:10:10.613
for our children and our children's children,

00:10:10.613 --> 00:10:13.730
we need to exercise to the
very greatest degree possible

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.442
that duty of care for a vibrant,

00:10:15.442 --> 00:10:18.339
and hopefully a lasting, democracy.

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:20.422
Thank you very much for listening to me.

00:10:20.422 --> 00:10:24.361
(Applause)
