00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:03.654
What is love?

00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:05.961
It's a hard term to define

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:09.850
in so far as it has a very wide application.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.619
I can love jogging.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.645
I can love a book, a movie.

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.516
I can love escalopes.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.711
I can love my wife.

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:22.115
(Laughter)

00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:26.810
But there's a great difference

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.901
between an escalope and my wife, for instance.

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:34.906
That is, if I value the escalope,

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:41.019
the escalope, on the other hand, 
it doesn't value me back.

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.321
Whereas my wife, she calls me

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:46.122
the star of her life.

00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:48.706
(Laughter)

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:50.662
Therefore, only another desiring conscience

00:00:50.662 --> 00:00:53.894
can conceive me as a desirable being.

00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:55.474
I know this, that's why

00:00:55.474 --> 00:00:57.820
love can be defined in a more accurate way

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.130
as the desire of being desired.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.925
Hence the eternal problem of love:

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:10.869
how to become and remain desirable?

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.489
The individual used to find

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:16.722
an answer to this problem

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:19.727
by submitting his life to community rules.

00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:21.834
You had a specific part to play

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:24.049
according to your sex, your age,

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.925
your social status,

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:27.955
and you only had to play your part

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:32.032
to be valued and loved by the whole community.

00:01:32.032 --> 00:01:35.789
Think about the young woman
who must remain chaste before marriage.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.155
Think about the youngest son 
who must obey the eldest son,

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:45.861
who in turn must obey the patriarch.

00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:50.147
But a phenomenon

00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:53.510
started in the 13th century,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.512
mainly in the Renaissance, in the West,

00:01:57.512 --> 00:02:00.891
that caused the biggest identity crisis

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:03.088
in the history of humankind.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.358
This phenomenon is modernity.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.306
We can basically summarize it
through a triple process.

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:14.029
First, a process of rationalization
of scientific research,

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.714
which has accelerated technical progress.

00:02:16.714 --> 00:02:21.178
Next, a process of political democratization,

00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:24.292
which has fostered individual rights.

00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:28.850
And finally, a process of rationalization 
of economic production

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.735
and of trade liberalization.

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.617
These three intertwined processes

00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:37.026
have completely annihilated

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:41.332
all the traditional bearings of Western societies,

00:02:41.332 --> 00:02:43.957
with radical consequences for the individual.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:46.518
Now individuals are free

00:02:46.518 --> 00:02:49.922
to value or disvalue

00:02:49.922 --> 00:02:54.127
any attitude, any choice, any object.

00:02:54.127 --> 00:03:00.344
But as a result, they are themselves confronted

00:03:00.344 --> 00:03:02.409
with this same freedom that others have

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.861
to value or disvalue them.

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:12.201
In other words, my value was once ensured

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:16.114
by submitting myself 
to the traditional authorities.

00:03:16.114 --> 00:03:21.398
Now it is quoted in the stock exchange.

00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:26.048
On the free market of individual desires,

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:30.033
I negotiate my value every day.

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:32.619
Hence the anxiety of contemporary man.

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:36.705
He is obsessed: "Am I desirable? How desirable?

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:39.803
How many people are going to love me?"

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.509
And how does he respond to this anxiety?

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:51.025
Well, by hysterically collecting
symbols of desirability.

00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:55.460
(Laughter)

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.765
I call this act of collecting,

00:03:57.765 --> 00:04:01.119
along with others, seduction capital.

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:03.162
Indeed, our consumer society

00:04:03.162 --> 00:04:08.631
is largely based on seduction capital.

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.742
It is said about this consumption
that our age is materialistic.

00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:16.690
But it's not true! We only accumulate objects

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.501
in order to communicate with other minds.

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:24.918
We do it to make them love us, to seduce them.

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:28.638
Nothing could be less materialistic, 
or more sentimental,

00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:32.863
than a teenager buying brand new jeans

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:35.355
and tearing them at the knees,

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:37.467
because he wants to please Jennifer.

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.917
(Laughter)

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:43.201
Consumerism is not materialism.

00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:45.276
It is rather what is swallowed up

00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:48.285
and sacrificed in the name of the god of love,

00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:52.731
or rather in the name of seduction capital.

00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:58.112
In light of this observation on contemporary love,

00:04:58.112 --> 00:05:01.427
how can we think of love in the years to come?

00:05:01.427 --> 00:05:03.711
We can envision two hypotheses:

00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:06.447
The first one consists of betting

00:05:06.447 --> 00:05:12.141
that this process of narcissistic 
capitalization will intensify.

00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:16.209
It is hard to say what shape 
this intensification will take,

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:17.940
because it largely depends

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.708
on social and technical innovations,

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:25.755
which are by definition difficult to predict.

00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:27.657
But we can, for instance,

00:05:27.657 --> 00:05:31.381
imagine a dating website

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:35.513
which, a bit like those loyalty points programs,

00:05:35.513 --> 00:05:38.705
uses seduction capital points

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:42.500
that vary according to my age, 
my height/weight ratio,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.023
my degree, my salary,

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:49.488
or the number of clicks on my profile.

00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:53.374
We can also imagine

00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:56.747
a chemical treatment for breakups

00:05:56.747 --> 00:06:00.565
that weakens the feelings of attachment.

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:04.622
By the way, there's a program on MTV already

00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:08.606
in which seduction teachers

00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:12.524
treat heartache as a disease.

00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:16.226
These teachers call themselves "pick-up artists."

00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:19.470
"Artist" in French is easy, it means "artiste."

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.182
"Pick-up" is to pick someone up,

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:24.298
but not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks.

00:06:24.298 --> 00:06:28.767
So they are artists of picking up chicks.

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:30.224
(Laughter)

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:35.339
And they call heartache "one-itis."

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.889
In English, "itis" is a suffix that signifies infection.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.353
One-itis can be translated as "an infection from one."

00:06:43.353 --> 00:06:47.122
It's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists,

00:06:47.122 --> 00:06:50.571
falling in love with someone

00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:52.403
is a waste of time,

00:06:52.403 --> 00:06:54.310
it's squandering your seduction capital,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.102
so it must be eliminated

00:06:56.102 --> 00:06:59.831
like a disease, like an infection.

00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:03.532
We can also envision

00:07:03.532 --> 00:07:06.549
a romantic use of the genome.

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:10.199
Everyone would carry it around

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.399
and present it like a business card

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:18.393
to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction.

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:22.021
(Laughter)

00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:27.184
Of course, this race for seduction,

00:07:27.184 --> 00:07:29.287
like every fierce competition,

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:34.220
will create huge disparities 
in narcissistic satisfaction,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.270
and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.014
So we can expect that modernity itself,

00:07:41.014 --> 00:07:45.550
which is the origin of seduction capital,
would be called into question.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.181
I'm thinking particularly of the reaction

00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:53.110
of neo-fascist or religious communes.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.746
But such a future doesn't have to be.

00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:04.168
Another path to thinking about love may be possible.

00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:06.258
But how?

00:08:06.258 --> 00:08:10.572
How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued?

00:08:10.572 --> 00:08:14.780
Well, by becoming aware
of my uselessness.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.879
(Laughter)

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:17.818
Yes,

00:08:17.818 --> 00:08:20.109
I'm useless.

00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:21.980
But rest assured:

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.442
so are you.

00:08:23.442 --> 00:08:25.592
(Laughter)

00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:29.629
(Applause)

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:33.999
We are all useless.

00:08:33.999 --> 00:08:36.414
This uselessness is easily demonstrated,

00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:40.015
because in order to be valued

00:08:40.015 --> 00:08:43.026
I need another to desire me,

00:08:43.026 --> 00:08:45.316
which shows that I do not have any value of my own.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.400
I don't have any inherent value.

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:53.489
We all pretend to have an idol;

00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:56.408
we all pretend to be an idol for
someone else, but actually

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:59.830
we are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.689
who appears totally cool and indifferent,

00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:05.838
while he has actually anticipated and calculated

00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:09.443
so that all eyes are on him.

00:09:09.443 --> 00:09:11.012
I think that becoming aware

00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:13.219
of this general imposture

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.627
that concerns all of us

00:09:14.627 --> 00:09:16.447
would ease our love relationships.

00:09:16.447 --> 00:09:18.837
It is because I want to be loved

00:09:18.837 --> 00:09:20.334
from head to toe,

00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:22.309
justified in my every choice,

00:09:22.309 --> 00:09:25.081
that the seduction hysteria exists.

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:27.374
And therefore I want to seem perfect

00:09:27.374 --> 00:09:28.994
so that another can love me.

00:09:28.994 --> 00:09:30.521
I want them to be perfect

00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:32.678
so that I can be reassured of my value.

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.065
It leads to couples

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:37.357
obsessed with performance

00:09:37.357 --> 00:09:39.513
who will break up, just like that,

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:42.067
at the slightest underachievement.

00:09:42.067 --> 00:09:46.190
In contrast to this attitude,

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.928
I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness.

00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:50.296
What is tenderness?

00:09:50.296 --> 00:09:54.169
To be tender is to accept 
the loved one's weaknesses.

00:09:54.169 --> 00:09:57.826
It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies.

00:09:57.826 --> 00:09:59.021
(Laughter)

00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:01.091
That's pretty bad.

00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:02.423
On the contrary,

00:10:02.423 --> 00:10:05.189
there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness.

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:09.238
I refer specifically to a kind of humor
that is unfortunately underused.

00:10:09.238 --> 00:10:12.115
It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:14.896
I refer to self-mockery.

00:10:14.896 --> 00:10:17.717
For a couple who is no longer sustained, supported

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.794
by the constraints of tradition,

00:10:19.794 --> 00:10:21.342
I believe that self-mockery

00:10:21.342 --> 00:10:25.695
is one of the best means for 
the relationship to endure.
