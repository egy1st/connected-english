00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:03.355
So imagine, you're in the supermarket,

00:00:03.355 --> 00:00:04.936
you're buying some groceries,

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:06.561
and you get given the option

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:10.196
for a plastic or a paper shopping bag.

00:00:10.196 --> 00:00:12.386
Which one do you choose if you want to do

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:14.802
the right thing by the environment?

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:16.683
Most people do pick the paper.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.911
Okay, let's think of why.

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:19.604
It's brown to start with.

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:21.080
Therefore, it must be good for the environment.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.598
It's biodegradable. It's reusable.

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.548
In some cases, it's recyclable.

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:28.342
So when people are looking at the plastic bag,

00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:31.272
it's likely they're thinking of something like this,

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:33.655
which we all know is absolutely terrible,

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:35.871
and we should be avoiding at all expenses

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.226
these kinds of environmental damages.

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:40.439
But people are often not thinking

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.457
of something like this,

00:00:42.457 --> 00:00:45.035
which is the other end of the spectrum.

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:47.802
When we produce materials,

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.432
we need to extract them from the environment,

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:53.336
and we need a whole bunch
of environmental impacts.

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:55.512
You see, what happens is, when we need

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:57.489
to make complex choices,

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.910
us humans like really simple solutions,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.526
and so we often ask for simple solutions.

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:03.999
And I work in design.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:05.510
I advise designers

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.775
and innovators around sustainability,

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.329
and everyone always says to me, "Oh Leyla,

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.251
I just want the eco-materials."

00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:13.535
And I say, "Well, that's very complex,

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:15.364
and we'll have to spend four hours talking about

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:17.279
what exactly an eco-material means,

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.199
because everything at some point

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:21.144
comes from nature,

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:23.239
and it's how you use the material

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:26.280
that dictates the environmental impact.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.069
So what happens is, we have to rely

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.127
on some sort of intuitive framework

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:31.702
when we make decisions.

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:34.032
So I like to call that intuitive framework

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.627
our environmental folklore.

00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:39.384
It's either the little voice
at the back of your head,

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:41.656
or it's that gut feeling you get

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.236
when you've done the right thing,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.784
so when you've picked the paper bag

00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:47.899
or when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.858
And environmental folklore is a really important thing

00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:53.306
because we're trying to do the right thing.

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:55.650
But how do we know if we're actually

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.973
reducing the net environmental impacts

00:01:57.973 --> 00:02:01.314
that our actions as individuals and as professionals

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:03.482
and as a society are actually having

00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:06.187
on the natural environment?

00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:08.030
So the thing about environmental folklore is

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.085
it tends to be based on our experiences,

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:11.816
the things we've heard from other people.

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:14.456
It doesn't tend to be based
on any scientific framework.

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:16.123
And this is really hard, because we live

00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:18.143
in incredibly complex systems.

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:19.863
We have the human systems

00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:21.629
of how we communicate and interrelate

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.144
and have our whole constructed society,

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.037
We have the industrial systems,
which is essentially the entire economy,

00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:29.890
and then all of that has to operate

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.415
within the biggest system,

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:33.507
and, I would argue, the most important,

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:35.163
the ecosystem.

00:02:35.163 --> 00:02:37.025
And you see, the choices that we make

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:38.458
as an individual,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.769
but the choices that we make

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.928
in every single job that we have,

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:44.548
no matter how high or low
you are in the pecking order,

00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:47.599
has an impact on all of these systems.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.934
And the thing is that we have to find ways

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:51.873
if we're actually going to address sustainability

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:55.021
of interlocking those complex systems

00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:57.965
and making better choices that result

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:00.549
in net environmental gains.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.197
What we need to do is we need to learn

00:03:02.197 --> 00:03:04.273
to do more with less.

00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:06.164
We have an increasing population,

00:03:06.164 --> 00:03:07.998
and everybody likes their mobile phones,

00:03:07.998 --> 00:03:10.113
especially in this situation here.

00:03:10.113 --> 00:03:14.168
So we need to find innovative ways of solving
some of these problems that we face.

00:03:14.168 --> 00:03:17.363
And that's where this process called
life cycle thinking comes in.

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:20.053
So essentially, everything that is created

00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:22.564
goes through a series of life cycle stages,

00:03:22.564 --> 00:03:24.426
and we use this scientific process

00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:26.150
called life cycle assessment,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.891
or in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,

00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:32.438
in order to have a clearer picture of how

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:36.244
everything that we do in the
technical part of those systems

00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:38.025
affects the natural environment.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:39.995
So we go all the way back

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:42.198
to the extraction of raw materials,

00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:44.015
and then we look at manufacturing,

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.874
we look at packaging and transportation,

00:03:45.874 --> 00:03:47.524
use, and end of life,

00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:50.441
and at every single one of these stages,

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:51.960
the things that we do

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.791
have an interaction with the natural environment,

00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.279
and we can monitor how that interaction

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.009
is actually affecting the systems and services

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.924
that make life on Earth possible.

00:04:01.924 --> 00:04:03.560
And through doing this,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.850
we've learned some absolutely fascinating things.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.563
And we've busted a bunch of myths.

00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:14.551
So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.

00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:16.284
It's used a lot in marketing,

00:04:16.284 --> 00:04:18.284
and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation

00:04:18.284 --> 00:04:20.217
when we're talking about sustainability,

00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:22.663
and that's the word biodegradability.

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:27.611
Now biodegradability is a material property;

00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.859
it is not a definition of environmental benefits.

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:32.762
Allow me to explain.

00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:34.454
When something natural,

00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:36.415
something that's made from a cellulose fiber

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:39.943
like a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:42.231
or even a piece of paper,

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:44.045
when something natural ends up

00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:46.668
in the natural environment, it degrades normally.

00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:48.532
Its little carbon molecules that it stored up

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:50.669
as it was growing are naturally released

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.249
back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.223
but this is a net situation.

00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:56.588
Most natural things

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.195
don't actually end up in nature.

00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:01.606
Most of the things, the waste that 
we produce, end up in landfill.

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:04.008
Landfill is a different environment.

00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:06.451
In landfill, those same carbon molecules

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:07.969
degrade in a different way,

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.881
because a landfill is anaerobic.

00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:13.299
It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:15.647
Those same molecules, they become methane,

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:18.565
and methane is a 25 times more potent

00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:21.418
greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:24.171
So our old lettuces and products

00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:25.750
that we have thrown out that are made

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.320
out of biodegradable materials,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.055
if they end up in landfill,

00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:31.081
contribute to climate change.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.473
You see, there are facilities now

00:05:32.473 --> 00:05:34.177
that can actually capture that methane

00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:35.615
and generate power,

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:38.406
displacing the need for fossil fuel power,

00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:39.871
but we need to be smart about this.

00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:43.036
We need to identify how we can start to leverage

00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:45.340
these types of things that are already happening

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.208
and start to design systems and services

00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:49.091
that alleviate these problems.

00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:52.336
Because right now, what people do
is they turn around and they say,

00:05:52.336 --> 00:05:54.895
"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper

00:05:54.895 --> 00:05:56.822
because that is better for the environment."

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:58.240
But if you're throwing it in the bin,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.703
and your local landfill facility

00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:02.124
is just a normal one,

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:07.030
then we're having what's called a double negative.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.194
I'm a product designer by trade.

00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:11.386
I then did social science.

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:12.803
And so I'm absolutely fascinated

00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:14.802
by consumer goods and how the consumer goods

00:06:14.802 --> 00:06:16.924
that we have kind of become immune to

00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:18.162
that fill our lives

00:06:18.162 --> 00:06:19.970
have an impact on the natural environment.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.583
And these guys are, like, serial offenders,

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:24.446
and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:26.076
has a refrigerator.

00:06:26.076 --> 00:06:27.708
Now America has this amazing ability

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:29.717
to keep growing refrigerators.

00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:31.695
In the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot

00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:33.543
on average, the standard size

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:35.172
of a refrigerator.

00:06:35.172 --> 00:06:37.631
And the problem is, they're so big now,

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:39.825
it's easier for us to buy more food

00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:41.816
that we can't eat or find.

00:06:41.816 --> 00:06:43.442
I mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator

00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:45.652
that have been there for years, all right?

00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:48.288
And so what happens is, we waste more food.

00:06:48.288 --> 00:06:51.633
And as I was just explaining,
food waste is a problem.

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:54.995
In fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent

00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:57.570
of food purchased for the home is wasted.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.905
Half of the world's produced food is wasted.

00:07:01.905 --> 00:07:04.558
That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:09.095
It's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.099
And I blame it on the refrigerator,

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:12.627
well, especially in Western cultures,

00:07:12.627 --> 00:07:14.477
because it makes it easier.

00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:16.869
I mean, there's a lot of complex
systems going on here.

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.807
I don't want to make it so simplistic.

00:07:18.807 --> 00:07:21.757
But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this,

00:07:21.757 --> 00:07:23.615
and one of the features of it

00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:25.577
is the crisper drawer.

00:07:25.577 --> 00:07:27.078
You all got crisper drawers?

00:07:27.078 --> 00:07:29.013
The drawer that you put your lettuces in?

00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:30.933
Lettuces have a habit of going soggy

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:32.729
in the crisper drawers, don't they?

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.139
Yeah? Soggy lettuces?

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:36.139
In the U.K., this is such a problem

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.837
that there was a government report a few years ago

00:07:37.837 --> 00:07:40.857
that actually said the second biggest offender

00:07:40.857 --> 00:07:43.274
of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.

00:07:43.274 --> 00:07:45.692
It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.

00:07:45.692 --> 00:07:47.905
Okay? So this is a problem, people.

00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:50.015
These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out

00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:51.887
left, right and center because the crisper drawers

00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:54.646
are not designed to actually keep things crisp.

00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:56.855
Okay. You need a tight environment.

00:07:56.855 --> 00:07:58.985
You need, like, an airless environment

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:01.710
to prevent the degrading that
would happen naturally.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.662
But the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer

00:08:03.662 --> 00:08:05.370
with a slightly better seal.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.457
Anyway, I'm clearly obsessed.

00:08:07.457 --> 00:08:10.182
Don't ever invite me over because I'll just
start going through your refrigerator

00:08:10.182 --> 00:08:11.700
and looking at all sorts of things like that.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.619
But essentially, this is a big problem.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:16.578
Because when we lose something
like the lettuce from the system,

00:08:16.578 --> 00:08:20.114
not only do we have that impact 
I just explained at the end of life,

00:08:20.114 --> 00:08:22.770
but we actually have had to grow that lettuce.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.041
The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.

00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:27.459
We've had to clear land.

00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:29.616
We've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,

00:08:29.616 --> 00:08:31.740
fertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.828
All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce

00:08:33.828 --> 00:08:35.540
get lost from the system,

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.151
which makes it a far bigger environmental impact

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:41.835
than the loss of the energy from the fridge.

00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:45.100
So we need to design things like this far better

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.281
if we're going to start addressing
serious environmental problems.

00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:49.932
We could start with the crisper drawer and the size.

00:08:49.932 --> 00:08:51.684
For those of you in the room who do design fridges,

00:08:51.684 --> 00:08:53.177
that would be great.

00:08:53.177 --> 00:08:56.275
The problem is, imagine if we

00:08:56.275 --> 00:08:58.925
actually started to reconsider 
how we designed things.

00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:02.532
So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,

00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:04.630
but we actually haven't really changed the design

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.301
of them that much since the 1950s.

00:09:07.301 --> 00:09:10.526
A little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.448
cold boxes that we store stuff in.

00:09:12.448 --> 00:09:14.268
So imagine if we actually really started

00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:17.013
to identify these problems and use that

00:09:17.013 --> 00:09:20.950
as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.303
design solutions that will solve those problems.

00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:26.528
This is design-led system change,

00:09:26.528 --> 00:09:30.238
design dictating the way in which the system

00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:33.003
can be far more sustainable.

00:09:33.003 --> 00:09:35.097
Forty percent food waste is a major problem.

00:09:35.097 --> 00:09:39.162
Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.513
Another item that I find fascinating

00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:42.766
is the electric tea kettle,

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:44.159
which I found out that

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:47.410
you don't do tea kettles in
this country, really, do you?

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.498
But that's really big in the U.K.

00:09:49.498 --> 00:09:51.731
Ninety-seven percent of households

00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:54.663
in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.

00:09:54.663 --> 00:09:56.270
So they're very popular.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.070
And, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.322
or a designer, and they were designing one of these,

00:10:01.322 --> 00:10:02.561
and they wanted to do it eco,

00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:04.479
they'd usually ask me two things.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.523
They'd say, "Leyla, how do I
make it technically efficient?"

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:10.811
Because obviously energy's
a problem with this product.

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:13.876
Or, "How do I make it green materials?

00:10:13.876 --> 00:10:16.786
How do I make the materials green

00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:18.608
in the manufacturing?"

00:10:18.608 --> 00:10:20.411
Would you ask me those questions?

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:23.210
They seem logical, right? Yeah.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.769
Well I'd say, "You're looking at the wrong problems."

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:27.927
Because the problem is with use.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:30.602
It's with how people use the product.

00:10:30.602 --> 00:10:32.437
Sixty-five percent of Brits

00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:34.781
admit to over-filling their kettle

00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:37.367
when they only need one cup of tea.

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:40.110
All of this extra water that's being boiled

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.078
requires energy, and it's been calculated

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:47.116
that in one day of extra energy use

00:10:47.116 --> 00:10:48.659
from boiling kettles

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:51.301
is enough to light all of the streetlights

00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:53.924
in England for a night.

00:10:53.924 --> 00:10:56.042
But this is the thing.

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:57.956
This is what I call a product-person failure.

00:10:57.956 --> 00:11:00.702
But we've got a product-system failure
going on with these little guys,

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.612
and they're so ubiquitous, you 
don't even notice they're there.

00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:06.825
And this guy over here, though, he does.
He's named Simon.

00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:10.132
Simon works for the national
electricity company in the U.K.

00:11:10.132 --> 00:11:12.274
He has a very important job of monitoring

00:11:12.274 --> 00:11:14.713
all of the electricity coming into the system

00:11:14.713 --> 00:11:16.126
to make sure there is enough

00:11:16.126 --> 00:11:18.054
so it powers everybody's homes.

00:11:18.054 --> 00:11:20.158
He's also watching television.

00:11:20.158 --> 00:11:22.131
The reason is because there's a unique

00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:23.949
phenomenon that happens in the U.K.

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:27.987
the moment that very popular TV shows end.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.225
The minute the ad break comes on,

00:11:30.225 --> 00:11:32.062
this man has to rush

00:11:32.062 --> 00:11:35.118
to buy nuclear power from France,

00:11:35.118 --> 00:11:38.007
because everybody turns their kettles on

00:11:38.007 --> 00:11:40.072
at the same time.

00:11:40.072 --> 00:11:42.318
(Laughter)

00:11:42.318 --> 00:11:48.303
1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.

00:11:48.303 --> 00:11:51.872
So imagine if you designed kettles,

00:11:51.872 --> 00:11:54.612
you actually found a way to
solve these system failures,

00:11:54.612 --> 00:11:57.277
because this is a huge amount of pressure

00:11:57.277 --> 00:11:58.668
on the system,

00:11:58.668 --> 00:12:02.104
just because the product hasn't
thought about the problem

00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:03.967
that it's going to have when it exists in the world.

00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:06.635
Now, I looked at a number of
kettles available on the market,

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:08.657
and found the minimum fill lines,

00:12:08.657 --> 00:12:10.423
so the little piece of information that tells you

00:12:10.423 --> 00:12:11.980
how much you need to put in there,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.899
was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:18.332
just to make one cup of tea.

00:12:18.332 --> 00:12:20.617
So this kettle here is an example of one where

00:12:20.617 --> 00:12:23.153
it actually has two reservoirs.

00:12:23.155 --> 00:12:25.340
One's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.665
The user actually has to push that button

00:12:27.665 --> 00:12:29.233
to get their hot water boiled,

00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:30.999
which means, because we're all lazy,

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:32.841
you only fill exactly what you need.

00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:35.165
And this is what I call behavior-changing products:

00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:37.277
products, systems or services

00:12:37.277 --> 00:12:41.136
that intervene and solve these problems up front.

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.786
Now, this is a technology arena,

00:12:43.786 --> 00:12:45.847
so obviously these things are quite popular,

00:12:45.847 --> 00:12:47.815
but I think if we're going to keep

00:12:47.815 --> 00:12:50.401
designing, buying and using and throwing out

00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:52.313
these kinds of products at the rate we currently do,

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.562
which is astronomically high,

00:12:54.562 --> 00:12:56.396
there are seven billion people

00:12:56.396 --> 00:12:57.806
who live in the world right now.

00:12:57.806 --> 00:12:59.993
There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions

00:12:59.993 --> 00:13:03.659
as of last year.

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:07.181
Every single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones

00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:08.434
roll off production lines,

00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:10.505
and some companies report their production rate

00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:12.855
as being greater than the human birth rate.

00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:15.985
One hundred fifty-two million phones 
were thrown out in the U.S. last year;

00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:17.869
only 11 percent were recycled.

00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:21.227
I'm from Australia. We have a
population of 22 million -- don't laugh --

00:13:21.227 --> 00:13:24.300
and it's been reported that 22 million phones

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.907
are in people's drawers.

00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:30.628
We need to find ways of solving
the problems around this,

00:13:30.628 --> 00:13:33.525
because these things are so complicated.

00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:36.831
They have so much locked up inside them.

00:13:36.831 --> 00:13:40.594
Gold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now

00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:44.211
to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones

00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:47.439
than it is out of a ton of gold ore?

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:49.829
There's a number of highly complex and valuable

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.430
materials embodied inside these things,

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.888
so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,

00:13:53.888 --> 00:13:56.052
because this is otherwise what happens.

00:13:56.052 --> 00:13:57.726
This is a community in Ghana,

00:13:57.726 --> 00:13:59.984
and e-waste is reported, or electronic waste

00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:01.960
is reported by the U.N.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.992
as being up to 50 million tons trafficked.

00:14:04.992 --> 00:14:06.306
This is how they get the gold

00:14:06.306 --> 00:14:07.840
and the other valuable materials out.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.778
They burn the electronic waste

00:14:09.778 --> 00:14:11.809
in open spaces.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:14.944
These are communities, and this
is happening all over the world.

00:14:14.944 --> 00:14:17.491
And because we don't see the ramifications

00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:19.320
of the choices that we make as designers,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.790
as businesspeople, as consumers,

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.403
then these kinds of externalities happen,

00:14:23.403 --> 00:14:25.705
and these are people's lives.

00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:30.153
So we need to find smarter, more systems-based,

00:14:30.153 --> 00:14:33.069
innovative solutions to these problems,

00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:36.845
if we're going to start to live
sustainably within this world.

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:40.818
So imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone,

00:14:40.818 --> 00:14:42.508
your new one because you replaced your old one --

00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:44.883
after 15 to 18 months is the average time

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:46.987
that people replace their phones, by the way —

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:49.972
so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.210
mobile phone replacing, then we should

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.259
be looking at closing the loop on these systems.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:56.170
The people who produce these phones,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.999
and some of which I'm sure
are in the room right now,

00:14:57.999 --> 00:15:00.677
could potentially look at doing what
we call closed-loop systems,

00:15:00.677 --> 00:15:02.245
or product system services,

00:15:02.245 --> 00:15:04.507
so identifying that there is a market demand

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:06.324
and that market demand's not going to go anywhere,

00:15:06.324 --> 00:15:09.377
so you design the product to solve the problem.

00:15:09.377 --> 00:15:11.716
Design for disassembly, design for light-weighting.

00:15:11.716 --> 00:15:14.082
We heard some of those kinds of strategies

00:15:14.082 --> 00:15:16.941
being used in the Tesla Motors car today.

00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:19.053
These kinds of approaches are not hard,

00:15:19.053 --> 00:15:20.911
but understanding the system

00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:24.442
and then looking for viable, market-driven

00:15:24.442 --> 00:15:26.425
consumer demand alternatives

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.976
is how we can start radically altering

00:15:28.976 --> 00:15:30.783
the sustainability agenda,

00:15:30.783 --> 00:15:32.654
because I hate to break it to you all:

00:15:32.654 --> 00:15:35.457
Consumption is the biggest problem.

00:15:35.457 --> 00:15:40.719
But design is one of the best solutions.

00:15:40.719 --> 00:15:42.903
These kinds of products are everywhere.

00:15:42.903 --> 00:15:45.571
By identifying alternative ways of doing things,

00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:47.166
we can actually start to innovate,

00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:48.559
and I say actually start to innovate.

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:51.044
I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.

00:15:51.044 --> 00:15:53.398
But in the regards to using sustainability

00:15:53.398 --> 00:15:56.085
as a parameter, as a criteria

00:15:56.085 --> 00:16:00.302
for fueling systems-based solutions,

00:16:00.302 --> 00:16:03.207
because as I've just demonstrated
with these simple products,

00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:06.598
they're participating in these major problems.

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.753
So we need to look across the entire life

00:16:08.753 --> 00:16:10.375
of the things that we do.

00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:12.090
If you just had paper or plastic --

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.854
obviously reusable is far more beneficial --

00:16:14.854 --> 00:16:18.325
then the paper is worse,

00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:20.371
and the paper is worse because it weighs

00:16:20.371 --> 00:16:22.475
four to 10 times more than the plastic,

00:16:22.475 --> 00:16:24.842
and when we actually compare,
from a life cycle perspective,

00:16:24.842 --> 00:16:27.532
a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,

00:16:27.532 --> 00:16:29.178
the paper is far better,

00:16:29.178 --> 00:16:31.718
but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag

00:16:31.718 --> 00:16:35.333
to carry your groceries home is not 
done with a kilo of each material.

00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:37.302
It's done with a very small amount of plastic

00:16:37.302 --> 00:16:38.995
and quite a lot more paper.

00:16:38.995 --> 00:16:41.953
Because functionality defines environmental impact,

00:16:41.953 --> 00:16:44.786
and I said earlier that the designers
always ask me for the eco-materials.

00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:47.810
I say, there's only a few materials
that you should completely avoid.

00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:49.730
The rest of them, it's all about application,

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.749
and at the end of the day, everything
we design and produce in the economy

00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:55.089
or buy as consumers is done so for function.

00:16:55.089 --> 00:16:57.206
We want something, therefore we buy it.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:17:00.362
So breaking things back down and delivering

00:17:00.362 --> 00:17:04.361
smartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions

00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:07.158
that take into consideration the entire system

00:17:07.158 --> 00:17:10.253
and the entire life of the thing, everything,

00:17:10.253 --> 00:17:13.089
all the way back to the extraction
through to the end of life,

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.891
we can start to actually find
really innovative solutions.

00:17:15.891 --> 00:17:17.961
And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing

00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:21.818
that a designer said to me recently 
who I work with, a senior designer.

00:17:21.818 --> 00:17:24.916
I said, "How come you're not doing 
sustainability? I know you know this."

00:17:24.916 --> 00:17:28.928
And he said, "Well, recently I pitched
a sustainability project to a client,

00:17:28.928 --> 00:17:30.869
and turned and he said to me,

00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:32.634
'I know it's going to cost less,

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:34.252
I know it's going to sell more,

00:17:34.252 --> 00:17:38.725
but we're not pioneers, because
pioneers have arrows in their backs.'"

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.942
I think we've got a roomful of pioneers,

00:17:40.942 --> 00:17:43.996
and I hope there are far more pioneers out there,
because we need to solve these problems.

00:17:44.027 --> 00:17:45.434
Thank you.

00:17:45.434 --> 00:17:50.210
(Applause)
