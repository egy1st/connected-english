00:00:00.846 --> 00:00:02.149
The world is changing

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.861
in some really profound ways,

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.844
and I worry that investors

00:00:06.844 --> 00:00:08.578
aren't paying enough attention

00:00:08.578 --> 00:00:10.443
to some of the biggest drivers of change,

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:14.219
especially when it comes to sustainability.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.674
And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,

00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:19.577
like environmental and social issues

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:22.086
and corporate governance.

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:24.352
I think it's reckless to ignore these things,

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:25.998
because doing so can jeopardize

00:00:25.998 --> 00:00:28.467
future long-term returns.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.663
And here's something that may surprise you:

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:35.334
the balance of power to really influence sustainability

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:37.489
rests with institutional investors,

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.525
the large investors like pension funds,

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.481
foundations and endowments.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.075
I believe that sustainable investing

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:47.725
is less complicated than you think,

00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:49.753
better-performing than you believe,

00:00:49.753 --> 00:00:52.626
and more important than we can imagine.

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:55.634
Let me remind you what we already know.

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:59.180
We have a population that's both growing and aging;

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.026
we have seven billion souls today

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.452
heading to 10 billion

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:04.353
at the end of the century;

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:06.851
we consume natural resources

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:09.677
faster than they can be replenished;

00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:12.114
and the emissions that are mainly responsible

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:16.943
for climate change just keep increasing.

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:21.160
Now clearly, these are
environmental and social issues,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.092
but that's not all.

00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:25.064
They're economic issues,

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:26.800
and that makes them relevant

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.077
to risk and return.

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:32.157
And they are really complex

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:33.822
and they can seem really far off,

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:37.108
that the temptation may be to do this:

00:01:37.108 --> 00:01:40.474
bury our heads in the sand and not think about it.

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:43.124
Resist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.

00:01:43.124 --> 00:01:45.050
(Laughter)

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.693
But it makes me wonder

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:48.706
if the investment rules of today

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:51.951
are fit for purpose tomorrow.

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:53.789
We know that investors,

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.649
when they look at a company
and decide whether to invest,

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.281
they look at financial data,

00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:02.301
metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,

00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:07.713
valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff.

00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:10.040
And these things are fundamental, of course,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.805
but they're not enough.

00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:14.254
Investors should also look at performance metrics

00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:16.178
in what we call ESG:

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:19.020
environment, social and governance.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.782
Environment includes energy consumption,

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:29.166
water availability, waste and pollution,

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.985
just making efficient uses of resources.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.112
Social includes human capital,

00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:36.980
things like employee engagement

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.324
and innovation capacity,

00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:42.636
as well as supply chain management

00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:46.206
and labor rights and human rights.

00:02:46.206 --> 00:02:48.014
And governance relates to the oversight

00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:51.795
of companies by their boards and investors.

00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:54.906
See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:59.093
But ESG is the measure of sustainability,

00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:03.234
and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors

00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:07.351
with financial factors into the investment process.

00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:09.479
It means limiting future risk

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.088
by minimizing harm to people and planet,

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.703
and it means providing capital to users

00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:18.863
who deploy it towards productive

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:21.587
and sustainable outcomes.

00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:24.751
So if sustainability matters financially today,

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:27.243
and all signs indicate more tomorrow,

00:03:27.243 --> 00:03:30.741
is the private sector paying attention?

00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:36.722
Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.

00:03:36.722 --> 00:03:38.288
They started to see sustainability

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:42.532
not just as important but crucial to business success.

00:03:42.532 --> 00:03:44.946
About 80 percent of global CEOs

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:49.037
see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation

00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:51.430
and leading to competitive advantage

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.154
in their industries.

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:56.327
But 93 percent see ESG as the future,

00:03:56.327 --> 00:03:59.376
or as important to the future of their business.

00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:02.593
So the views of CEOs are clear.

00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:05.780
There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.308
So how are companies actually leveraging ESG

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:12.110
to drive hard business results?

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.631
One example is near and dear to our hearts.

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:18.065
In 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:19.711
to the cloud environment,

00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:22.140
and we retired another 85.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.846
We virtualized our operating system environments,

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:28.309
and we completed numerous automation projects.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.841
Now these initiatives create
a more mobile workplace,

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.625
and they reduce our real estate footprint,

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.265
and they yield savings of 23 million dollars

00:04:36.265 --> 00:04:39.265
in operating costs annually,

00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:41.101
and avoid the emissions

00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:45.551
of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.584
That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars

00:04:48.584 --> 00:04:50.373
off the road.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.012
So awesome, right?

00:04:53.012 --> 00:04:55.976
Another example is Pentair.

00:04:55.976 --> 00:04:58.305
Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,

00:04:58.305 --> 00:04:59.885
and about a decade ago,

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:02.372
they sold their core power tools business

00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:06.630
and reinvested those proceeds in a water business.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.593
That's a really big bet. Why did they do that?

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:13.321
Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,

00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:16.243
there's more growth in water than in power tools,

00:05:16.243 --> 00:05:18.165
and this company has their sights set

00:05:18.165 --> 00:05:20.532
on what they call "the new New World."

00:05:20.532 --> 00:05:22.915
That's four billion middle class people

00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:28.069
demanding food, energy and water.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.193
Now, you may be asking yourself,

00:05:31.193 --> 00:05:32.859
are these just isolated cases?

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:34.837
I mean, come on, really?

00:05:34.837 --> 00:05:36.846
Do companies that take sustainability into account

00:05:36.846 --> 00:05:39.032
really do well financially?

00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:41.878
The answer that may surprise you is yes.

00:05:41.878 --> 00:05:45.043
The data shows that stocks
with better ESG performance

00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:48.390
perform just as well as others.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.664
In blue, we see the MSCI World.

00:05:50.664 --> 00:05:52.101
It's an index of large companies

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.890
from developed markets across the world.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.362
And in gold, we see a subset of companies

00:05:57.362 --> 00:06:00.145
rated as having the best ESG performance.

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:04.396
Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff.

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:08.807
So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.

00:06:08.807 --> 00:06:11.370
In some cases, there may be outperformance

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.953
from ESG.

00:06:13.953 --> 00:06:16.131
In blue, we see the performance

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.546
of the 500 largest global companies,

00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:21.859
and in gold, we see a subset of companies

00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:24.682
with best practice in climate change strategy

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:26.115
and risk management.

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:27.545
Now over almost eight years,

00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:30.555
they've outperformed by about two thirds.

00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:34.449
So yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.978
But it does illustrate that environmental leadership

00:06:36.978 --> 00:06:40.051
is compatible with good returns.

00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:44.394
So if the returns are the same or better

00:06:44.394 --> 00:06:47.505
and the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?

00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:50.636
Are investors, particularly institutional investors,

00:06:50.636 --> 00:06:52.075
engaged?

00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:53.952
Well, some are,

00:06:53.952 --> 00:06:57.288
and a few are really at the vanguard.

00:06:57.288 --> 00:06:58.527
Hesta.

00:06:58.527 --> 00:07:00.774
Hesta is a retirement fund for health

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:03.469
and community services employees in Australia,

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:05.714
with assets of 22 billion [dollars].

00:07:05.714 --> 00:07:07.537
They believe that ESG has the potential

00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:09.605
to impact risks and returns,

00:07:09.605 --> 00:07:12.897
so incorporating it into the investment process

00:07:12.897 --> 00:07:15.113
is core to their duty

00:07:15.113 --> 00:07:17.271
to act in the best interest of fund members,

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.957
core to their duty.

00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:22.668
You gotta love the Aussies, right?

00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:25.176
CalPERS is another example.

00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:27.197
CalPERS is the pension fund

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.478
for public employees in California,

00:07:29.478 --> 00:07:32.194
and with assets of 244 billion [dollars],

00:07:32.194 --> 00:07:34.286
they are the second largest in the U.S.

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.983
and the sixth largest in the world.

00:07:36.983 --> 00:07:38.546
Now, they're moving toward 100 percent

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.135
sustainable investment

00:07:40.135 --> 00:07:42.217
by systematically integrated ESG

00:07:42.217 --> 00:07:44.966
across the entire fund.

00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:48.423
Why? They believe it's critical

00:07:48.423 --> 00:07:52.954
to superior long-term returns, full stop.

00:07:52.954 --> 00:07:55.546
In their own words, "long-term value creation

00:07:55.546 --> 00:07:57.586
requires the effective management

00:07:57.586 --> 00:07:59.728
of three forms of capital:

00:07:59.728 --> 00:08:04.447
financial, human, and physical.

00:08:04.447 --> 00:08:08.306
This is why we are concerned with ESG."

00:08:08.306 --> 00:08:10.714
Now, I do speak to a lot of investors

00:08:10.714 --> 00:08:12.441
as part of my job,

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:14.735
and not all of them see it this way.

00:08:14.735 --> 00:08:18.493
Often I hear, "We are required to maximize returns,

00:08:18.493 --> 00:08:20.243
so we don't do that here,"

00:08:20.243 --> 00:08:22.590
or, "We don't want to use the portfolio

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.094
to make policy statements."

00:08:25.094 --> 00:08:27.960
The one that just really gets under my skin is,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.012
"If you want to do something about that,

00:08:30.012 --> 00:08:33.475
just make money, give the profits to charities."

00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:37.244
It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:41.267
I mean, let me clarify something right here.

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:43.872
Companies and investors are not

00:08:43.872 --> 00:08:46.631
singularly responsible for the fate of the planet.

00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:49.019
They don't have indefinite social obligations,

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.792
and prudent investing and finance theory

00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:53.891
aren't subordinate to sustainability.

00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:55.547
They're compatible.

00:08:55.547 --> 00:09:00.012
So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.

00:09:00.012 --> 00:09:01.989
But institutional investors

00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:05.155
are the x-factor in sustainability.

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:07.218
Why do they hold the key?

00:09:07.218 --> 00:09:10.933
The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.

00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:13.619
(Laughter)

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.015
A lot of it.

00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:17.757
I mean, a really lot of it.

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.600
The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.658
The global bond market, 78 trillion.

00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:28.836
That's 133 trillion combined.

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.507
That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.

00:09:31.507 --> 00:09:33.726
That's the world's largest economy.

00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:37.563
That's some serious freaking firepower.

00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:39.612
So we can reconsider

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.535
some of these pressing challenges,

00:09:41.535 --> 00:09:44.049
like fresh water, clean air,

00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:46.074
feeding 10 billion mouths,

00:09:46.074 --> 00:09:47.751
if institutional investors

00:09:47.751 --> 00:09:50.163
integrated ESG into investment.

00:09:50.163 --> 00:09:52.314
What if they used that firepower

00:09:52.314 --> 00:09:54.358
to allocate more of their capital

00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:55.771
to companies working the hardest

00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.853
at solving these challenges

00:09:57.853 --> 00:10:00.969
or at least not exacerbating them?

00:10:00.969 --> 00:10:05.806
What if we work and save and invest,

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:08.439
only to find that the world we retire into

00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:12.165
is more stressed and less secure than it is now?

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:17.037
What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?

00:10:17.037 --> 00:10:19.525
Now a fair question might be,

00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:21.421
what if all this sustainability risk stuff

00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:25.957
is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,

00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:28.110
something for virtuous consumers

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.066
or lifestyle choice?

00:10:30.066 --> 00:10:32.805
Well, President John F. Kennedy said something

00:10:32.805 --> 00:10:36.290
about this that is just spot on:

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.102
"There are risks and costs to a program of action,

00:10:40.102 --> 00:10:42.751
but they are far less than the long-range risks

00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:47.366
and costs of comfortable inaction."

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:50.984
I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.619
but since this is based on
widespread scientific consensus,

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:57.180
the odds that it's not completely wrong

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.796
are better than the odds

00:10:58.796 --> 00:11:00.471
that our house will burn down

00:11:00.471 --> 00:11:02.406
or we'll get in a car accident.

00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:06.000
Well, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter)

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.303
But my point is that we buy insurance

00:11:09.303 --> 00:11:11.286
to protect ourselves financially

00:11:11.286 --> 00:11:14.489
in case those things happen, right?

00:11:14.489 --> 00:11:16.038
So by investing sustainably

00:11:16.038 --> 00:11:18.257
we're doing two things.

00:11:18.257 --> 00:11:20.415
We're creating insurance,

00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:24.661
reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,

00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:26.650
and at the same time, in the short term,

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.326
we're not sacrificing performance.

00:11:29.326 --> 00:11:34.083
[Man in comic: "What if it's a big hoax 
and we create a better world for nothing?"]

00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:36.199
Good, you like it. I like it too.

00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:37.776
(Laughter)

00:11:37.776 --> 00:11:39.849
I like it because it pokes fun

00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:42.444
at both sides of the climate change issue.

00:11:42.444 --> 00:11:45.788
I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.527
But what I really like about it

00:11:47.527 --> 00:11:50.456
is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,

00:11:50.456 --> 00:11:52.525
which is, "Plan for the future,

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:54.095
because that's where you're going to spend

00:11:54.095 --> 00:11:56.596
the rest of your life."

00:11:56.596 --> 00:11:58.955
Thank you.

00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:02.100
(Applause)
