00:00:00.903 --> 00:00:03.069
Thirteen years ago,

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:09.450
we set ourselves a goal to end poverty.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.069
After some success,

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.123
we've hit a big hurdle.

00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:17.644
The aftermath of the financial crisis

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:20.369
has begun to hit aid payments,

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.133
which have fallen for two consecutive years.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:29.112
My question is whether the lessons learned

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:33.032
from saving the financial system

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:36.514
can be used to help us overcome that hurdle

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:39.719
and help millions.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.629
Can we simply print money for aid?

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.136
"Surely not."

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:50.145
It's a common reaction.

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.167
(Laughter)

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.677
It's a quick talk.

00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:58.454
Others channel John McEnroe.

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:00.426
"You cannot be serious!"

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:05.357
Now, I can't do the accent, but I am serious,

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:09.357
thanks to these two children,

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:13.037
who, as you'll learn, are very much at the heart

00:01:13.037 --> 00:01:15.529
of my talk.

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:18.495
On the left, we have Pia.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.085
She lives in England.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:23.229
She has two loving parents,

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.129
one of whom is standing right here.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.521
Dorothy, on the right,

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:33.420
lives in rural Kenya.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.059
She's one of 13,000 orphans

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:37.564
and vulnerable children

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:42.912
who are assisted by a charity that I support.

00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:45.692
I do that because I believe

00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:48.013
that Dorothy, like Pia,

00:01:48.013 --> 00:01:51.351
deserves the best life chances

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:53.915
that we can afford to give her.

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:56.954
You'll all agree with me, I'm sure.

00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:59.564
The U.N. agrees too.

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:01.616
Their overriding aim

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:03.692
for international aid

00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:09.830
is to strive for a life of dignity for all.

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:14.354
But -- and here's that hurdle --

00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:18.904
can we afford our aid aspirations?

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:22.197
History suggests not.

00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:27.519
In 1970, governments set themselves a target

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.014
to increase overseas aid payments

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:32.283
to 0.7 percent

00:02:32.283 --> 00:02:33.922
of their national income.

00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:38.199
As you can see, a big gap opens up

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.793
between actual aid and that target.

00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:47.056
But then come the Millennium Development Goals,

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:49.465
eight ambitious targets

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:53.373
to be met by 2015.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:56.368
If I tell you that just one of those targets

00:02:56.368 --> 00:03:00.551
is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty,

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.369
you get a sense of the ambition.

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.974
There's also been some success.

00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:08.283
The number of people living

00:03:08.283 --> 00:03:14.259
on less than $1.25 a day has halved.

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.986
But a lot remains to be done in two years.

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:21.677
One in eight remain hungry.

00:03:21.677 --> 00:03:24.288
In the context of this auditorium,

00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:28.736
the front two rows aren't going to get any food.

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:30.894
We can't settle for that,

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:35.398
which is why the concern about the eighth goal,

00:03:35.398 --> 00:03:37.218
which relates to funding,

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:40.132
which I said at the beginning is falling,

00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:44.592
is so troubling.

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:46.646
So what can be done?

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:49.638
Well, I work in financial markets,

00:03:49.638 --> 00:03:52.089
not development.

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.126
I study the behavior of investors,

00:03:55.126 --> 00:04:00.712
how they react to policy and the economy.

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:05.345
It gives me a different angle on the aid issue.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.866
But it took an innocent question

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:10.501
from my then-four-year-old daughter

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:14.560
to make me appreciate that.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.755
Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe

00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:22.171
and we passed a man collecting for charity.

00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:23.722
I didn't have any change to give him,

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.223
and she was disappointed.

00:04:26.223 --> 00:04:30.001
Once in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book

00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:31.743
and starts scribbling.

00:04:31.743 --> 00:04:35.767
After a little while, I ask her what she's doing,

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:38.303
and she shows me a drawing

00:04:38.303 --> 00:04:40.515
of a Â£5 note

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:42.558
to give to the man outside.

00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:43.811
It's so sweet,

00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.911
and more generous than Dad would have been.

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.837
But of course I explained to her,

00:04:48.837 --> 00:04:51.340
"You can't do that; it's not allowed."

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.034
To which I get the classic four-year-old response:

00:04:56.034 --> 00:04:58.582
"Why not?"

00:04:58.582 --> 00:05:00.996
Now I'm excited, because I actually think

00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:02.837
I can answer this time.

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:05.752
So I launch into an explanation of how

00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:09.067
an unlimited supply of money

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:12.246
chasing a limited number of goods

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:17.180
sends prices to the moon.

00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:23.355
Something about that exchange stuck with me,

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:25.458
not because of the look of relief

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.721
on Pia's face when I finally finished,

00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:32.511
but because it related

00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:37.412
to the sanctity of the money supply,

00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:41.714
a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned

00:05:41.714 --> 00:05:44.633
by the reaction of central banks

00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:47.109
to the financial crisis.

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:49.676
To reassure investors,

00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:54.573
central banks began buying assets

00:05:54.573 --> 00:05:59.609
to try and encourage investors to do the same.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:03.207
They funded these purchases

00:06:03.207 --> 00:06:06.756
with money they created themselves.

00:06:06.756 --> 00:06:10.042
The money wasn't actually physically printed.

00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:13.656
It's still sort of locked away
in the banking system today.

00:06:13.656 --> 00:06:18.857
But the amount created was unprecedented.

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:22.362
Together, the central banks of the U.S.,

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:24.232
U.K and Japan

00:06:24.232 --> 00:06:27.622
increased the stock of money in their economies

00:06:27.622 --> 00:06:31.650
by 3.7 trillion dollars.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.105
That's three times, in fact
that's more than three times,

00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:39.917
the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation.

00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:44.165
Three times!

00:06:44.165 --> 00:06:46.075
Before the crisis,

00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:51.023
this would have been utterly unthinkable,

00:06:51.023 --> 00:06:58.487
yet it was accepted remarkably quickly.

00:06:58.487 --> 00:07:00.514
The price of gold,

00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:03.262
an asset thought to protect against inflation,

00:07:03.262 --> 00:07:06.088
did jump,

00:07:06.088 --> 00:07:08.886
but investors bought other assets

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.517
that offered little protection from inflation.

00:07:11.517 --> 00:07:15.061
They bought fixed income securities, bonds.

00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:17.828
They bought equities too.

00:07:17.828 --> 00:07:20.487
For all the scare stories,

00:07:20.487 --> 00:07:23.516
the actual actions of investors

00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:30.041
spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence.

00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:35.716
That confidence was based on two pillars.

00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:38.181
The first was that, after years

00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:41.437
of keeping inflation under control,

00:07:41.437 --> 00:07:44.244
central banks were trusted

00:07:44.244 --> 00:07:47.531
to take the money-printing away

00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:51.152
if inflation became a threat.

00:07:51.152 --> 00:07:57.381
Secondly, inflation simply never became a threat.

00:07:57.381 --> 00:07:59.249
As you can see, in the United States,

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:01.290
inflation for most of this period

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.747
remained below average.

00:08:04.747 --> 00:08:08.019
It was the same elsewhere.

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:11.436
So how does all this relate to aid?

00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:15.311
Well, this is where Dorothy

00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:17.777
and the Mango Tree charity

00:08:17.777 --> 00:08:20.335
that supports her comes in.

00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:22.432
I was at one of their fundraising events

00:08:22.432 --> 00:08:23.652
earlier this year,

00:08:23.652 --> 00:08:27.401
and I was inspired to give a one-off donation

00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:30.239
when I remembered that my firm

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:33.498
offers to match the charitable contributions

00:08:33.498 --> 00:08:36.241
its employees make.

00:08:36.241 --> 00:08:38.967
So think of this:

00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:41.254
Instead of just being able to help Dorothy

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.960
and four of her classmates

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.240
to go through secondary school for a few years,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.544
I was able to double my contribution.

00:08:50.544 --> 00:08:52.957
Brilliant.

00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:58.920
So following that conversation with my daughter,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.557
and seeing the absence of inflation

00:09:01.557 --> 00:09:03.504
in the face of money-printing,

00:09:03.504 --> 00:09:06.591
and knowing that international aid payments

00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:09.903
were falling at just the wrong time,

00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:13.864
this made me wonder:

00:09:13.864 --> 00:09:15.959
Could we match

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:22.009
but just on a much grander scale?

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:26.462
Let's call this scheme "Print Aid."

00:09:26.462 --> 00:09:29.120
And here's how it might work.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.277
Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so,

00:09:34.277 --> 00:09:36.587
the central bank would be mandated

00:09:36.587 --> 00:09:39.980
to match the government's overseas aid payments

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.447
up to a certain limit.

00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:44.520
Governments have been aiming to get aid

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.238
to 0.7 percent for years,

00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:49.123
so let's set the limit at half of that,

00:09:49.123 --> 00:09:53.232
0.35 percent of their income.

00:09:53.232 --> 00:09:55.304
So it would work like this: If in a given year

00:09:55.304 --> 00:09:57.990
the government gave 0.2 percent of its income

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.122
to overseas aid,

00:09:59.122 --> 00:10:00.605
the central bank would simply top it up

00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:03.781
with a further 0.2 percent.

00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:07.382
So far so good.

00:10:07.382 --> 00:10:10.062
How risky is this?

00:10:10.062 --> 00:10:14.304
Well, this involves the creation of money

00:10:14.304 --> 00:10:17.112
to buy goods, not assets.

00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:20.665
It sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it.

00:10:20.665 --> 00:10:25.093
But there are two important mitigating factors here.

00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:28.636
The first is that by definition,

00:10:28.636 --> 00:10:33.786
this money printed would be spent overseas.

00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:37.327
So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation

00:10:37.327 --> 00:10:41.736
in the country doing the actual printing

00:10:41.736 --> 00:10:46.670
unless it leads to a currency
depreciation of that country.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.963
That is unlikely for the second reason:

00:10:49.963 --> 00:10:52.844
the scale of the money that would be printed

00:10:52.844 --> 00:10:55.664
under this scheme.

00:10:55.664 --> 00:10:58.804
So let's think of an example

00:10:58.804 --> 00:11:02.347
where Print Aid was in place

00:11:02.347 --> 00:11:06.689
in the U.S., U.K. and Japan.

00:11:06.689 --> 00:11:08.992
To match the aid payments made

00:11:08.992 --> 00:11:11.728
by those governments over the last four years,

00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:13.955
Print Aid would have generated

00:11:13.955 --> 00:11:18.290
200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.477
What would that look like

00:11:20.477 --> 00:11:24.079
in the context of the increase in the money stock

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:26.355
that had already happened in those countries

00:11:26.355 --> 00:11:28.436
to save the financial system?

00:11:28.436 --> 00:11:31.593
Are you read for this?

00:11:31.593 --> 00:11:33.677
You might struggle to see that at the back,

00:11:33.677 --> 00:11:37.247
because the gap is quite small.

00:11:37.247 --> 00:11:39.695
So what we're saying here

00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:43.163
is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble

00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:45.539
to save our financial systems,

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:47.594
and you know what, it paid off.

00:11:47.594 --> 00:11:50.167
There was no inflation.

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:53.473
Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk

00:11:53.473 --> 00:11:58.125
to print an extra 200 billion for aid?

00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:00.034
Would the risks really be that different?

00:12:00.034 --> 00:12:02.577
To me, it's not that clear.

00:12:02.577 --> 00:12:05.935
What is clear is the impact on aid.

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:08.051
Even though this is the printing

00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:09.887
of just three central banks,

00:12:09.887 --> 00:12:13.508
the global aid that's given

00:12:13.508 --> 00:12:18.429
over this period is up by almost 40 percent.

00:12:18.429 --> 00:12:20.860
Aid as a proportion of national income

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.310
all of a sudden is at a 40-year high.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.297
Now, we don't get to 0.7 percent.

00:12:27.297 --> 00:12:30.042
Governments are still incentivized to give.

00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:34.535
But you know what, that's the 
point of a matching scheme.

00:12:34.535 --> 00:12:38.350
So I think what we've learned

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.944
is that the risks from this money creation scheme

00:12:42.944 --> 00:12:45.725
are quite modest,

00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:48.525
but the benefits

00:12:48.525 --> 00:12:50.991
are potentially huge.

00:12:50.991 --> 00:12:54.294
Imagine what we could do
with 40 percent more funding.

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:59.265
We might be able to feed the front row.

00:12:59.265 --> 00:13:01.963
The thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear,

00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:03.687
apart from the fact that I've run out of time,

00:13:03.687 --> 00:13:08.404
is that the window of opportunity for this idea

00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:11.237
is a short one.

00:13:11.237 --> 00:13:15.062
Today, money creation by central banks

00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:17.976
is an accepted policy tool.

00:13:17.976 --> 00:13:20.457
That may not always be the case.

00:13:20.457 --> 00:13:24.820
Today there are universally agreed aims

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.711
for international aid.

00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:30.331
That may not always be the case.

00:13:30.331 --> 00:13:32.969
Today might be the only time

00:13:32.969 --> 00:13:35.852
that these two things coincide,

00:13:35.852 --> 00:13:39.827
such that we can afford the aid

00:13:39.827 --> 00:13:43.470
that we've always aspired to give.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:51.900
So, can we print money for international aid?

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.638
I seriously believe the question should be,

00:13:55.638 --> 00:13:57.701
why not?

00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:00.514
Thank you very much.

00:14:00.514 --> 00:14:06.198
