00:00:01.636 --> 00:00:05.231
What makes a great leader today?

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:07.874
Many of us carry this image

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:11.194
of this all-knowing superhero

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:13.642
who stands and commands

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:17.271
and protects his followers.

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:21.567
But that's kind of an image from another time,

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:23.818
and what's also outdated

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:26.220
are the leadership development programs

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.603
that are based on success models

00:00:28.603 --> 00:00:32.785
for a world that was, not a world that is

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:34.949
or that is coming.

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.360
We conducted a study of 4,000 companies,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.367
and we asked them, let's see the effectiveness

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.958
of your leadership development programs.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.146
Fifty-eight percent of the companies

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.514
cited significant talent gaps

00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:51.869
for critical leadership roles.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:55.308
That means that despite
corporate training programs,

00:00:55.308 --> 00:00:59.745
off-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things,

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:01.686
more than half the companies

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:06.543
had failed to grow enough great leaders.

00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:08.566
You may be asking yourself,

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.297
is my company helping me to prepare

00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:14.540
to be a great 21st-century leader?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.952
The odds are, probably not.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:22.015
Now, I've spent 25 years of my professional life

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.520
observing what makes great leaders.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.985
I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies,

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:30.054
I've advised over 200 CEOs,

00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:32.813
and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:35.823
than you can imagine.

00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:39.548
But a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend

00:01:39.548 --> 00:01:42.763
in leadership preparation.

00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:46.589
I noticed that, despite all the efforts,

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:49.128
there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing

00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:51.252
about individuals.

00:01:51.252 --> 00:01:54.886
One story was about Chris,

00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:57.230
a high-potential, superstar leader

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.832
who moves to a new unit and fails,

00:02:00.832 --> 00:02:03.568
destroying unrecoverable value.

00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:07.161
And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO,

00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.863
who was so frustrated

00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:10.930
because her company is cited

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.259
as a best company for leaders,

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.096
but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:19.681
to lead their crucial initiatives.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.638
And then there were stories

00:02:21.638 --> 00:02:24.168
like the senior leadership team

00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:26.248
of a once-thriving business

00:02:26.248 --> 00:02:29.704
that's surprised by a market shift,

00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:32.435
finds itself having to force the company

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:34.763
to reduce its size in half

00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:37.576
or go out of business.

00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:40.294
Now, these recurring stories

00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:42.861
cause me to ask two questions.

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:45.332
Why are the leadership gaps widening

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.265
when there's so much more investment

00:02:47.265 --> 00:02:49.489
in leadership development?

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.786
And what are the great leaders doing

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:56.661
distinctly different to thrive and grow?

00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:59.030
One of the things that I did,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.706
I was so consumed by these questions

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:04.650
and also frustrated by those stories,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.058
that I left my job

00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:09.638
so that I could study this full time,

00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:12.583
and I took a year to travel

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.603
to different parts of the world

00:03:14.603 --> 00:03:16.989
to learn about effective and ineffective

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.374
leadership practices in companies,

00:03:19.374 --> 00:03:22.877
countries and nonprofit organizations.

00:03:22.877 --> 00:03:26.204
And so I did things like travel to South Africa,

00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:29.130
where I had an opportunity to understand

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.604
how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time

00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:33.495
in anticipating and navigating

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:36.912
his political, social and economic context.

00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:39.935
I also met a number of nonprofit leaders

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:43.905
who, despite very limited financial resources,

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.848
were making a huge impact in the world,

00:03:46.848 --> 00:03:50.710
often bringing together seeming adversaries.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.765
And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:58.097
trying to understand how the environment

00:03:58.097 --> 00:03:59.255
had shaped the leaders,

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:00.858
the moves that they made,

00:04:00.858 --> 00:04:02.384
and then the impact of those moves

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:05.311
beyond their tenure.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.312
And then, when I returned to work full time,

00:04:08.312 --> 00:04:11.601
in this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:15.093
who were also interested in these questions.

00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:18.038
Now, from all this, I distilled

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:22.042
the characteristics of leaders who are thriving

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:23.868
and what they do differently,

00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:26.321
and then I also distilled

00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:29.263
the preparation practices that enable people

00:04:29.263 --> 00:04:31.904
to grow to their potential.

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.852
I want to share some of those with you now.

00:04:33.852 --> 00:04:35.927
("What makes a great leader in the 21st century?")

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:39.292
In a 21st-century world, which is more global,

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:41.743
digitally enabled and transparent,

00:04:41.743 --> 00:04:45.156
with faster speeds of information 
flow and innovation,

00:04:45.156 --> 00:04:47.451
and where nothing big gets done

00:04:47.451 --> 00:04:50.687
without some kind of a complex matrix,

00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:54.347
relying on traditional development practices

00:04:54.347 --> 00:04:57.005
will stunt your growth as a leader.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.852
In fact, traditional assessments

00:04:59.852 --> 00:05:04.195
like narrow 360 surveys or
outdated performance criteria

00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:06.233
will give you false positives,

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:09.659
lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.799
than you really are.

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:15.692
Leadership in the 21st century is defined

00:05:15.692 --> 00:05:18.846
and evidenced by three questions.

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:20.180
Where are you looking

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.256
to anticipate the next change

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:26.729
to your business model or your life?

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.579
The answer to this question is on your calendar.

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:35.520
Who are you spending time with? On what topics?

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.068
Where are you traveling? What are you reading?

00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:39.815
And then how are you distilling this

00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:43.522
into understanding potential discontinuities,

00:05:43.522 --> 00:05:45.774
and then making a decision to do something

00:05:45.774 --> 00:05:50.188
right now so that you're prepared and ready?

00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:53.190
There's a leadership team that does a practice

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.162
where they bring together each member

00:05:56.162 --> 00:05:58.969
collecting, here are trends that impact me,

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.254
here are trends that impact another team member,

00:06:01.254 --> 00:06:02.653
and they share these,

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:05.449
and then make decisions,
to course-correct a strategy

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.706
or to anticipate a new move.

00:06:08.706 --> 00:06:11.759
Great leaders are not head-down.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.004
They see around corners,

00:06:14.004 --> 00:06:17.913
shaping their future, not just reacting to it.

00:06:17.913 --> 00:06:19.868
The second question is,

00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:21.887
what is the diversity measure

00:06:21.887 --> 00:06:25.506
of your personal and professional
stakeholder network?

00:06:25.506 --> 00:06:28.508
You know, we hear often about 
good ol' boy networks

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:32.416
and they're certainly alive and 
well in many institutions.

00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:34.967
But to some extent, we all have a network

00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:36.896
of people that we're comfortable with.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.808
So this question is about your capacity

00:06:39.808 --> 00:06:42.307
to develop relationships with people

00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:43.830
that are very different than you.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.823
And those differences can be biological,

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:51.607
physical, functional, political, 
cultural, socioeconomic.

00:06:51.607 --> 00:06:55.050
And yet, despite all these differences,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.807
they connect with you

00:06:56.807 --> 00:06:58.061
and they trust you enough

00:06:58.061 --> 00:06:59.343
to cooperate with you

00:06:59.343 --> 00:07:02.481
in achieving a shared goal.

00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.816
Great leaders understand

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:07.745
that having a more diverse network

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:11.286
is a source of pattern identification

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:14.071
at greater levels and also of solutions,

00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:15.895
because you have people that are thinking

00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:18.580
differently than you are.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.930
Third question: are you courageous enough

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:27.832
to abandon a practice that has 
made you successful in the past?

00:07:27.832 --> 00:07:31.981
There's an expression: Go along to get along.

00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:34.899
But if you follow this advice,

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:37.291
chances are as a leader,

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:41.806
you're going to keep doing
what's familiar and comfortable.

00:07:41.806 --> 00:07:44.659
Great leaders dare to be different.

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:46.304
They don't just talk about risk-taking,

00:07:46.304 --> 00:07:48.122
they actually do it.

00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:51.034
And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that

00:07:51.034 --> 00:07:53.611
the most impactful development comes

00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:56.915
when you are able to build the emotional stamina

00:07:56.915 --> 00:08:01.075
to withstand people telling you that your new idea

00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:05.793
is naïve or reckless or just plain stupid.

00:08:05.793 --> 00:08:09.655
Now interestingly, the people who will join you

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:13.110
are not your usual suspects in your network.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.761
They're often people that think differently

00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:19.633
and therefore are willing to join you

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.992
in taking a courageous leap.

00:08:21.992 --> 00:08:25.243
And it's a leap, not a step.

00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:28.152
More than traditional leadership programs,

00:08:28.152 --> 00:08:30.034
answering these three questions

00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:31.417
will determine your effectiveness

00:08:31.417 --> 00:08:34.886
as a 21st-century leader.

00:08:34.886 --> 00:08:39.307
So what makes a great leader in the 21st century?

00:08:39.307 --> 00:08:42.856
I've met many, and they stand out.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.507
They are women and men

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:46.273
who are preparing themselves

00:08:46.273 --> 00:08:49.392
not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday

00:08:49.392 --> 00:08:53.168
but also for the realities of today

00:08:53.168 --> 00:08:57.429
and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.

00:08:57.429 --> 00:08:59.856
Thank you.

00:08:59.856 --> 00:09:02.534
(Applause)
