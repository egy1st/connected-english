WEBVTT

00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:01.715
I'm going to go off script

00:00:01.715 --> 00:00:03.766
and make Chris quite nervous here

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.114
by making this audience participation.

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:09.297
All right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right.

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:11.741
So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand

00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.797
if you've ever heard a
heterosexual couple having sex.

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:18.348
Could be the neighbors, hotel room,

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:20.355
your parents. Sorry.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.107
Okay. Pretty much everybody.

00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:23.934
Now raise your hand if the man was making

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:27.363
more noise than the woman.

00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:29.676
I see one guy there.

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:31.923
It doesn't count if it was you, sir.

00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:32.938
(Laughter)

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:36.448
So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay.

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:38.524
Sitting next to a loud guy.

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.148
Now what does this tell us?

00:00:40.148 --> 00:00:41.994
It tells us that human beings

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:43.362
make noise when they have sex,

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:45.488
and it's generally the woman who makes more noise.

00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:48.542
This is known as female copulatory vocalization

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:49.965
to the clipboard crowd.

00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:51.596
I wasn't even going to mention this,

00:00:51.596 --> 00:00:54.537
but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here,

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:57.141
and she is the world's most famous

00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.090
female copulatory vocalizer.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.490
So I thought, got to talk about that.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.203
We'll get back to that a little bit later.

00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:06.168
Let me start by saying human beings

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:08.269
are not descended from apes,

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.501
despite what you may have heard. We are apes.

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.337
We are more closely related
to the chimp and the bonobo

00:01:13.337 --> 00:01:16.717
than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant,

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:19.915
as Jared Diamond pointed
out in one of his early books.

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:24.110
We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.611
than chimps and bonobos are related

00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:27.273
to any other primate --

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:29.549
gorillas, orangutans, what have you.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.796
So we're extremely closely related to them,

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:35.222
and as you'll see in terms of our behavior,

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:37.589
we've got some relationship as well.

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:39.508
So what I'm asking today, the question

00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:42.570
I want to explore with you today is,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.738
what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?

00:01:46.738 --> 00:01:48.956
Now, since Darwin's day there's been

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:50.458
what Cacilda and I have called

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.144
the standard narrative of human sexual evolution,

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:54.698
and you're all familiar with it,

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.261
even if you haven't read this stuff.

00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:00.329
The idea is that, as part of human nature,

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.318
from the beginning of our species' time,

00:02:02.318 --> 00:02:06.812
men have sort of leased
women's reproductive potential

00:02:06.812 --> 00:02:10.207
by providing them with certain goods and services.

00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:13.877
Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status,

00:02:13.877 --> 00:02:16.508
protection, things like that.

00:02:16.508 --> 00:02:18.843
And in exchange, women have offered fidelity,

00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:21.221
or at least a promise of fidelity.

00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:25.491
Now this sets men and women up
in an oppositional relationship.

00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:31.434
The war between the sexes is built right into
our DNA, according to this vision. Right?

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:35.371
What Cacilda and I have argued is that no,

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.812
this economic relationship,

00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:39.637
this oppositional relationship,

00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:42.262
is actually an artifact of agriculture,

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:45.938
which only arose about 10,000
years ago at the earliest.

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:48.105
Anatomically modern human beings

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.104
have been around for about 200,000 years,

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.726
so we're talking about five percent, at most,

00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:58.414
of our time as a modern, distinct species.

00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:01.948
So before agriculture,

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.953
before the agricultural revolution,

00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:06.064
it's important to understand that human beings

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:09.398
lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:12.414
characterized wherever they're found in the world

00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:17.005
by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism.

00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:18.873
They not only share things,

00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:21.382
they demand that things be shared:

00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:23.641
meat, shelter, protection, all these things

00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:26.650
that were supposedly being traded to women

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.480
for their sexual fidelity, it turns out,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.210
are shared widely among these societies.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.398
Now I'm not saying that our ancestors

00:03:34.398 --> 00:03:36.359
were noble savages, and I'm not saying

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.155
modern day hunter-gatherers
are noble savages either.

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:41.166
What I'm saying is that this is simply

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:43.606
the best way to mitigate risk

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:45.536
in a foraging context.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:48.652
And there's really no argument
about this among anthropologists.

00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:53.216
All Cacilda and I have done is extend
this sharing behavior to sexuality.

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:55.651
So we've argued that human sexuality

00:03:55.651 --> 00:04:00.135
has essentially evolved, until agriculture,

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.281
as a way of establishing and maintaining

00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:07.007
the complex, flexible social systems, networks,

00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:09.918
that our ancestors were very good at,

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:14.534
and that's why our species has survived so well.

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:16.751
Now, this makes some people uncomfortable,

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:19.136
and so I always need to take 
a moment in these talks

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:20.980
to say, listen,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.623
I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous,

00:04:23.623 --> 00:04:25.958
but I'm not saying they were
having sex with strangers.

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.984
There were no strangers. Right?

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:29.828
In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers.

00:04:29.828 --> 00:04:31.817
You've known these people your entire life.

00:04:31.817 --> 00:04:35.276
So I'm saying, yes, there were
overlapping sexual relationships,

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:39.583
that our ancestors probably had
several different sexual relationships

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:42.970
going on at any given moment in their adult lives.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.373
But I'm not saying they were
having sex with strangers.

00:04:45.373 --> 00:04:48.484
I'm not saying that they didn't love the
people they were having sex with.

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:51.389
And I'm not saying there was
no pair-bonding going on.

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.475
I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive.

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:58.159
And those of us who have
chosen to be monogamous --

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.497
my parents, for example, have been married

00:05:00.497 --> 00:05:03.005
for 52 years monogamously,

00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:05.367
and if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad,

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:07.714
I don't want to hear about itâ€”

00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:10.106
I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying

00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:11.662
there's anything wrong with this.

00:05:11.662 --> 00:05:13.821
What I'm saying is that to argue

00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:18.495
that our ancestors were sexual omnivores

00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:20.782
is no more a criticism of monogamy

00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:24.250
than to argue that our ancestors
were dietary omnivores

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.573
is a criticism of vegetarianism.

00:05:27.573 --> 00:05:29.454
You can choose to be a vegetarian,

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.198
but don't think that just because
you've made that decision,

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.990
bacon suddenly stops smelling good.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.677
Okay? So this is my point.

00:05:37.677 --> 00:05:40.028
(Laughter)

00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:43.649
That one took a minute to sink in, huh?

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:45.979
Now, in addition to being a great genius,

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.044
a wonderful man, a wonderful husband,

00:05:48.044 --> 00:05:49.824
a wonderful father, Charles Darwin

00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:53.936
was also a world-class Victorian prude.

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:55.876
All right? He was perplexed

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:58.486
by the sexual swellings of certain primates,

00:05:58.486 --> 00:06:00.029
including chimps and bonobos,

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.567
because these sexual swellings tend to provoke

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:05.159
many males to mate with the females.

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.330
So he couldn't understand why on Earth would
the female have developed this thing

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.259
if all they were supposed to be doing
is forming their pair bond, right?

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.698
Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this,

00:06:14.698 --> 00:06:16.646
but chimps and bonobos mate

00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:18.300
one to four times per hour

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.716
with up to a dozen males per day

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:24.332
when they have their sexual swellings.

00:06:24.332 --> 00:06:26.987
Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:28.789
through 40 percent, roughly,

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.674
of their menstrual cycle,

00:06:30.674 --> 00:06:33.374
bonobos 90 percent,

00:06:33.374 --> 00:06:36.796
and humans are among the
only species on the planet

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:38.898
where the female is available for sex

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.886
throughout the menstrual cycle,

00:06:40.886 --> 00:06:43.630
whether she's menstruating,
whether she's post-menopausal,

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.941
whether she's already pregnant.

00:06:44.941 --> 00:06:48.785
This is vanishingly rare among mammals.

00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:52.578
So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:55.253
Now, Darwin ignored the reflections

00:06:55.253 --> 00:06:58.821
of the sexual swelling in his own day,

00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:02.452
as scientists tend to do sometimes.

00:07:02.452 --> 00:07:04.957
So what we're talking about is sperm competition.

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:08.367
Now the average human ejaculate
has about 300 million sperm cells,

00:07:08.367 --> 00:07:10.797
so it's already a competitive environment.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:14.010
The question is whether these sperm are 
competing against other men's sperm

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.815
or just their own.

00:07:15.815 --> 00:07:17.921
There's a lot to talk about in this chart.

00:07:17.921 --> 00:07:20.096
The one thing I'll call your attention to right away

00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:24.138
is the little musical note above the
female chimp and bonobo and human.

00:07:24.138 --> 00:07:27.439
That indicates female copulatory vocalization.

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.041
Just look at the numbers.

00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:31.237
The average human has sex

00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:34.879
about 1,000 times per birth.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.052
If that number seems high for some of you,

00:07:37.052 --> 00:07:40.265
I assure you it seems low for others in the room.

00:07:40.265 --> 00:07:43.215
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.

00:07:43.215 --> 00:07:45.517
We don't share it with the other three apes,

00:07:45.517 --> 00:07:47.773
the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon,

00:07:47.773 --> 00:07:49.434
who are more typical of mammals,

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:52.626
having sex only about a dozen times per birth.

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:56.839
Humans and bonobos are the only 
animals that have sex face-to-face

00:07:56.847 --> 00:07:59.253
when both of them are alive.

00:07:59.253 --> 00:08:03.158
(Laughter)

00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:07.066
And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo

00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:09.462
all have external testicles, which in our book

00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:13.450
we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.710
just for beer.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.436
If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge

00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:20.778
in the garage, you expect a party to happen

00:08:20.778 --> 00:08:22.567
at any moment, and you need to be ready.

00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:24.722
That's what the external testicles are.

00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:27.132
They keep the sperm cells cool

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.350
so you can have frequent ejaculations.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.089
I'm sorry. It's true.

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:36.178
The human, some of you will be happy to hear,

00:08:36.178 --> 00:08:38.989
has the largest, thickest penis of any primate.

00:08:38.989 --> 00:08:41.499
Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.

00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:44.060
It goes into anthropology as well.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.677
Historical records are full of accounts of people

00:08:46.677 --> 00:08:48.486
around the world who have sexual practices

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.116
that should be impossible

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:54.042
given what we have assumed
about human sexual evolution.

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:56.742
These women are the Mosuo
from southwestern China.

00:08:56.742 --> 00:08:59.309
In their society, everyone, men and women,

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:01.050
are completely sexually autonomous.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.009
There's no shame associated with sexual behavior.

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.255
Women have hundreds of partners.

00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:09.437
It doesn't matter. Nobody cares.
Nobody gossips. It's not an issue.

00:09:09.437 --> 00:09:11.233
When the woman becomes pregnant,

00:09:11.233 --> 00:09:14.091
the child is cared for by her, 
her sisters, and her brothers.

00:09:14.091 --> 00:09:16.930
The biological father is a nonissue.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.336
On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon,

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:22.205
we've got many tribes which practice

00:09:22.205 --> 00:09:24.937
what anthropologists call partible paternity.

00:09:24.937 --> 00:09:27.534
These people actually believe --

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:29.249
and they have no contact among them,

00:09:29.249 --> 00:09:30.905
no common language or anything,

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:32.642
so it's not an idea that spread,

00:09:32.642 --> 00:09:34.779
it's an idea that's arisen around the world --

00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:36.936
they believe that a fetus is literally made

00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:39.212
of accumulated semen.

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:41.200
So a woman who wants to have a child

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.032
who's smart and funny and strong

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:45.163
makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy,

00:09:45.163 --> 00:09:47.107
the funny guy and the strong guy,

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:49.331
to get the essence of each of
these men into the baby,

00:09:49.331 --> 00:09:51.843
and then when the child is born,

00:09:51.843 --> 00:09:53.985
these different men will come forward

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:56.855
and acknowledge their paternity of the child.

00:09:56.855 --> 00:09:59.693
So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor

00:09:59.693 --> 00:10:01.309
in this society.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.297
So there are all sorts of examples like this

00:10:03.297 --> 00:10:05.747
that we go through in the book.

00:10:05.747 --> 00:10:09.207
Now, why does this matter?

00:10:09.207 --> 00:10:11.767
Edward Wilson says we need to understand

00:10:11.767 --> 00:10:14.813
that human sexuality is first a bonding device

00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:17.648
and only secondarily procreation.

00:10:17.648 --> 00:10:19.832
I think that's true. This matters because

00:10:19.832 --> 00:10:22.870
our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.457
with many aspects of the modern world.

00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:27.595
The contradictions between what we're told

00:10:27.595 --> 00:10:31.022
we should feel and what we actually do feel

00:10:31.022 --> 00:10:36.159
generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:38.575
My hope is that a more accurate,

00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:40.950
updated understanding of human sexuality

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.970
will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves,

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.567
for each other,

00:10:45.567 --> 00:10:49.190
greater respect for unconventional
relationship configurations

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.471
like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions,

00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:57.819
and that we'll finally put to rest the idea

00:10:57.819 --> 00:11:00.393
that men have some innate, instinctive right

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:04.621
to monitor and control women's sexual behavior.

00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:07.613
(Applause)

00:11:07.613 --> 00:11:09.767
Thank you.

00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:12.023
And we'll see that it's not only gay people

00:11:12.023 --> 00:11:13.692
that have to come out of the closet.

00:11:13.692 --> 00:11:17.221
We all have closets we have to come out of. Right?

00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:18.982
And when we do come out of those closets,

00:11:18.982 --> 00:11:22.541
we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other,

00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:27.045
our fight is with an outdated, 
Victorian sense of human sexuality

00:11:27.045 --> 00:11:30.600
that conflates desire with property rights,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.365
generates shame and confusion

00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:36.200
in place of understanding and empathy.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.916
It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus,

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:40.646
because the truth is

00:11:40.646 --> 00:11:41.983
that men are from Africa

00:11:41.983 --> 00:11:43.979
and women are from Africa.

00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:45.924
Thank you.

00:11:45.924 --> 00:11:51.383
(Applause)

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.024
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Christopher Ryan: Thank you.

00:11:57.024 --> 00:11:58.766
CA: So a question.

00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:02.665
It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments

00:12:02.665 --> 00:12:05.732
about evolutionary history

00:12:05.732 --> 00:12:08.316
to turn that into what we ought to do today.

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:10.722
Someone could give a talk and say,

00:12:10.722 --> 00:12:13.467
look at us, we've got these really sharp teeth

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:15.194
and muscles and a brain that's really good

00:12:15.194 --> 00:12:16.755
at throwing weapons,

00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:19.819
and if you look at lots of societies around the world,

00:12:19.819 --> 00:12:22.105
you'll see very high rates of violence.

00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:25.274
Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism,

00:12:25.274 --> 00:12:27.418
but it's not who you are.

00:12:27.418 --> 00:12:29.468
How is that different

00:12:29.468 --> 00:12:32.833
from the talk you gave?

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:36.017
CR: Well first of all, the evidence

00:12:36.017 --> 00:12:38.792
for high levels of violence in prehistory

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:41.398
is very debatable.

00:12:41.398 --> 00:12:43.599
But that's just an example.

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:47.203
Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me,

00:12:47.203 --> 00:12:49.743
just because we lived a certain way in the past

00:12:49.743 --> 00:12:52.942
doesn't mean we should live that 
way now, and I agree with that.

00:12:52.942 --> 00:12:55.469
Everyone has to respond to the modern world.

00:12:55.469 --> 00:12:59.891
But the body does have its inherent

00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:02.748
evolved trajectories.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:06.228
And so you could live on
McDonald's and milkshakes,

00:13:06.228 --> 00:13:09.684
but your body will rebel against 
that. We have appetites.

00:13:09.702 --> 00:13:11.390
I think it was Schopenhauer who said,

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.254
a person can do what they want

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:16.311
but not want what they want.

00:13:16.311 --> 00:13:18.034
And so what I'm arguing against

00:13:18.034 --> 00:13:20.498
is the shame that's associated with desires.

00:13:20.498 --> 00:13:23.857
It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife

00:13:23.857 --> 00:13:26.067
but you still are attracted to other people,

00:13:26.067 --> 00:13:27.566
there's something wrong with you,

00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:29.503
there's something wrong with your marriage,

00:13:29.503 --> 00:13:30.963
something wrong with your partner.

00:13:30.963 --> 00:13:32.986
I think a lot of families are fractured

00:13:32.986 --> 00:13:34.971
by unrealistic expectations

00:13:34.971 --> 00:13:38.016
that are based upon this false
vision of human sexuality.

00:13:38.016 --> 00:13:39.480
That's what I'm trying to get at.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.979
CA: Thank you. Communicated
powerfully. Thanks a lot.

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:45.970
CR: Thank you, Chris.
(Applause)
