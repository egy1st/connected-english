WEBVTT

00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:02.405
I'm very pleased to be here today

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:04.959
to talk to you all about how we might repair

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:06.995
the damaged brain,

00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:09.237
and I'm particularly excited by this field,

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:11.722
because as a neurologist myself,

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.523
I believe that this offers one of the great ways

00:00:13.523 --> 00:00:15.455
that we might be able to offer hope

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:18.028
for patients who today live with devastating

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:21.986
and yet untreatable diseases of the brain.

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:24.076
So here's the problem.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.876
You can see here the picture of somebody's brain

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:28.408
with Alzheimer's disease

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:30.327
next to a healthy brain,

00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:32.943
and what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain,

00:00:32.943 --> 00:00:37.661
ringed red, there's obvious
damage -- atrophy, scarring.

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:39.378
And I could show you equivalent pictures

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:41.605
from other disease: multiple sclerosis,

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:44.123
motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease,

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:46.260
even Huntington's disease,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.229
and they would all tell a similar story.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.369
And collectively these brain disorders represent

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:54.935
one of the major public health threats of our time.

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:59.183
And the numbers here are really rather staggering.

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:02.375
At any one time, there are 35 million people today

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.332
living with one of these brain diseases,

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.871
and the annual cost globally

00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:09.891
is 700 billion dollars.

00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:11.753
I mean, just think about that.

00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:13.240
That's greater than one percent

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.986
of the global GDP.

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:17.892
And it gets worse,

00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:20.054
because all these numbers are rising

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.512
because these are by and large

00:01:21.512 --> 00:01:24.700
age-related diseases, and we're living longer.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.095
So the question we really need to ask ourselves is,

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:31.092
why, given the devastating impact of these diseases

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:32.572
to the individual,

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:35.325
never mind the scale of the societal problem,

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:38.906
why are there no effective treatments?

00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:40.884
Now in order to consider this,

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:43.167
I first need to give you a crash course

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:45.492
in how the brain works.

00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:47.378
So in other words, I need to tell you

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.434
everything I learned at medical school.

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:51.474
(Laughter)

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:53.712
But believe me, this isn't going to take very long.

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:56.167
Okay? (Laughter)

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:58.136
So the brain is terribly simple:

00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:01.183
it's made up of four cells,

00:02:01.183 --> 00:02:02.985
and two of them are shown here.

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:04.498
There's the nerve cell,

00:02:04.498 --> 00:02:06.038
and then there's the myelinating cell,

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:07.536
or the insulating cell.

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:10.026
It's called oligodendrocyte.

00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:11.815
And when these four cells work together

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:13.674
in health and harmony,

00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:17.642
they create an extraordinary
symphony of electrical activity,

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:19.882
and it is this electrical activity

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:23.255
that underpins our ability to think, to emote,

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:26.599
to remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.940
But equally, each of these individual four cells

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.030
alone or together, can go rogue or die,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.275
and when that happens, you get damage.

00:02:37.275 --> 00:02:38.490
You get damaged wiring.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.554
You get disrupted connections.

00:02:41.554 --> 00:02:45.712
And that's evident here with the slower conduction.

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:48.175
But ultimately, this damage will manifest

00:02:48.175 --> 00:02:50.657
as disease, clearly.

00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:53.755
And if the starting dying nerve cell

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:55.571
is a motor nerve, for example,

00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:57.986
you'll get motor neuron disease.

00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:00.609
So I'd like to give you a real-life illustration

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.017
of what happens with motor neuron disease.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.546
So this is a patient of mine called John.

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:09.559
John I saw just last week in the clinic.

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.183
And I've asked John to tell us something 
about what were his problems

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:15.082
that led to the initial diagnosis

00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:16.721
of motor neuron disease.

00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.670
John: I was diagnosed in October in 2011,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.250
and the main problem was a breathing problem,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.943
difficulty breathing.

00:03:26.943 --> 00:03:29.203
Siddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you
caught all of that, but what John was telling us

00:03:29.203 --> 00:03:31.443
was that difficulty with breathing

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:33.537
led eventually to the diagnosis

00:03:33.537 --> 00:03:36.390
of motor neuron disease.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.954
So John's now 18 months
further down in that journey,

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:42.187
and I've now asked him to tell us something about

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:44.476
his current predicament.

00:03:44.476 --> 00:03:47.336
John: What I've got now is 
the breathing's gotten worse.

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:53.033
I've got weakness in my hands, 
my arms and my legs.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:57.853
So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.

00:03:57.853 --> 00:04:00.679
SC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.803
most of the time.

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:05.021
So what these two clips show

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.777
is not just the devastating
consequence of the disease,

00:04:07.777 --> 00:04:09.320
but they also tell us something about

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.620
the shocking pace of the disease,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.932
because in just 18 months,

00:04:14.932 --> 00:04:17.628
a fit adult man has been rendered

00:04:17.628 --> 00:04:20.959
wheelchair- and respirator-dependent.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.264
And let's face it, John could be anybody's father,

00:04:23.264 --> 00:04:25.451
brother or friend.

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:27.704
So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:32.304
But what happens when that myelin cell dies?

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:34.524
You get multiple sclerosis.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.343
So the scan on your left

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:39.066
is an illustration of the brain,

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:41.917
and it's a map of the connections of the brain,

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:43.884
and superimposed upon which

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:45.258
are areas of damage.

00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:47.449
We call them lesions of demyelination.

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.281
But they're damage, and they're white.

00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:51.796
So I know what you're thinking here.

00:04:51.796 --> 00:04:54.304
You're thinking, "My God, this bloke came up

00:04:54.304 --> 00:04:56.235
and said he's going to talk about hope,

00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:58.744
and all he's done is give a really rather bleak

00:04:58.744 --> 00:05:00.308
and depressing tale."

00:05:00.308 --> 00:05:01.903
I've told you these diseases are terrible.

00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:04.564
They're devastating, numbers are rising,

00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:06.691
the costs are ridiculous, and worst of all,

00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:08.977
we have no treatment. Where's the hope?

00:05:08.977 --> 00:05:11.522
Well, you know what? I think there is hope.

00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:13.916
And there's hope in this next section,

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:16.211
of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,

00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:17.739
because what it illustrates

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:20.212
is, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.

00:05:20.212 --> 00:05:22.790
It just doesn't do it well enough.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.915
And so again, there are two
things I want to show you.

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:28.341
First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.

00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:31.824
And again, it's another one of these white masses.

00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:35.262
But crucially, the area that's ringed red

00:05:35.262 --> 00:05:37.485
highlights an area that is pale blue.

00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:40.311
But that area that is pale blue was once white.

00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:43.922
So it was damaged. It's now repaired.

00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:46.684
Just to be clear: It's not because of doctors.

00:05:46.684 --> 00:05:49.001
It's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.

00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:51.184
This is spontaneous repair.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.732
It's amazing and it's occurred

00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:55.946
because there are stem cells in the brain, even,

00:05:55.946 --> 00:05:59.120
which can enable new myelin, new insulation,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.449
to be laid down over the damaged nerves.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.936
And this observation is important for two reasons.

00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:09.176
The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies

00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:10.805
that we learnt at medical school,

00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:14.425
or at least I did, admittedly last century,

00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:16.996
which is that the brain doesn't repair itself,

00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:20.117
unlike, say, the bone or the liver.

00:06:20.117 --> 00:06:23.616
But actually it does, but it
just doesn't do it well enough.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.258
And the second thing it does,

00:06:25.258 --> 00:06:29.233
and it gives us a very clear direction 
of travel for new therapies --

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:30.952
I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist

00:06:30.952 --> 00:06:32.472
to know what to do here.

00:06:32.472 --> 00:06:35.405
You simply need to find ways of promoting

00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:39.929
the endogenous, spontaneous
repair that occurs anyway.

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:42.386
So the question is, why, if we've known that

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:44.343
for some time, as we have,

00:06:44.343 --> 00:06:48.637
why do we not have those treatments?

00:06:48.637 --> 00:06:50.756
And that in part reflects the complexity

00:06:50.756 --> 00:06:53.367
of drug development.

00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:55.401
Now, drug development you might think of

00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:58.125
as a rather expensive but risky bet,

00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:00.078
and the odds of this bet are roughly this:

00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:02.675
they're 10,000 to one against,

00:07:02.675 --> 00:07:05.480
because you need to screen
about 10,000 compounds

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.551
to find that one potential winner.

00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:09.468
And then you need to spend 15 years

00:07:09.468 --> 00:07:10.966
and spend over a billion dollars,

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:14.109
and even then, you may not have a winner.

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:15.788
So the question for us is,

00:07:15.788 --> 00:07:17.379
can you change the rules of the game

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.928
and can you shorten the odds?

00:07:19.928 --> 00:07:21.972
And in order to do that, you have to think,

00:07:21.972 --> 00:07:24.802
where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?

00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:27.915
And one of the bottlenecks is 
early in drug discovery.

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:31.877
All that screening occurs in animal models.

00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:35.336
But we know that the proper 
study of mankind is man,

00:07:35.336 --> 00:07:37.440
to borrow from Alexander Pope.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.811
So the question is, can we study these diseases

00:07:39.811 --> 00:07:42.199
using human material?

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:44.262
And of course, absolutely we can.

00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:45.791
We can use stem cells,

00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:48.591
and specifically we can use human stem cells.

00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:50.695
And human stem cells are these extraordinary

00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:53.097
but simple cells that can do two things:

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:55.891
they can self-renew or make more of themselves,

00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:57.949
but they can also become specialized

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.548
to make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,

00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:02.388
maybe even the motor nerve cell

00:08:02.388 --> 00:08:04.548
or the myelin cell.

00:08:04.548 --> 00:08:06.069
And the challenge has long been,

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.041
can we harness the power,

00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:10.326
the undoubted power of these stem cells

00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:12.344
in order to realize their promise

00:08:12.344 --> 00:08:13.971
for regenerative neurology?

00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:16.900
And I think we can now, and the reason we can

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.808
is because there have been
several major discoveries

00:08:19.808 --> 00:08:21.545
in the last 10, 20 years.

00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:23.157
One of them was here in Edinburgh,

00:08:23.157 --> 00:08:27.269
and it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.

00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:28.894
So Dolly was made in Edinburgh,

00:08:28.894 --> 00:08:30.577
and Dolly was an example

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:33.791
of the first cloning of a mammal

00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:35.739
from an adult cell.

00:08:35.739 --> 00:08:38.544
But I think the even more significant breakthrough

00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:41.466
for the purposes of our discussion today

00:08:41.466 --> 00:08:43.955
was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist

00:08:43.955 --> 00:08:45.552
called Yamanaka.

00:08:45.552 --> 00:08:46.856
And what Yamaka did,

00:08:46.856 --> 00:08:49.288
in a fantastic form of scientific cookery,

00:08:49.288 --> 00:08:51.326
was he showed that four ingredients,

00:08:51.326 --> 00:08:53.189
just four ingredients,

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:56.376
could effectively convert any cell, adult cell,

00:08:56.376 --> 00:08:58.618
into a master stem cell.

00:08:58.618 --> 00:09:01.602
And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,

00:09:01.602 --> 00:09:03.842
because what it means that
from anybody in this room,

00:09:03.842 --> 00:09:05.646
but particularly patients,

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:06.977
you could now generate

00:09:06.977 --> 00:09:09.703
a bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.

00:09:09.703 --> 00:09:12.651
Take a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:14.390
so you could then make those cells

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.829
that are relevant to their disease,

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:19.471
both to study but potentially to treat.

00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:21.533
Now, the idea of that at medical school --

00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:24.158
this is a recurring theme, isn't 
it, me and medical school? —

00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:25.976
would have been ridiculous,

00:09:25.976 --> 00:09:28.035
but it's an absolute reality today.

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:30.169
And I see this as the cornerstone

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:33.346
of regeneration, repair and hope.

00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:35.296
And whilst we're on the theme of hope,

00:09:35.296 --> 00:09:37.437
for those of you who might have failed at school,

00:09:37.437 --> 00:09:39.662
there's hope for you as well,

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.158
because this is the school report of John Gerdon.

00:09:42.158 --> 00:09:43.370
["I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist;
on his present showing this is quite ridiculous."]

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.806
So they didn't think much of him then.

00:09:44.806 --> 00:09:47.664
But what you may not know is that he 
got the Nobel Prize for medicine

00:09:47.664 --> 00:09:50.216
just three months ago.

00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:52.782
So to return to the original problem,

00:09:52.782 --> 00:09:54.925
what is the opportunity of these stem cells,

00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:56.586
or this disruptive technology,

00:09:56.586 --> 00:09:58.140
for repairing the damaged brain,

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.271
which we call regenerative neurology?

00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:02.698
I think there are two ways you can think about this:

00:10:02.698 --> 00:10:06.146
as a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,

00:10:06.146 --> 00:10:08.963
and/or as a form of therapy.

00:10:08.963 --> 00:10:10.990
So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.439
in the next few moments.

00:10:13.439 --> 00:10:15.470
Drug discovery in a dish is how people often

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.700
talk about this.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.627
It's very simple: You take a patient with a disease,

00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:21.446
let's say motor neuron disease,

00:10:21.446 --> 00:10:23.203
you take a skin sample,

00:10:23.203 --> 00:10:26.261
you do the pluripotent reprogramming,

00:10:26.261 --> 00:10:28.352
as I've already told you,

00:10:28.352 --> 00:10:30.869
and you generate live motor nerve cells.

00:10:30.869 --> 00:10:32.603
That's straightforward, because that's what

00:10:32.603 --> 00:10:34.340
pluripotent cells can do.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.296
But crucially, you can then compare their behavior

00:10:37.296 --> 00:10:39.719
to their equivalent but healthy counterparts,

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:41.749
ideally from an unaffected relative.

00:10:41.749 --> 00:10:44.991
That way, you're matching for genetic variation.

00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:47.338
And that's exactly what we did here.

00:10:47.338 --> 00:10:49.261
This was a collaboration with colleagues:

00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.784
in London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S., 
Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.

00:10:52.784 --> 00:10:55.306
And what you're looking at, and this is amazing,

00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:58.106
these are living, growing, motor nerve cells

00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:00.349
from a patient with motor neuron disease.

00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:02.274
It happens to be an inherited form.

00:11:02.274 --> 00:11:03.973
I mean, just imagine that.

00:11:03.973 --> 00:11:06.454
This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.

00:11:06.454 --> 00:11:09.808
So apart from seeing them
grow and put out processes,

00:11:09.808 --> 00:11:12.250
we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.309
but crucially, we can then
track their individual health

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:17.829
and compare the diseased motor nerve cells

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:19.701
to the healthy ones.

00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:23.188
And when you do all that and put it together,

00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:25.287
you realize that the diseased ones,

00:11:25.287 --> 00:11:27.075
which is represented in the red line,

00:11:27.075 --> 00:11:30.696
are two and a half times more likely to die

00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:33.401
than the healthy counterpart.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:36.044
And the crucial point about this is that you then have

00:11:36.044 --> 00:11:39.633
a fantastic assay to discover drugs,

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:41.542
because what would you ask of the drugs,

00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:43.303
and you could do this through a high-throughput

00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:45.712
automated screening system,

00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:48.158
you'd ask the drugs, give me one thing:

00:11:48.158 --> 00:11:50.983
find me a drug that will bring the red line

00:11:50.983 --> 00:11:52.873
closer to the blue line,

00:11:52.873 --> 00:11:56.092
because that drug will be a high-value candidate

00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:58.992
that you could probably take direct to human trial

00:11:58.992 --> 00:12:01.579
and almost bypass that bottleneck

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:03.980
that I've told you about in drug discovery

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.793
with the animal models,

00:12:05.793 --> 00:12:08.446
if that makes sense. It's fantastic.

00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:10.010
But I want to come back

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.059
to how you might use stem cells directly

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:13.834
to repair damage.

00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:15.659
And again there are two ways to think about this,

00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:17.674
and they're not mutually exclusive.

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:19.964
The first, and I think in the long run

00:12:19.964 --> 00:12:22.193
the one that will give us the biggest dividend,

00:12:22.193 --> 00:12:24.797
but it's not thought of that way just yet,

00:12:24.797 --> 00:12:28.053
is to think about those stem cells that are already

00:12:28.053 --> 00:12:29.893
in your brain, and I've told you that.

00:12:29.893 --> 00:12:31.747
All of us have stem cells in the brain,

00:12:31.747 --> 00:12:33.382
even the diseased brain,

00:12:33.382 --> 00:12:35.000
and surely the smart way forward

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.497
is to find ways that you can promote and activate

00:12:37.497 --> 00:12:39.533
those stem cells in your brain already

00:12:39.533 --> 00:12:42.720
to react and respond appropriately to damage

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.004
to repair it.

00:12:44.004 --> 00:12:45.436
That will be the future.

00:12:45.436 --> 00:12:48.309
There will be drugs that will do that.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:52.572
But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.376
transplant them in,

00:12:54.376 --> 00:12:58.854
to replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.

00:12:58.854 --> 00:13:00.942
And I want to tell you now an experiment,

00:13:00.942 --> 00:13:02.836
it's a clinical trial that we did,

00:13:02.836 --> 00:13:04.692
which recently completed,

00:13:04.692 --> 00:13:07.209
which is with colleagues in UCL,

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:09.964
David Miller in particular.

00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:11.877
So this study was very simple.

00:13:11.877 --> 00:13:14.979
We took patients with multiple sclerosis

00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:16.517
and asked a simple question:

00:13:16.517 --> 00:13:18.191
Would stem cells from the bone marrow

00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:19.914
be protective of their nerves?

00:13:19.914 --> 00:13:23.759
So what we did was we took this bone marrow,

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:25.976
grew up the stem cells in the lab,

00:13:25.976 --> 00:13:28.315
and then injected them back into the vein.

00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:30.115
I'm making this sound really simple.

00:13:30.115 --> 00:13:33.222
It took five years off a lot of people, okay?

00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:34.910
And it put gray hair on me

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.391
and caused all kinds of issues.

00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:40.414
But conceptually, it's essentially simple.

00:13:40.414 --> 00:13:43.721
So we've given them into the vein, right?

00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:47.354
So in order to measure whether
this was successful or not,

00:13:47.354 --> 00:13:49.102
we measured the optic nerve

00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:50.788
as our outcome measure.

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.553
And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.,

00:13:52.553 --> 00:13:54.626
because patients with M.S. sadly suffer

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.098
with problems with vision --

00:13:56.098 --> 00:13:58.288
loss of vision, unclear vision.

00:13:58.288 --> 00:14:00.371
And so we measured the size of the optic nerve

00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:02.425
using the scans with David Miller

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.523
three times -- 12 months, six months,

00:14:04.523 --> 00:14:06.139
and before the infusion --

00:14:06.139 --> 00:14:09.265
and you can see the gently declining red line.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.493
And that's telling you that
the optic nerve is shrinking,

00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:13.836
which makes sense, because their nerves are dying.

00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:16.142
We then gave the stem cell infusion

00:14:16.142 --> 00:14:18.243
and repeated the measurement twice --

00:14:18.243 --> 00:14:19.882
three months and six months --

00:14:19.882 --> 00:14:21.855
and to our surprise, almost,

00:14:21.855 --> 00:14:24.011
the line's gone up.

00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:26.542
That suggests that the intervention

00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:28.439
has been protective.

00:14:28.439 --> 00:14:30.356
I don't think myself that what's happened

00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:32.392
is that those stem cells have made new myelin

00:14:32.392 --> 00:14:33.856
or new nerves.

00:14:33.856 --> 00:14:36.001
What I think they've done is they've promoted

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:38.610
the endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.061
to do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.

00:14:42.061 --> 00:14:44.360
So this is a proof of concept.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.985
I'm very excited about that.

00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:49.474
So I just want to end with the theme I began on,

00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:51.464
which was regeneration and hope.

00:14:51.464 --> 00:14:53.234
So here I've asked John

00:14:53.234 --> 00:14:55.532
what his hopes are for the future.

00:14:55.532 --> 00:14:57.286
John: I would hope that

00:14:57.286 --> 00:14:59.086
sometime in the future

00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:01.526
through the research that you people are doing,

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.735
we can come up with a cure

00:15:03.735 --> 00:15:07.559
so that people like me can lead a normal life.

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.154
SC: I mean, that speaks volumes.

00:15:10.154 --> 00:15:12.693
But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John --

00:15:12.693 --> 00:15:14.422
thanking John for allowing me to share

00:15:14.422 --> 00:15:17.592
his insights and these clips with you all.

00:15:17.592 --> 00:15:20.127
But I'd also like to add to John and to others

00:15:20.127 --> 00:15:22.704
that my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.

00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:25.056
I do believe that the disruptive technologies

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:27.114
like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you

00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:28.935
do offer very real hope.

00:15:28.935 --> 00:15:30.698
And I do think that the day that we might be able

00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:32.134
to repair the damaged brain

00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:33.423
is sooner than we think.

00:15:33.423 --> 00:15:35.226
Thank you.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:39.919
(Applause)
