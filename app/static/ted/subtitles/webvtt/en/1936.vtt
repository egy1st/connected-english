00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:04.268
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies.

00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:06.101
They're exactly what they sound like.

00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:08.654
They are these huge collections of galaxies,

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:10.909
bound together by their mutual gravity.

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.571
So most of the points that you see on the screen

00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:16.100
are not individual stars,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.936
but collections of stars, or galaxies.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.267
Now, by showing you some of these images,

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:23.014
I hope that you will quickly see that

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:25.694
galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:27.187
but more than that,

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:29.850
I think galaxy clusters are mysterious,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.403
they are surprising,

00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:32.820
and they're useful.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.351
Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories.

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:39.987
And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters

00:00:39.987 --> 00:00:41.852
is to describe the experiments

00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:43.405
that you can do with them.

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:45.685
And I think there are four major types,

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:48.269
and the first type that I want to describe

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.488
is probing the very big.

00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:52.183
So, how big?

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:56.434
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:59.403
It is so massive that the light passing through it

00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:02.018
is being bent, it's being distorted

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:04.527
by the extreme gravity of this cluster.

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:06.331
And, in fact, if you look very carefully

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:09.031
you'll be able to see rings around this cluster.

00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:10.580
Now, to give you a number,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.363
this particular galaxy cluster

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:16.571
has a mass of over one million billion suns.

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.884
It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get.

00:01:19.884 --> 00:01:21.385
But more than their mass,

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:23.359
they have this additional feature.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.703
They are essentially isolated systems,

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.925
so if we like, we can think of them

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:31.195
as a scaled-down version of the entire universe.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:33.197
And many of the questions that we might have

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:35.165
about the universe at large scales,

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:37.080
such as, how does gravity work?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.112
might be answered by studying these systems.

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:41.445
So that was very big.

00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:43.330
The second things is very hot.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.113
Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster,

00:01:46.113 --> 00:01:49.030
and I subtract away all of the starlight,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.825
what I'm left with is this big, blue blob.

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:53.310
This is in false color.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.659
It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.320
And the question is, if it's not galaxies,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.519
what is emitting this light?

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.419
The answer is hot gas,

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:04.242
million-degree gas --

00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:05.899
in fact, it's plasma.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.558
And the reason why it's so hot

00:02:07.558 --> 00:02:09.538
goes back to the previous slide.

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:12.278
The extreme gravity of these systems

00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:15.320
is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.902
and great speeds means great temperatures.

00:02:17.902 --> 00:02:19.621
So this is the main idea,

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:21.987
but science is a rough draft.

00:02:21.987 --> 00:02:24.538
There are many basic properties about this plasma

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:26.236
that still confuse us,

00:02:26.236 --> 00:02:27.569
still puzzle us,

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.655
and still push our understanding

00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:31.694
of the physics of the very hot.

00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:35.121
Third thing: probing the very small.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.967
Now, to explain this, I need to tell you

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:39.987
a very disturbing fact.

00:02:39.987 --> 00:02:42.777
Most of the universe's matter

00:02:42.777 --> 00:02:44.588
is not made up of atoms.

00:02:44.588 --> 00:02:46.538
You were lied to.

00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:49.665
Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious,

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:51.787
which we call dark matter.

00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:55.454
Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much,

00:02:55.454 --> 00:02:57.122
except through gravity,

00:02:57.122 --> 00:02:58.734
and of course we would like to learn more about it.

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:00.277
If you're a particle physicist,

00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:02.786
you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together.

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:04.776
And dark matter is no exception.

00:03:04.776 --> 00:03:06.436
Well, how do we do this?

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.927
To answer that question,

00:03:07.927 --> 00:03:09.320
I'm going to have to ask another one,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.486
which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?

00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:14.796
Here is an image.

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:17.987
Since galaxy clusters are representative

00:03:17.987 --> 00:03:21.111
slices of the universe, scaled-down versions.

00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:23.234
They are mostly made up of dark matter,

00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:25.787
and that's what you see in this bluish purple.

00:03:25.787 --> 00:03:27.404
The red represents the hot gas,

00:03:27.404 --> 00:03:29.371
and, of course, you can see many galaxies.

00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:31.736
What's happened is a particle accelerator

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.627
at a huge, huge scale.

00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:35.404
And this is very important,

00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:37.287
because what it means is that very, very small

00:03:37.287 --> 00:03:40.371
effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,

00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:42.550
might be compounded and compounded

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.359
into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.871
So, it's very funny.

00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:49.819
The reason why galaxy clusters

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.485
can teach us about dark matter,

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:53.235
the reason why galaxy clusters

00:03:53.235 --> 00:03:55.788
can teach us about the physics of the very small,

00:03:55.788 --> 00:03:58.819
is precisely because they are so very big.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.904
Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange.

00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:05.954
Certainly what I've said so far is crazy.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.237
Okay, if there's anything stranger

00:04:08.237 --> 00:04:10.654
I think it has to be dark energy.

00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:12.371
If I throw a ball into the air,

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.169
I expect it to go up.

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.293
What I don't expect is that it go up

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:18.459
at an ever-increasing rate.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.204
Similarly, cosmologists understand why

00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:22.786
the universe is expanding.

00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:24.954
They don't understand why it's expanding

00:04:24.954 --> 00:04:26.892
at an ever-increasing rate.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:28.570
They give the cause of this

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.162
accelerated expansion a name,

00:04:30.162 --> 00:04:32.046
and they call it dark energy.

00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:34.734
And, again, we want to learn more about it.

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:37.121
So, one particular question that we have is,

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:39.816
how does dark energy affect the universe

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:41.434
at the largest scales?

00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:42.893
Depending on how strong it is,

00:04:42.893 --> 00:04:46.154
maybe structure forms faster or slower.

00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:48.703
Well, the problem with the large-scale structure

00:04:48.703 --> 00:04:51.041
of the universe is that it's horribly complicated.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.370
Here is a computer simulation.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.498
And we need a way to simplify it.

00:04:55.498 --> 00:04:59.069
Well, I like to think about this using an analogy.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.787
If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,

00:05:01.787 --> 00:05:03.453
the most important thing to do

00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:05.234
is not to model the little positions

00:05:05.234 --> 00:05:08.155
of every single little piece of the boat that broke off.

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:09.820
The most important thing to do is

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.821
to track the two biggest parts.

00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:15.653
Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:17.120
at the largest scales

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.871
by tracking its biggest pieces

00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:22.862
and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.

00:05:22.862 --> 00:05:25.818
So, as I come to a close,

00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:27.820
you might feel slightly cheated.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.070
I mean, I began by talking about

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.153
how galaxy clusters are useful,

00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:33.653
and I've given some reasons,

00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:36.253
but what is their use really?

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:38.370
Well, to answer this,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.986
I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:42.472
when he was asked about cars.

00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:43.831
He had this to say:

00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:46.120
"If I had asked people what they wanted,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.903
they would have said faster horses."

00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:51.404
Today, we as a society are faced

00:05:51.404 --> 00:05:53.622
with many, many difficult problems.

00:05:53.622 --> 00:05:57.453
And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious.

00:05:57.453 --> 00:05:59.620
They are not faster horses.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.862
They will require an enormous amount of

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.568
scientific ingenuity.

00:06:03.568 --> 00:06:05.154
So, yes, we need to focus,

00:06:05.154 --> 00:06:06.904
yes, we need to concentrate,

00:06:06.904 --> 00:06:08.870
but we also need to remember that

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.705
innovation, ingenuity, inspiration --

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.037
these things come

00:06:13.037 --> 00:06:14.725
when we broaden our field of vision

00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:16.065
when we step back

00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:17.414
when we zoom out.

00:06:17.414 --> 00:06:19.237
And I can't think of a better way to do this than

00:06:19.237 --> 00:06:22.992
by studying the universe around us. Thanks.

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:25.941
(Applause)
