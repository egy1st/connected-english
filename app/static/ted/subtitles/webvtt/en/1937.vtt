00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:02.432
Almost two years ago,

00:00:02.432 --> 00:00:04.823
I was driving in my car in Germany,

00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:07.339
and I turned on the radio.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.546
Europe at the time was in the middle

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:10.989
of the Euro crisis,

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:15.235
and all the headlines were about European countries

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:18.076
getting downgraded by rating agencies

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.930
in the United States.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.039
I listened and thought to myself,

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.111
"What are these rating agencies,

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:27.564
and why is everybody so upset about their work?"

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:29.616
Well, if you were sitting

00:00:29.616 --> 00:00:31.377
next to me in the car that day

00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:33.939
and would have told me that I would devote

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:37.183
the next years to trying to reform them,

00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:41.131
obviously I would have called you crazy.

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:43.033
But guess what's really crazy:

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.062
the way these rating agencies are run.

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:47.705
And I would like to explain to you

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:49.806
not only why it's time to change this,

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:52.984
but also how we can do it.

00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:54.638
So let me tell you a little bit

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:58.216
about what rating agencies really do.

00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:00.600
As you would read a car magazine

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.402
before purchasing a new car

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.494
or taking a look at a product review

00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:08.371
before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,

00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.571
investors are reading ratings

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.884
before they decide in which kind of product

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:15.972
they are investing their money.

00:01:15.972 --> 00:01:18.783
A rating can range from a so-called AAA,

00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:21.726
which means it's a top-performing product,

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:24.253
and it can go down to the level

00:01:24.253 --> 00:01:27.267
of the so-called BBB-,

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:30.692
which means it's a fairly risky investment.

00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:33.253
Rating agencies are rating companies.

00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:34.503
They are rating banks.

00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:36.867
They are rating even financial products

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.942
like the infamous mortgage-backed securities.

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:42.019
But they can also rate countries,

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.767
and these ratings are called sovereign ratings,

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:47.124
and I would like to focus in particular

00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:49.750
on these sovereign ratings.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.156
And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:53.615
you're thinking,

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:56.223
so why should I really care about this, right?

00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:57.808
Be honest.

00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:00.097
Well, ratings affect you.

00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:02.259
They affect all of us.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.564
If a rating agency rates a country,

00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:08.839
it basically assesses and evaluates

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.240
a country's debt

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.589
and the ability and willingness of a country

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:14.930
to repay its debt.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.863
So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,

00:02:17.863 --> 00:02:19.940
the country has to pay more

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.547
in order to borrow money

00:02:21.547 --> 00:02:23.108
on the international markets.

00:02:23.108 --> 00:02:25.909
So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.272
because you and your fellow countrymen

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:32.062
have to pony up more in order to borrow.

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:34.878
But what if a country can't afford to pay more

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:37.715
because it's maybe too expensive?

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:40.650
Well, then the country has less available

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.312
for other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:46.751
And this is the reason why you should care,

00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:49.797
because sovereign ratings affect everyone.

00:02:49.797 --> 00:02:51.458
And that is the reason why I believe

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:54.414
they should be defined as public goods.

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:57.225
They should be transparent, accessible,

00:02:57.226 --> 00:03:01.807
and available to everyone at no cost.

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.853
But here's the situation:

00:03:03.853 --> 00:03:05.997
the rating agency market is dominated

00:03:05.997 --> 00:03:08.970
by three players and three players only --

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.749
Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch --

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.706
and we know whenever there
is a market concentration,

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:16.505
there is really no competition.

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:18.782
There is no incentive to improve

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.099
the quality of your product.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.348
And let's face it, the credit rating 
agencies have contributed,

00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:28.193
putting the global economy on the brink,

00:03:28.193 --> 00:03:31.978
and yet they have to change the way they operate.

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:33.851
The second point,

00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.873
would you really buy a car

00:03:35.873 --> 00:03:39.359
just based on the advice of the dealer?

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.372
Obviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.

00:03:42.372 --> 00:03:44.965
But that's actually what's going on

00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:48.843
in the rating agency sector every single day.

00:03:48.843 --> 00:03:51.592
The customers of these rating agencies,

00:03:51.592 --> 00:03:54.079
like countries or companies,

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.505
they are paying for their own ratings,

00:03:56.505 --> 00:03:58.503
and obviously this is creating

00:03:58.503 --> 00:04:01.374
a conflict of interest.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.890
The third point is,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.805
the rating agencies are not really telling us

00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:09.443
how they are coming up with their ratings,

00:04:09.443 --> 00:04:11.283
but in this day and age,

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:13.159
you can't even sell a candy bar

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.207
without listing everything that's inside.

00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:19.891
But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,

00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:21.560
we really do not know

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.042
what all the different ingredients are.

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:25.988
We are allowing the rating agencies

00:04:25.988 --> 00:04:28.690
to be intransparent about their work,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.752
and we need to change this.

00:04:30.752 --> 00:04:33.232
I think there is no doubt that the sector

00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:34.949
needs a complete overhaul,

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.459
not just a trimming at the margins.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:39.682
I think it's time for a bold move.

00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:42.798
I think it's time to upgrade the system.

00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:45.360
And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.182
have invested a lot of time and effort

00:04:48.182 --> 00:04:51.913
thinking about an alternative for the sector.

00:04:51.913 --> 00:04:54.512
And we have developed the first model

00:04:54.512 --> 00:04:59.670
for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.126
and we call it by its acronym, INCRA.

00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:05.524
INCRA would make a difference

00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:07.951
to the current system

00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:12.153
by adding another nonprofit player to the mix.

00:05:12.153 --> 00:05:15.602
It would be based on a nonprofit model

00:05:15.602 --> 00:05:19.246
that would be based on a sustainable endowment.

00:05:19.246 --> 00:05:21.370
The endowment would create income

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.787
that would allow us to run the operation,

00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:25.489
to run the rating agency,

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:27.539
and it would also allow us

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.224
to make our ratings publicly available.

00:05:31.224 --> 00:05:33.927
But this is not enough to make a difference, right?

00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:35.800
INCRA would also be based on

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.378
a very, very clear governance structure

00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:41.300
that would avoid any conflict of interest,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.169
and it would include many stakeholders from society.

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.718
INCRA would not only be a European

00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:50.849
or an American rating agency,

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.213
it would be a truly international one,

00:05:53.213 --> 00:05:56.330
in which, in particular, the emerging economies

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.454
would have an equal interest, 
voice and representation.

00:06:01.454 --> 00:06:04.884
The second big difference that INCRA would make is

00:06:04.884 --> 00:06:07.862
that would it base its sovereign risk assessment

00:06:07.862 --> 00:06:10.558
on a broader set of indicators.

00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:12.459
Think about it that way.

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:14.303
If we conduct a sovereign rating,

00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:15.920
we basically take a look at

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.587
the economic soil of a country,

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:21.172
its macroeconomic fundamentals.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.350
But we also have to ask the question,

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.251
who is cultivating the economic soil

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.186
of a country, right?

00:06:28.186 --> 00:06:30.346
Well, a country has many gardeners,

00:06:30.346 --> 00:06:32.164
and one of them is the government,

00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.209
so we have to ask the question,

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:35.523
how is a country governed?

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:37.109
How is it managed?

00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:39.279
And this is the reason why we have developed

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.370
what we call forward-looking indicators.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.037
These are indicators that give you

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:45.544
a much better read about

00:06:45.544 --> 00:06:49.095
the socioeconomic development of a country.

00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:51.853
I hope you would agree it's important for you to know

00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:59.021
if your government is willing to invest 
in renewable energy and education.

00:06:59.034 --> 00:07:00.759
It's important for you to know

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.762
if the government of your country

00:07:02.762 --> 00:07:04.724
is able to manage a crisis,

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:07.705
if the government is finally able to implement

00:07:07.705 --> 00:07:11.433
the reforms that it's promised.

00:07:11.433 --> 00:07:13.300
For example, if INCRA would rate

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.254
South Africa right now,

00:07:15.254 --> 00:07:18.711
of course we would take a very, very close look

00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.011
at the youth unemployment of the country,

00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:23.549
the highest in the world.

00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:26.993
If over 70 percent of a country's population

00:07:26.993 --> 00:07:30.584
under the age of 35 is unemployed,

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:33.680
of course this has a huge impact on the economy

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.974
today and even more so in the future.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:40.249
Well, our friends at Moody's,

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:42.572
Standard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch will tell us

00:07:42.572 --> 00:07:45.605
we would take this into account as well.

00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:47.554
But guess what? We do not know

00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:50.571
exactly how they will take this into account.

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:52.922
And this leads me to the third big difference

00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:54.626
that INCRA would make.

00:07:54.626 --> 00:07:57.420
INCRA would not only release its ratings

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.391
but it would also release its indicators

00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:02.053
and methodology.

00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:04.616
So in contrast to the current system,

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:08.131
INCRA would be fully transparent.

00:08:08.131 --> 00:08:09.970
So in a nutshell,

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.172
INCRA would offer an alternative

00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:15.598
to the current system of
the big three rating agencies

00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:19.563
by adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix

00:08:19.563 --> 00:08:21.967
that would increase the competition,

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:24.530
it would increase the transparency of the sector,

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.335
and it would also increase the quality.

00:08:27.335 --> 00:08:29.303
I can tell that sovereign ratings

00:08:29.303 --> 00:08:32.527
may still look to you like this very small piece

00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:36.802
of this very complex global financial world,

00:08:36.802 --> 00:08:39.242
but I tell you it's a very important one,

00:08:39.242 --> 00:08:41.684
and a very important one to fix,

00:08:41.684 --> 00:08:44.827
because sovereign ratings affect all of us,

00:08:44.827 --> 00:08:48.365
and they should be addressed and should be defined

00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:49.825
as public goods.

00:08:49.825 --> 00:08:52.709
And this is why we are testing our model right now,

00:08:52.709 --> 00:08:55.636
and why we are trying to find out if it can

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.839
bring together a group of able and willing actors

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.489
to bring INCRA to life.

00:09:01.489 --> 00:09:04.100
I truly believe building up INCRA

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.491
is in everyone's interest,

00:09:06.491 --> 00:09:10.061
and that we have the unique opportunity right now

00:09:10.061 --> 00:09:12.630
to turn INCRA into a cornerstone

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.025
of a new, more inclusive financial system.

00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:19.593
Because for way too long,

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:23.285
we have left the big financial players on their own.

00:09:23.285 --> 00:09:26.081
It's time to give them some company.

00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:28.115
Thank you.

00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:32.115
(Applause)
