00:00:00.586 --> 00:00:02.649
I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.823
and its relationship with technology.

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:09.718
We tend to think of business strategy

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:11.681
as being a rather abstract body

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:13.396
of essentially economic thought,

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.026
perhaps rather timeless.

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:16.966
I'm going to argue that, in fact,

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.521
business strategy has always been premised

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.940
on assumptions about technology,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.913
that those assumptions are changing,

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.630
and, in fact, changing quite dramatically,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.702
and that therefore what that will drive us to

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:32.605
is a different concept of what we mean

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:35.043
by business strategy.

00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:36.524
Let me start, if I may,

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:39.294
with a little bit of history.

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:41.038
The idea of strategy in business

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:44.338
owes its origins to two intellectual giants:

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:46.472
Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG,

00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:50.244
and Michael Porter, professor
at the Harvard Business School.

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:53.076
Henderson's central idea was what you might call

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:56.067
the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.936
against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:00.729
What Henderson recognized was that,

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.125
in the business world,

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.780
there are many phenomena which are characterized

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.815
by what economists would call increasing returns --

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:08.178
scale, experience.

00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:10.052
The more you do of something,

00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:12.449
disproportionately the better you get.

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:15.412
And therefore he found a logic for investing

00:01:15.412 --> 00:01:18.154
in such kinds of overwhelming mass

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:20.707
in order to achieve competitive advantage.

00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:22.775
And that was the first introduction

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.439
of essentially a military concept of strategy

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.421
into the business world.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.156
Porter agreed with that premise,

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:32.707
but he qualified it.

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:35.696
He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well,

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:39.571
but businesses actually have multiple steps to them.

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:41.144
They have different components,

00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:43.676
and each of those components might be driven

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.461
by a different kind of strategy.

00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:47.789
A company or a business
might actually be advantaged

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.267
in some activities but disadvantaged in others.

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:53.368
He formed the concept of the value chain,

00:01:53.368 --> 00:01:56.438
essentially the sequence of steps with which

00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:59.590
a, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component,

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.953
becomes assembled into a finished product,

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:03.594
and then is distributed, for example,

00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:06.010
and he argued that advantage accrued

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.551
to each of those components,

00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:09.265
and that the advantage of the whole

00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:11.396
was in some sense the sum or the average

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:13.744
of that of its parts.

00:02:13.744 --> 00:02:16.321
And this idea of the value chain was predicated

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.889
on the recognition that

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.535
what holds a business together is transaction costs,

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:24.830
that in essence you need to coordinate,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.405
organizations are more efficient at coordination

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:29.067
than markets, very often,

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:32.123
and therefore the nature and role and boundaries

00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:35.962
of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.

00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:38.526
It was on those two ideas,

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:41.912
Henderson's idea of increasing returns

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:43.460
to scale and experience,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.883
and Porter's idea of the value chain,

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:47.796
encompassing heterogenous elements,

00:02:47.796 --> 00:02:51.131
that the whole edifice of business strategy

00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:53.908
was subsequently erected.

00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:56.337
Now what I'm going to argue is

00:02:56.337 --> 00:03:02.051
that those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.

00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.605
First of all, let's think about transaction costs.

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:07.002
There are really two components
to transaction costs.

00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:09.872
One is about processing information,
and the other is about communication.

00:03:09.872 --> 00:03:13.153
These are the economics of
processing and communicating

00:03:13.153 --> 00:03:15.627
as they have evolved over a long period of time.

00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:18.637
As we all know from so many contexts,

00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:20.893
they have been radically transformed

00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:23.205
since the days when Porter and Henderson

00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:25.299
first formulated their theories.

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.365
In particular, since the mid-'90s,

00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:29.233
communications costs have actually been falling

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.224
even faster than transaction costs,

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:33.783
which is why communication, the Internet,

00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:38.398
has exploded in such a dramatic fashion.

00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:40.568
Now, those falling transaction costs

00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:42.544
have profound consequences,

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:44.337
because if transaction costs are the glue

00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:46.759
that hold value chains together, and they are falling,

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.401
there is less to economize on.

00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:51.333
There is less need for vertically
integrated organization,

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:54.211
and value chains at least can break up.

00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:56.710
They needn't necessarily, but they can.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.850
In particular, it then becomes possible for

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.616
a competitor in one business

00:04:00.616 --> 00:04:03.941
to use their position in one step of the value chain

00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:05.773
in order to penetrate or attack

00:04:05.773 --> 00:04:08.937
or disintermediate the competitor in another.

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:11.598
That is not just an abstract proposition.

00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:13.277
There are many very specific stories

00:04:13.277 --> 00:04:15.049
of how that actually happened.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.542
A poster child example was
the encyclopedia business.

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:19.991
The encyclopedia business

00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.093
in the days of leatherbound books

00:04:22.093 --> 00:04:23.797
was basically a distribution business.

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:26.251
Most of the cost was the
commission to the salesmen.

00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:28.877
The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,

00:04:28.877 --> 00:04:32.293
new technologies made the distribution of knowledge

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:34.572
many orders of magnitude cheaper,

00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:37.286
and the encyclopedia industry collapsed.

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:40.118
It's now, of course, a very familiar story.

00:04:40.118 --> 00:04:42.160
This, in fact, more generally was the story

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.669
of the first generation of the Internet economy.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.869
It was about falling transaction costs

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.344
breaking up value chains

00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:50.973
and therefore allowing disintermediation,

00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:53.310
or what we call deconstruction.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.627
One of the questions I was occasionally asked was,

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:58.143
well, what's going to replace the encyclopedia

00:04:58.143 --> 00:05:00.794
when Britannica no longer has a business model?

00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:02.960
And it was a while before
the answer became manifest.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.747
Now, of course, we know
what it is: it's the Wikipedia.

00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:08.970
Now what's special about the
Wikipedia is not its distribution.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.374
What's special about the Wikipedia
is the way it's produced.

00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:13.614
The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:16.141
created by its users.

00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:18.021
And this, in fact, defines what you might call

00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:20.509
the second decade of the Internet economy,

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.869
the decade in which the Internet as a noun

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:25.776
became the Internet as a verb.

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:27.645
It became a set of conversations,

00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:31.721
the era in which user-generated
content and social networks

00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:34.412
became the dominant phenomenon.

00:05:34.412 --> 00:05:36.310
Now what that really meant

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.684
in terms of the Porter-Henderson framework

00:05:39.684 --> 00:05:43.075
was the collapse of certain
kinds of economies of scale.

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:45.413
It turned out that tens of thousands

00:05:45.413 --> 00:05:48.496
of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia

00:05:48.496 --> 00:05:50.042
could do just as good a job,

00:05:50.042 --> 00:05:51.733
and certainly a much cheaper job,

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:54.712
than professionals in a hierarchical organization.

00:05:54.712 --> 00:05:57.169
So basically what was happening was that one layer

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.063
of this value chain was becoming fragmented,

00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:01.907
as individuals could take over

00:06:01.907 --> 00:06:05.194
where organizations were no longer needed.

00:06:05.194 --> 00:06:07.826
But there's another question
that obviously this graph poses,

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.109
which is, okay, we've
gone through two decades --

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:12.787
does anything distinguish the third?

00:06:12.787 --> 00:06:14.902
And what I'm going to argue is that indeed

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:16.407
something does distinguish the third,

00:06:16.407 --> 00:06:18.853
and it maps exactly on to the kind of

00:06:18.853 --> 00:06:21.321
Porter-Henderson logic that
we've been talking about.

00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:23.908
And that is, about data.

00:06:23.908 --> 00:06:25.577
If we go back to around 2000,

00:06:25.577 --> 00:06:27.936
a lot of people were talking
about the information revolution,

00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:30.237
and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data

00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:32.511
was growing, indeed growing quite fast.

00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.369
but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.187
We go forward to 2007,

00:06:37.187 --> 00:06:40.372
not only had the world's stock of data exploded,

00:06:40.372 --> 00:06:42.892
but there'd been this massive substitution

00:06:42.892 --> 00:06:44.907
of digital for analog.

00:06:44.907 --> 00:06:46.776
And more important even than that,

00:06:46.776 --> 00:06:48.516
if you look more carefully at this graph,

00:06:48.516 --> 00:06:50.536
what you will observe is that about a half

00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:52.150
of that digital data

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.536
is information that has an I.P. address.

00:06:54.536 --> 00:06:57.387
It's on a server or it's on a P.C.

00:06:57.387 --> 00:06:59.194
But having an I.P. address means that it

00:06:59.194 --> 00:07:01.364
can be connected to any other data

00:07:01.364 --> 00:07:03.227
that has an I.P. address.

00:07:03.227 --> 00:07:04.873
It means it becomes possible

00:07:04.873 --> 00:07:07.960
to put together half of the world's knowledge

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.612
in order to see patterns,

00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:11.969
an entirely new thing.

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:13.937
If we run the numbers forward to today,

00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:15.363
it probably looks something like this.

00:07:15.363 --> 00:07:16.531
We're not really sure.

00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:18.559
If we run the numbers forward to 2020,

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:21.459
we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:25.799
It's curious that the future is so much
more predictable than the present.

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:30.194
And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication

00:07:30.194 --> 00:07:33.167
in the stock of information that is connected

00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:35.395
via an I.P. address.

00:07:35.395 --> 00:07:38.856
Now, if the number of connections that we can make

00:07:38.856 --> 00:07:41.996
is proportional to the number of pairs of data points,

00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:44.459
a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:46.562
is a ten-thousandfold multiplication

00:07:46.562 --> 00:07:48.127
in the number of patterns

00:07:48.127 --> 00:07:50.204
that we can see in that data,

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:52.864
this just in the last 10 or 11 years.

00:07:52.864 --> 00:07:55.688
This, I would submit, is a sea change,

00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:57.772
a profound change in the economics

00:07:57.772 --> 00:07:59.723
of the world that we live in.

00:07:59.723 --> 00:08:00.887
The first human genome,

00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:02.453
that of James Watson,

00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:06.373
was mapped as the culmination of the
Human Genome Project in the year 2000,

00:08:06.373 --> 00:08:08.550
and it took about 200 million dollars

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.531
and about 10 years of work to map

00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:12.946
just one person's genomic makeup.

00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:15.551
Since then, the costs of mapping
the genome have come down.

00:08:15.551 --> 00:08:17.438
In fact, they've come down in recent years

00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:19.112
very dramatically indeed,

00:08:19.112 --> 00:08:21.558
to the point where the cost 
is now below 1,000 dollars,

00:08:21.558 --> 00:08:24.509
and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.240
it will be below 100 dollars --

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.436
a five or six order of magnitude drop

00:08:29.436 --> 00:08:31.381
in the cost of genomic mapping

00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:33.804
in just a 15-year period,

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:36.199
an extraordinary phenomenon.

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:40.604
Now, in the days when mapping a genome

00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:43.613
cost millions, or even tens of thousands,

00:08:43.613 --> 00:08:45.591
it was basically a research enterprise.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.133
Scientists would gather some representative people,

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:49.347
and they would see patterns, and they would try

00:08:49.347 --> 00:08:52.237
and make generalizations about
human nature and disease

00:08:52.237 --> 00:08:53.828
from the abstract patterns they find

00:08:53.828 --> 00:08:57.288
from these particular selected individuals.

00:08:57.288 --> 00:09:00.121
But when the genome can 
be mapped for 100 bucks,

00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.469
99 dollars while you wait,

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:04.659
then what happens is, it becomes retail.

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:06.516
It becomes above all clinical.

00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:07.728
You go the doctor with a cold,

00:09:07.728 --> 00:09:09.662
and if he or she hasn't done it already,

00:09:09.662 --> 00:09:11.900
the first thing they do is map your genome,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.555
at which point what they're now doing

00:09:13.555 --> 00:09:18.084
is not starting from some abstract 
knowledge of genomic medicine

00:09:18.084 --> 00:09:20.148
and trying to work out how it applies to you,

00:09:20.148 --> 00:09:22.717
but they're starting from your particular genome.

00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:24.157
Now think of the power of that.

00:09:24.157 --> 00:09:25.946
Think of where that takes us

00:09:25.946 --> 00:09:28.892
when we can combine genomic data

00:09:28.892 --> 00:09:30.381
with clinical data

00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:32.340
with data about drug interactions

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.629
with the kind of ambient data that devices

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:36.388
like our phone and medical sensors

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:38.246
will increasingly be collecting.

00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:40.707
Think what happens when we collect all of that data

00:09:40.707 --> 00:09:42.180
and we can put it together

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.668
in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.579
This, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,

00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:50.020
but this will drive a revolution in medicine.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.340
Fabulous, lots of people talk about this.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.779
But there's one thing that
doesn't get much attention.

00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:58.063
How is that model of colossal sharing

00:09:58.063 --> 00:10:00.709
across all of those kinds of databases

00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:03.201
compatible with the business models

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:05.815
of institutions and organizations and corporations

00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:08.112
that are involved in this business today?

00:10:08.112 --> 00:10:10.888
If your business is based on proprietary data,

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:13.931
if your competitive advantage
is defined by your data,

00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:17.451
how on Earth is that company or is that society

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:19.549
in fact going to achieve the value

00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:22.554
that's implicit in the technology? They can't.

00:10:22.554 --> 00:10:24.601
So essentially what's happening here,

00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.245
and genomics is merely one example of this,

00:10:27.245 --> 00:10:29.559
is that technology is driving

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:32.128
the natural scaling of the activity

00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:35.055
beyond the institutional boundaries within which

00:10:35.055 --> 00:10:37.213
we have been used to thinking about it,

00:10:37.213 --> 00:10:39.376
and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries

00:10:39.376 --> 00:10:41.630
in terms of which business strategy

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.085
as a discipline is formulated.

00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:48.571
The basic story here is that what used to be

00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:52.233
vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition

00:10:52.233 --> 00:10:55.024
among essentially similar kinds of competitors

00:10:55.024 --> 00:10:57.483
is evolving, by one means or another,

00:10:57.483 --> 00:11:00.844
from a vertical structure to a horizontal one.

00:11:00.844 --> 00:11:02.559
Why is that happening?

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:05.064
It's happening because
transaction costs are plummeting

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.992
and because scale is polarizing.

00:11:06.992 --> 00:11:08.734
The plummeting of transaction costs

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:11.372
weakens the glue that holds value chains together,

00:11:11.372 --> 00:11:13.040
and allows them to separate.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.975
The polarization of scale economies

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:18.101
towards the very small -- small is beautiful --

00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:20.769
allows for scalable communities

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:23.886
to substitute for conventional corporate production.

00:11:23.886 --> 00:11:25.890
The scaling in the opposite direction,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.923
towards things like big data,

00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:29.332
drive the structure of business

00:11:29.332 --> 00:11:32.055
towards the creation of new kinds of institutions

00:11:32.055 --> 00:11:34.033
that can achieve that scale.

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:36.791
But either way, the typically vertical structure

00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:39.795
gets driven to becoming more horizontal.

00:11:39.795 --> 00:11:42.210
The logic isn't just about big data.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.536
If we were to look, for example,
at the telecommunications industry,

00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:47.911
you can tell the same story about fiber optics.

00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:50.047
If we look at the pharmaceutical industry,

00:11:50.047 --> 00:11:51.940
or, for that matter, university research,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.614
you can say exactly the same story

00:11:53.614 --> 00:11:55.353
about so-called "big science."

00:11:55.353 --> 00:11:56.888
And in the opposite direction,

00:11:56.888 --> 00:11:59.085
if we look, say, at the energy sector,

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:01.945
where all the talk is about how households

00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:05.529
will be efficient producers of green energy

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:08.157
and efficient conservers of energy,

00:12:08.157 --> 00:12:10.037
that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.

00:12:10.037 --> 00:12:11.907
That is the fragmentation of scale

00:12:11.907 --> 00:12:14.261
because the very small can substitute

00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:16.855
for the traditional corporate scale.

00:12:16.855 --> 00:12:18.646
Either way, what we are driven to

00:12:18.646 --> 00:12:22.017
is this horizontalization of the structure of industries,

00:12:22.017 --> 00:12:24.607
and that implies fundamental changes

00:12:24.607 --> 00:12:26.669
in how we think about strategy.

00:12:26.669 --> 00:12:28.701
It means, for example, that we need to think

00:12:28.701 --> 00:12:31.248
about strategy as the curation

00:12:31.248 --> 00:12:33.893
of these kinds of horizontal structure,

00:12:33.893 --> 00:12:35.533
where things like business definition

00:12:35.533 --> 00:12:37.095
and even industry definition

00:12:37.095 --> 00:12:39.897
are actually the outcomes of strategy,

00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:43.078
not something that the strategy presupposes.

00:12:43.078 --> 00:12:46.234
It means, for example, we need to work out

00:12:46.234 --> 00:12:48.591
how to accommodate collaboration

00:12:48.591 --> 00:12:50.457
and competition simultaneously.

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:51.543
Think about the genome.

00:12:51.543 --> 00:12:53.321
We need to accommodate the very large

00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:55.456
and the very small simultaneously.

00:12:55.456 --> 00:12:57.399
And we need industry structures

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:00.341
that will accommodate very,
very different motivations,

00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:02.974
from the amateur motivations
of people in communities

00:13:02.974 --> 00:13:04.947
to maybe the social motivations

00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:07.283
of infrastructure built by governments,

00:13:07.283 --> 00:13:09.908
or, for that matter, cooperative institutions

00:13:09.908 --> 00:13:12.400
built by companies that are otherwise competing,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.394
because that is the only way
that they can get to scale.

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:17.371
These kinds of transformations

00:13:17.371 --> 00:13:21.096
render the traditional premises 
of business strategy obsolete.

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:23.665
They drive us into a completely new world.

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:25.086
They require us, whether we are

00:13:25.086 --> 00:13:27.853
in the public sector or the private sector,

00:13:27.853 --> 00:13:30.153
to think very fundamentally differently

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:31.973
about the structure of business,

00:13:31.973 --> 00:13:35.427
and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.

00:13:35.427 --> 00:13:38.240
Thank you.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.755
