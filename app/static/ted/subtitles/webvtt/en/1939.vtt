00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:03.115
I had brain surgery 18 years ago,

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:05.682
and since that time, brain science has become

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:07.681
a personal passion of mine.

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.916
I'm actually an engineer.

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:12.432
And first let me say, I recently joined

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:13.981
Google's Moonshot group,

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.193
where I had a division,

00:00:15.193 --> 00:00:17.374
the display division in Google X,

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:19.996
and the brain science work I'm speaking about today

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:22.917
is work I did before I joined Google

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:25.249
and on the side outside of Google.

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.432
So that said, there's a stigma

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:30.717
when you have brain surgery.

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:33.540
Are you still smart or not?

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.388
And if not, can you make yourself smart again?

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:39.154
After my neurosurgery,

00:00:39.154 --> 00:00:41.151
part of my brain was missing,

00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:43.924
and I had to deal with that.

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:46.868
It wasn't the grey matter, but it 
was the gooey part dead center

00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:50.270
that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.501
Immediately after my surgery,

00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.644
I had to decide what amounts of each of over

00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:58.346
a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,

00:00:58.346 --> 00:01:00.155
because if I just took nothing,

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.887
I would die within hours.

00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:06.807
Every day now for 18 years -- every single day --

00:01:06.807 --> 00:01:09.517
I've had to try to decide the combinations

00:01:09.517 --> 00:01:10.845
and mixtures of chemicals,

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:14.692
and try to get them, to stay alive.

00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:17.413
There have been several close calls.

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:21.112
But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,

00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:24.339
so I decided I would experiment

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:26.779
to try to find more optimal dosages

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:28.416
because there really isn't a clear road map

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:30.319
on this that's detailed.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.470
I began to try different mixtures,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.342
and I was blown away by how

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:37.753
tiny changes in dosages

00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:40.902
dramatically changed my sense of self,

00:01:40.902 --> 00:01:42.713
my sense of who I was, my thinking,

00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:44.972
my behavior towards people.

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:47.021
One particularly dramatic case:

00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:48.889
for a couple months I actually tried dosages

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.797
and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,

00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:55.808
and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:58.928
(Laughter)

00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:01.986
I was angry all the time,

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:03.832
I thought about sex constantly,

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.781
and I thought I was the smartest person

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:08.832
in the entire world, and

00:02:08.832 --> 00:02:11.095
—(Laughter)—

00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:14.020
of course over the years I'd
met guys kind of like that,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.287
or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.

00:02:16.287 --> 00:02:18.471
I was kind of extreme.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.040
But to me, the surprise was,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.206
I wasn't trying to be arrogant.

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:26.415
I was actually trying,

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:28.775
with a little bit of insecurity,

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:31.775
to actually fix a problem in front of me,

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:33.631
and it just didn't come out that way.

00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.114
So I couldn't handle it.

00:02:35.114 --> 00:02:36.639
I changed my dosages.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.094
But that experience, I think, gave me

00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:40.845
a new appreciation for men

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:42.661
and what they might walk through,

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.351
and I've gotten along with men

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:46.190
a lot better since then.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.735
What I was trying to do

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.763
with tuning these hormones

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:52.086
and neurotransmitters and so forth

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:55.691
was to try to get my intelligence back

00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:58.325
after my illness and surgery,

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:00.960
my creative thought, my idea flow.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.601
And I think mostly in images,

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:06.453
and so for me that became a key metric --

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:08.783
how to get these mental images

00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:11.287
that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,

00:03:11.287 --> 00:03:13.030
if you will, my ideas,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.402
trying on different new ideas for size,

00:03:15.402 --> 00:03:17.097
playing out scenarios.

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:19.010
This kind of thinking isn't new.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.265
Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:23.793
saw things similarly.

00:03:23.793 --> 00:03:26.530
They thought that mental images and ideas

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.861
were actually the same thing.

00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:31.278
There are those today that dispute that,

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:34.473
and lots of debates about how the mind works,

00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:36.209
but for me it's simple:

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.741
Mental images, for most of us,

00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:42.675
are central in inventive and creative thinking.

00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:44.450
So after several years,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.683
I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,

00:03:47.683 --> 00:03:50.731
really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:53.000
and the analytical backbone behind them.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.921
And so now I'm working on,

00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:59.083
how can I get these mental images in my mind

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:01.933
out to my computer screen faster?

00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:04.022
Can you imagine, if you will,

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:06.142
a movie director being able to use

00:04:06.142 --> 00:04:09.904
her imagination alone to
direct the world in front of her?

00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:13.492
Or a musician to get the music out of his head?

00:04:13.492 --> 00:04:15.784
There are incredible possibilities with this

00:04:15.784 --> 00:04:17.777
as a way for creative people

00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:20.010
to share at light speed.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.008
And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck

00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:23.181
in being able to do this

00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:27.161
is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.

00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:30.019
So let me show you why I think 
we're pretty close to getting there

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.416
by sharing with you two recent experiments

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:35.003
from two top neuroscience groups.

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.491
Both used fMRI technology --

00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:39.770
functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.181
to image the brain,

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:44.438
and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis

00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:46.388
and his colleagues at Harvard.

00:04:46.388 --> 00:04:49.542
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan

00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:52.809
of a person looking at an image.

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:54.738
The middle column shows the brainscan

00:04:54.738 --> 00:04:56.359
of that same individual

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:59.425
imagining, seeing that same image.

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:01.473
And the right column was created

00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:05.067
by subtracting the middle 
column from the left column,

00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:08.026
showing the difference to be nearly zero.

00:05:08.026 --> 00:05:10.920
This was repeated on lots of different individuals

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.750
with lots of different images,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.354
always with a similar result.

00:05:15.354 --> 00:05:17.443
The difference between seeing an image

00:05:17.443 --> 00:05:19.898
and imagining seeing that same image

00:05:19.898 --> 00:05:22.053
is next to nothing.

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:24.814
Next let me share with you one other experiment,

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:29.355
this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.

00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:31.418
They've been able to decode brainwaves

00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:33.859
into recognizable visual fields.

00:05:33.859 --> 00:05:35.164
So let me set this up for you.

00:05:35.164 --> 00:05:37.497
In this experiment, individuals were shown

00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:39.492
hundreds of hours of YouTube videos

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:41.531
while scans were made of their brains

00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:44.747
to create a large library of their brain reacting

00:05:44.747 --> 00:05:47.396
to video sequences.

00:05:47.396 --> 00:05:50.246
Then a new movie was shown with new images,

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:52.198
new people, new animals in it,

00:05:52.198 --> 00:05:54.909
and a new scan set was recorded.

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.697
The computer, using brain scan data alone,

00:05:57.697 --> 00:05:59.721
decoded that new brain scan

00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:04.097
to show what it thought the 
individual was actually seeing.

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:07.478
On the right-hand side, you
see the computer's guess,

00:06:07.478 --> 00:06:11.485
and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.

00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:13.804
This is the jaw-dropper.

00:06:13.804 --> 00:06:16.491
We are so close to being able to do this.

00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:19.276
We just need to up the resolution.

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:22.528
And now remember that when you see an image

00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:24.686
versus when you imagine that same image,

00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:28.161
it creates the same brain scan.

00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:30.883
So this was done with the highest-resolution

00:06:30.883 --> 00:06:33.068
brain scan systems available today,

00:06:33.068 --> 00:06:34.852
and their resolution has increased really

00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:38.349
about a thousandfold in the last several years.

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.671
Next we need to increase the resolution

00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:42.648
another thousandfold

00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:44.437
to get a deeper glimpse.

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:45.948
How do we do that?

00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:48.562
There's a lot of techniques in this approach.

00:06:48.562 --> 00:06:51.680
One way is to crack open your
skull and put in electrodes.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.083
I'm not for that.

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:56.038
There's a lot of new imaging techniques

00:06:56.038 --> 00:06:58.041
being proposed, some even by me,

00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.000
but given the recent success of MRI,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.068
first we need to ask the question,

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:05.909
is it the end of the road with this technology?

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.364
Conventional wisdom says the only way

00:07:08.364 --> 00:07:10.953
to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,

00:07:10.953 --> 00:07:12.795
but at this point bigger magnets

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:16.545
only offer incremental resolution improvements,

00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:18.705
not the thousandfold we need.

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:20.528
I'm putting forward an idea:

00:07:20.528 --> 00:07:22.491
instead of bigger magnets,

00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:24.941
let's make better magnets.

00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:26.944
There's some new technology breakthroughs

00:07:26.944 --> 00:07:28.401
in nanoscience

00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:30.128
when applied to magnetic structures

00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:33.141
that have created a whole new class of magnets,

00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.672
and with these magnets, we can lay down

00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:37.839
very fine detailed magnetic field patterns

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.194
throughout the brain,

00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:42.376
and using those, we can actually create

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:45.214
holographic-like interference structures

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.683
to get precision control over many patterns,

00:07:48.683 --> 00:07:51.128
as is shown here by shifting things.

00:07:51.128 --> 00:07:54.278
We can create much more complicated structures

00:07:54.278 --> 00:07:56.349
with slightly different arrangements,

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:59.382
kind of like making Spirograph.

00:07:59.382 --> 00:08:01.610
So why does that matter?

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.187
A lot of effort in MRI over the years

00:08:04.187 --> 00:08:07.024
has gone into making really big,

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:09.634
really huge magnets, right?

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:12.143
But yet most of the recent advances

00:08:12.143 --> 00:08:14.340
in resolution have actually come from

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.348
ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions

00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:21.635
in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.326
in the MRI systems.

00:08:24.326 --> 00:08:27.648
Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,

00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:30.320
put down structured magnetic patterns

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.419
in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.726
So by combining the magnetics patterns

00:08:35.726 --> 00:08:38.436
with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies

00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:40.607
processing which can massively increase

00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:42.576
the information that we can extract

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:45.022
in a single scan.

00:08:45.022 --> 00:08:47.354
And on top of that, we can then layer

00:08:47.354 --> 00:08:51.826
our ever-growing knowledge 
of brain structure and memory

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:55.521
to create a thousandfold increase that we need.

00:08:55.521 --> 00:08:58.464
And using fMRI, we should be able to measure

00:08:58.464 --> 00:09:00.546
not just oxygenated blood flow,

00:09:00.546 --> 00:09:03.447
but the hormones and neurotransmitters 
I've talked about

00:09:03.447 --> 00:09:05.792
and maybe even the direct neural activity,

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:07.295
which is the dream.

00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:09.529
We're going to be able to dump our ideas

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:12.223
directly to digital media.

00:09:12.223 --> 00:09:14.934
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language

00:09:14.934 --> 00:09:19.143
and communicate directly with human thought?

00:09:19.143 --> 00:09:22.336
What would we be capable of then?

00:09:22.336 --> 00:09:24.973
And how will we learn to deal

00:09:24.973 --> 00:09:29.192
with the truths of unfiltered human thought?

00:09:29.192 --> 00:09:31.759
You think the Internet was big.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:34.361
These are huge questions.

00:09:34.361 --> 00:09:36.509
It might be irresistible as a tool

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:40.385
to amplify our thinking and communication skills.

00:09:40.385 --> 00:09:42.408
And indeed, this very same tool

00:09:42.408 --> 00:09:44.534
may prove to lead to the cure

00:09:44.534 --> 00:09:47.608
for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.

00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:51.120
We have little option but to open this door.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.705
Regardless, pick a year --

00:09:52.705 --> 00:09:54.971
will it happen in five years or 15 years?

00:09:54.971 --> 00:09:59.587
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.

00:09:59.587 --> 00:10:03.282
We need to learn how to take this step together.

00:10:03.282 --> 00:10:05.456
Thank you.

00:10:05.456 --> 00:10:09.430
(Applause)
