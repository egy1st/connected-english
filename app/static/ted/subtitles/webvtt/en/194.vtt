WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter) We'll be talking about them.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments, normally. I'm a theorist.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I'm going see what happens if I press this button.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Sure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What is it made of?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and they're very much connected with the history of the universe.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but those are at very, very small distances,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The main thing I want to talk about is this:

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And why on earth could that be so?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Well, here's an example from my own experience.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's fairly dramatic, actually, to have this happen.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Three or four of us, in 1957,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces, this weak force.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And it was in disagreement with seven -- seven, count them, seven experiments.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Experiments were all wrong.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And we published before knowing that,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because we figured it was so beautiful, it's gotta be right!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The experiments had to be wrong, and they were.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now our friend over there, Albert Einstein,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
used to pay very little attention when people said,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
"You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
DC Miller. What about that?" And he would say, "Aw, that'll go away." (Laughter)

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now, why does stuff like that work? That's the question.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now, yeah, what do we mean by beautiful? That's one thing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'll try to make that clear -- partially clear.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Why should it work, and is this something to do with human beings?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and that is, it has nothing to do with human beings.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Somewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
maybe in a another galaxy,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and are interested in science. It's not impossible; I think there probably are lots.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Very likely, none is close enough to interact with us.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But they could be out there, very easily.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And suppose they have, you know, very different sensory apparatus, and so on.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
They have seven tentacles, and they have 14 little funny-looking compound eyes,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and a brain shaped like a pretzel.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Would they really have different laws?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
There are lots of people who believe that, and I think it is utter baloney.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I think there are laws out there,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
-- but we try. And we try to get closer and closer.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And someday, we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
of the particles and forces, what I call the "fundamental law."

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We may not even be terribly far from it.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
we can still think there is one out there,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I think that's the main point to be made.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We express these things mathematically.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And when the mathematics is very simple --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
when in terms of some mathematical notation,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
you can write the theory in a very brief space, without a lot of complication --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Newton certainly believed that.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And he said, here, "It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The basic law, let's say -- here's an assumption.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of a unified theory of all the particles.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Now, some people call that a theory of everything.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway. (Laughter)

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Now, sometimes those probabilities are near certainties.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And in a lot of familiar cases, they of course are.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
But other times they're not, and you have only probabilities for different outcomes.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
or chance outcomes, that are there in addition.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes; they are in addition.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact, a huge amount of the information

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
in the universe around us comes from those accidents,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and not just from the fundamental laws.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Now, it's often said that getting closer and closer

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies, and then higher energies,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and then higher energies, or short distances, and then shorter distances,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and then still shorter distances, and so on, is like peeling the skin of an onion.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And we keep doing that,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and build more powerful machines, accelerators for particles.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Now, what happens is that as we do that, as we peel these skins of the onion,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and we get closer and closer to the underlying law,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and with the next one. We write them out mathematically,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and we see they use very similar mathematics.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
They require very similar mathematics.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
That is absolutely remarkable, and that is a central feature

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
of what I'm trying to say today.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Newton called it -- that's Newton, by the way -- that one.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This one is Albert Einstein. Hi, Al! And anyway,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
he said, "nature conformable to herself" -- personifying nature as a female.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And so what happens is that the new phenomena,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
the new skins, the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that we get to, resemble the slightly larger ones.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
is almost the same as what we need for the next skin.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And that's why the equations look so simple.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Because they use mathematics we already have.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
A trivial example is this: Newton found the law of gravity,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Coulomb, in France, found the same law for electric charges.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Here's an example of this similarity.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
You look at gravity, you see a certain law.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Then you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's a very simple example.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
There are lots of more sophisticated examples.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Symmetry is very important in this discussion.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You know what it means. A circle, for example,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
You rotate around the center of the circle, the circle remains unchanged.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
You take a sphere, in three dimensions, you rotate around the center of the sphere,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and all those rotations leave the sphere alone.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They are symmetries of the sphere.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So we say, in general, that there's a symmetry

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
or its description, unchanged.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
under rotations of all of space.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Doesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
it doesn't leave the -- doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
There's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and if you use that notation, the equations get a lot simpler.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Then Einstein, with his special theory of relativity,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
which are called special relativity.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And those symmetries, then, make the equations even shorter, and even prettier, therefore.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Let's look. You don't have to know what these things mean, doesn't make any difference.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
But you can just look at the form. (Laughter) You can look at the form.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You see above, at the top, a long list

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
of equations with three components for the three directions of space: x, y and z.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Then, using vector analysis, you use rotational symmetry, and you get this next set.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
down here, showing that symmetry exhibits better and better.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
The more and more symmetry you have, the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
The last two, the first equation says that electric charges and currents

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
The next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Someday we may find some slight hole in that argument.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But for the moment, that's the case.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Now, here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
They should have heard of it, but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
so I won't do it. I'll just mention it. (Laughter)

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But Chen Ning Yang, called by us "Frank" Yang -- (Laughter)

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
-- and Bob Mills put forward, 50 years ago,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
this generalization of Maxwell's equations, with a new symmetry.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
A whole new symmetry.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Mathematics very similar, but there was a whole new symmetry.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
-- didn't. It didn't, by itself, contribute to particle physics.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But then some of us generalized it further. And then it did!

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So here we say, again, what we said before:

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And therefore it looks beautiful

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
because we already know how to write it in a lovely, concise way.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And then there is self-similarity across the scales -- in other words,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
from one skin of the onion to another one.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Proximate self-similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
That will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Here's what Newton himself said:

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
"Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self."

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
but in his day it wasn't taken for granted.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
There's the story, which is not absolutely certain to be right, but a lot of people told it.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Four sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and he went down to his mother's farm -- because the university was closed --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
he saw an apple fall from a tree, or on his head or something.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
That was a big unification for those days, although today we take it for granted.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
It's the same theory of gravity.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So he said that this principle of nature, consonance:

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
"This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I forbore to describe it in that book,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ... "

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
That's what we all have to watch out for, (Laughter) especially at this meeting.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
" ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book."

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Now, who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
That the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and so on? Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It's not something in the human mind. The human mind can, of course, appreciate it

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and enjoy it, use it, but it's not -- it doesn't stem from the human mind.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
It stems from the character of gravity.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And that's true of all the things we're talking about.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
They are properties of the fundamental law.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
the phenomenon of the next skin.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I say here that Newton did a lot of things that year:

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
gravity, the laws of motion, the calculus, white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And he could have written quite an essay on "What I Did Over My Summer Vacation."

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
(Laughter)

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
They follow from the fundamental theory.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
They are what we call emergent properties.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
That's what emergence means.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Life can emerge from physics and chemistry, plus a lot of accidents.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
The human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It doesn't diminish the importance of these subjects

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
to know that they follow from more fundamental things, plus accidents.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
That's a general rule, and it's critically important to realize that.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You don't need something more in order to get something more.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
People keep asking that when they read my book, "The Quark and the Jaguar,"

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and they say, "Isn't there something more beyond what you have there?"

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Presumably, they mean something supernatural.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Anyway, there isn't. (Laughter)

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
You don't need something more to explain something more.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Thank you very much. (Applause)
