00:00:00.811 --> 00:00:02.776
The 2011 Arab Spring

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:04.579
captured the attention of the world.

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:06.228
It also captured the attention

00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:08.605
of authoritarian governments in other countries,

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:11.568
who were worried that revolution would spread.

00:00:11.568 --> 00:00:13.645
To respond, they ramped up surveillance

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.741
of activists, journalists and dissidents

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.695
who they feared would inspire revolution

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:20.530
in their own countries.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.575
One prominent Bahraini activist,

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:24.685
who was arrested and tortured by his government,

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:26.410
has said that the interrogators showed him

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.280
transcripts of his telephone calls

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.088
and text messages.

00:00:30.088 --> 00:00:31.744
Of course, it's no secret

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:34.940
that governments are able to intercept
telephone calls and text messages.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.312
It's for that reason that many activists

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.238
specifically avoid using the telephone.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.586
Instead, they use tools like Skype,

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:44.106
which they think are immune to interception.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:45.878
They're wrong.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.604
There have now been over the last few years

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:50.250
an industry of companies

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.504
who provide surveillance technology to governments,

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:55.865
specifically technology that
allows those governments

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:57.518
to hack into the computers

00:00:57.518 --> 00:00:59.113
of surveillance targets.

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:01.953
Rather than intercepting the communications 
as they go over the wire,

00:01:01.953 --> 00:01:04.220
instead they now hack into your computer,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.222
enable your webcam, enable your microphone,

00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:08.679
and steal documents from your computer.

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.512
When the government of Egypt fell in 2011,

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:14.913
activists raided the office of the secret police,

00:01:14.913 --> 00:01:16.901
and among the many documents they found

00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:19.218
was this document by the Gamma Corporation,

00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:21.019
by Gamma International.

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:22.676
Gamma is a German company

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:24.160
that manufactures surveillance software

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.317
and sells it only to governments.

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:28.324
It's important to note that most governments

00:01:28.324 --> 00:01:30.390
don't really have the in-house capabilities

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.855
to develop this software.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:33.474
Smaller ones don't have the resources

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:35.250
or the expertise,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.557
and so there's this market of Western companies

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:40.524
who are happy to supply them with the tools

00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:42.242
and techniques for a price.

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:44.848
Gamma is just one of these companies.

00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:47.756
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:49.653
their software to the Egyptian government.

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:52.250
They'd sent them an invoice for a sale,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.892
but the Egyptians never bought it.

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:55.616
Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.249
used a free demo version of Gamma's software.

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.024
(Laughter)

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:04.522
So this screenshot is from a sales video

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:06.087
that Gamma produced.

00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:08.070
Really, they're just emphasizing

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.721
in a relatively slick presentation

00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.914
the fact that the police can sort of sit

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:13.364
in an air-conditioned office

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:14.775
and remotely monitor someone

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:16.950
without them having any idea that it's going on.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.985
You know, your webcam light won't turn on.

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:22.339
There's nothing to indicate that
the microphone is enabled.

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.674
This is the managing director
of Gamma International.

00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:27.535
His name is Martin Muench.

00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:30.466
There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.318
This is perhaps my favorite.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.462
I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam.

00:02:34.462 --> 00:02:36.130
You can see there's a little sticker

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.023
that's placed over his camera.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:40.556
He knows what kind of surveillance is possible,

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:42.362
and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.964
against him.

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.888
Muench has said that he intends

00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:47.552
for his software to be used

00:02:47.552 --> 00:02:50.535
to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:52.331
Of course, he's also acknowledged that once

00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:54.486
the software has been sold to governments,

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:58.311
he has no way of knowing how it can be used.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.161
Gamma's software has been located on servers

00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.817
in countries around the world,

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:04.208
many with really atrocious track records

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:05.769
and human rights violations.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.164
They really are selling their
software around the world.

00:03:09.164 --> 00:03:11.465
Gamma is not the only company in the business.

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:14.216
As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:17.055
One of the other big guys in the industry

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:19.450
is an Italian company called Hacking Team.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.175
Now, Hacking Team has what is probably

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:23.145
the slickest presentation.

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:26.173
The video they've produced is very sexy,

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:27.821
and so I'm going to play you a clip

00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:29.135
just so you can get a feel

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:30.966
both for the capabilities of the software

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:32.872
but also how it's marketed

00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:34.640
to their government clients.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.156
(Video) Narrator: You want to look 
through your target's eyes.

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.063
(Music)

00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:43.065
You have to hack your target.

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:49.381
["While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders"]

00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:52.304
You have to hit many different platforms.

00:03:52.304 --> 00:03:56.184
["Windows, OS X, iOS, Android,
Blackberry, Symbian, Linux"]

00:03:56.184 --> 00:03:58.652
You have to overcome encryption

00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:01.549
and capture relevant data.

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.108
[Skype &amp; encrypted calls, target location, 
messaging, relationships,

00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:09.280
web browsing, audio &amp; video"]

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.440
Being stealth and untraceable.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.714
["Immune to any protection system
Hidden collection infrastructure"]

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:20.819
Deployed all over your country.

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.353
["Up to hundreds of thousands of targets
Managed from a single spot"]

00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:28.675
Exactly what we do.

00:04:28.675 --> 00:04:30.938
Christopher Soghoian: So, it
would be funny if it wasn't true,

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.726
but, in fact, Hacking Team's software

00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:35.674
is being sold to governments around the world.

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:37.426
Last year we learned, for example,

00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:41.474
that it's been used to target Moroccan 
journalists by the Moroccan government.

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:44.018
Many, many countries it's been found in.

00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:47.142
So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting

00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:49.485
the U.S. law enforcement market.

00:04:49.485 --> 00:04:51.768
In the last year or so, the company

00:04:51.768 --> 00:04:56.544
has opened a sales office in Maryland.

00:04:56.544 --> 00:04:58.658
The company has also hired a spokesperson.

00:04:58.658 --> 00:05:00.195
They've been attending

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:01.792
surveillance industry conferences

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:03.807
where law enforcement officials show up.

00:05:03.807 --> 00:05:05.641
They've spoken at the conferences.

00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:07.229
What I thought was most fascinating was

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.330
they've actually paid for the coffee break

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.270
at one of the law enforcement conferences

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.763
earlier this year.

00:05:12.763 --> 00:05:14.862
I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team

00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:17.587
has sold their technology in the United States,

00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:19.558
but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,

00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:22.733
it isn't because they haven't been trying hard.

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:24.775
So as I said before,

00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:26.695
governments that don't really have the resources

00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:28.291
to build their own tools will buy

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:29.701
off-the-shelf surveillance software,

00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.089
and so for that reason,

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.805
you see that the government of, say, Tunisia,

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:35.993
might use the same software
as the government of Germany.

00:05:35.993 --> 00:05:38.265
They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:40.464
The Federal Bureau of
Investigation in the United States

00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:43.226
does have the budget to build
their own surveillance technology,

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:45.007
and so for several years, I've been trying

00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:47.398
to figure out if and how the FBI

00:05:47.398 --> 00:05:50.296
is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.

00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:53.449
My friends at an organization called
the Electronic Frontier Foundation --

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.761
they're a civil society group —

00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:58.253
obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:01.101
detailing their next generation
of surveillance technologies.

00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:03.735
Most of these documents were heavily redacted,

00:06:03.735 --> 00:06:06.551
but what you can see from the slides,

00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:08.513
if I zoom in, is this term:

00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:10.333
Remote Operations Unit.

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:12.567
Now, when I first looked into this,

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:14.637
I'd never heard of this unit before.

00:06:14.637 --> 00:06:16.939
I've been studying surveillance
for more than six years.

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:18.224
I'd never heard of it.

00:06:18.224 --> 00:06:20.187
And so I went online and I did some research,

00:06:20.187 --> 00:06:22.312
and ultimately I hit the mother lode

00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:23.946
when I went to LinkedIn,

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:26.515
the social networking site for job seekers.

00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:29.428
There were lots of former
U.S. government contractors

00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:30.815
who had at one point worked

00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:32.124
for the Remote Operating Unit,

00:06:32.124 --> 00:06:35.538
and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs

00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:37.569
what they had done in their former job.

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.791
(Laughter)

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:41.778
So I took this information

00:06:41.778 --> 00:06:45.522
and I gave it to a journalist that I know
and trust at the Wall Street Journal,

00:06:45.522 --> 00:06:47.323
and she was able to contact several other

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.077
former law enforcement officials

00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:50.883
who spoke on background and confirmed

00:06:50.883 --> 00:06:54.242
that yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team

00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:56.378
that does nothing but hack into the computers

00:06:56.378 --> 00:06:57.904
of surveillance targets.

00:06:57.904 --> 00:06:59.792
Like Gamma and Hacking Team,

00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:01.909
the FBI also has the capability

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.303
to remotely activate webcams, microphones,

00:07:05.303 --> 00:07:07.505
steal documents, get web browsing information,

00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:09.189
the works.

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.011
There's sort of a big problem

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:12.611
with governments going into hacking,

00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:15.130
and that's that terrorists, pedophiles,

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.041
drug dealers, journalists and human rights activists

00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:20.312
all use the same kinds of computers.

00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:22.359
There's no drug dealer phone

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.325
and there's no journalist laptop.

00:07:24.325 --> 00:07:26.559
We all use the same technology,

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:28.453
and what that means then is that for governments

00:07:28.453 --> 00:07:30.570
to have the capability to hack into the computers

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.269
of the real bad guys,

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:34.245
they also have to have the capability

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.430
to hack into our devices too.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.182
So governments around the world

00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:39.643
have been embracing this technology.

00:07:39.643 --> 00:07:41.248
They've been embracing hacking

00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:43.068
as a law enforcement technique,

00:07:43.068 --> 00:07:45.018
but without any real debate.

00:07:45.018 --> 00:07:46.837
In the United States, where I live,

00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:48.662
there have been no congressional hearings.

00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:50.623
There's no law that's been passed

00:07:50.623 --> 00:07:52.696
specifically authorizing this technique,

00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:55.365
and because of its power and potential for abuse,

00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:58.312
