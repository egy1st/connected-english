00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:03.070
The year is 1800.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.126
A curious little invention is being talked about.

00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:09.207
It's called a microscope.

00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:10.986
What it allows you to do

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:13.628
is see tiny little lifeforms

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:16.115
that are invisible to the naked eye.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.143
Soon comes the medical discovery

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:21.228
that many of these lifeforms are actually causes

00:00:21.228 --> 00:00:23.419
of terrible human diseases.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.204
Imagine what happened to the society

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:28.192
when they realized

00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:31.008
that an English mom in her teacup

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.144
actually was drinking a monster soup,

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:37.293
not very far from here. This is from London.

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:40.135
Fast forward 200 years.

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:42.267
We still have this monster soup around,

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:45.122
and it's taken hold in the developing countries

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.538
around the tropical belt.

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:50.101
Just for malaria itself,

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.546
there are a million deaths a year,

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:54.292
and more than a billion people

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:56.940
that need to be tested because they are at risk

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.175
for different species of malarial infections.

00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:02.986
Now it's actually very simple to put a face

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:04.781
to many of these monsters.

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:07.408
You take a stain, like acridine orange

00:01:07.408 --> 00:01:09.525
or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa,

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:12.638
and a microscope, and you look at them.

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:15.018
They all have faces.

00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:17.656
Why is that so, that Alex in Kenya,

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:20.884
Fatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai,

00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:24.305
and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:27.884
to be able to diagnose why they are sick?

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:30.910
And that's primarily because scalability

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.942
of the diagnostics is completely out of reach.

00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:37.858
And remember that number: one billion.

00:01:37.858 --> 00:01:41.759
The problem lies with the microscope itself.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.135
Even though the pinnacle of modern science,

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:47.270
research microscopes are
not designed for field testing.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.950
Neither were they first designed

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.101
for diagnostics at all.

00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:54.489
They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain,

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.790
and cost a lot of money.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.195
This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:03.489
using the exact same setup
that we actually use today

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.173
for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram

00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:08.618
in Sevagram in India.

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:11.945
Two of my students, Jim and James,

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.265
traveled around India and Thailand,

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:16.517
starting to think about this problem a lot.

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:18.992
We saw all kinds of donated equipment.

00:02:18.992 --> 00:02:21.904
We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:24.099
And we saw people who had a functional microscope

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.050
but just didn't know how to even turn it on.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.690
What grew out of that work and that trip

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.441
was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.

00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.264
So what is a Foldscope?

00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:38.813
A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope,

00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:41.943
a platform for fluorescence, bright-field,

00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:43.518
polarization, projection,

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:46.086
all kinds of advanced microscopy

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.301
built purely by folding paper.

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:52.162
So, now you think, how is that possible?

00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:54.125
I'm going to show you some examples here,

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.926
and we will run through some of them.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:59.710
It starts with a single sheet of paper.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.081
What you see here is all the possible components

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:07.506
to build a functional bright-field
and fluorescence microscope.

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:09.315
So, there are three stages:

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:12.064
There is the optical stage, the illumination stage

00:03:12.064 --> 00:03:14.532
and the mask-holding stage.

00:03:14.532 --> 00:03:16.404
And there are micro optics at the bottom

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.278
that's actually embedded in the paper itself.

00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:21.782
What you do is, you take it on,

00:03:21.782 --> 00:03:24.558
and just like you are playing like a toy,

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:27.645
which it is,

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:31.614
I tab it off,

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.221
and I break it off.

00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:39.945
This paper has no instructions and no languages.

00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:42.264
There is a code, a color code embedded,

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:46.875
that tells you exactly how to
fold that specific microscope.

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:49.524
When it's done, it looks something like this,

00:03:49.524 --> 00:03:52.255
has all the functionalities of a standard microscope,

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:54.136
just like an XY stage,

00:03:54.136 --> 00:03:58.557
a place where a sample slide could go,

00:03:58.557 --> 00:04:01.097
for example right here.

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:02.609
We didn't want to change this,

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.981
because this is the standard

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:05.834
that's been optimized for over the years,

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:08.530
and many health workers are actually used to this.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.991
So this is what changes,

00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:12.158
but the standard stains all remain the same

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:13.933
for many different diseases.

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:16.865
You pop this in.

00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:20.751
There is an XY stage,

00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:22.724
and then there is a focusing stage,

00:04:22.724 --> 00:04:24.590
which is a flexure mechanism

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.143
that's built in paper itself that allows us to move

00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:30.124
and focus the lenses by micron steps.

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:32.257
So what's really interesting about this object,

00:04:32.257 --> 00:04:34.140
and my students hate when I do this,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.901
but I'm going to do this anyway,

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.857
is these are rugged devices.

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:42.434
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:45.386
and really try to stomp on it.

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:47.761
And they last, even though they're designed

00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:51.224
from a very flexible material, like paper.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:54.076
Another fun fact is, this is what we actually

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:58.131
send out there as a standard diagnostic tool,

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.900
but here in this envelope

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.291
I have 30 different foldscopes

00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:08.022
of different configurations all in a single folder.

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:09.834
And I'm going to pick one randomly.

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:11.916
This one, it turns out, is actually designed

00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.479
specifically for malaria,

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.790
because it has the fluorescent filters built

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.887
specifically for diagnosing malaria.

00:05:17.887 --> 00:05:21.815
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:23.581
comes out of this.

00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:26.520
So up till now, you didn't actually see

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.477
what I would see from one of these setups.

00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:31.158
So what I would like to do is,

00:05:31.158 --> 00:05:32.784
if we could dim the lights, please,

00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:36.449
it turns out foldscopes are
also projection microscopes.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.983
I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn --

00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:40.736
go to the back of the wall --

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:42.444
and just project, and this way you will see

00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:44.564
exactly what I would see.

00:05:44.564 --> 00:05:46.350
What you're looking at --

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.733
(Applause) —

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:51.369
This is a cross-section of a compound eye,

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:53.720
and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.964
I am going through the z-axis.

00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:58.988
You actually see how the lenses are cut together

00:05:58.988 --> 00:06:00.561
in the cross-section pattern.

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.117
Another example, one of my favorite insects,

00:06:03.117 --> 00:06:05.094
I love to hate this one,

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:06.875
is a mosquito,

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:10.637
and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:14.000
Right there.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.213
All from the simple setup that I actually described.

00:06:18.213 --> 00:06:19.986
So my wife has been field testing

00:06:19.986 --> 00:06:21.986
some of our microscopes

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:24.467
by washing my clothes whenever I forget them

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.496
in the dryer.

00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:29.296
So it turns out they're waterproof, and --

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:31.084
(Laughter) —

00:06:31.084 --> 00:06:33.582
right here is just fluorescent water,

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.132
and I don't know if you can actually see this.

00:06:35.132 --> 00:06:37.521
This also shows you how 
the projection scope works.

00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:41.174
You get to see the beam the 
way it's projected and bent.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.139
Can we get the lights back on again?

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.926
So I'm quickly going to show you,

00:06:48.926 --> 00:06:50.975
since I'm running out of time,

00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:53.401
in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,

00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:56.481
the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,

00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:59.603
so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.

00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:02.462
(Applause)

00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:04.557
And what this allows us to do

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.893
is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy,

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:08.910
which we call use-and-throw microscopy.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.999
I'm going to give you a quick snapshot

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.762
of some of the parts that go in.

00:07:12.762 --> 00:07:14.221
Here is a sheet of paper.

00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:16.310
This is when we were thinking about the idea.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.665
This is an A4 sheet of paper.

00:07:17.665 --> 00:07:19.646
These are the three stages that you actually see.

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:23.076
And the optical components, if you
look at the inset up on the right,

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.503
we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses

00:07:25.503 --> 00:07:27.815
in paper itself at really high throughputs,

00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:29.674
so it uses a process of self-assembly

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:30.786
and surface tension

00:07:30.786 --> 00:07:34.322
to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:35.767
So that's where the lenses go.

00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:37.379
There are some light sources.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:38.764
And essentially, in the end,

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:41.942
all the parts line up because of origami,

00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:45.213
because of the fact that origami allows us

00:07:45.213 --> 00:07:48.193
micron-scale precision of optical alignment.

00:07:48.193 --> 00:07:50.822
So even though this looks like a simple toy,

00:07:50.822 --> 00:07:52.736
the aspects of engineering that go in

00:07:52.736 --> 00:07:55.422
something like this are fairly sophisticated.

00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:58.657
So here is another obvious thing that we would do,

00:07:58.657 --> 00:08:00.250
typically, if I was going to show

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.755
that these microscopes are robust,

00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:05.593
is go to the third floor and
drop it from the floor itself.

00:08:05.593 --> 00:08:08.916
There it is, and it survives.

00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:11.093
So for us, the next step actually

00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:12.932
is really finishing our field trials.

00:08:12.932 --> 00:08:15.037
We are starting at the end of the summer.

00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:17.964
We are at a stage where we'll be 
making thousands of microscopes.

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:20.108
That would be the first time where we would be

00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:22.193
doing field trials with the highest density

00:08:22.193 --> 00:08:24.748
of microscopes ever at a given place.

00:08:24.748 --> 00:08:26.828
We've started collecting data for malaria,

00:08:26.828 --> 00:08:30.624
Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.

00:08:30.624 --> 00:08:32.718
And I want to leave you with this picture.

00:08:32.718 --> 00:08:34.643
I had not anticipated this before,

00:08:34.643 --> 00:08:36.330
but a really interesting link

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.225
between hands-on science education

00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:39.483
and global health.

00:08:39.483 --> 00:08:42.409
What are the tools that we're actually providing

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.589
the kids who are going to fight

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:46.507
this monster soup for tomorrow?

00:08:46.507 --> 00:08:48.865
I would love for them to be able to just print out

00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:50.994
a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.
