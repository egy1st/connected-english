00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:02.722
This is a vending machine in Los Angeles.

00:00:02.746 --> 00:00:05.456
It's in a shopping mall,
and it sells fish eggs.

00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:07.869
It's a caviar-vending machine.

00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:11.950
This is the Art-o-mat,
an art-vending machine

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:14.684
that sells small artistic creations
by different artists,

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:17.855
usually on small wood blocks
or matchboxes, in limited edition.

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:19.592
This is Oliver Medvedik.

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:23.112
He is not a vending machine,
but he is one of the founders of Genspace,

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:25.103
a community biolab in Brooklyn, New York,

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:26.898
where anybody can go and take classes

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.076
and learn how to do things
like grow E. coli that glows in the dark

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.852
or learn how to take strawberry DNA.

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:34.927
In fact, I saw Oliver do
one of these strawberry DNA extractions

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.988
about a year ago, and this is what led me
into this bizarre path

00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:39.954
that I'm going to talk to you right now.

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:43.024
Strawberry DNA is really fascinating,
because it's so beautiful.

00:00:43.048 --> 00:00:45.832
I'd never thought about DNA
being a beautiful thing before,

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:47.247
before I saw it in this form.

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:49.573
A lot of people, especially
in the art community,

00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:51.843
don't necessarily engage
in science in this way.

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:53.742
I instantly joined Genspace after this,

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.350
and asked Oliver, "If we can do
this with strawberries,

00:00:56.374 --> 00:00:57.761
can we do this with people?"

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.414
About 10 minutes later,
we were both spitting in vials,

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:02.956
coming up with a protocol
for human DNA extraction.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.483
I started doing this on my own.

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:06.469
This is what my DNA actually looks like.

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:09.044
And I was at a dinner party
with some artist friends,

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.087
and I was telling them about this project,

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:13.829
and they couldn't believe
that you could actually see DNA.

00:01:13.853 --> 00:01:16.685
So I said, all right, let's get out
some supplies right now.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.861
And I started having these bizarre
dinner parties on Friday nights,

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:22.558
where people would come over
and we'd do DNA extractions,

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.226
and I would capture them on video,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.932
because it created
this kind of funny portrait as well.

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:29.445
(Laughter)

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.870
These are people who don't necessarily
regularly engage with science.

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:35.059
You can kind of tell from their reactions.

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:36.882
(Laughter)

00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:38.510
But they became fascinated by it,

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:41.961
and it was really exciting for me
to see them get excited about science.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:44.115
And so I started doing this regularly.

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:45.712
(Laughter)

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:48.015
It's an odd thing to do
with your Friday nights,

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.618
but this is what I started doing.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.859
I started collecting a whole group
of my friends' DNA in small vials

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:54.060
and categorizing them.

00:01:54.084 --> 00:01:55.529
This is what that looked like.

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:58.267
And it started to make me think
about a couple of things.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:00.499
First, this looked a lot
like my Facebook wall.

00:02:00.523 --> 00:02:03.711
So in a way, I created
sort of a genetic social network.

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:04.970
And the second thing was,

00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:07.783
one time a friend came over
and looked at this on my table

00:02:07.807 --> 00:02:10.000
and was like, 
"Uh ... why are they numbered?

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:12.301
Is this person more rare
than the other one?"

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:14.111
And I hadn't even thought about that.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:15.295
They were just numbered

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.930
because that was the order
that I extracted the DNA in.

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:20.064
But that made me think
about collecting toys,

00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:23.303
and what's going on right now
in the toy world with blind box toys,

00:02:23.327 --> 00:02:25.386
and being able to collect these rare toys.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.407
You buy these boxes, but aren't sure
what's going to be inside.

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.438
But when you open them,
you have different rarities of the toys.

00:02:31.462 --> 00:02:33.901
I thought that was interesting;
I thought about this

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:36.834
and the caviar vending machine
and the Art-o-mat all together.

00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:39.816
And for some reason, I was one night
drawing a vending machine,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.175
thinking of doing paintings
of a vending machine.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.979
The vial of my DNA was sitting there,

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.929
and I saw a beautiful collaboration
between the strands of DNA

00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:48.626
and the coils of a vending machine.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.147
So I decided to create an art installation
called the DNA Vending Machine.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.405
Here it is.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:58.506
(Music)

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.588
[DNA Vending Machine
is an art installation

00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:02.814
about our increasing access
to biotechnology.]

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:07.431
(Music)

00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:10.413
[For a reasonable cost,
you can purchase a sample of human DNA

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:12.178
from a traditional vending machine.]

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.234
(Music)

00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:34.765
[Each sample comes packaged

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.985
with a collectible limited edition
portrait of the human specimen.]

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.546
(Music)

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.103
[DNA Vending Machine treats DNA
as a collectible material

00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:48.943
and brings to light legal issues
over the ownership of DNA.]

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:53.289
(Music ends)

00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:54.464
Gabriel Barcia-Colombo:

00:03:54.488 --> 00:03:58.001
The DNA Vending Machine is currently
in a couple of galleries in New York,

00:03:58.025 --> 00:03:59.624
and it's selling out pretty well.

00:03:59.648 --> 00:04:01.636
We're in the first edition of 100 pieces,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.614
hoping to do another edition pretty soon.

00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:05.717
I'd like to get it
into more of a metro hub,

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:07.424
like Grand Central or Penn Station,

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:10.298
next to some of the other
vending machines in that location.

00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:12.703
But really, with this
and a lot of my art projects,

00:04:12.727 --> 00:04:14.559
I want to ask the audience a question:

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:18.405
When biotechnology and DNA sequencing
becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting

00:04:18.429 --> 00:04:22.315
or 3D printing or buying caviar
from a vending machine,

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:25.639
will you submit your sample of DNA
to be part of the vending machine?

00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:27.450
How much will these samples be worth?

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:29.339
Will you buy someone else's sample?

00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:31.724
And what will you be able to do
with that sample?

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:34.270
Thank you.

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:38.873
(Applause)
