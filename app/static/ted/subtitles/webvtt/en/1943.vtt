WEBVTT

00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.872
So my moment of truth

00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:05.936
did not come all at once.

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:09.562
In 2010, I had the chance to be considered

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.889
for promotion from my job

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.961
as director of policy planning

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:16.718
at the U.S. State Department.

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:20.449
This was my moment to lean in,

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.334
to push myself forward

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:26.028
for what are really only a handful

00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:29.045
of the very top foreign policy jobs,

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:32.125
and I had just finished a big, 18-month project

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.698
for Secretary Clinton, successfully,

00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:38.929
and I knew I could handle a bigger job.

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.759
The woman I thought I was

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:44.930
would have said yes.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.957
But I had been commuting for two years

00:00:46.957 --> 00:00:50.100
between Washington and Princeton, New Jersey,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.027
where my husband and my two teenage sons lived,

00:00:54.027 --> 00:00:57.293
and it was not going well.

00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:00.998
I tried on the idea of eking out another two years

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:03.794
in Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:05.929
from their school and my husband from his work

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.510
and asking them to join me.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.549
But deep down, I knew

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.080
that the right decision was to go home,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.996
even if I didn't fully recognize the woman

00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:21.988
who was making that choice.

00:01:21.988 --> 00:01:25.495
That was a decision based on love

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:27.439
and responsibility.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.338
I couldn't keep watching my oldest son

00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:31.763
make bad choices

00:01:31.763 --> 00:01:34.458
without being able to be there for him

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:38.241
when and if he needed me.

00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.755
But the real change came more gradually.

00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:43.514
Over the next year,

00:01:43.514 --> 00:01:46.389
while my family was righting itself,

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:48.053
I started to realize

00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:50.992
that even if I could go back into government,

00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:52.772
I didn't want to.

00:01:52.772 --> 00:01:56.719
I didn't want to miss the last five years

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.551
that my sons were at home.

00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:03.437
I finally allowed myself to accept

00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:06.443
what was really most important to me,

00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:09.852
not what I was conditioned to want

00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:14.550
or maybe what I conditioned myself to want,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.611
and that decision led to a reassessment

00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:22.634
of the feminist narrative that I grew up with

00:02:22.634 --> 00:02:26.290
and have always championed.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.142
I am still completely committed

00:02:30.142 --> 00:02:35.327
to the cause of male-female equality,

00:02:35.327 --> 00:02:40.273
but let's think about what that equality really means,

00:02:40.273 --> 00:02:43.200
and how best to achieve it.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.323
I always accepted the idea

00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:49.248
that the most respected and powerful people

00:02:49.248 --> 00:02:53.753
in our society are men at the top of their careers,

00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:57.928
so that the measure of male-female equality

00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:02.147
ought to be how many women are in those positions:

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:05.066
prime ministers, presidents, CEOs,

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:10.169
directors, managers, Nobel laureates, leaders.

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:14.446
I still think we should do everything we possibly can

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:16.526
to achieve that goal.

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:21.651
But that's only half of real equality,

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:24.999
and I now think we're never going to get there

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:30.281
unless we recognize the other half.

00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.592
I suggest that real equality,

00:03:34.592 --> 00:03:36.863
full equality,

00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:40.078
does not just mean valuing women

00:03:40.078 --> 00:03:42.245
on male terms.

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:46.863
It means creating a much wider range

00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:50.875
of equally respected choices

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:53.926
for women and for men.

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:57.395
And to get there, we have to change our workplaces,

00:03:57.395 --> 00:04:00.309
our policies and our culture.

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.374
In the workplace,

00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:05.677
real equality means valuing family

00:04:05.677 --> 00:04:07.300
just as much as work,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.863
and understanding that the two reinforce each other.

00:04:11.863 --> 00:04:13.766
As a leader and as a manager,

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:16.811
I have always acted on the mantra,

00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.091
if family comes first,

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.938
work does not come second --

00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:24.242
life comes together.

00:04:24.242 --> 00:04:28.407
If you work for me, and you have a family issue,

00:04:28.407 --> 00:04:30.841
I expect you to attend to it,

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:32.486
and I am confident,

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:35.183
and my confidence has always been borne out,

00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:39.174
that the work will get done, and done better.

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.575
Workers who have a reason to get home

00:04:41.575 --> 00:04:44.954
to care for their children or their family members

00:04:44.954 --> 00:04:47.461
are more focused, more efficient,

00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:49.484
more results-focused.

00:04:49.484 --> 00:04:52.613
And breadwinners who are also caregivers

00:04:52.613 --> 00:04:55.220
have a much wider range

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.746
of experiences and contacts.

00:04:57.746 --> 00:05:00.978
Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time

00:05:00.978 --> 00:05:03.579
at school events for his kids

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:05.405
talking to other parents.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.463
He's much more likely to bring in

00:05:07.463 --> 00:05:09.403
new clients for his firm

00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:12.664
than a lawyer who never leaves his office.

00:05:12.664 --> 00:05:14.553
And caregiving itself

00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:18.335
develops patience --

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:20.798
a lot of patience --

00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:26.418
and empathy, creativity, resilience, adaptability.

00:05:26.418 --> 00:05:30.216
Those are all attributes that are ever more important

00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:32.309
in a high-speed, horizontal,

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.758
networked global economy.

00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:39.946
The best companies actually know this.

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.673
The companies that win awards

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:44.925
for workplace flexibility in the United States

00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:48.151
include some of our most successful corporations,

00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:50.422
and a 2008 national study

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:52.475
on the changing workforce

00:05:52.475 --> 00:05:54.089
showed that employees

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.591
in flexible and effective workplaces

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.304
are more engaged with their work,

00:05:59.304 --> 00:06:01.794
they're more satisfied and more loyal,

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.627
they have lower levels of stress

00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:06.026
and higher levels of mental health.

00:06:06.026 --> 00:06:09.736
And a 2012 study of employers

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.589
showed that deep, flexible practices

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.979
actually lowered operating costs

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.444
and increased adaptability

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:20.531
in a global service economy.

00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:23.648
So you may think

00:06:23.648 --> 00:06:27.865
that the privileging of work over family

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:31.812
is only an American problem.

00:06:31.812 --> 00:06:35.350
Sadly, though, the obsession with work

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.510
is no longer a uniquely American disease.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.282
Twenty years ago,

00:06:40.282 --> 00:06:42.278
when my family first started going to Italy,

00:06:42.278 --> 00:06:45.881
we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta.

00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:48.764
Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day.

00:06:48.764 --> 00:06:50.630
It's actually just as much

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.742
about embracing the warmth of a family lunch.

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:56.945
Now, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses

00:06:56.945 --> 00:06:58.658
close for siesta,

00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:02.196
reflecting the advance of global corporations

00:07:02.196 --> 00:07:05.033
and 24-hour competition.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:07.902
So making a place for those we love

00:07:07.902 --> 00:07:11.647
is actually a global imperative.

00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:14.377
In policy terms,

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:17.813
real equality means recognizing

00:07:17.813 --> 00:07:20.771
that the work that women have traditionally done

00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:22.648
is just as important

00:07:22.648 --> 00:07:25.311
as the work that men have traditionally done,

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:28.363
no matter who does it.

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:32.108
Think about it: Breadwinning and caregiving

00:07:32.108 --> 00:07:35.633
are equally necessary for human survival.

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:39.117
At least if we get beyond a barter economy,

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:41.354
somebody has to earn an income

00:07:41.354 --> 00:07:44.308
and someone else has to convert that income

00:07:44.308 --> 00:07:48.092
to care and sustenance for loved ones.

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:50.230
Now most of you, when you hear me

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.955
talk about breadwinning and caregiving,

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:56.396
instinctively translate those categories

00:07:56.396 --> 00:08:00.127
into men's work and women's work.

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:02.963
And we don't typically challenge

00:08:02.963 --> 00:08:06.861
why men's work is advantaged.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.451
But consider a same-sex couple

00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:11.470
like my friends Sarah and Emily.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.338
They're psychiatrists.

00:08:13.338 --> 00:08:15.167
They got married five years ago,

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:18.448
and now they have two-year-old twins.

00:08:18.448 --> 00:08:20.520
They love being mothers,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.088
but they also love their work,

00:08:22.088 --> 00:08:24.298
and they're really good at what they do.

00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:26.319
So how are they going to divide up

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.796
breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities?

00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:30.881
Should one of them stop working

00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:33.573
or reduce hours to be home?

00:08:33.573 --> 00:08:36.252
Or should they both change their practices

00:08:36.252 --> 00:08:39.535
so they can have much more flexible schedules?

00:08:39.535 --> 00:08:41.506
And what criteria should they use

00:08:41.506 --> 00:08:42.800
to make that decision?

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.574
Is it who makes the most money

00:08:44.574 --> 00:08:48.351
or who is most committed to her career?

00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:52.912
Or who has the most flexible boss?

00:08:52.912 --> 00:08:56.237
The same-sex perspective helps us see

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:58.701
that juggling work and family

00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:00.812
are not women's problems,

00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:03.450
they're family problems.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.473
And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones,

00:09:06.473 --> 00:09:08.242
because they have a choice

00:09:08.242 --> 00:09:10.779
about how much they want to work.

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:13.608
Millions of men and women

00:09:13.608 --> 00:09:16.945
have to be both breadwinners and caregivers

00:09:16.945 --> 00:09:20.485
just to earn the income they need,

00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:23.033
and many of those workers are scrambling.

00:09:23.033 --> 00:09:25.917
They're patching together care arrangements

00:09:25.917 --> 00:09:27.090
that are inadequate

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.501
and often actually unsafe.

00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:34.191
If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal,

00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:35.779
then why shouldn't a government

00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:39.595
invest as much in an infrastructure of care

00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:43.454
as the foundation of a healthy society

00:09:43.454 --> 00:09:46.566
as it invests in physical infrastructure

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:50.442
as the backbone of a successful economy?

00:09:50.442 --> 00:09:52.778
The governments that get it --

00:09:52.778 --> 00:09:54.625
no surprises here --

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:56.465
the governments that get it,

00:09:56.465 --> 00:10:01.170
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.100
provide universal child care,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.219
support for caregivers at home,

00:10:06.219 --> 00:10:09.386
school and early childhood education,

00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:11.596
protections for pregnant women,

00:10:11.596 --> 00:10:15.981
and care for the elderly and the disabled.

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:19.662
Those governments invest in that infrastructure

00:10:19.662 --> 00:10:22.991
the same way they invest in roads and bridges

00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:26.126
and tunnels and trains.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.534
Those societies also show you

00:10:28.534 --> 00:10:30.824
that breadwinning and caregiving

00:10:30.824 --> 00:10:33.208
reinforce each other.

00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:39.047
They routinely rank among the top 15 countries

00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:42.380
of the most globally competitive economies,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.032
but at the same time,

00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:48.723
they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index.

00:10:48.723 --> 00:10:52.259
In fact, they rank higher than other governments,

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:54.928
like my own, the U.S., or Switzerland,

00:10:54.928 --> 00:10:57.857
that have higher average levels of income

00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:03.620
but lower rankings on work-life balance.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.296
So changing our workplaces

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:09.592
and building infrastructures of care

00:11:09.592 --> 00:11:11.067
would make a big difference,

00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:15.551
but we're not going to get equally valued choices

00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:18.056
unless we change our culture,

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:21.197
and the kind of cultural change required

00:11:21.197 --> 00:11:23.952
means re-socializing men.

00:11:23.952 --> 00:11:27.626
(Applause)

00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:29.361
Increasingly in developed countries,

00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:32.443
women are socialized to believe that our place

00:11:32.443 --> 00:11:36.103
is no longer only in the home,

00:11:36.103 --> 00:11:40.999
but men are actually still where they always were.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:44.397
Men are still socialized to believe

00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:46.652
that they have to be breadwinners,

00:11:46.652 --> 00:11:49.527
that to derive their self-worth

00:11:49.527 --> 00:11:52.406
from how high they can climb over other men

00:11:52.406 --> 00:11:54.751
on a career ladder.

00:11:54.751 --> 00:11:57.534
The feminist revolution still has a long way to go.

00:11:57.534 --> 00:11:59.436
It's certainly not complete.

00:11:59.436 --> 00:12:01.092
But 60 years after

00:12:01.092 --> 00:12:03.402
"The Feminine
Mystique" was published,

00:12:03.402 --> 00:12:05.703
many women actually have

00:12:05.703 --> 00:12:08.681
more choices than men do.

00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:11.409
We can decide to be a breadwinner,

00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:15.556
a caregiver, or any combination of the two.

00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:18.082
When a man, on the other hand,

00:12:18.082 --> 00:12:20.971
decides to be a caregiver,

00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:24.275
he puts his manhood on the line.

00:12:24.275 --> 00:12:27.495
His friends may praise his decision,

00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:31.367
but underneath, they're scratching their heads.

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:34.468
Isn't the measure of a man

00:12:34.468 --> 00:12:37.399
his willingness to compete with other men

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:39.779
for power and prestige?

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:43.875
And as many women hold that view as men do.

00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:46.841
We know that lots of women

00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:50.160
still judge the attractiveness of a man

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.885
based in large part on how successful he is

00:12:52.885 --> 00:12:54.382
in his career.

00:12:54.382 --> 00:12:56.733
A woman can drop out of the work force

00:12:56.733 --> 00:12:58.893
and still be an attractive partner.

00:12:58.893 --> 00:13:03.432
For a man, that's a risky proposition.

00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:05.673
So as parents and partners,

00:13:05.673 --> 00:13:08.860
we should be socializing our sons

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.311
and our husbands

00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:14.635
to be whatever they want to be,

00:13:14.635 --> 00:13:18.254
either caregivers or breadwinners.

00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:21.610
We should be socializing them to make caregiving

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.597
cool for guys.

00:13:23.597 --> 00:13:27.362
(Applause)

00:13:27.362 --> 00:13:33.674
I can almost hear lots of you thinking, "No way."

00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:38.321
But in fact, the change is 
actually already happening.

00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:40.278
At least in the United States,

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.502
lots of men take pride in cooking,

00:13:42.502 --> 00:13:45.818
and frankly obsess over stoves.

00:13:45.818 --> 00:13:48.805
They are in the birthing rooms.

00:13:48.805 --> 00:13:51.449
They take paternity leave when they can.

00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:53.911
They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler

00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:56.553
just as well as their wives can,

00:13:56.553 --> 00:13:58.302
and they are increasingly

00:13:58.302 --> 00:14:00.869
doing much more of the housework.

00:14:00.869 --> 00:14:02.957
Indeed, there are male college students now

00:14:02.957 --> 00:14:04.484
who are starting to say,

00:14:04.484 --> 00:14:06.360
"I want to be a stay-at-home dad."

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.611
That was completely unthinkable

00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:11.478
50 or even 30 years ago.

00:14:11.478 --> 00:14:14.369
And in Norway, where men have

00:14:14.369 --> 00:14:17.158
an automatic three month's paternity leave,

00:14:17.158 --> 00:14:20.495
but they lose it if they decide not to take it,

00:14:20.495 --> 00:14:22.420
a high government official told me

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.652
that companies are starting to look

00:14:24.652 --> 00:14:26.737
at prospective male employees

00:14:26.737 --> 00:14:30.715
and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact

00:14:30.715 --> 00:14:33.111
take their leave when they had kids.

00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:35.940
That means that it's starting to seem

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.142
like a character defect

00:14:38.142 --> 00:14:42.362
not to want to be a fully engaged father.

00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:50.943
So I was raised

00:14:50.943 --> 00:14:54.592
to believe that championing women's rights

00:14:54.592 --> 00:14:56.711
meant doing everything we could

00:14:56.711 --> 00:14:58.485
to get women to the top.

00:14:58.485 --> 00:15:01.204
And I still hope that I live long enough

00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:04.467
to see men and women equally represented

00:15:04.467 --> 00:15:07.514
at all levels of the work force.

00:15:07.514 --> 00:15:11.613
But I've come to believe that we have to value family

00:15:11.613 --> 00:15:14.445
every bit as much as we value work,

00:15:14.445 --> 00:15:16.957
and that we should entertain the idea

00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:20.506
that doing right by those we love

00:15:20.506 --> 00:15:24.422
will make all of us better at everything we do.

00:15:24.422 --> 00:15:26.490
Thirty years ago, Carol Gilligan,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.447
a wonderful psychologist, studied adolescent girls

00:15:29.447 --> 00:15:32.504
and identified an ethic of care,

00:15:32.504 --> 00:15:35.659
an element of human nature every bit as important

00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:37.646
as the ethic of justice.

00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:40.951
It turns out that "you don't care"

00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:43.872
is just as much a part of who we are

00:15:43.872 --> 00:15:46.152
as "that's not fair."

00:15:46.152 --> 00:15:47.952
Bill Gates agrees.

00:15:47.952 --> 00:15:51.123
He argues that the two great forces of human nature

00:15:51.123 --> 00:15:55.330
are self-interest and caring for others.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.972
Let's bring them both together.

00:15:57.972 --> 00:16:00.631
Let's make the feminist revolution

00:16:00.631 --> 00:16:03.363
a humanist revolution.

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:05.107
As whole human beings,

00:16:05.107 --> 00:16:08.951
we will be better caregivers and breadwinners.

00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:11.059
You may think that can't happen,

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:12.759
but I grew up in a society

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:15.105
where my mother put out small vases

00:16:15.105 --> 00:16:17.767
of cigarettes for dinner parties,

00:16:17.767 --> 00:16:21.960
where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.490
and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual.

00:16:28.602 --> 00:16:33.041
Today, not so much.

00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:36.681
The revolution for human equality

00:16:36.681 --> 00:16:38.471
can happen.

00:16:38.471 --> 00:16:40.717
It is happening.

00:16:40.717 --> 00:16:42.999
It will happen.

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:47.717
How far and how fast is up to us.

00:16:47.717 --> 00:16:49.860
Thank you.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.860
(Applause)
