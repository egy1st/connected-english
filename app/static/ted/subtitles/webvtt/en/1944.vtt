WEBVTT

00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:03.101
Let me start by asking you a
question, just with a show of hands:

00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:05.236
Who has an iPhone?

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:08.326
Who has an Android phone?

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:10.394
Who has a Blackberry?

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:12.768
Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry?

00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:15.351
(Laughter)

00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:17.439
And let me guess, how many of you,

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.447
when you arrived here, like me, went and bought

00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:23.237
a pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah?

00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:24.637
I'll bet you didn't even know

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:26.615
you're using African technology.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.898
Pay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea,

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:31.968
pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:34.371
a good 15 years ago,

00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:36.916
and now, like franchising,

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:39.199
pay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.776
of economic activity in the world.

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:43.668
So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa,

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.738
which I think is the purest form,

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:47.746
innovation out of necessity.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.208
But first, I'm going to ask you some other questions.

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:51.843
You don't have to put your hands up.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.475
These are rhetorical.

00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:56.745
Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:58.746
the alternating current that powers the lights

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.277
in this building or the city that we're in?

00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:03.965
Why did Henry Ford have to
invent the production line

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:06.582
to produce these Fords that came in anything

00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:08.043
as long as they were black?

00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:12.822
And why did Eric Merrifield
have to invent the dolos?

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.420
Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.241
and in the background, you can see Robben Island.

00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:22.290
This is a small dolos, and Eric Merrifield

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.053
is the most famous inventor you've never heard of.

00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:29.273
In 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor

00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:31.645
in a small South African town called East London,

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:34.688
and while he was watching his kids playing

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:37.234
with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse,

00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:38.856
he had the idea for this.

00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:41.073
It's a bit like a huge jumping jack,

00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:44.515
and they have used this in every harbor in the world

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:46.135
as a breakwater.

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:49.324
The global shipping economy would not be possible

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:52.224
without African technology like this.

00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:55.973
So whenever you talk about Africa,

00:01:55.973 --> 00:01:58.900
you have to put up this picture
of the world from space,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.727
and people go, "Look, it's the Dark Continent."

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:04.386
Actually, it isn't.

00:02:04.386 --> 00:02:06.415
What it is is a map of innovation.

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:09.900
And it's really easy to see
where innovation's going on.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.960
All the places with lots of electricity, it isn't.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.987
(Laughter)

00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:21.520
(Applause)

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.970
And the reason it isn't is because everybody's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.155
watching television or playing Angry Birds.

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:30.624
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:33.828
So where it's happening is in Africa.

00:02:33.828 --> 00:02:35.646
Now, this is real innovation,

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:38.801
not the way people have expropriated the word

00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:40.994
to talk about launching new products.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.751
This is real innovation, and I
define it as problem-solving.

00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:47.315
People are solving real problems in Africa.

00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:49.581
Why? Because we have to.

00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:51.314
Because we have real problems.

00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:53.910
And when we solve real problems for people,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.307
we solve them for the rest of the world

00:02:56.307 --> 00:02:58.411
at the same time.

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:01.746
So in California, everybody's really excited

00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:04.752
about a little square of plastic
that you plug into a phone

00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:06.443
and you can swipe your credit card,

00:03:06.443 --> 00:03:09.322
and people say, "We've liberated the credit card

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.996
from the point of sale terminal."

00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:15.410
Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card?

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.758
In Africa, we've been doing that for years,

00:03:18.758 --> 00:03:20.760
and we've been doing it on phones like this.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.294
This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela,

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:25.243
about an hour south of Nairobi,

00:03:25.243 --> 00:03:28.123
and the thing that's so remarkable
about the payment system

00:03:28.123 --> 00:03:30.325
that's been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa

00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:33.069
is that it works on phones like this.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.835
It works on every single phone possible,

00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:38.653
because it uses SMS.

00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:41.551
You can pay bills with it, 
you can buy your groceries,

00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:43.549
you can pay your kids' school fees,

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.582
and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials.

00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:49.063
(Laughter)

00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:52.055
Something like 25 million dollars a day

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:54.226
is transacted through M-Pesa.

00:03:54.226 --> 00:03:56.537
Forty percent of Kenya's GDP

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:59.738
moves through M-Pesa using phones like this.

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.828
And you think this is just a feature phone.

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:04.900
Actually it's the smartphone of Africa.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.359
It's also a radio, and it's also a torch,

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.771
and more than anything else,

00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:11.539
it has really superb battery life.

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:13.641
Why? Because that's what we need.

00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:17.054
We have really severe energy problems in Africa.

00:04:17.054 --> 00:04:18.599
By the way, you can update Facebook

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.272
and send Gmail from a phone like this.

00:04:22.272 --> 00:04:24.852
So we have found a way to use

00:04:24.852 --> 00:04:27.745
the available technology to send money via M-Pesa,

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:29.766
which is a bit like a check system

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:32.008
for the mobile age.

00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:34.630
I come from Johannesburg, which is a mining town.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.094
It's built on gold.

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:38.383
This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier.

00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:43.748
And the difference today is that 
the gold of today is mobile.

00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:47.991
If you think about the railroad system
in North America and how that worked,

00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:49.873
first came the infrastructure,

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:53.153
then came the industry around it, the brothels --

00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:55.145
it's a bit like the Internet today, right? â€”

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.613
and everything else that worked with it:

00:04:57.613 --> 00:04:59.680
bars, saloons, etc.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.898
The gold of today is mobile,

00:05:01.898 --> 00:05:04.919
and mobile is the enabler
that makes all of this possible.

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.945
So what are some of the
things that you can do with it?

00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:10.531
Well, this is by a guy called
Bright Simons from Ghana,

00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:12.945
and what you do is you take medication,

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:16.183
something that some people might
spend their entire month's salary on,

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.948
and you scratch off the code,

00:05:18.948 --> 00:05:20.890
and you send that to an SMS number,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.885
and it tells you if that is legitimate

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:24.675
or if it's expired.

00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:28.244
Really simple, really effective, really life-saving.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.433
In Kenya, there's a service called iCow,

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.372
which just sends you really important information

00:05:33.372 --> 00:05:35.250
about how to look after your dairy.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.791
The dairy business in Kenya

00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:39.597
is a $463 million business,

00:05:39.597 --> 00:05:42.214
and the difference between a subsistence farmer

00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:43.911
and an abundance farmer

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:46.285
is only a couple of liters of milk a day.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:49.305
And if you can do that,
you can rise out of poverty.

00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:53.276
Really simple, using a basic phone.

00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:56.061
If you don't have electricity, no problem!

00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:58.022
We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts

00:05:58.022 --> 00:06:00.506
using a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did.

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:02.586
There's another great African that you've heard

00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:06.318
that's busy disrupting the
automobile industry in the world.

00:06:06.318 --> 00:06:09.077
He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.848
and the electricity industry in North America,

00:06:11.848 --> 00:06:14.931
and if he's lucky, he'll get us to Mars,

00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:16.796
hopefully in my lifetime.

00:06:16.796 --> 00:06:19.879
He comes from Pretoria, the capital of [South Africa],

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.815
about 50 kilometers from where I live.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:26.397
So back to Joburg, which is sometimes called Egoli,

00:06:26.397 --> 00:06:28.546
which means City of Gold.

00:06:28.546 --> 00:06:32.557
And not only is mobile the gold of today,

00:06:32.557 --> 00:06:34.927
I don't believe that the gold is under the ground.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.659
I believe we are the gold.

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.003
Like you've heard the other economists say,

00:06:39.003 --> 00:06:41.035
we are at the point where China was

00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:43.468
when its boom years began,

00:06:43.468 --> 00:06:44.838
and that's where we're going.

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:49.826
So, you hear the West talk
about innovation at the edge.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.735
Well, of course it's happening at the edge,

00:06:51.735 --> 00:06:54.732
because in the middle,
everybody's updating Facebook,

00:06:54.732 --> 00:06:56.731
or worse still, they're trying to understand

00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:58.858
Facebook's privacy settings.

00:06:58.858 --> 00:07:00.762
(Laughter)

00:07:00.762 --> 00:07:03.308
This is not that catchy catchphrase.

00:07:03.308 --> 00:07:07.210
This is innovation over the edge.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.176
So, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent,

00:07:12.176 --> 00:07:14.850
but actually it's mobile-only,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.495
so while everybody else is doing all of those things,

00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:19.835
we're solving the world's problems.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:22.158
So there's only one thing left to say.

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:24.638
["You're welcome"] (Laughter)

00:07:24.638 --> 00:07:31.161
(Applause)
