00:00:00.527 --> 00:00:03.372
Anyone in the room thought about sex today?

00:00:03.372 --> 00:00:04.532
(Laughter)

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:05.737
Yeah, you did.

00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:08.203
Thank you for putting your hand up over there.

00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:09.923
Well, I'm here to provide you with

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:11.618
some biological validation

00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:13.048
for your sordid daydreams.

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:14.442
I'm here to tell you a few things

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:17.948
that you might not have known about wild sex.

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:19.796
Now, when humans think about sex,

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:21.526
male and female forms

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:23.197
are generally what come to mind,

00:00:23.197 --> 00:00:25.650
but for many millions of years,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.271
such specific categories didn't even exist.

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:30.874
Sex was a mere fusion of bodies

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:32.484
or a trickle of DNA

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:35.026
shared between two or more beings.

00:00:35.026 --> 00:00:37.351
It wasn't until about 500 million years ago

00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:40.715
that we start to see structures akin to a penis

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.373
or a thing that gives DNA out,

00:00:43.373 --> 00:00:46.527
and a vagina, something that receives it.

00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:48.852
Now invariably, you're probably thinking about

00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:51.272
what belongs to our own species,

00:00:51.272 --> 00:00:53.170
these very familiar structures,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.456
but the diversity that we see in sexual structures

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:57.444
in the animal kingdom that has evolved

00:00:57.444 --> 00:01:00.092
in response to the multitude of factors

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:01.753
surrounding reproduction

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:04.147
is pretty mind-blowing.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:07.788
Penile diversity is especially profuse.

00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:09.933
So this is a paper nautilus.

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.843
It's a close relative of squid and octopus,

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:15.965
and males have a hectocotylus.

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:17.715
Just what is a hectocotylus?

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:21.894
A detachable, swimming penis.

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:24.303
It leaves the [body of the male],

00:01:24.303 --> 00:01:27.503
finds the female through
pheromonal cues in the water,

00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:29.414
attaches itself to her body

00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:30.722
and deposits the sperm.

00:01:30.722 --> 00:01:33.246
For many decades, biologists actually felt

00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:37.691
that the hectocotylus was a
separate organism altogether.

00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:40.679
Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.627
And the tapir has a prehensile penis.

00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:46.669
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:49.095
much akin to what we have with our hands.

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:50.767
And it uses this dexterity

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.983
to bypass the vagina altogether

00:01:52.983 --> 00:01:56.354
and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,

00:01:56.354 --> 00:01:59.908
not to mention it's a pretty good size.

00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:01.837
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom,

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:03.532
however, is not that of the tapir.

00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:05.864
The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio

00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:07.558
in the animal kingdom actually belongs

00:02:07.558 --> 00:02:09.809
to the meager beach barnacle,

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.001
and this video is actually showing you

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.085
what the human penis would look like

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:17.546
if it were the same size as that of a barnacle.

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:20.732
(Laughter)

00:02:20.732 --> 00:02:22.995
Mm-hm. (Laughter)

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:25.793
So with all of this diversity in structure,

00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:27.950
one might think, then, that penises

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.921
are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:32.998
for the purposes of successful reproduction.

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:35.543
Simply insert part A into slot B,

00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:37.618
and we should all be good to go.

00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:39.947
But of course, that doesn't exactly happen,

00:02:39.947 --> 00:02:42.875
and that's because we can't
just take form into account.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.157
We have to think about function as well,

00:02:45.157 --> 00:02:46.947
and when it comes to sex,

00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:49.473
function relates to the contributions made

00:02:49.473 --> 00:02:52.272
by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.606
And these contributions are far from equal.

00:02:55.606 --> 00:02:57.992
Eggs are very expensive to make,

00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:00.943
so it makes sense for females to be very choosy

00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:03.380
about who she shares them with.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.193
Sperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,

00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:09.045
so it makes more sense for males

00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:11.195
to have a more-sex-is-better strategy

00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:12.607
when it comes to siring members

00:03:12.607 --> 00:03:14.453
of future generations.

00:03:14.453 --> 00:03:16.165
So how do animals cope

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:19.050
with these very incongruent
needs between the sexes?

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.299
I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.738
or if she has the ability to store sperm

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:26.415
and she simply has enough,

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.488
then it makes more sense for her to spend her time

00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:31.166
doing other biologically relevant things:

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:34.023
avoiding predators, taking care of offspring,

00:03:34.023 --> 00:03:36.193
gathering and ingesting food.

00:03:36.193 --> 00:03:38.506
This is, of course, bad news for any male

00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:41.057
who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,

00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:44.162
and this sets the scene for
some pretty drastic strategies

00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:47.468
for successful fertilization.

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:49.475
This is bedbug sex,

00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:53.749
and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.543
Males have a spiked, barbed penis

00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:59.147
that they literally stab into the female,

00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:02.008
and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.143
They stab it anywhere in her body,

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.940
and the sperm simply migrates

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.244
through her hemolymph to her ovaries.

00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:11.388
If a female gets too many stab wounds,

00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:13.734
or if a stab wound happens to become infected,

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:16.113
she can actually die from it.

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.884
Now if you've ever been out for a nice,

00:04:17.884 --> 00:04:19.775
peaceful walk by the lake

00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:22.517
and happened to see some ducks having sex,

00:04:22.517 --> 00:04:24.212
you've undoubtedly been alarmed,

00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:26.723
because it looks like gang rape.

00:04:26.723 --> 00:04:29.384
And quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.

00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:31.604
A group of males will grab a female,

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.773
hold her down,

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:37.203
and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis

00:04:37.203 --> 00:04:40.287
into her corkscrew-shaped vagina

00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:43.193
over and over and over again.

00:04:43.193 --> 00:04:46.982
From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.

00:04:46.982 --> 00:04:49.117
Now the female actually
gets the last laugh, though,

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:51.944
because she can actually manipulate her posture

00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:55.049
so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:58.311
better access to her ovaries.

00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.421
Now, I like to share stories
like this with my audiences

00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:01.877
because, yeah, we humans,

00:05:01.877 --> 00:05:05.022
we tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,

00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:07.263
there's romance, and there's orgasm.

00:05:07.263 --> 00:05:08.945
But orgasm didn't actually evolve

00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:11.031
until about 65 million years ago

00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:12.798
with the advent of mammals.

00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:15.662
But some animals had it going
on quite a bit before that.

00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:17.416
There are some more primitive ways

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:19.817
of pleasing one's partner.

00:05:19.817 --> 00:05:21.873
Earwig males have either

00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:23.631
really large penile appendages

00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:25.032
or really small ones.

00:05:25.032 --> 00:05:27.853
It's a very simple genetically inherited trait

00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:29.839
and the males are not otherwise any different.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.801
Those that have long penile appendages

00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:33.569
are not bigger or stronger

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.073
or otherwise any different at all.

00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:37.614
So going back to our biological minds, then,

00:05:37.614 --> 00:05:39.731
we might think that females should choose

00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:42.712
to have sex with the guys that
have the shorter appendages,

00:05:42.712 --> 00:05:45.277
because she can use her time for other things:

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:46.953
avoiding predators, taking care of young,

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:48.801
finding and ingesting food.

00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:51.617
But biologists have repeatedly observed

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.585
that females choose to have sex

00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:57.714
with the males that have the long appendages.

00:05:57.714 --> 00:05:59.677
Why do they do this?

00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:02.076
Well, according to the biological literature,

00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:04.903
"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males

00:06:04.903 --> 00:06:07.523
may elicit more favorable female responses

00:06:07.523 --> 00:06:10.600
through superior mechanical
or stimulatory interaction

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.158
with the female reproductive tract."

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:16.549
Mm-hm.

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:18.486
These are Mexican guppies,

00:06:18.486 --> 00:06:20.617
and what you see on their upper maxilla

00:06:20.617 --> 00:06:23.019
is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:24.864
and these filaments basically form

00:06:24.864 --> 00:06:27.462
a fish mustache, if you will.

00:06:27.462 --> 00:06:29.804
Now males have been observed to prod

00:06:29.804 --> 00:06:31.468
the female's genital opening

00:06:31.468 --> 00:06:33.415
prior to copulating with her,

00:06:33.415 --> 00:06:36.924
and in what I have lovingly termed
the Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,

00:06:36.924 --> 00:06:40.936
females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:44.901
with males that have these fish mustaches.

00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:48.198
A little guppy porn for you right there.

00:06:48.198 --> 00:06:50.954
So we've seen very different strategies

00:06:50.954 --> 00:06:53.192
that males are using when it comes to

00:06:53.192 --> 00:06:54.788
winning a female partner.

00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:59.776
We've seen a coercion strategy in which
sexual structures are used in a forceful way

00:06:59.776 --> 00:07:01.549
to basically make a female have sex.

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:03.606
We've also seen a titillation strategy

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:05.543
where males are actually

00:07:05.543 --> 00:07:07.691
pleasing their female partners into choosing them

00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:09.410
as a sex partner.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.855
Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,

00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:14.271
it's the coercion strategy that we see

00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:16.010
time and time again.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.357
It's very common in many phyla,

00:07:18.357 --> 00:07:20.990
from invertebrates to avian species,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.536
mammals, and, of course, even in primates.

00:07:23.536 --> 00:07:27.073
Now interestingly, there 
are a few mammalian species

00:07:27.073 --> 00:07:30.305
in which females have evolved specialized genitalia

00:07:30.305 --> 00:07:34.974
that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.

00:07:34.974 --> 00:07:37.342
Female elephants and female hyenas

00:07:37.342 --> 00:07:39.716
have a penile clitoris,

00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:43.523
or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,

00:07:43.523 --> 00:07:45.082
much like a penis,

00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:47.466
and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:50.633
by merely looking at their external morphology.

00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:54.225
So before a male can insert
his penis into a female's vagina,

00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:56.080
she has to take this penile clitoris

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.643
and basically inside-out it in her own body.

00:07:59.643 --> 00:08:02.580
I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.112
It's simply not going to happen

00:08:04.112 --> 00:08:07.434
unless the female is on board with the action.

00:08:07.434 --> 00:08:09.247
Now, even more interesting is the fact

00:08:09.247 --> 00:08:11.256
that elephant and hyena societies

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:13.685
are entirely matriarchal:

00:08:13.685 --> 00:08:16.187
they're run by females, groups of females,

00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:18.433
sisters, aunts and offspring,

00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:21.636
and when young males attain sexual maturity,

00:08:21.636 --> 00:08:23.513
they're turfed out of the group.

00:08:23.513 --> 00:08:25.596
In hyena societies, adult males

00:08:25.596 --> 00:08:28.858
are actually the lowest on the social scale.

00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:31.291
They can take part in a kill only after

00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:34.021
everybody else, including the offspring.

00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:36.339
So it seems that when you take the penis power

00:08:36.339 --> 00:08:38.177
away from a male,

00:08:38.177 --> 00:08:42.236
you take away all the social power he has.

00:08:42.236 --> 00:08:44.878
So what are my take-home
messages from my talk today?

00:08:44.878 --> 00:08:47.559
Well, sex is just so much more

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.158
than insert part A into slot B

00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:53.300
and hope that the offspring run around everywhere.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.957
The sexual strategies and reproductive structures

00:08:55.957 --> 00:08:58.980
that we see in the animal kingdom basically

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.908
dictate how males and females
will react to each other,

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:05.654
which then dictates how populations and societies

00:09:05.654 --> 00:09:07.269
form and evolve.

00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:09.753
So it may not be surprising to any of you

00:09:09.753 --> 00:09:11.561
that animals, including ourselves,

00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:15.171
spend a good amount of time thinking about sex,

00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:18.347
but what might surprise you is the extent to which

00:09:18.347 --> 00:09:22.418
so many other aspects of their lives and our lives

00:09:22.418 --> 00:09:24.240
are influenced by it.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.203
So thank you, and happy daydreaming.

00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:30.282
