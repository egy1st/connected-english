00:00:00.815 --> 00:00:02.450
I'd like to talk today

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.922
about how we can change our brains

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.515
and our society.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:09.690
Meet Joe.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.408
Joe's 32 years old and a murderer.

00:00:13.408 --> 00:00:16.150
I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.970
at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.971
I'd like you to imagine this place.

00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:25.069
It looks and feels like it sounds:

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.451
Wormwood Scrubs.

00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.675
Built at the end of the Victorian Era

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.187
by the inmates themselves,

00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:34.387
it is where England's most
dangerous prisoners are kept.

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:36.593
These individuals have committed acts

00:00:36.593 --> 00:00:38.763
of unspeakable evil.

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:42.474
And I was there to study their brains.

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:44.226
I was part of a team of researchers

00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:45.903
from University College London,

00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:48.658
on a grant from the U.K. department of health.

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:50.706
My task was to study a group of inmates

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:53.450
who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.175
That meant they were the most

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:56.888
callous and the most aggressive

00:00:56.888 --> 00:01:00.012
of the entire prison population.

00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:03.589
What lay at the root of their behavior?

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.915
Was there a neurological cause for their condition?

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:10.758
And if there was a neurological cause,

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:13.813
could we find a cure?

00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:17.758
So I'd like to speak about change, and 
especially about emotional change.

00:01:17.758 --> 00:01:19.738
Growing up, I was always intrigued

00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:22.802
by how people change.

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:25.325
My mother, a clinical psychotherapist,

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:27.965
would occasionally see patients at home

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:29.385
in the evening.

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:30.919
She would shut the door to the living room,

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.924
and I imagined

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:35.436
magical things happened in that room.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:37.117
At the age of five or six

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:39.559
I would creep up in my pajamas

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:42.368
and sit outside with my ear glued to the door.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.815
On more than one occasion, I fell asleep

00:01:43.815 --> 00:01:45.275
and they had to push me out of the way

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:47.436
at the end of the session.

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:50.335
And I suppose that's how I found myself

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:52.410
walking into the secure interview room

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.419
on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs.

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:58.755
Joe sat across a steel table

00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:02.981
and greeted me with this blank expression.

00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:05.859
The prison warden, looking equally indifferent,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.506
said, "Any trouble, just press the red buzzer,

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:10.945
and we'll be around as soon as we can."

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:13.903
(Laughter)

00:02:13.903 --> 00:02:15.673
I sat down.

00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:18.650
The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.744
I looked up at the red buzzer

00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:22.843
far behind Joe on the opposite wall.

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:25.489
(Laughter)

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.251
I looked at Joe.

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.328
Perhaps detecting my concern,

00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:30.684
he leaned forward, and said,

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:32.911
as reassuringly as he could,

00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:34.291
"Ah, don't worry about the buzzer,

00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:36.544
it doesn't work anyway."

00:02:36.544 --> 00:02:41.991
(Laughter)

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:45.361
Over the subsequent months,

00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:49.446
we tested Joe and his fellow inmates,

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.497
looking specifically at their ability

00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:56.481
to categorize different images of emotion.

00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:58.267
And we looked at their physical response

00:02:58.267 --> 00:03:00.009
to those emotions.

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:01.590
So, for example, when most of us look

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.515
at a picture like this of somebody looking sad,

00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:08.066
we instantly have a slight,

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.000
measurable physical response:

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.298
increased heart rate, sweating of the skin.

00:03:13.298 --> 00:03:15.082
Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able

00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:17.096
to describe the pictures accurately,

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:20.829
they failed to show the emotions required.

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.382
They failed to show a physical response.

00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:26.433
It was as though they knew the words

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:29.826
but not the music of empathy.

00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:31.610
So we wanted to look closer at this

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.059
to use MRI to image their brains.

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.166
That turned out to be not such an easy task.

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:39.995
Imagine transporting a collection

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:42.690
of clinical psychopaths across central London

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.829
in shackles and handcuffs

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.955
in rush hour,

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:50.129
and in order to place each
of them in an MRI scanner,

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.110
you have to remove all metal objects,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.444
including shackles and handcuffs,

00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:57.799
and, as I learned, all body piercings.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.036
After some time, however,
we had a tentative answer.

00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:04.854
These individuals were not just the victims

00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:06.906
of a troubled childhood.

00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:09.427
There was something else.

00:04:09.427 --> 00:04:13.047
People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area

00:04:13.047 --> 00:04:15.108
called the amygdala.

00:04:15.108 --> 00:04:17.132
The amygdala is an almond-shaped organ

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:20.455
deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain.

00:04:20.455 --> 00:04:24.940
It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.846
Normally, the more empathic a person is,

00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:30.891
the larger and more active their amygdala is.

00:04:30.891 --> 00:04:32.371
Our population of inmates

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:33.698
had a deficient amygdala,

00:04:33.698 --> 00:04:35.993
which likely led to their lack of empathy

00:04:35.993 --> 00:04:38.927
and to their immoral behavior.

00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:42.069
So let's take a step back.

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.692
Normally, acquiring moral behavior

00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:47.082
is simply part of growing up,

00:04:47.082 --> 00:04:49.283
like learning to speak.

00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:52.574
At the age of six months, virtually every one of us

00:04:52.574 --> 00:04:56.531
is able to differentiate between
animate and inanimate objects.

00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:59.005
At the age of 12 months,

00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:02.229
most children are able to imitate

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.114
the purposeful actions of others.

00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:06.649
So for example, your mother raises her hands

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:09.388
to stretch, and you imitate her behavior.

00:05:09.388 --> 00:05:12.589
At first, this isn't perfect.

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:14.536
I remember my cousin Sasha,

00:05:14.536 --> 00:05:16.699
two years old at the time,

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.359
looking through a picture book

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:21.542
and licking one finger and flicking
the page with the other hand,

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:23.647
licking one finger and flicking
the page with the other hand.

00:05:23.647 --> 00:05:25.961
(Laughter)

00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:29.887
Bit by bit, we build the foundations 
of the social brain

00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:34.519
so that by the time we're three, four years old,

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:35.811
most children, not all,

00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:37.584
have acquired the ability to understand

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:39.187
the intentions of others,

00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:42.513
another prerequisite for empathy.

00:05:42.513 --> 00:05:45.125
The fact that this developmental progression

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:46.627
is universal,

00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:48.603
irrespective of where you live in the world

00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:51.229
or which culture you inhabit,

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.442
strongly suggests that the foundations

00:05:53.442 --> 00:05:56.566
of moral behavior are inborn.

00:05:56.566 --> 00:05:59.043
If you doubt this,

00:05:59.043 --> 00:06:02.819
try, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.896
to a four-year-old.

00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:06.684
You will find that the mind of a four-year old

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:08.188
is not naÃ¯ve in the slightest.

00:06:08.188 --> 00:06:11.213
It is more akin to a Swiss army knife

00:06:11.213 --> 00:06:13.244
with fixed mental modules

00:06:13.244 --> 00:06:15.718
finely honed during development

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:18.835
and a sharp sense of fairness.

00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:21.493
The early years are crucial.

00:06:21.493 --> 00:06:23.737
There seems to be a window of opportunity,

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:26.203
after which mastering moral questions

00:06:26.203 --> 00:06:27.685
becomes more difficult,

00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:31.819
like adults learning a foreign language.

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.853
That's not to say it's impossible.

00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:36.962
A recent, wonderful study from Stanford University

00:06:36.962 --> 00:06:39.203
showed that people who have played

00:06:39.203 --> 00:06:41.612
a virtual reality game in which they took on

00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:44.073
the role of a good and helpful superhero

00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:46.189
actually became more caring and helpful

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:48.692
towards others afterwards.

00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:50.901
Now I'm not suggesting

00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:53.956
we endow criminals with superpowers,

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:57.369
but I am suggesting that we need to find ways

00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:59.247
to get Joe and people like him

00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:01.892
to change their brains and their behavior,

00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:03.667
for their benefit

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:06.802
and for the benefit of the rest of us.

00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:10.337
So can brains change?

00:07:10.337 --> 00:07:12.921
For over 100 years,

00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:16.035
neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:19.855
held the view that after initial
development in childhood,

00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:22.279
no new brain cells could grow

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.580
in the adult human brain.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.067
The brain could only change

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:27.049
within certain set limits.

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:29.147
That was the dogma.

00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:31.386
But then, in the 1990s,

00:07:31.386 --> 00:07:33.082
studies starting showing,

00:07:33.082 --> 00:07:35.819
following the lead of Elizabeth
Gould at Princeton and others,

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:39.154
studies started showing the
evidence of neurogenesis,

00:07:39.154 --> 00:07:41.212
the birth of new brain cells

00:07:41.212 --> 00:07:44.281
in the adult mammalian brain,

00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:45.865
first in the olfactory bulb,

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:47.946
which is responsible for our sense of smell,

00:07:47.946 --> 00:07:49.985
then in the hippocampus

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:52.029
involving short-term memory,

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:55.312
and finally in the amygdala itself.

00:07:55.312 --> 00:07:57.088
In order to understand

00:07:57.088 --> 00:07:59.047
how this process works,

00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:01.936
I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford

00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:05.198
specializing in learning and development.

00:08:05.198 --> 00:08:08.968
Instead of psychopaths, I studied mice,

00:08:08.968 --> 00:08:11.309
because the same pattern of brain responses

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:15.039
appears across many different
species of social animals.

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:19.621
So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage,

00:08:19.621 --> 00:08:22.309
a shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool,

00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:23.876
alone and without much stimulation,

00:08:23.876 --> 00:08:25.487
not only does it not thrive,

00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:27.244
but it will often develop strange,

00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:28.818
repetitive behaviors.

00:08:28.818 --> 00:08:31.437
This naturally sociable animal

00:08:31.437 --> 00:08:33.880
will lose its ability to bond with other mice,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.075
even becoming aggressive when introduced to them.

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:40.137
However, mice reared in what we called

00:08:40.137 --> 00:08:41.643
an enriched environment,

00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:43.854
a large habitation with other mice

00:08:43.854 --> 00:08:47.284
with wheels and ladders and areas to explore,

00:08:47.284 --> 00:08:48.869
demonstrate neurogenesis,

00:08:48.869 --> 00:08:51.169
the birth of new brain cells,

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:53.483
and as we showed, they also perform better

00:08:53.483 --> 00:08:56.200
on a range of learning and memory tasks.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.630
Now, they don't develop morality to the point of

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.390
carrying the shopping bags of little old mice

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.611
across the street,

00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:05.354
but their improved environment results in healthy,

00:09:05.354 --> 00:09:07.267
sociable behavior.

00:09:07.267 --> 00:09:10.210
Mice reared in a standard cage, by contrast,

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.675
not dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell,

00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:15.976
have dramatically lower levels of new neurons

00:09:15.976 --> 00:09:17.603
in the brain.

00:09:17.603 --> 00:09:20.419
It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals,

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:21.925
including primates like us,

00:09:21.925 --> 00:09:24.437
can show neurogenesis.

00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:25.723
In some areas of the brain,

00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:29.418
more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed.

00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:31.677
We're just beginning to understand

00:09:31.677 --> 00:09:33.771
what exact function these cells have,

00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:36.697
but what it implies is that the brain is capable

00:09:36.697 --> 00:09:41.890
of extraordinary change way into adulthood.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.624
However, our brains are also

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:47.264
exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment.

00:09:47.264 --> 00:09:49.814
Stress hormones, glucocorticoids,

00:09:49.814 --> 00:09:51.364
released by the brain,

00:09:51.364 --> 00:09:54.925
suppress the growth of these new cells.

00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:57.473
The more stress, the less brain development,

00:09:57.473 --> 00:10:01.941
which in turn causes less adaptability

00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:04.684
and causes higher stress levels.

00:10:04.684 --> 00:10:08.469
This is the interplay between nature and nurture

00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:12.174
in real time in front of our eyes.

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:14.241
When you think about it,

00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:16.616
it is ironic that our current solution

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.542
for people with stressed amygdalae

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:20.334
is to place them in an environment

00:10:20.334 --> 00:10:24.663
that actually inhibits any chance of further growth.

00:10:24.663 --> 00:10:27.150
Of course, imprisonment is a necessary part

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.570
of the criminal justice system

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.335
and of protecting society.

00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:32.972
Our research does not suggest

00:10:32.972 --> 00:10:35.189
that criminals should submit their MRI scans

00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:36.611
as evidence in court

00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:40.269
and get off the hook because
they've got a faulty amygdala.

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:42.342
The evidence is actually the other way.

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:45.193
Because our brains are capable of change,

00:10:45.193 --> 00:10:47.691
we need to take responsibility for our actions,

00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:49.543
and they need to take responsibility

00:10:49.543 --> 00:10:52.971
for their rehabilitation.

00:10:52.971 --> 00:10:54.775
One way such rehabilitation might work

00:10:54.775 --> 00:10:58.068
is through restorative justice programs.

00:10:58.068 --> 00:11:00.397
Here victims, if they choose to participate,

00:11:00.397 --> 00:11:02.638
and perpetrators meet face to face

00:11:02.638 --> 00:11:05.338
in safe, structured encounters,

00:11:05.338 --> 00:11:07.168
and the perpetrator is encouraged

00:11:07.168 --> 00:11:09.137
to take responsibility for their actions,

00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:12.366
and the victim plays an active role in the process.

00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:15.237
In such a setting, the perpetrator can see,

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:17.572
perhaps for the first time,

00:11:17.572 --> 00:11:19.976
the victim as a real person

00:11:19.976 --> 00:11:21.645
with thoughts and feelings and a genuine

00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:23.483
emotional response.

00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:25.374
This stimulates the amygdala

00:11:25.374 --> 00:11:28.925
and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice

00:11:28.925 --> 00:11:31.991
than simple incarceration.

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:33.576
Such programs won't work for everyone,

00:11:33.576 --> 00:11:36.265
but for many, it could be a way

00:11:36.265 --> 00:11:40.626
to break the frozen sea within.

00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:43.385
So what can we do now?

00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:45.897
How can we apply this knowledge?

00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:48.218
I'd like to leave you with

00:11:48.218 --> 00:11:49.963
three lessons that I learned.

00:11:49.963 --> 00:11:52.133
The first thing that I learned was that

00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:53.659
we need to change our mindset.

00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:56.808
Since Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago,

00:11:56.808 --> 00:11:59.923
society has advanced in virtually every aspect,

00:11:59.923 --> 00:12:03.337
in the way we run our schools, our hospitals.

00:12:03.337 --> 00:12:05.420
Yet the moment we speak about prisons,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.316
it's as though we're back in Dickensian times,

00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:10.540
if not medieval times.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.774
For too long, I believe,

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:16.439
we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:19.481
of the false notion that human 
nature cannot change,

00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:23.144
and as a society, it's costing us dearly.

00:12:23.144 --> 00:12:27.020
We know that the brain is
capable of extraordinary change,

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.059
and the best way to achieve that,

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:32.471
even in adults, is to change and modulate

00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:34.266
our environment.

00:12:34.266 --> 00:12:37.151
The second thing I have learned

00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:39.777
is that we need to create an alliance

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:43.278
of people who believe that science is integral

00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:45.560
to bringing about social change.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.533
It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place

00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:50.712
a high-security inmate in an MRI scanner.

00:12:50.712 --> 00:12:53.220
Well actually, that turns out not to be so easy,

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.879
but ultimately what we want to show

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:59.647
is whether we're able to
reduce the reoffending rates.

00:12:59.647 --> 00:13:02.368
In order to answer complex questions like that,

00:13:02.368 --> 00:13:05.019
we need people of different backgrounds --

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:07.223
lab-based scientists and clinicians,

00:13:07.223 --> 00:13:09.613
social workers and policy makers,

00:13:09.613 --> 00:13:12.236
philanthropists and human rights activists â

00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:14.162
to work together.

00:13:14.162 --> 00:13:15.849
Finally, I believe we need

00:13:15.849 --> 00:13:17.487
to change our own amygdalae,

00:13:17.487 --> 00:13:20.268
because this issue goes to the heart

00:13:20.268 --> 00:13:22.039
not just of who Joe is,

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:23.951
but who we are.

00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:26.931
We need to change our view of Joe

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:30.733
as someone wholly irredeemable,

00:13:30.733 --> 00:13:34.243
because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable,

00:13:34.243 --> 00:13:38.523
how is he going to see himself as any different?

00:13:38.523 --> 00:13:40.394
In another decade, Joe will be released

00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:43.063
from Wormwood Scrubs.

00:13:43.063 --> 00:13:45.980
Will he be among the 70 percent of inmates

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.474
who end up reoffending

00:13:47.474 --> 00:13:50.256
and returning to the prison system?

00:13:50.256 --> 00:13:52.892
Wouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence,

00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:54.818
Joe was able to train his amygdala,

00:13:54.818 --> 00:13:57.172
which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells

00:13:57.172 --> 00:13:58.453
and connections,

00:13:58.453 --> 00:14:01.049
so that he will be able to face the world

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.169
once he gets released?

00:14:03.169 --> 00:14:07.633
Surely, that would be in the interest of all of us.

00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:12.800
(Applause)

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.802
Thank you. (Applause)
