00:00:00.763 --> 00:00:04.579
I want you all to think

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:10.295
about the third word
that was ever said about you --

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:14.614
or, if you were delivering,

00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:18.344
about the person you were delivering.

00:00:19.864 --> 00:00:23.705
And you can all mouth it
if you want or say it out loud.

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:29.286
It was -- the first two were, "It's a ..."

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.331
Audience: (Mixed reply) Girl. Boy.

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:32.356
(Laughter)

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.982
Well, it shows you that --

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.085
I also deal with issues
where there's not certainty

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.684
of whether it's a girl or a boy,

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:41.989
so the mixed answer was very appropriate.

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:46.970
Of course, now the answer often comes
not at birth but at the ultrasound,

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.948
unless the prospective parents
choose to be surprised,

00:00:50.972 --> 00:00:52.576
like we all were.

00:00:53.835 --> 00:01:00.835
But I want you to think about what it is
that leads to that statement

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.875
on the third word,

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.376
because the third word

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.238
is a description of your sex.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.548
And by that I mean,

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:19.071
made by a description of your genitals.

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:23.480
Now, as a pediatric endocrinologist,

00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:28.981
I used to be very, very involved
and still somewhat am, in cases

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:35.269
in which there are mismatches
in the externals

00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:39.307
or between the externals
and the internals,

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:44.144
and we literally have to figure out

00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:47.286
what is the description of your sex.

00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:53.784
But there is nothing
that is definable at the time of birth

00:01:53.808 --> 00:01:57.053
that would define you.

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:00.244
And when I talk about definition,

00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:05.029
I'm talking about your sexual orientation.

00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:10.143
We don't say, "It's a ... gay boy!"

00:02:11.668 --> 00:02:12.957
"A lesbian girl!"

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.958
Those situations don't
really define themselves

00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:20.171
more until the second decade of life.

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:26.928
Nor do they define your gender,

00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:30.540
which, as different
from your anatomic sex,

00:02:30.564 --> 00:02:33.814
describes your self-concept:

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:39.346
Do you see yourself as a male or female,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.326
or somewhere in the spectrum in between?

00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:49.872
That sometimes shows up

00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:52.856
in the first decade of life,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.502
but it can be very confusing for parents,

00:02:56.526 --> 00:03:01.233
because it is quite normative for children

00:03:01.257 --> 00:03:05.610
to act in a cross-gender play and way,

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:07.944
and, in fact, there are studies that show

00:03:07.968 --> 00:03:13.796
that even 80 percent of children
who act in that fashion

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.738
will not persist in wanting
to be the opposite gender

00:03:20.762 --> 00:03:23.458
at the time when puberty begins.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:29.278
But, at the time that puberty begins --

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:35.835
that means between about age 10 to 12
in girls, 12 to 14 in boys --

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.946
with breast budding,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.843
or two to three times'
increase in the gonads

00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:45.712
in the case of genetic males,

00:03:45.736 --> 00:03:47.362
by that particular point,

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:52.318
the child who says
they are in the absolute wrong body

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:56.034
is almost certain to be transgender

00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:04.279
and is extremely unlikely
to change those feelings,

00:04:04.303 --> 00:04:08.838
no matter how anybody tries
reparative therapy

00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:11.036
or any other noxious things.

00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:15.189
Now, this is relatively rare,

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:18.109
so I had relatively little
personal experience with this.

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:21.583
And my experience was more typical,

00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:23.647
only because I had an adolescent practice.

00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:25.339
And I saw someone age 24,

00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:29.930
genetically female, went through Harvard
with three male roommates

00:04:29.954 --> 00:04:31.290
who knew the whole story,

00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:37.331
a registrar who always listed his name
on course lists as a male name,

00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:40.306
and came to me after graduating,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.324
saying, "Help me. I know you know
a lot of endocrinology."

00:04:44.348 --> 00:04:47.656
And indeed, I've treated a lot of people
who were born without gonads.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.324
This wasn't rocket science.

00:04:49.348 --> 00:04:50.951
But I made a deal with him:

00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:52.772
"I'll treat you if you teach me."

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.987
And so he did.

00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:58.971
And what an education I got

00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:01.824
from taking care of all the members
of his support group.

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:06.170
And then I got really confused,

00:05:06.194 --> 00:05:08.727
because I thought it was
relatively easy at that age

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:10.334
to just give people the hormones

00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:13.776
of the gender
in which they were affirming.

00:05:14.595 --> 00:05:17.801
But then my patient married,

00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:22.631
and he married a woman
who had been born as a male,

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:25.934
had married as a male, had two children,

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.229
then went through
a transition into female.

00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:35.710
And now this delightful female

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:42.202
was attached to my male patient --
in fact, got legally married,

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:45.478
because they showed up as a man
and a woman, and who knew, right?

00:05:45.502 --> 00:05:47.005
(Laughter)

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:51.003
And I was confused --

00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:53.898
"Does this make so-and-so gay?

00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:55.672
Does this make so-and-so straight?"

00:05:55.696 --> 00:06:00.522
I was getting sexual orientation
confused with gender identity.

00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:03.784
And my patient said to me,

00:06:03.808 --> 00:06:05.276
"Look, look, look.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.713
If you just think of the following,
you'll get it right:

00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:11.980
Sexual orientation
is who you go to bed with.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:15.344
Gender identity is who you go to bed as."

00:06:15.802 --> 00:06:17.803
(Laughter)

00:06:17.827 --> 00:06:20.619
And I subsequently learned
from the many adults --

00:06:20.643 --> 00:06:23.165
I took care of about 200 adults --

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:24.859
I learned from them

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:29.518
that if I didn't peek as to who
their partner was in the waiting room,

00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:33.217
I would never be able to guess
better than chance,

00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:37.439
whether they were gay,
straight, bi or asexual

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.607
in their affirmed gender.

00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:40.853
In other words,

00:06:40.877 --> 00:06:45.436
one thing has absolutely nothing
to do with the other.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.139
And the data show it.

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:52.224
Now, as I took care of the 200 adults,

00:06:52.248 --> 00:06:53.843
I found it extremely painful.

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.797
These people -- many of them --

00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:02.098
had to give up so much of their lives.

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:04.553
Sometimes their parents would reject them,

00:07:04.577 --> 00:07:06.926
siblings, their own children,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.697
and then their divorcing spouse

00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:12.232
would forbid them
from seeing their children.

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.485
It was so awful,

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:17.765
but why did they do it at 40 and 50?

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:23.034
Because they felt
they had to affirm themselves

00:07:23.058 --> 00:07:24.840
before they would kill themselves.

00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:31.262
And indeed, the rate of suicide
among untreated transgendered people

00:07:31.286 --> 00:07:33.737
is among the highest in the world.

00:07:35.057 --> 00:07:36.210
So, what to do?

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.932
I was intrigued, in going
to a conference in Holland,

00:07:40.956 --> 00:07:43.202
where they are experts in this,

00:07:43.226 --> 00:07:45.528
and saw the most remarkable thing.

00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:49.845
They were treating young adolescents

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:55.839
after giving them the most intense
psychometric testing of gender,

00:07:55.863 --> 00:08:00.259
and they were treating them by blocking
the puberty that they didn't want.

00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:02.845
Because basically,
kids look about the same,

00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:05.864
each sex, until they go through puberty,

00:08:05.888 --> 00:08:08.581
at which point, if you feel
you're in the wrong sex,

00:08:08.605 --> 00:08:10.794
you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey.

00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:14.216
The fantasy that you had
that your body will change

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.891
to be who you want it to be, with puberty,

00:08:16.915 --> 00:08:19.636
actually is nullified
by the puberty you get.

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:23.796
And they fall apart.

00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:28.804
So that's why putting the puberty
on hold -- why on hold?

00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:31.878
You can't just give them
the opposite hormones that young.

00:08:31.902 --> 00:08:33.737
They'll end up stunted in growth,

00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:36.309
and you think you can have
a meaningful conversation

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:38.823
about the fertility effects
of such treatment

00:08:38.847 --> 00:08:42.242
with a 10-year-old girl,
a 12-year-old boy?

00:08:42.663 --> 00:08:45.169
So this buys time
in the diagnostic process

00:08:45.193 --> 00:08:47.021
for four or five years,

00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:49.343
so that they can work it out.

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:52.447
They can have more and more testing,

00:08:52.471 --> 00:08:56.440
they can live without feeling their bodies
are running away from them.

00:08:56.464 --> 00:09:00.622
And then, in a program they call 12-16-18,

00:09:00.646 --> 00:09:05.495
around age 12 is when they
give the blocking hormones,

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.959
and then at age 16, with retesting,

00:09:07.983 --> 00:09:10.265
they re-qualify to receive --

00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:13.261
now remember, the blocking
hormones are reversible,

00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:16.166
but when you give the hormones
of the opposite sex,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.507
you now start spouting breasts
and facial hair and voice change,

00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:21.273
depending on what you're using,

00:09:21.297 --> 00:09:23.399
and those effects are permanent,

00:09:23.423 --> 00:09:25.241
or require surgery to remove,

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.496
or electrolysis,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.646
and you can never really affect the voice.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:32.280
So this is serious,
and this is 15-, 16-year-old stuff.

00:09:33.184 --> 00:09:35.861
And then at 18,
they're eligible for surgery.

00:09:36.772 --> 00:09:40.864
And while there's no good surgery
for females to males genitally,

00:09:40.888 --> 00:09:44.188
the male-to-female surgery
has fooled gynecologists.

00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:46.833
That's how good it can be.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:52.064
So I looked at how
the patients were doing,

00:09:52.088 --> 00:09:54.950
and I looked at patients
who just looked like everybody else,

00:09:54.974 --> 00:09:57.705
except they were pubertally delayed.

00:09:57.729 --> 00:09:59.642
But once they gave them the hormones

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:02.275
consistent with the gender they affirm,

00:10:02.299 --> 00:10:03.532
they look beautiful.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.515
They look normal.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.395
They had normal heights.

00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:10.737
You would never be able
to pick them out in a crowd.

00:10:12.522 --> 00:10:15.079
So at that point, I decided
I'm going to do this.

00:10:15.103 --> 00:10:19.587
This is really where the pediatric
endocrine realm comes in,

00:10:19.611 --> 00:10:24.428
because, in fact, if you're going to deal
with it in kids aged 10 to 14,

00:10:24.452 --> 00:10:26.372
that's pediatric endocrinology.

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:30.741
So I brought some kids in,

00:10:31.513 --> 00:10:34.074
and this now became the standard of care,

00:10:34.098 --> 00:10:36.903
and the [Boston]
Children's Hospital was behind it.

00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:41.070
By my showing them
the kids before and after,

00:10:41.094 --> 00:10:44.915
people who never got treated
and people who wished to be treated,

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:46.527
and pictures of the Dutch --

00:10:48.035 --> 00:10:49.256
they came to me and said,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.487
"You've got to do
something for these kids."

00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:53.568
Well, where were these kids before?

00:10:54.774 --> 00:10:57.145
They were out there suffering,
is where they were.

00:10:57.894 --> 00:11:04.038
So we started a program in 2007.

00:11:04.062 --> 00:11:06.458
It became the first program of its kind --

00:11:06.482 --> 00:11:08.839
but it's really of the Dutch kind --

00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:10.046
in North America.

00:11:10.927 --> 00:11:14.426
And since then, we have 160 patients.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.831
Did they come from Afghanistan? No.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:25.440
75 percent of them came
from within 150 miles of Boston.

00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:29.456
And some came from England.

00:11:30.138 --> 00:11:34.181
Jackie had been abused
in the Midlands, in England.

00:11:34.205 --> 00:11:36.067
She's 12 years old there,

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:37.404
she was living as a girl,

00:11:37.428 --> 00:11:39.586
but she was being beaten up.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.181
It was a horror show,
they had to homeschool her.

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:44.993
And the reason the British were coming

00:11:45.017 --> 00:11:50.717
was because they would not treat
anybody with anything under age 16,

00:11:50.741 --> 00:11:54.454
which means they were consigning
them to an adult body

00:11:54.478 --> 00:11:55.937
no matter what happened,

00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:57.537
even if they tested them well.

00:11:58.108 --> 00:12:02.786
Jackie, on top of it, was,
by virtue of skeletal markings,

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.731
destined to be six feet five.

00:12:07.138 --> 00:12:10.042
And yet, she had just begun
a male puberty.

00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:14.513
Well, I did something
a little bit innovative,

00:12:14.537 --> 00:12:16.635
because I do know hormones,

00:12:16.659 --> 00:12:18.597
and that estrogen is much more potent

00:12:18.621 --> 00:12:22.411
in closing epiphyses, the growth plates,

00:12:22.435 --> 00:12:25.728
and stopping growth, than testosterone is.

00:12:25.752 --> 00:12:30.481
So we blocked her testosterone
with a blocking hormone,

00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:33.964
but we added estrogen,
not at 16, but at 13.

00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:37.489
And so here she is at 16, on the left.

00:12:38.093 --> 00:12:40.371
And on her 16th birthday,
she went to Thailand,

00:12:40.395 --> 00:12:42.673
where they would do
a genital plastic surgery.

00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:44.573
They will do it at 18 now.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.637
And she ended up 5'11".

00:12:47.312 --> 00:12:50.535
But more than that,
she has normal breast size,

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:52.847
because by blocking testosterone,

00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:56.225
every one of our patients
has normal breast size

00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:59.259
if they get to us at the appropriate age,

00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:00.434
not too late.

00:13:01.057 --> 00:13:02.816
And on the far right, there she is.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.665
She went public -- semifinalist
in the Miss England competition.

00:13:09.068 --> 00:13:11.571
The judges debated
as to, can they do this?

00:13:12.134 --> 00:13:16.285
And one of them quipped, I'm told,

00:13:16.309 --> 00:13:20.275
"But she has more natural self
than half the other contestants."

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.187
(Laughter)

00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:26.458
And some of them
have been rearranged a little bit,

00:13:26.482 --> 00:13:28.566
but it's all her DNA.

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:32.774
And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman.

00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:36.982
And she was offered contracts as a model,

00:13:37.006 --> 00:13:39.131
at which point
she teased me, when she said,

00:13:39.155 --> 00:13:41.700
"You know, I might have had
a better chance as a model

00:13:41.724 --> 00:13:43.432
if you'd made me six feet one."

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.436
(Laughter)

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.611
Go figure.

00:13:48.038 --> 00:13:50.966
So this picture, I think, says it all.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.081
It really says it all.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.384
These are Nicole and brother Jonas,

00:13:57.408 --> 00:13:59.347
identical twin boys,

00:14:00.427 --> 00:14:01.931
and proven to be identical.

00:14:03.978 --> 00:14:07.572
Nicole had affirmed herself
as a girl as early as age three.

00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:10.103
At age seven, they changed her name,

00:14:10.127 --> 00:14:14.571
and came to me at the very
beginnings of a male puberty.

00:14:14.904 --> 00:14:17.688
Now you can imagine
looking at Jonas at only 14,

00:14:17.712 --> 00:14:20.499
that male puberty is early in this family,

00:14:20.523 --> 00:14:22.562
because he looks more like a 16-year-old.

00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:24.896
But it makes the point all the more,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.205
of why you have to be conscious
of where the patient is.

00:14:28.665 --> 00:14:31.371
Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here,

00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:35.562
and Jonas is just going --
biologic control.

00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:37.886
This is what Nicole would look like

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.967
if we weren't doing what we were doing.

00:14:39.991 --> 00:14:42.458
He's got a prominent Adam's apple.

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:46.039
He's got angular bones
to the face, a mustache,

00:14:46.063 --> 00:14:48.126
and you can see there's
a height difference,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.029
because he's gone through
a growth spurt that she won't get.

00:14:51.053 --> 00:14:52.570
Now Nicole is on estrogen.

00:14:52.594 --> 00:14:55.061
She has a bit of a form to her.

00:14:55.887 --> 00:14:59.502
This family went
to the White House last spring,

00:14:59.526 --> 00:15:05.265
because of their work in overturning
an anti-discrimination --

00:15:05.289 --> 00:15:07.671
there was a bill that would block

00:15:07.695 --> 00:15:12.298
the right of transgender people in Maine
to use public bathrooms,

00:15:12.322 --> 00:15:15.067
and it looked like the bill
was going to pass,

00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:16.798
and that would have been a problem,

00:15:16.822 --> 00:15:20.299
but Nicole went personally
to every legislator in Maine

00:15:20.323 --> 00:15:22.311
and said, "I can do this.

00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:24.327
If they see me, they'll understand

00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:26.497
why I'm no threat in the ladies' room,

00:15:26.521 --> 00:15:28.603
but I can be threatened
in the men's room."

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.126
And then they finally got it.

00:15:32.038 --> 00:15:33.713
So where do we go from here?

00:15:35.022 --> 00:15:39.091
Well, we still have a ways to go
in terms of anti-discrimination.

00:15:39.115 --> 00:15:42.782
There are only 17 states
that have an anti-discrimination law

00:15:42.806 --> 00:15:45.382
against discrimination in housing,

00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:48.498
employment, public accommodation --

00:15:48.522 --> 00:15:51.510
only 17 states, and five of them
are in New England.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.435
We need less expensive drugs.

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:54.846
They cost a fortune.

00:15:55.164 --> 00:15:59.057
And we need to get
this condition out of the DSM.

00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:03.781
It is as much a psychiatric disease
as being gay and lesbian,

00:16:03.805 --> 00:16:06.724
and that went out the window in 1973,

00:16:06.748 --> 00:16:08.252
and the whole world changed.

00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:10.994
And this isn't going to break
anybody's budget.

00:16:11.018 --> 00:16:12.485
This is not that common.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.660
But the risks of not
doing anything for them

00:16:18.005 --> 00:16:24.477
not only puts all of them at risk
of losing their lives to suicide,

00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:30.753
but it also says something about
whether we are a truly inclusive society.

00:16:30.777 --> 00:16:31.928
Thank you.

00:16:31.952 --> 00:16:35.928
(Applause)
