["Rebecca Newberger Goldstein"]

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.349
["Steven Pinker"]

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.626
["The Long Reach of Reason"]

00:00:11.348 --> 00:00:14.641
Cabbie: Twenty-two dollars.
Steven Pinker: Okay.

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:21.975
Rebecca Newberger Goldstein: Reason 
appears to have fallen on hard times:

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:25.310
Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.776
and political discourse has become a race

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:30.791
to the bottom.

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:35.345
We're living in an era of scientific creationism,

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:39.359
9/11 conspiracy theories, psychic hotlines,

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.466
and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.520
People who think too well

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.876
are often accused of elitism,

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:49.035
and even in the academy,

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.684
there are attacks on logocentrism,

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:56.569
the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking.

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.076
SP: But is this necessarily a bad thing?

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:01.295
Perhaps reason is overrated.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.438
Many pundits have argued that a good heart

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.388
and steadfast moral clarity

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:09.626
are superior to triangulations
of overeducated policy wonks,

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:12.291
like the best and brightest and that dragged us

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.153
into the quagmire of Vietnam.

00:01:14.153 --> 00:01:15.975
And wasn't it reason that gave us the means

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.705
to despoil the planet

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:20.726
and threaten our species with
weapons of mass destruction?

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:23.965
In this way of thinking, 
it's character and conscience,

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:27.091
not cold-hearted calculation, that will save us.

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.956
Besides, a human being is not a brain on a stick.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:33.474
My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:35.375
by our bodies and our emotions

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.360
and use our puny powers of reason

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.720
merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.917
RNG: How could a reasoned
argument logically entail

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:47.349
the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments?

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.185
Look, you're trying to persuade
us of reason's impotence.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:53.572
You're not threatening us or bribing us,

00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:55.203
suggesting that we resolve the issue

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:58.411
with a show of hands or a beauty contest.

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.348
By the very act of trying to
reason us into your position,

00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:05.366
you're conceding reason's potency.

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:08.372
Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be.

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:09.770
You show up for that debate

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.612
and you've already lost it.

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:15.327
SP: But can reason lead us in directions

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:17.999
that are good or decent or moral?

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.510
After all, you pointed out that reason

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.284
is just a means to an end,

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:24.750
and the end depends on the reasoner's passions.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.317
Reason can lay out a road
map to peace and harmony

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:29.173
if the reasoner wants peace and harmony,

00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:32.000
but it can also lay out a road
map to conflict and strife

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.677
if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife.

00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:37.003
Can reason force the reasoner to want

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:39.312
less cruelty and waste?

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:42.584
RNG: All on its own, the answer is no,

00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:45.345
but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes.

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:47.699
You need two conditions:

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.258
The first is that reasoners all care

00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:51.968
about their own well-being.

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:54.864
That's one of the passions that has to be present

00:02:54.864 --> 00:02:57.068
in order for reason to go to work,

00:02:57.068 --> 00:02:58.956
and it's obviously present in all of us.

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:01.486
We all care passionately

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:03.750
about our own well-being.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.583
The second condition is that reasoners

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:08.068
are members of a community of reasoners

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:10.142
who can affect one another's well-being,

00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:11.655
can exchange messages,

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:14.483
and comprehend each other's reasoning.

00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:17.469
And that's certainly true of our gregarious

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.481
and loquatious species,

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.337
well endowed with the instinct for language.

00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:24.659
SP: Well, that sounds good in theory,

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.673
but has it worked that way in practice?

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.507
In particular, can it explain

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:30.438
a momentous historical development

00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:33.305
that I spoke about five years ago here at TED?

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:35.950
Namely, we seem to be getting more humane.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.310
Centuries ago, our ancestors would burn cats alive

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.570
as a form of popular entertainment.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.449
Knights waged constant war on each other

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.615
by trying to kill as many of each
other's peasants as possible.

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:49.290
Governments executed people for frivolous reasons,

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.700
like stealing a cabbage

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.948
or criticizing the royal garden.

00:03:52.948 --> 00:03:55.201
The executions were designed to be as prolonged

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.139
and as painful as possible, like crucifixion,

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.233
disembowelment, breaking on the wheel.

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:02.299
Respectable people kept slaves.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.272
For all our flaws, we have abandoned

00:04:04.272 --> 00:04:05.765
these barbaric practices.

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.533
RNG: So, do you think it's
human nature that's changed?

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:11.318
SP: Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.917
that can erupt in violence,

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:17.287
like greed, tribalism, revenge, dominance, sadism.

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:20.286
But we also have instincts that can steer us away,

00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:23.778
like self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness,

00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:25.054
what Abraham Lincoln called

00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:26.643
the better angels of our nature.

00:04:26.643 --> 00:04:28.685
RNG: So if human nature didn't change,

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.684
what invigorated those better angels?

00:04:30.684 --> 00:04:32.217
SP: Well, among other things,

00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:34.359
our circle of empathy expanded.

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:36.806
Years ago, our ancestors would feel the pain

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:39.279
only of their family and people in their village.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.081
But with the expansion of literacy and travel,

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.007
people started to sympathize

00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:45.672
with wider and wider circles,

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:48.553
the clan, the tribe, the nation, the race,

00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:51.508
and perhaps eventually, all of humanity.

00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:53.714
RNG: Can hard-headed scientists

00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:56.735
really give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy?

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:58.416
SP: They can and do.

00:04:58.416 --> 00:05:00.417
Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain

00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:02.597
that respond to other people's actions

00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:04.664
the same way they respond to our own.

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:06.391
Empathy emerges early in life,

00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:08.274
perhaps before the age of one.

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:09.917
Books on empathy have become bestsellers,

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:11.931
like "The Empathic Civilization"

00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:14.111
and "The Age of Empathy."

00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:16.809
RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:20.477
But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:22.347
for making moral progress.

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:24.534
For one thing, it's innately biased

00:05:24.534 --> 00:05:26.660
toward blood relations, babies

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.494
and warm, fuzzy animals.

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.893
As far as empathy is concerned,

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:34.426
ugly outsiders can go to hell.

00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:37.829
And even our best attempts to work up sympathy

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:39.813
for those who are unconnected with us

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:44.012
fall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature

00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:46.566
that was pointed out by Adam Smith.

00:05:46.566 --> 00:05:48.347
Adam Smith: Let us suppose that the great empire

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:50.962
of China was suddenly swallowed
up by an earthquake,

00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:53.552
and let us consider how a 
man of humanity in Europe

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:55.254
would react on receiving intelligence

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.317
of this dreadful calamity.

00:05:57.317 --> 00:05:59.534
He would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly

00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:02.194
his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people.

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:04.071
He would make many melancholy reflections

00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.261
upon the precariousness of human life,

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.275
and when all these humane sentiments

00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:10.118
had been once fairly expressed,

00:06:10.118 --> 00:06:12.370
he would pursue his business or his pleasure

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.519
with the same ease and tranquility

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.611
as if no such accident had happened.

00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:19.153
If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow,

00:06:19.153 --> 00:06:20.690
he would not sleep tonight,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.432
but provided he never saw them,

00:06:22.432 --> 00:06:24.870
he would snore with the most profound security

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.779
over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.682
SP: But if empathy wasn't enough
to make us more humane,

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.242
what else was there?

00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:34.936
RNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:38.762
one of our most effective better angels: reason.

00:06:38.762 --> 00:06:41.330
Reason has muscle.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.704
It's reason that provides the push to widen

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.849
that circle of empathy.

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.757
Every one of the humanitarian developments

00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:52.355
that you mentioned originated with thinkers

00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:55.225
who gave reasons for why some practice

00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:57.183
was indefensible.

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:59.822
They demonstrated that the way people treated

00:06:59.822 --> 00:07:01.769
some particular group of others

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:03.555
was logically inconsistent

00:07:03.555 --> 00:07:06.127
with the way they insisted
on being treated themselves.

00:07:06.127 --> 00:07:07.821
SP: Are you saying that reason

00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:10.127
can actually change people's minds?

00:07:10.127 --> 00:07:12.057
Don't people just stick with whatever conviction

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.538
serves their interests

00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:16.354
or conforms to the culture that they grew up in?

00:07:16.354 --> 00:07:19.513
RNG: Here's a fascinating fact about us:

00:07:19.513 --> 00:07:21.591
Contradictions bother us,

00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:23.726
at least when we're forced to confront them,

00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:25.544
which is just another way of saying

00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:28.290
that we are susceptible to reason.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.121
And if you look at the history of moral progress,

00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:34.828
you can trace a direct pathway
from reasoned arguments

00:07:34.828 --> 00:07:38.167
to changes in the way that we actually feel.

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:41.748
Time and again, a thinker would lay out an argument

00:07:41.748 --> 00:07:45.018
as to why some practice was indefensible,

00:07:45.018 --> 00:07:50.067
irrational, inconsistent with values already held.

00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:52.135
Their essay would go viral,

00:07:52.135 --> 00:07:54.420
get translated into many languages,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.770
get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons,

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.377
and at dinner parties,

00:07:59.377 --> 00:08:03.430
and influence leaders, legislators,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.968
popular opinion.

00:08:04.968 --> 00:08:08.221
Eventually their conclusions get absorbed

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.548
into the common sense of decency,

00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:13.237
erasing the tracks of the original argument

00:08:13.237 --> 00:08:15.045
that had gotten us there.

00:08:15.045 --> 00:08:17.842
Few of us today feel any need to put forth

00:08:17.842 --> 00:08:19.950
a rigorous philosophical argument

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.209
as to why slavery is wrong

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:25.767
or public hangings or beating children.

00:08:25.767 --> 00:08:28.667
By now, these things just feel wrong.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:31.504
But just those arguments had to be made,

00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:34.253
and they were, in centuries past.

00:08:34.253 --> 00:08:36.005
SP: Are you saying that people needed

00:08:36.005 --> 00:08:38.053
a step-by-step argument to grasp

00:08:38.053 --> 00:08:40.112
why something might be a wee bit wrong

00:08:40.112 --> 00:08:41.890
with burning heretics at the stake?

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.807
RNG: Oh, they did. Here's the French theologian

00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:47.729
Sebastian Castellio making the case.

00:08:47.729 --> 00:08:49.744
Sebastian Castellio: Calvin says that he's certain,

00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:51.384
and other sects say that they are.

00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:52.657
Who shall be judge?

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.095
If the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin?

00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:58.114
But then, why does he write so
many books about manifest truth?

00:08:58.114 --> 00:09:00.650
In view of the uncertainty, we must define heretics

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.414
simply as one with whom we disagree.

00:09:02.414 --> 00:09:04.386
And if then we are going to kill heretics,

00:09:04.386 --> 00:09:06.627
the logical outcome will be a war of extermination,

00:09:06.627 --> 00:09:08.498
since each is sure of himself.

00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:10.047
SP: Or with hideous punishments

00:09:10.047 --> 00:09:11.890
like breaking on the wheel?

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.398
RNG: The prohibition in our constitution

00:09:14.398 --> 00:09:16.430
of cruel and unusual punishments

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.011
was a response to a pamphlet circulated in 1764

00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:23.530
by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.881
Cesare Beccaria: As punishments
become more cruel,

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:27.964
the minds of men, which like fluids

00:09:27.964 --> 00:09:29.923
always adjust to the level of the objects

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:31.802
that surround them, become hardened,

00:09:31.802 --> 00:09:34.647
and after a hundred years of cruel punishments,

00:09:34.647 --> 00:09:36.839
breaking on the wheel causes no more fear

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.983
than imprisonment previously did.

00:09:38.983 --> 00:09:41.030
For a punishment to achieve its objective,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.770
it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.829
outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime,

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:48.937
and into this calculation ought to be factored

00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:50.603
the certainty of punishment

00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:51.741
and the loss of the good

00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:54.376
that the commission of the crime will produce.

00:09:54.376 --> 00:09:56.168
Everything beyond this is superfluous,

00:09:56.168 --> 00:09:58.119
and therefore tyrannical.

00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:00.469
SP: But surely antiwar movements depended

00:10:00.469 --> 00:10:01.998
on mass demonstrations

00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:04.080
and catchy tunes by folk singers

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.987
and wrenching photographs
of the human costs of war.

00:10:06.987 --> 00:10:10.165
RNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements

00:10:10.165 --> 00:10:12.858
reach back to a long chain of thinkers

00:10:12.858 --> 00:10:15.446
who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:17.685
our emotions against war,

00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:20.812
such as the father of modernity, Erasmus.

00:10:20.812 --> 00:10:22.669
Erasmus: The advantages derived from peace

00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:24.334
diffuse themselves far and wide,

00:10:24.334 --> 00:10:26.233
and reach great numbers,

00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:28.234
while in war, if anything turns out happily,

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:30.458
the advantage redounds only to a few,

00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:32.469
and those unworthy of reaping it.

00:10:32.469 --> 00:10:35.346
One man's safety is owing
to the destruction of another.

00:10:35.346 --> 00:10:38.015
One man's prize is derived
from the plunder of another.

00:10:38.015 --> 00:10:40.182
The cause of rejoicings made by one side

00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:42.530
is to the other a cause of mourning.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.071
Whatever is unfortunate in war,

00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:45.731
is severely so indeed,

00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:47.133
and whatever, on the contrary,

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:48.422
is called good fortune,

00:10:48.422 --> 00:10:50.341
is a savage and a cruel good fortune,

00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:53.978
an ungenerous happiness deriving
its existence from another's woe.

00:10:53.978 --> 00:10:55.835
SP: But everyone knows that the movement

00:10:55.835 --> 00:10:59.053
to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion.

00:10:59.053 --> 00:11:01.303
It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers,

00:11:01.303 --> 00:11:04.638
and it only became popular when
Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel

00:11:04.638 --> 00:11:06.922
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" became a bestseller.

00:11:06.922 --> 00:11:09.839
RNG: But the ball got rolling a century before.

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:13.077
John Locke bucked the tide of millennia

00:11:13.077 --> 00:11:16.502
that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural.

00:11:16.502 --> 00:11:19.076
He argued that it was inconsistent

00:11:19.076 --> 00:11:20.998
with the principles of rational government.

00:11:20.998 --> 00:11:22.643
John Locke: Freedom of men under government

00:11:22.643 --> 00:11:24.662
is to have a standing rule to live by

00:11:24.662 --> 00:11:26.715
common to everyone of that society

00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:29.787
and made by the legislative power erected in it,

00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:31.971
a liberty to follow my own will in all things

00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:33.691
where that rule prescribes not,

00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:35.602
not to be subject to the inconstant,

00:11:35.602 --> 00:11:39.009
uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man,

00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:41.608
as freedom of nature is to
be under no other restraint

00:11:41.608 --> 00:11:43.558
but the law of nature.

00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:45.350
SP: Those words sound familiar.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.076
Where have I read them before? Ah, yes.

00:11:48.076 --> 00:11:50.819
Mary Astell: If absolute sovereignty 
be not necessary

00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:53.431
in a state, how comes it to be so in a family?

00:11:53.431 --> 00:11:56.411
Or if in a family, why not in a state?

00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:58.279
Since no reason can be alleged for the one

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:00.387
that will not hold more strongly for the other,

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.820
if all men are born free,

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.209
how is it that all women are born slaves,

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:06.637
as they must be if being subjected

00:12:06.637 --> 00:12:08.675
to the inconstant, uncertain,

00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:11.195
unknown, arbitrary will of men

00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:14.095
be the perfect condition of slavery?

00:12:14.095 --> 00:12:16.028
RNG: That sort of co-option

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:18.594
is all in the job description of reason.

00:12:18.594 --> 00:12:20.769
One movement for the expansion of rights

00:12:20.769 --> 00:12:24.659
inspires another because the logic is the same,

00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:26.558
and once that's hammered home,

00:12:26.558 --> 00:12:29.092
it becomes increasingly uncomfortable

00:12:29.092 --> 00:12:31.286
to ignore the inconsistency.

00:12:31.286 --> 00:12:34.081
In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement

00:12:34.081 --> 00:12:35.999
inspired the movements for women's rights,

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:39.622
children's rights, gay rights and even animal rights.

00:12:39.622 --> 00:12:42.044
But fully two centuries before,

00:12:42.044 --> 00:12:44.192
the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham

00:12:44.192 --> 00:12:46.894
had exposed the indefensibility

00:12:46.894 --> 00:12:49.336
of customary practices such as

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.439
the cruelty to animals.

00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:53.819
Jeremy Bentham: The question
is not, can they reason,

00:12:53.819 --> 00:12:57.212
nor can they talk, but can they suffer?

00:12:57.212 --> 00:13:00.056
RNG: And the persecution of homosexuals.

00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:02.024
JB: As to any primary mischief,

00:13:02.024 --> 00:13:05.281
it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone.

00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:07.531
On the contrary, it produces pleasure.

00:13:07.531 --> 00:13:09.061
The partners are both willing.

00:13:09.061 --> 00:13:10.605
If either of them be unwilling,

00:13:10.605 --> 00:13:11.963
the act is an offense,

00:13:11.963 --> 00:13:14.172
totally different in its nature of effects.

00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:16.784
It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape.

00:13:16.784 --> 00:13:19.028
As to the any danger exclusive of pain,

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:20.740
the danger, if any, much consist

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.579
in the tendency of the example.

00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:25.713
But what is the tendency of this example?

00:13:25.713 --> 00:13:27.985
To dispose others to engage in the same practices.

00:13:27.985 --> 00:13:30.679
But this practice produces not pain of any kind

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:32.313
to anyone.

00:13:32.313 --> 00:13:34.779
SP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.638
for the arguments of these great thinkers

00:13:36.638 --> 00:13:40.043
to trickle down and infiltrate
the population as a whole.

00:13:40.043 --> 00:13:42.522
It kind of makes you wonder about our own time.

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:44.491
Are there practices that we engage in

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.286
where the arguments against
them are there for all to see

00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:49.575
but nonetheless we persist in them?

00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:52.567
RNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us,

00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:55.782
will they be as appalled by some of our practices

00:13:55.782 --> 00:13:59.441
as we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning,

00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:02.529
wife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors?

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:05.321
SP: I'm sure everyone here
could think of an example.

00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:07.351
RNG: I opt for the mistreatment of animals

00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:09.062
in factory farms.

00:14:09.062 --> 00:14:11.292
SP: The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders

00:14:11.292 --> 00:14:13.994
and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons.

00:14:13.994 --> 00:14:16.719
RNG: Scrimping on donations to life-saving charities

00:14:16.719 --> 00:14:18.376
in the developing world.

00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:20.718
SP: The possession of nuclear weapons.

00:14:20.718 --> 00:14:23.095
RNG: The appeal to religion to justify

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:24.735
the otherwise unjustifiable,

00:14:24.735 --> 00:14:27.247
such as the ban on contraception.

00:14:27.247 --> 00:14:29.035
SP: What about religious faith in general?

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.216
RNG: Eh, I'm not holding my breath.

00:14:31.216 --> 00:14:33.273
SP: Still, I have become convinced

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:34.984
that reason is a better angel

00:14:34.984 --> 00:14:36.556
that deserves the greatest credit

00:14:36.556 --> 00:14:39.210
for the moral progress our species has enjoyed

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.325
and that holds out the greatest hope

00:14:41.325 --> 00:14:44.141
for continuing moral progress in the future.

00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:46.043
RNG: And if, our friends,

00:14:46.043 --> 00:14:48.723
you detect a flaw in this argument,

00:14:48.723 --> 00:14:52.045
just remember you'll be depending on reason

00:14:52.045 --> 00:14:53.416
to point it out.

00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:56.130
Thank you.
SP: Thank you.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:03.125
(Applause)
