00:00:00.144 --> 00:00:01.464
I've come here today

00:00:01.464 --> 00:00:04.151
to talk to you about a problem.

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:07.678
It's a very simple yet devastating problem,

00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:09.623
one that spans the globe

00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:12.536
and is affecting all of us.

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:14.621
The problem is

00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:17.346
anonymous companies.

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:19.436
It sounds like a really dry and technical thing,

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.492
doesn't it?

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:22.994
But anonymous companies are making it difficult

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:25.546
and sometimes impossible

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.395
to find out

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:30.394
the actual human beings responsible

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:35.604
sometimes for really terrible crimes.

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:40.646
So, why am I here talking to all of you?

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:44.176
Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:47.127
and when my parents taught my twin brother and I

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:49.033
to question authority,

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:51.044
I don't think they knew where it might lead.

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:52.399
(Laughter)

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.238
And, they probably really regretted it

00:00:54.238 --> 00:00:57.376
during my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,

00:00:57.376 --> 00:00:59.994
I questioned their authority a lot.

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:01.589
And a lot of my school teachers

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.717
didn't appreciate it much either.

00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:06.852
You see, since the age of about five

00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:10.525
I've always asked the question, but why?

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:13.154
But why does the Earth go around the sun?

00:01:13.154 --> 00:01:14.991
But why is blood red?

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.298
But why do I have to go to school?

00:01:17.298 --> 00:01:19.311
But why do I have to respect the teachers

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.178
and authority?

00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:22.820
And little did I realize

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.598
that this question would become the basis

00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:28.251
of everything I would do.

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.006
And so it was

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.490
in my twenties, a long time ago,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.571
that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London

00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:38.360
I was sitting with Simon Taylor

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.368
and Patrick Alley

00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:42.233
and we were busy stuffing envelopes

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:45.283
for a mail out in the office of the campaign group

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:47.538
where we worked at the time.

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:51.623
And as usual, we were talking 
about the world's problems.

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:53.437
And in particular, we were talking about

00:01:53.437 --> 00:01:56.357
the civil war in Cambodia.

00:01:56.357 --> 00:02:00.588
And we had talked about that 
many, many times before.

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:02.875
But then suddenly we stopped

00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:04.419
and looked at each other

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:08.648
and said, but why don't we try and change this?

00:02:08.648 --> 00:02:11.251
And from that slightly crazy question,

00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.093
over two decades

00:02:13.093 --> 00:02:15.359
and many campaigns later,

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.150
including alerting the world

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.366
to the problem of blood diamonds funding war,

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:22.427
from that crazy question,

00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:25.288
Global Witness is now an 80-strong team

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:29.810
of campaigners, investigators, 
journalists and lawyers.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.113
And we're all driven by the same belief,

00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:36.577
that change really is possible.

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:39.696
So, what exactly does Global Witness do?

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:41.930
We investigate, we report,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.652
to uncover the people really responsible

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:46.565
for funding conflict --

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:50.076
for stealing millions from citizens around the world,

00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:51.913
also known as state looting,

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:54.522
and for destroying the environment.

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:59.686
And then we campaign hard to 
change the system itself.

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.447
And we're doing this because 
so many of the countries

00:03:02.447 --> 00:03:04.323
rich in natural resources

00:03:04.323 --> 00:03:07.035
like oil or diamonds or timber

00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:09.539
are home to some of the poorest

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.939
and most dispossessed people on the planet.

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.433
And much of this injustice

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.087
is made possible

00:03:17.087 --> 00:03:20.819
by currently accepted business practices.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.036
And one of these is anonymous companies.

00:03:25.036 --> 00:03:27.130
Now we've come up against anonymous companies

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.270
in lots of our investigations,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.952
like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:03:31.952 --> 00:03:34.704
where we exposed how secretive deals

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:36.337
involving anonymous companies

00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:38.522
had deprived the citizens

00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:42.487
of one of the poorest countries on the planet

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.363
of well over a billion dollars.

00:03:44.363 --> 00:03:49.894
That's twice the country's health 
and education budget combined.

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:51.215
Or in Liberia,

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:54.063
where an international predatory logging company

00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:56.626
used front companies as it attempted to grab

00:03:56.626 --> 00:04:00.815
a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:03.898
Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,

00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:07.093
which has led to the destruction 
of much of its forests.

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:11.234
Well, that uses anonymous companies too.

00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:13.523
We secretly filmed some of the family

00:04:13.523 --> 00:04:16.320
of the former chief minister and a lawyer

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.592
as they told our undercover investigator

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:21.344
exactly how these dubious deals are done

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.420
using such companies.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.193
And the awful thing is,

00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:29.499
there are so many other examples out there

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:33.503
from all walks of life.

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:37.721
This truly is a scandal of epic proportions

00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:40.486
hidden in plain sight.

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:43.265
Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,

00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:44.308
the Zetas,

00:04:44.308 --> 00:04:46.962
who use anonymous companies 
to launder profits

00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:48.908
while their drugs-related violence

00:04:48.908 --> 00:04:53.526
is tearing communities apart across the Americas.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.474
Or the anonymous company,

00:04:55.474 --> 00:04:57.745
which bought up Americans' tax debts,

00:04:57.745 --> 00:04:59.537
piled on the legal fees

00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:00.921
and then gave homeowners a choice:

00:05:00.921 --> 00:05:03.935
Pay up or lose your home.

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:06.613
Imagine being threatened with losing your home

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:09.327
sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,

00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:10.697
and not being able to find out

00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:14.233
who you were really up against.

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:15.672
Now anonymous companies

00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:18.546
are great for sanctions busting too.

00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:21.092
As the Iranian government found out

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:22.927
when, through a series of front companies,

00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:26.020
it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.314
on Fifth Avenue,

00:05:28.314 --> 00:05:31.209
despite American sanctions.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.343
And Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,

00:05:34.343 --> 00:05:37.072
and other companies were the unwitting,

00:05:37.072 --> 00:05:40.179
unknowing tenants there.

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:42.310
There are just so many examples,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.766
the horesemeat scandal in Europe,

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:47.263
the Italian mafia, they've used these companies

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.052
for decades.

00:05:49.052 --> 00:05:54.811
The $100 million American Medicare fraud,

00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:58.583
the supply of weapons to wars around the world

00:05:58.583 --> 00:05:59.610
including those

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.396
in Eastern Europe in the early '90s.

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:03.674
Anonymous companies

00:06:03.674 --> 00:06:05.330
have even come to light

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.696
in the recent revolution in the Ukraine.

00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:14.201
But, for every case that we and others expose

00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:17.418
there are so many more that will remain hidden away

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:19.815
because of the current system.

00:06:19.815 --> 00:06:21.774
And it's just a simple truth

00:06:21.774 --> 00:06:26.391
that some of the people responsible 
for outrageous crimes,

00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:28.631
for stealing from you and me

00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:30.675
and millions of others,

00:06:30.675 --> 00:06:31.858
they are remaining faceless

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.343
and they are escaping accountability

00:06:34.343 --> 00:06:36.515
and they're doing this with ease,

00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:39.930
and they're doing it using legal structures.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.951
And really, that is unfair.

00:06:44.951 --> 00:06:46.890
Well, you might well ask,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.784
what exactly is an anonymous company,

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.192
and can I really set one up, and use it,

00:06:52.192 --> 00:06:54.920
without anyone knowing who I am?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.651
Well, the answer is, yes you can.

00:06:56.651 --> 00:06:58.366
But if you're anything like me,

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.378
you'll want to see some of that for yourself,

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.086
so let me show you.

00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:03.403
Well first you need to work out

00:07:03.403 --> 00:07:05.441
where you want to set it up.

00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:07.418
Now, at this point you might be imagining

00:07:07.418 --> 00:07:10.936
one of those lovely tropical island tax havens

00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:12.941
but here's the thing,

00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:14.138
shockingly,

00:07:14.138 --> 00:07:16.482
my own hometown, London,

00:07:16.482 --> 00:07:17.811
and indeed the U.K.,

00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:20.533
is one of the best places in the world

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:23.437
to set up an anonymous company.

00:07:23.437 --> 00:07:26.126
And the other, even better,

00:07:26.126 --> 00:07:30.049
I'm afraid that's America.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:32.505
Do you know, in some states across America

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:34.822
you need less identification

00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:36.289
to open up a company

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.406
than you do to get a library card,

00:07:39.406 --> 00:07:40.662
like Delaware,

00:07:40.662 --> 00:07:42.744
which is one of the easiest places

00:07:42.744 --> 00:07:46.983
in the world to set up an anonymous company.

00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:48.584
Okay, so let's say it's America,

00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:50.659
and let's say it's Delaware,

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:52.522
and now you can simply go online

00:07:52.522 --> 00:07:55.620
and find yourself a company service provider.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.603
These are the companies that 
can set your one up for you,

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:02.745
and remember, it's all legal,
routine business practice.

00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:04.384
So, here's one,

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:07.311
but there are plenty of others to choose from.

00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:08.942
And having made your choice,

00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:11.448
you then pick what type of company you want

00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:14.564
and then fill in a contact, name and address.

00:08:14.564 --> 00:08:15.748
But don't worry,

00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:17.307
it doesn't have to be your name.

00:08:17.307 --> 00:08:18.789
It can be your lawyer's

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:20.688
or your service provider's,

00:08:20.688 --> 00:08:24.523
and it's not for the public record anyway.

00:08:24.523 --> 00:08:27.080
And then you add the owner of the company.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.019
Now this is the key part,

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.899
and again it doesn't have to be you,

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:33.002
because you can get creative,

00:08:33.002 --> 00:08:36.551
because there is a whole universe 
out there of nominees

00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:38.398
to choose from.

00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:40.734
And nominees are the people that you

00:08:40.734 --> 00:08:45.570
can legally pay to be your company's owner.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.412
And if you don't want to involve anyone else,

00:08:47.412 --> 00:08:50.275
it doesn't even have to be an actual human being.

00:08:50.275 --> 00:08:53.363
It could be another company.

00:08:53.363 --> 00:08:54.793
And then finally,

00:08:54.793 --> 00:08:56.522
give your company a name

00:08:56.522 --> 00:08:59.253
add a few more details and make your payment.

00:08:59.253 --> 00:09:00.673
And then the service provider

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:03.456
will take a few hours or more to process it.

00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:04.695
But there you are,

00:09:04.695 --> 00:09:07.075
in 10 minutes of online shopping

00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:11.289
you can create yourself an anonymous company.

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:12.677
And not only is it easy,

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.284
really, really easy and cheap,

00:09:15.284 --> 00:09:17.572
it's totally legal too.

00:09:17.572 --> 00:09:21.296
But the fun doesn't have to end there,

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:24.095
maybe you want to be even more anonymous.

00:09:24.095 --> 00:09:26.198
Well, that's no problem either.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:28.956
You can simply keep adding layers,

00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:31.056
companies owned by companies.

00:09:31.056 --> 00:09:32.436
You can have hundreds of layers

00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:34.524
with hundreds of companies spread across

00:09:34.524 --> 00:09:37.181
lots of different countries,

00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:38.511
like a giant web,

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.700
each layer adds anonymity.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.930
Each layer makes it more difficult

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.619
for law enforcement and others

00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:48.002
to find out who the real owner is.

00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:52.092
But whose interests is this all serving?

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.218
It might be in the interests of the company

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:55.984
or a particular individual,

00:09:55.984 --> 00:09:58.372
but what about all of us, the public?

00:09:58.372 --> 00:10:01.141
There hasn't even been a global conversation yet

00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.561
about whether it's okay

00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:05.796
to misuse companies in this way.

00:10:05.796 --> 00:10:09.674
And what does it all mean for us?

00:10:09.674 --> 00:10:12.227
Well, an example that really haunts me

00:10:12.227 --> 00:10:14.605
is one I came across recently.

00:10:14.605 --> 00:10:16.554
And it's that of a horrific fire

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:18.339
in a nightclub in Buenos Aires

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:21.290
about a decade ago.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.560
It was the night before New Year's Eve.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.728
Three thousand very happy revelers,

00:10:25.728 --> 00:10:26.765
many of them teenagers,

00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:29.960
were crammed into a space meant for 1,000.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.133
And then tragedy struck,

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:32.736
a fire broke out

00:10:32.736 --> 00:10:34.820
plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.796
and toxic smoke filled the club.

00:10:36.796 --> 00:10:38.861
So people tried to escape

00:10:38.861 --> 00:10:41.494
only to find that some of the fire doors

00:10:41.494 --> 00:10:45.155
had been chained shut.

00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:47.588
Over 200 people died.

00:10:47.588 --> 00:10:51.347
Seven hundred were injured trying to get out.

00:10:51.347 --> 00:10:54.892
And as the victims' families 
and the city and the country

00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:56.436
reeled in shock,

00:10:56.436 --> 00:10:59.982
investigators tried to find out who was responsible.

00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:02.473
And as they looked for the owners of the club,

00:11:02.473 --> 00:11:06.031
they found instead anonymous companies,

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:08.325
and confusion surrounded the identities of those

00:11:08.325 --> 00:11:10.832
involved with the companies.

00:11:10.832 --> 00:11:13.294
Now ultimately, a range of people were charged

00:11:13.294 --> 00:11:15.321
and some went to jail.

00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:17.154
But this was an awful tragedy,

00:11:17.154 --> 00:11:19.137
and it shouldn't have been so difficult

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:23.047
just to try and find out who was responsible

00:11:23.047 --> 00:11:26.008
for those deaths.

00:11:26.008 --> 00:11:27.953
Because in an age

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:30.207
when there is so much information

00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:32.204
out there in the open,

00:11:32.204 --> 00:11:33.878
why should this crucial information

00:11:33.878 --> 00:11:35.388
about company ownership

00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:37.094
stay hidden away?

00:11:37.094 --> 00:11:40.819
Why should tax evaders, corrupt 
government officials,

00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:43.071
arms traders and more,

00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:47.109
be able to hide their identities from us, the public?

00:11:47.109 --> 00:11:52.738
Why should this secrecy be such 
an accepted business practice?

00:11:52.738 --> 00:11:54.426
Anonymous companies

00:11:54.426 --> 00:11:56.635
might be the norm right now

00:11:56.635 --> 00:11:58.641
but it wasn't always this way.

00:11:58.641 --> 00:12:00.438
Companies were created

00:12:00.438 --> 00:12:02.710
to give people a chance to innovate

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.373
and not have to put everything on the line.

00:12:06.373 --> 00:12:09.715
Companies were created to limit financial risk,

00:12:09.715 --> 00:12:14.665
they were never intended to 
be used as a moral shield.

00:12:14.665 --> 00:12:16.939
Companies were never intended to be anonymous,

00:12:16.939 --> 00:12:19.355
and they don't have to be.

00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:22.245
And so I come to my wish.

00:12:22.245 --> 00:12:25.046
My wish is for us to know

00:12:25.046 --> 00:12:27.772
who owns and controls companies

00:12:27.772 --> 00:12:30.522
so that they can no longer be used anonymously

00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:33.152
against the public good.

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:35.818
Together let's ignite world opinion,

00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:37.295
change the law,

00:12:37.295 --> 00:12:42.175
and launch a new era of openness in business.

00:12:42.175 --> 00:12:43.807
So what might this look like?

00:12:43.807 --> 00:12:46.376
Well, imagine if you could go online

00:12:46.376 --> 00:12:49.493
and look up the real owner of a company.

00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:52.265
Imagine if this data were open and free,

00:12:52.265 --> 00:12:53.976
accessible across borders

00:12:53.976 --> 00:12:55.775
for citizens and businesses

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.463
and law enforcement alike.

00:12:57.463 --> 00:13:01.931
Imagine what a game changer that would be.

00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:04.434
So how are we going to do this?

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:05.880
Well, there is only one way.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.131
Together, we have to change the law globally

00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:11.072
to create public registries

00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:13.927
which list the true owners of companies

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:15.963
and can be accessed by all

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:18.092
with no loopholes.

00:13:18.092 --> 00:13:21.824
And yes, this is ambitious,

00:13:21.824 --> 00:13:24.215
but there is momentum on this issue,

00:13:24.215 --> 00:13:26.259
and over the years I have seen

00:13:26.259 --> 00:13:28.591
the sheer power of momentum,

00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:30.975
and it's just starting on this issue.

00:13:30.975 --> 00:13:34.253
There is such an opportunity right now.

00:13:34.253 --> 00:13:36.282
And the TED community

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:39.647
of creative and innovative thinkers and doers

00:13:39.647 --> 00:13:41.544
across all of society

00:13:41.544 --> 00:13:44.803
could make the crucial difference.

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:48.637
You really can make this change happen.

00:13:48.637 --> 00:13:50.439
Now, a simple starting point

00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:51.905
is the address behind me

00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:54.264
for a Facebook page that you can join now

00:13:54.264 --> 00:13:57.010
to support the campaign and spread the word.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.434
It's going to be a springboard

00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:00.395
for our global campaigning.

00:14:00.395 --> 00:14:01.870
And the techies among you,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.243
you could really help us create a prototype

00:14:05.243 --> 00:14:06.963
public registry

00:14:06.963 --> 00:14:11.839
to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:14.350
Campaign groups from around the world

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.210
have come together to work on this issue.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.490
The U.K. government is already on board;

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.892
it supports these public registries.

00:14:24.892 --> 00:14:26.790
And just last week,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.498
the European Parliament came on board

00:14:29.498 --> 00:14:34.564
with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.

00:14:34.564 --> 00:14:36.989
That is momentum.

00:14:36.989 --> 00:14:40.817
(Applause)

00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:44.290
But it's early days.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.782
America still needs to come on board,

00:14:46.782 --> 00:14:50.359
as do so many other countries.

00:14:50.359 --> 00:14:53.468
And to succeed we will all together

00:14:53.468 --> 00:14:55.912
need to help and push our politicians,

00:14:55.912 --> 00:14:57.499
because without that,

00:14:57.499 --> 00:14:59.467
real far-reaching, world-shifting change

00:14:59.467 --> 00:15:02.168
just isn't going to happen.

00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:04.857
Because this isn't just about changing the law,

00:15:04.857 --> 00:15:06.949
this is about starting a conversation

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:09.342
about what it's okay for companies to do,

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:14.376
and in what ways is it acceptable 
to use company structures.

00:15:14.376 --> 00:15:17.149
This isn't just a dry policy issue.

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:18.637
This is a human issue

00:15:18.637 --> 00:15:21.295
which affects us all.

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:27.699
This is about being on the right side of history.

00:15:27.699 --> 00:15:33.057
Global citizens, innovators, 
business leaders, individuals,

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:35.044
we need you.

00:15:35.044 --> 00:15:38.554
Together, let's kickstart this global movement.

00:15:38.554 --> 00:15:39.899
Let's just do it,

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:43.201
let's end anonymous companies.

00:15:43.201 --> 00:15:45.305
Thank you.

00:15:45.305 --> 00:15:48.751
(Applause)
