00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want you to imagine that you're a student in my lab.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And so here's the challenge:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want you to help me create a fully 3D, dynamic, parameterized contact model.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The translation of that is, could you help me build a foot?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And it is a true challenge, and I do want you to help me.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Of course, in the challenge there is a prize.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's not quite the TED Prize, but it is an exclusive t-shirt from our lab.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now if we want to design a foot, what do we have to do?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We have to first know what a foot is.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If we go to the dictionary, it says, "It's the lower extremity of a leg

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking"

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That's the traditional definition.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But if you wanted to really do research, what do you have to do?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So you go to the literature. (Laughter)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Maybe you're familiar with this literature.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The problem is, there are many, many feet.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
How do you do this?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I want you to help me do that in this next clip.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
As you see this clip, look for principles,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and also think about experiments that you might design

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in order to understand how a foot works.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
See any common themes? Principles?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What would you do?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
What experiments would you run?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Wow. (Applause)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Our research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
It's a design inspired by nature, but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but it's a synthesis of the secrets of many, many feet.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
in the probability of contact, the movement of that surface

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and the type of footholds that are present.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
If you want to study how a foot works,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
we're going to have to simulate those surfaces, or simulate that debris.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
When we did that, here's a new experiment that we did:

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
we put an animal and had it run -- this grass spider --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
on a surface with 99 percent of the contact area removed.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But it didn't even slow down the animal.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now how could it do that? Well, look more carefully.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
When we slow it down 50 times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
The leg is acting as a foot.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And in fact, the animal contacts other parts of its leg

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
more frequently than the traditionally defined foot.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The foot is distributed along the whole leg.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and you can remove its foot.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I'm passing some cockroaches around. Take a look at their feet.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Without a foot, here's what it does. It doesn't even slow down.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It can run the same speed without even that segment.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
No problem for the cockroach -- they can grow them back, if you care.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
How do they do it?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Look carefully: this is slowed down 100 times,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It's acting, again, as a distributed foot --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
very effective.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Now, the question we had is, how general is a distributed foot?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Journalists, this is off the record; it's embargoed.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Take a look at what that is!

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It was discovered by Christina Huffard

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and filmed by Sea Studios, right here from Monterey.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We've also described another species of bipedal octopus.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This one disguises itself as floating algae.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can't be seen.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
(Applause)

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
truly extraordinary.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
In 1951, Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But we know that art imitates life,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and it turns out nature, three million years ago, evolved the next animal.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's a shrimp-like animal called the stomatopod,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama:

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
it actually rolls, and it can even roll uphill.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's the ultimate distributed foot: its whole body in this case is acting like its foot.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So, if we want to then, to our blueprint, add the first important feature,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
we want to add distributed foot contact.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Not just with the traditional foot, but also the leg,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and even of the body.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Can this help us inspire the design of novel robots?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We biologically inspired this robot, named RHex,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
RHex's foot started off to be quite simple,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
then it got tuned over time, and ultimately resulted in this half circle.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Why is that? The video will show you.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Watch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
What you'll see, in fact, is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Watch it go over this.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You can see it here well on this debris.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Extraordinary. No sensing, all the control is built right into the tuned legs.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Really simple, but beautiful.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Now, you might have noticed something else about the animals

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
when they were running over the rough terrain.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And my assistant's going to help me here.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
When you touched the cockroach leg -- can you get the microphone for him?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
When you touched the cockroach leg, what did it feel like?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Did you notice something?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Boy: Spiny.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Robert Full: It's spiny, right? It's really spiny, isn't it? It sort of hurts.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
(Laughter)

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Chris Anderson: Did you touch it?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
RF: So if you look carefully at this, what you see is that they have spines

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and until a few weeks ago, no one knew what they did.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
They assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We found that they're for something else -- here's a segment of that spine.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
They're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to pull the leg out from debris,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but they're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Now crabs don't miss footholds, because they normally move on sand --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
until they come to our lab.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And where they have a problem with this kind of mesh,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
because they don't have spines.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
The crabs are missing spines, so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But of course, we can deal with that

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because we can produce artificial spines.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We can make spines that catch on simulated debris

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and collapse on removal to easily pull them out.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
We did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
as you see here, and then we tested them.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Do we really understand that principle of tuning? The answer is, yes!

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
This is slowed down 20-fold, and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
A little better than nature.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So to our blueprint, we need to add tuned spines.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Well, here's RHex: RHex has trouble on rails -- on smooth rails, as you see here.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So why not add a spine? My colleagues did this at U. Penn.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Dan Koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and here's RHex, now, going over those steel -- those rails. No problem!

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
How does it do it?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Let's slow it down and you can see the spines in action.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Watch the leg come around, and you'll see it grab on right there.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It couldn't do that before; it would just slip and get stuck and tip over.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And watch again, right there -- successful.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Now just because we have a distributed foot and spines

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
doesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
This is really, really difficult.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But look at this animal do it!

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
One of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It's extraordinary how fast it can do it --

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but if you slow it down, you see something that's quite extraordinary.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and doing, actually, terribly, with respect to grabbing on the surface.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It looks, in fact, like it's swimming up the surface.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
We can actually model that behavior better as a fluid, if you look at it.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
The distributed foot, actually, is working more like a paddle.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
The same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Watch its feet.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
It's actually functioning as a paddle

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
even though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Can you use this to make a better robot?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Martin Buehler did -- who's now at Boston Dynamics --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
he took this idea and made RHex to be Aqua RHex.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So here's RHex with paddles,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
For rough surfaces, though, animals add claws.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And you probably feel them if you grabbed it.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Did you touch it?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
CA: I did.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
RF: And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University, one of my collaborators, is an extraordinary engineer

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
who developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So to our blueprint, let's attach claws.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Now if we look at animals, though, to be really maneuverable in all surfaces,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
the animals use hybrid mechanisms

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that include claws, and spines, and hairs, and pads, and glue, and capillary adhesion

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and a whole bunch of other things.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
These are all from different insects.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
There's an ant crawling up a vertical surface.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Let's look at that ant.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
This is the foot of an ant. You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
This is when its foot's in the air.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
You see what happens?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
That pad comes out. And that's where the glue is.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Here from underneath is an ant foot,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and when the claws don't dig in, that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
It just extrudes.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And this was a hard shot to get -- I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So it's pretty tough to do.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
This is what it looks like close up --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
here's the ant foot, and there's the glue.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And we discovered this glue may be an interesting two-phase mixture.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It certainly helps it to hold on.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So to our blueprint, we stick on some sticky pads.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Now we have something better here.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
The gecko's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
These are its feet.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
They're -- almost look alien. And the secret, which they stick on with,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
involves their hairy toes.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
They can run up a surface at a meter per second,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
take 30 steps in that one second -- you can hardly see them.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
If we slow it down, they attach their feet at eight milliseconds,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and detach them in 16 milliseconds.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And when you watch how they detach it, it is bizarre.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
They peel away from the surface like you'd peel away a piece of tape.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Very strange. How do they stick?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
If you look at their feet, they have leaf-like structures called linalae

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
with millions of hairs.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It has a hundred to a thousand split ends,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and that's the secret, because it allows intimate contact.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
The gecko has a billion of these 200-nanometer-sized split ends.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And they don't stick by glue, or they don't work like Velcro, or they don't work with suction.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
We discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
So to our blueprint, we split some hairs.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
This has inspired the design of the first self-cleaning dry adhesive --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
the patent issued, we're happy to say.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And here's the simplest version in nature,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and here's my collaborator Ron Fearing's attempt

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And here's the first attempt to have it work on some load.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
There's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You could think of a thousand possible uses, I'm sure.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Lots of people have, and we're excited about realizing this as a product.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We have imagined products; for example, this one:

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
we imagined a bio-inspired Band-Aid, where we took the glue off the Band-Aid.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
We took some hairs from a molting gecko;

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
put three rolls of them on here, and then made this Band-Aid.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
This is an undergraduate volunteer --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
we have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them --

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
that's actually just a red pen mark.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
But it makes an incredible Band-Aid.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.000
It's aerated, it can be peeled off easily, it doesn't cause any irritation, it works underwater.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
we just wondered how they climbed up something --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
can lead to things that you could never imagine.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It's just an example of why we need to support curiosity-based research.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Here you are, pulling off the Band-Aid.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So we've redefined, now, what a foot is.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
The question is, can we use these secrets, then,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to inspire the design of a better foot, better than one that we see in nature?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Here's the new project:

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets --

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I call the new robot RiSE, for "Robot in Scansorial Environment" -- that's a climbing environment --

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And here is RiSE.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
It's six-legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You have the audio? You can hear it go up.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And here it is coming up at you, in its first steps up a wall.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Now it's only using its simplest feet here, so this is very new.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Mark Cutkosky, though, is taking it a step further.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
He's the one able to build this shape-deposition manufactured feet and toes.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
The next step is to make compliant toes,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
attempt to make that climb, and ultimately put it on the robot.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And that's exactly what he's done.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
He's built, in fact, a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So these are tuned toes -- there are six of them,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
So this is not using any suction, any glue,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and it will ultimately, when it's attached to the robot --

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
it's as biologically inspired as the animal --

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Here you see it, next, going up the side of a building at Stanford.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
It's sped up -- again, it's a foot climbing.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
It's not the whole robot yet, we're working on it --

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
now you can see how it's attaching.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
These tuned structures allow the spines, friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
to grab onto very challenging, difficult surfaces.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sped up 20 times --

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor? OK?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
You can visualize this now; it's not impossible.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
It's a very challenging task. But more to come later.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
To finish: we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
We've learned we should distribute control to smart parts.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Don't put it all in the brain,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
but put some of the control in tuned feet, legs and even body.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
That nature uses hybrid solutions, not a single solution, to these problems,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and they're integrated and beautifully robust.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000
And third, we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
to make -- potentially -- something better than nature.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So there's a clear message:

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
whether you care about a fundamental, basic research

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
of really interesting, bizarre, wonderful animals,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
or you want to build a search-and-rescue robot

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
that can help you in an earthquake, or to save someone in a fire,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
or you care about medicine, we must preserve nature's designs.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Thank you.
