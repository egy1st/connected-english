00:00:01.072 --> 00:00:03.083
Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens,

00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:05.169
the future of the Internet.

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:08.552
So I would like to welcome to the TED stage

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:11.378
the man behind those revelations,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.754
Ed Snowden.

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:17.321
(Applause)

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:21.574
Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:24.349
controlling this bot from his laptop,

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.402
so he can see what the bot can see.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.350
Ed, welcome to the TED stage.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.961
What can you see, as a matter of fact?

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.699
Edward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone.

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.949
This is amazing.

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.162
(Laughter)

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:44.445
CA: Ed, some questions for you.

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:45.738
You've been called many things

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:47.303
in the last few months.

00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:52.228
You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor,

00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:53.957
a hero.

00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:57.774
What words would you describe yourself with?

00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:00.436
ES: You know, everybody who is involved

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:01.932
with this debate

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:04.674
has been struggling over me and my personality

00:01:04.674 --> 00:01:07.723
and how to describe me.

00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:09.412
But when I think about it,

00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:12.841
this isn't the question that
we should be struggling with.

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:16.008
Who I am really doesn't matter at all.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.720
If I'm the worst person in the world,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.677
you can hate me and move on.

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:23.212
What really matters here are the issues.

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:26.047
What really matters here is the
kind of government we want,

00:01:26.047 --> 00:01:27.560
the kind of Internet we want,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.118
the kind of relationship between people

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:31.458
and societies.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.546
And that's what I'm hoping
the debate will move towards,

00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:36.918
and we've seen that increasing over time.

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.828
If I had to describe myself,

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:40.172
I wouldn't use words like "hero."

00:01:40.172 --> 00:01:42.874
I wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor."

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:45.068
I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen,

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:47.632
just like everyone else.

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:49.505
CA: So just to give some context

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:51.701
for those who don't know the whole story --

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:55.431
(Applause) —

00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:59.994
this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.384
working as a consultant to the NSA.

00:02:02.384 --> 00:02:04.428
As a sysadmin, you had access

00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:06.833
to their systems,

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:11.087
and you began revealing
certain classified documents

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:14.287
to some handpicked journalists

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:15.878
leading the way to June's revelations.

00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:21.254
Now, what propelled you to do this?

00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:24.040
ES: You know,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.220
when I was sitting in Hawaii,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.878
and the years before, when I was
working in the intelligence community,

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:32.600
I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.877
We do a lot of good things
in the intelligence community,

00:02:35.877 --> 00:02:37.070
things that need to be done,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.767
and things that help everyone.

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:41.724
But there are also things that go too far.

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:43.020
There are things that shouldn't be done,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.088
and decisions that were being made in secret

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:47.336
without the public's awareness,

00:02:47.336 --> 00:02:49.848
without the public's consent,

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:52.700
and without even our representatives in government

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.333
having knowledge of these programs.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:03:00.866
When I really came to struggle with these issues,

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:02.488
I thought to myself,

00:03:02.488 --> 00:03:05.574
how can I do this in the most responsible way,

00:03:05.574 --> 00:03:08.582
that maximizes the public benefit

00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:11.293
while minimizing the risks?

00:03:11.293 --> 00:03:14.381
And out of all the solutions that I could come up with,

00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:16.623
out of going to Congress,

00:03:16.623 --> 00:03:17.926
when there were no laws,

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:19.611
there were no legal protections

00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:21.378
for a private employee,

00:03:21.378 --> 00:03:24.711
a contractor in intelligence like myself,

00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:28.358
there was a risk that I would be
buried along with the information

00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:30.265
and the public would never find out.

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:33.287
But the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution

00:03:33.287 --> 00:03:36.828
guarantees us a free press for a reason,

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:40.033
and that's to enable an adversarial press,

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.930
to challenge the government,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.564
but also to work together with the government,

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:46.882
to have a dialogue and debate about how we can

00:03:46.882 --> 00:03:52.321
inform the public about matters of vital importance

00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.451
without putting our national security at risk.

00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.127
And by working with journalists,

00:03:57.127 --> 00:03:59.281
by giving all of my information

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.558
back to the American people,

00:04:01.558 --> 00:04:03.329
rather than trusting myself to make

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.063
the decisions about publication,

00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:08.299
we've had a robust debate

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.566
with a deep investment by the government

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:16.672
that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.

00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:20.447
And the risks that have been threatened,

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:22.580
the risks that have been played up

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.132
by the government

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:25.558
have never materialized.

00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:27.636
We've never seen any evidence

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:31.192
of even a single instance of specific harm,

00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:32.661
and because of that,

00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:34.788
I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.

00:04:34.788 --> 00:04:37.001
CA: So let me show the audience

00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.470
a couple of examples of what you revealed.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.382
If we could have a slide up, and Ed,

00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:43.137
I don't know whether you can see,

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:44.251
the slides are here.

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:46.836
This is a slide of the PRISM program,

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:49.305
and maybe you could tell the audience

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:51.911
what that was that was revealed.

00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:54.123
ES: The best way to understand PRISM,

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:55.584
because there's been a little bit of controversy,

00:04:55.584 --> 00:04:59.335
is to first talk about what PRISM isn't.

00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:02.090
Much of the debate in the U.S.
has been about metadata.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.981
They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,

00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:07.722
and they're talking about a specific legal authority

00:05:07.722 --> 00:05:10.427
called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.

00:05:10.427 --> 00:05:13.496
That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:15.859
mass surveillance of the entire country's

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:18.016
phone records, things like that --

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:19.378
who you're talking to,

00:05:19.378 --> 00:05:21.406
when you're talking to them,

00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:22.702
where you traveled.

00:05:22.702 --> 00:05:25.203
These are all metadata events.

00:05:25.203 --> 00:05:28.549
PRISM is about content.

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:30.689
It's a program through which the government could

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:32.733
compel corporate America,

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:36.126
it could deputize corporate America

00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:39.990
to do its dirty work for the NSA.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.986
And even though some of
these companies did resist,

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:44.409
even though some of them --

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.655
I believe Yahoo was one of them —

00:05:45.655 --> 00:05:48.312
challenged them in court, they all lost,

00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:51.227
because it was never tried by an open court.

00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:54.358
They were only tried by a secret court.

00:05:54.358 --> 00:05:55.725
And something that we've seen,

00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:58.429
something about the PRISM program
that's very concerning to me is,

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:00.408
there's been a talking point in the U.S. government

00:06:00.408 --> 00:06:04.159
where they've said 15 federal judges

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.857
have reviewed these programs
and found them to be lawful,

00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:09.577
but what they don't tell you

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:12.207
is those are secret judges

00:06:12.207 --> 00:06:14.209
in a secret court

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:17.283
based on secret interpretations of law

00:06:17.283 --> 00:06:21.517
that's considered 34,000 warrant requests

00:06:21.517 --> 00:06:23.976
over 33 years,

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:26.163
and in 33 years only rejected

00:06:26.163 --> 00:06:29.046
11 government requests.

00:06:29.046 --> 00:06:31.793
These aren't the people that we want deciding

00:06:31.793 --> 00:06:33.939
what the role of corporate America

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:36.395
in a free and open Internet should be.

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.506
CA: Now, this slide that we're showing here

00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:40.718
shows the dates in which

00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:43.133
different technology companies, Internet companies,

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:45.487
are alleged to have joined the program,

00:06:45.487 --> 00:06:48.445
and where data collection began from them.

00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:53.194
Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:58.298
How was that data collected by the NSA?

00:06:58.298 --> 00:07:01.477
ES: Right. So the NSA's own slides

00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:04.277
refer to it as direct access.

00:07:04.277 --> 00:07:07.027
What that means to an actual NSA analyst,

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:10.135
someone like me who was working
as an intelligence analyst

00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:12.606
targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,

00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:14.688
things like that, in Hawaii,

00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:16.657
is the provenance of that data

00:07:16.657 --> 00:07:18.913
is directly from their servers.

00:07:18.913 --> 00:07:20.977
It doesn't mean

00:07:20.977 --> 00:07:23.783
that there's a group of company representatives

00:07:23.783 --> 00:07:26.220
sitting in a smoky room with the NSA

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.010
palling around and making back-room deals

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.553
about how they're going to give this stuff away.

00:07:30.553 --> 00:07:32.946
Now each company handles it different ways.

00:07:32.946 --> 00:07:34.122
Some are responsible.

00:07:34.122 --> 00:07:36.213
Some are somewhat less responsible.

00:07:36.213 --> 00:07:37.981
But the bottom line is, when we talk about

00:07:37.981 --> 00:07:41.360
how this information is given,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.846
it's coming from the companies themselves.

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:46.141
It's not stolen from the lines.

00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:48.073
But there's an important thing to remember here:

00:07:48.073 --> 00:07:50.004
even though companies pushed back,

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:52.057
even though companies demanded,

00:07:52.057 --> 00:07:54.603
hey, let's do this through a warrant process,

00:07:54.603 --> 00:07:56.377
let's do this

00:07:56.377 --> 00:07:59.526
where we actually have some sort of legal review,

00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:01.357
some sort of basis for handing over

00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:03.297
these users' data,

00:08:03.297 --> 00:08:05.688
we saw stories in the Washington Post last year

00:08:05.688 --> 00:08:08.900
that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.499
that said the NSA broke in

00:08:11.499 --> 00:08:13.300
to the data center communications

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.456
between Google to itself

00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:17.034
and Yahoo to itself.

00:08:17.034 --> 00:08:19.866
So even these companies that are cooperating

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:22.737
in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner

00:08:22.737 --> 00:08:24.610
with the NSA,

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.906
the NSA isn't satisfied with that,

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:29.884
and because of that, we need our companies

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.699
to work very hard

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:35.171
to guarantee that they're going to represent

00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:37.757
the interests of the user, and also advocate

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:39.673
for the rights of the users.

00:08:39.673 --> 00:08:40.947
And I think over the last year,

00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:42.530
we've seen the companies that are named

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.948
on the PRISM slides

00:08:43.948 --> 00:08:45.757
take great strides to do that,

00:08:45.757 --> 00:08:48.010
and I encourage them to continue.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.692
CA: What more should they do?

00:08:50.692 --> 00:08:54.209
ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:57.435
in America can do today, right now,

00:08:57.435 --> 00:08:58.877
without consulting with lawyers,

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:02.416
to protect the rights of users worldwide,

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:07.799
is to enable SSL web encryption

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:09.804
on every page you visit.

00:09:09.804 --> 00:09:12.746
The reason this matters is today,

00:09:12.746 --> 00:09:17.984
if you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,

00:09:17.984 --> 00:09:20.431
the NSA can see a record of that,

00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:22.650
the Russian intelligence service
can see a record of that,

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.107
the Chinese service can see a record of that,

00:09:25.107 --> 00:09:27.005
the French service, the German service,

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:28.327
the services of Andorra.

00:09:28.327 --> 00:09:31.605
They can all see it because it's unencrypted.

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:35.205
The world's library is Amazon.com,

00:09:35.205 --> 00:09:37.860
but not only do they not
support encryption by default,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.026
you cannot choose to use encryption

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:41.753
when browsing through books.

00:09:41.753 --> 00:09:43.462
This is something that we need to change,

00:09:43.462 --> 00:09:45.337
not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,

00:09:45.337 --> 00:09:46.829
but they're a great example.

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:48.497
All companies need to move

00:09:48.497 --> 00:09:51.890
to an encrypted browsing habit by default

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.374
for all users who haven't taken any action

00:09:54.374 --> 00:09:56.635
or picked any special methods on their own.

00:09:56.635 --> 00:09:58.946
That'll increase the privacy and the rights

00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:01.711
that people enjoy worldwide.

00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:04.189
CA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:07.142
I want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)

00:10:07.142 --> 00:10:09.850
This is a program called Boundless Informant.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.526
What is that?

00:10:11.526 --> 00:10:13.706
ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA

00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:16.149
for using appropriate names on this.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:19.994
This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.464
Boundless Informant

00:10:21.464 --> 00:10:24.314
is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:26.723
The NSA was previously asked by Congress,

00:10:26.723 --> 00:10:28.936
was there any ability that they had

00:10:28.936 --> 00:10:32.694
to even give a rough ballpark estimate

00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:34.880
of the amount of American communications

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.014
that were being intercepted.

00:10:37.014 --> 00:10:40.045
They said no. They said, we don't track those stats,

00:10:40.045 --> 00:10:41.594
and we can't track those stats.

00:10:41.594 --> 00:10:44.698
We can't tell you how many communications

00:10:44.698 --> 00:10:46.161
we're intercepting around the world,

00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:47.648
because to tell you that would be

00:10:47.648 --> 00:10:50.955
to invade your privacy.

00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:53.170
Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.305
but the reality, when you look at this slide is,

00:10:55.305 --> 00:10:56.958
not only do they have the capability,

00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.574
the capability already exists.

00:10:59.574 --> 00:11:01.248
It's already in place.

00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:04.396
The NSA has its own internal data format

00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:08.545
that tracks both ends of a communication,

00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:09.827
and if it says,

00:11:09.827 --> 00:11:11.853
this communication came from America,

00:11:11.853 --> 00:11:14.209
they can tell Congress how
many of those communications

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:16.725
they have today, right now.

00:11:16.725 --> 00:11:19.696
And what Boundless Informant tells us

00:11:19.696 --> 00:11:22.422
is more communications are being intercepted

00:11:22.422 --> 00:11:25.395
in America about Americans

00:11:25.395 --> 00:11:28.815
than there are in Russia about Russians.

00:11:28.815 --> 00:11:30.680
I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.999
should be aiming for.

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:35.405
CA: Ed, there was a story broken
in the Washington Post,

00:11:35.405 --> 00:11:37.127
again from your data.

00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:38.806
The headline says,

00:11:38.806 --> 00:11:40.303
"NSA broke privacy rules

00:11:40.303 --> 00:11:42.333
thousands of times per year."

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:43.871
Tell us about that.

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:46.464
ES: We also heard in Congressional
testimony last year,

00:11:46.464 --> 00:11:48.401
it was an amazing thing for someone like me

00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:50.105
who came from the NSA

00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:52.677
and who's seen the actual internal documents,

00:11:52.677 --> 00:11:55.268
knows what's in them,

00:11:55.268 --> 00:11:57.808
to see officials testifying under oath

00:11:57.808 --> 00:11:59.690
that there had been no abuses,

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.323
that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:06.264
when we knew this story was coming.

00:12:06.264 --> 00:12:08.352
But what's especially interesting about this,

00:12:08.352 --> 00:12:10.400
about the fact that the NSA has violated

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.768
their own rules, their own laws

00:12:12.768 --> 00:12:15.441
thousands of times in a single year,

00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:18.168
including one event by itself,

00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:23.144
one event out of those 2,776,

00:12:23.144 --> 00:12:25.450
that affected more than 3,000 people.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.289
In another event, they intercepted

00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:31.501
all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.738
What's amazing about this,

00:12:33.738 --> 00:12:35.946
this report, that didn't get that much attention,

00:12:35.946 --> 00:12:40.807
is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,

00:12:40.807 --> 00:12:42.948
the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,

00:12:42.948 --> 00:12:46.935
Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report

00:12:46.935 --> 00:12:50.126
until the Washington Post contacted her

00:12:50.126 --> 00:12:52.574
asking for comment on the report.

00:12:52.574 --> 00:12:54.467
And she then requested a copy from the NSA

00:12:54.467 --> 00:12:56.168
and received it,

00:12:56.168 --> 00:12:58.195
but had never seen this before that.

00:12:58.195 --> 00:13:00.882
What does that say about the state of oversight

00:13:00.882 --> 00:13:02.619
in American intelligence

00:13:02.619 --> 00:13:04.407
when the chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee

00:13:04.407 --> 00:13:07.200
has no idea that the rules are being broken

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.360
thousands of times every year?

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.989
CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:

00:13:12.989 --> 00:13:15.654
Why should we care about

00:13:15.654 --> 00:13:17.122
all this surveillance, honestly?

00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:19.274
I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,

00:13:19.274 --> 00:13:22.058
you've got nothing to worry about.

00:13:22.058 --> 00:13:24.350
What's wrong with that point of view?

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.998
ES: Well, so the first thing is,

00:13:25.998 --> 00:13:27.711
you're giving up your rights.

00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:29.069
You're saying hey, you know,

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:31.441
I don't think I'm going to need them,

00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:33.123
so I'm just going to trust that, you know,

00:13:33.123 --> 00:13:36.101
let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,

00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:38.075
these guys are going to do the right thing.

00:13:38.075 --> 00:13:39.934
Your rights matter

00:13:39.934 --> 00:13:42.776
because you never know when
you're going to need them.

00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:45.058
Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:47.190
not just in America,

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.781
but in Western societies

00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:51.743
and in democratic societies around the world.

00:13:51.743 --> 00:13:54.147
People should be able to pick up the phone

00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:55.601
and to call their family,

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.600
people should be able to send a text message

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.728
to their loved ones,

00:13:58.728 --> 00:14:01.182
people should be able to buy a book online,

00:14:01.182 --> 00:14:02.972
they should be able to travel by train,

00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:05.189
they should be able to buy an airline ticket

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:06.926
without wondering about how these events

00:14:06.926 --> 00:14:10.611
are going to look to an agent of the government,

00:14:10.611 --> 00:14:13.201
possibly not even your government

00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:14.956
years in the future,

00:14:14.956 --> 00:14:16.696
how they're going to be misinterpreted

00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:19.480
and what they're going to think your intentions were.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.554
We have a right to privacy.

00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:25.172
We require warrants to be based on probable cause

00:14:25.172 --> 00:14:27.636
or some kind of individualized suspicion

00:14:27.636 --> 00:14:32.163
because we recognize that trusting anybody,

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:33.757
any government authority,

00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:36.841
with the entirety of human communications

00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:39.274
in secret and without oversight

00:14:39.274 --> 00:14:44.118
is simply too great a temptation to be ignored.

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:46.677
CA: Some people are furious at what you've done.

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:49.516
I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney

00:14:49.516 --> 00:14:55.408
who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,

00:14:55.408 --> 00:14:58.830
Edward Snowden is the lion
that bit the head off the dog.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.383
He thinks you've committed

00:15:00.383 --> 00:15:02.675
one of the worst acts of betrayal

00:15:02.675 --> 00:15:04.781
in American history.

00:15:04.781 --> 00:15:09.137
What would you say to people who think that?

00:15:10.975 --> 00:15:13.180
ES: Dick Cheney's really something else.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:19.977
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:15:20.476 --> 00:15:25.378
Thank you. (Laughter)

00:15:25.378 --> 00:15:27.854
I think it's amazing, because at the time

00:15:27.854 --> 00:15:31.629
Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:33.065
Dick Cheney was saying

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:35.495
he was going to end governments worldwide,

00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:38.400
the skies were going to ignite

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.536
and the seas were going to boil off,

00:15:40.536 --> 00:15:42.754
and now he's saying it's a flea bite.

00:15:42.754 --> 00:15:45.267
So we should be suspicious about the same sort of

00:15:45.267 --> 00:15:49.460
overblown claims of damage to national security

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.145
from these kind of officials.

00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:57.994
But let's assume that these
people really believe this.

00:15:57.994 --> 00:16:00.224
I would argue that they have kind of

00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:04.594
a narrow conception of national security.

00:16:04.594 --> 00:16:07.810
The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney

00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:10.822
do not keep the nation safe.

00:16:10.822 --> 00:16:14.855
The public interest is not always the same

00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:17.290
as the national interest.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.184
Going to war with people who are not our enemy

00:16:21.184 --> 00:16:23.314
in places that are not a threat

00:16:23.314 --> 00:16:25.481
doesn't make us safe,

00:16:25.481 --> 00:16:27.648
and that applies whether it's in Iraq

00:16:27.648 --> 00:16:29.415
or on the Internet.

00:16:29.415 --> 00:16:30.938
The Internet is not the enemy.

00:16:30.938 --> 00:16:32.963
Our economy is not the enemy.

00:16:32.963 --> 00:16:35.249
American businesses, Chinese businesses,

00:16:35.249 --> 00:16:39.820
and any other company out there

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.251
is a part of our society.

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.465
It's a part of our interconnected world.

00:16:44.465 --> 00:16:48.910
There are ties of fraternity that bond us together,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.578
and if we destroy these bonds

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:54.733
by undermining the standards, the security,

00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:57.590
the manner of behavior,

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.541
that nations and citizens all around the world

00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:02.918
expect us to abide by.

00:17:02.918 --> 00:17:06.620
CA: But it's alleged that you've stolen

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.519
1.7 million documents.

00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:10.346
It seems only a few hundred of them

00:17:10.346 --> 00:17:13.203
have been shared with journalists so far.

00:17:13.203 --> 00:17:16.248
Are there more revelations to come?

00:17:16.248 --> 00:17:18.690
ES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.491
I don't think there's any question

00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:25.738
that some of the most important reporting

00:17:25.738 --> 00:17:30.478
to be done is yet to come.

00:17:30.478 --> 00:17:32.540
CA: Come here, because I want to ask you

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.067
about this particular revelation.

00:17:34.067 --> 00:17:37.089
Come and take a look at this.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:40.337
I mean, this is a story which I think
for a lot of the techies in this room

00:17:40.337 --> 00:17:42.076
is the single most shocking thing

00:17:42.076 --> 00:17:44.436
that they have heard in the last few months.

00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:47.061
It's about a program called "Bullrun."

00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:50.837
Can you explain what that is?

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:52.545
ES: So Bullrun, and this is again

00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:59.642
where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,

00:17:59.642 --> 00:18:04.232
this is a program named after a Civil War battle.

00:18:04.232 --> 00:18:05.845
The British counterpart is called Edgehill,

00:18:05.845 --> 00:18:07.320
which is a U.K. civil war battle.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.527
And the reason that I believe they're named this way

00:18:09.527 --> 00:18:13.016
is because they target our own infrastructure.

00:18:13.016 --> 00:18:15.707
They're programs through which the NSA

00:18:15.707 --> 00:18:19.922
intentionally misleads corporate partners.

00:18:19.922 --> 00:18:21.804
They tell corporate partners that these

00:18:21.804 --> 00:18:23.479
are safe standards.

00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:25.498
They say hey, we need to work with you

00:18:25.498 --> 00:18:29.151
to secure your systems,

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:32.344
but in reality, they're giving bad advice

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.610
to these companies that makes them

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.905
degrade the security of their services.

00:18:35.905 --> 00:18:38.234
They're building in backdoors that not only

00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:40.592
the NSA can exploit,

00:18:40.592 --> 00:18:43.113
but anyone else who has time and money

00:18:43.113 --> 00:18:45.233
to research and find it

00:18:45.233 --> 00:18:47.367
can then use to let themselves in

00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:49.237
to the world's communications.

00:18:49.237 --> 00:18:51.007
And this is really dangerous,

00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:55.191
because if we lose a single standard,

00:18:55.191 --> 00:18:58.250
if we lose the trust of something like SSL,

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.732
which was specifically targeted

00:18:59.732 --> 00:19:01.855
by the Bullrun program,

00:19:01.855 --> 00:19:04.523
we will live a less safe world overall.

00:19:04.523 --> 00:19:06.630
We won't be able to access our banks

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.883
and we won't be able to access commerce

00:19:11.883 --> 00:19:14.706
without worrying about people
monitoring those communications

00:19:14.706 --> 00:19:16.884
or subverting them for their own ends.

00:19:16.884 --> 00:19:20.953
CA: And do those same decisions also potentially

00:19:20.953 --> 00:19:23.939
open America up to cyberattacks

00:19:23.939 --> 00:19:27.855
from other sources?

00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:29.320
ES: Absolutely.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.052
One of the problems,

00:19:31.052 --> 00:19:34.502
one of the dangerous legacies

00:19:34.502 --> 00:19:37.994
that we've seen in the post-9/11 era,

00:19:37.994 --> 00:19:42.231
is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.

00:19:42.231 --> 00:19:44.157
They've been in charge of offensive operations,

00:19:44.157 --> 00:19:45.278
that is hacking,

00:19:45.278 --> 00:19:47.988
but they've also been in
charge of defensive operations,

00:19:47.988 --> 00:19:50.351
and traditionally they've always prioritized

00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:51.738
defense over offense

00:19:51.738 --> 00:19:53.128
based on the principle

00:19:53.128 --> 00:19:55.944
that American secrets are simply worth more.

00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:58.054
If we hack a Chinese business

00:19:58.054 --> 00:19:59.738
and steal their secrets,

00:19:59.738 --> 00:20:01.821
if we hack a government office in Berlin

00:20:01.821 --> 00:20:03.919
and steal their secrets,

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:07.526
that has less value to the American people

00:20:07.526 --> 00:20:09.626
than making sure that the Chinese

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.132
can't get access to our secrets.

00:20:12.132 --> 00:20:16.263
So by reducing the security of our communications,

00:20:16.263 --> 00:20:18.291
they're not only putting the world at risk,

00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:20.563
they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,

00:20:20.563 --> 00:20:23.234
because intellectual property is the basis,

00:20:23.234 --> 00:20:25.161
the foundation of our economy,

00:20:25.161 --> 00:20:27.419
and if we put that at risk through weak security,

00:20:27.419 --> 00:20:29.048
we're going to be paying for it for years.

00:20:29.048 --> 00:20:30.595
CA: But they've made a calculation

00:20:30.595 --> 00:20:32.786
that it was worth doing this

00:20:32.786 --> 00:20:36.325
as part of America's defense against terrorism.

00:20:36.325 --> 00:20:39.937
Surely that makes it a price worth paying.

00:20:39.937 --> 00:20:43.824
ES: Well, when you look at the results

00:20:43.824 --> 00:20:46.131
of these programs in stopping terrorism,

00:20:46.131 --> 00:20:49.881
you will see that that's unfounded,

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:51.800
and you don't have to take my word for it,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.572
because we've had the first open court,

00:20:55.572 --> 00:20:57.941
the first federal court that's reviewed this,

00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:00.737
outside the secrecy arrangement,

00:21:00.737 --> 00:21:02.724
called these programs Orwellian

00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:04.958
and likely unconstitutional.

00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:07.697
Congress, who has access

00:21:07.697 --> 00:21:09.008
to be briefed on these things,

00:21:09.008 --> 00:21:11.990
and now has the desire to be,

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.397
has produced bills to reform it,

00:21:14.397 --> 00:21:17.282
and two independent White House panels

00:21:17.282 --> 00:21:19.372
who reviewed all of the classified evidence

00:21:19.372 --> 00:21:22.005
said these programs have never stopped

00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:23.766
a single terrorist attack

00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:27.269
that was imminent in the United States.

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:30.455
So is it really terrorism that we're stopping?

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:32.786
Do these programs have any value at all?

00:21:32.786 --> 00:21:35.030
I say no, and all three branches

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.462
of the American government say no as well.

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:39.275
CA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation

00:21:39.275 --> 00:21:42.560
for them than the war against terrorism?

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.110
ES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.110
CA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.989
for them other than the war against terrorism?

00:21:50.989 --> 00:21:53.684
ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism

00:21:53.684 --> 00:21:55.885
has always been what we in the intelligence world

00:21:55.885 --> 00:21:59.158
would call a cover for action.

00:21:59.158 --> 00:22:01.083
Terrorism is something that provokes

00:22:01.083 --> 00:22:03.313
an emotional response that allows people

00:22:03.313 --> 00:22:07.670
to rationalize authorizing powers and programs

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.114
that they wouldn't give otherwise.

00:22:10.114 --> 00:22:12.600
The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.317
the NSA asked for these authorities

00:22:14.317 --> 00:22:16.254
back in the 1990s.

00:22:16.254 --> 00:22:19.244
They asked the FBI to go to
Congress and make the case.

00:22:19.244 --> 00:22:21.418
The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.

00:22:21.418 --> 00:22:23.983
But Congress and the American people said no.

00:22:23.983 --> 00:22:26.394
They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.

00:22:26.394 --> 00:22:28.313
They said it's worth too much damage

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:31.000
to our society to justify the gains.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.275
But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,

00:22:35.275 --> 00:22:38.526
they used secrecy and they
used the justification of terrorism

00:22:38.526 --> 00:22:40.460
to start these programs in secret

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.272
without asking Congress,

00:22:42.272 --> 00:22:44.452
without asking the American people,

00:22:44.452 --> 00:22:47.190
and it's that kind of government behind closed doors

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.749
that we need to guard ourselves against,

00:22:49.749 --> 00:22:50.999
because it makes us less safe,

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:52.891
and it offers no value.

00:22:52.891 --> 00:22:54.757
CA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,

00:22:54.757 --> 00:22:56.939
because I've got a more personal question for you.

00:22:56.939 --> 00:22:59.863
Speaking of terror,

00:22:59.863 --> 00:23:03.820
most people would find the
situation you're in right now

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.116
in Russia pretty terrifying.

00:23:07.116 --> 00:23:10.703
You obviously heard what happened,

00:23:10.703 --> 00:23:12.896
what the treatment that Bradley Manning got,

00:23:12.896 --> 00:23:15.177
Chelsea Manning as now is,

00:23:15.177 --> 00:23:17.664
and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that

00:23:17.664 --> 00:23:19.322
there are people in the intelligence community

00:23:19.322 --> 00:23:21.601
who want you dead.

00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:23.541
How are you coping with this?

00:23:23.541 --> 00:23:25.490
How are you coping with the fear?

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.494
ES: It's no mystery

00:23:28.494 --> 00:23:34.142
that there are governments out
there that want to see me dead.

00:23:34.142 --> 00:23:37.552
I've made clear again and again and again

00:23:37.552 --> 00:23:40.918
that I go to sleep every morning

00:23:40.918 --> 00:23:45.478
thinking about what I can
do for the American people.

00:23:45.478 --> 00:23:48.510
I don't want to harm my government.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.773
I want to help my government,

00:23:51.773 --> 00:23:55.581
but the fact that they are willing to

00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:57.901
completely ignore due process,

00:23:57.901 --> 00:24:00.609
they're willing to declare guilt

00:24:00.609 --> 00:24:03.895
without ever seeing a trial,

00:24:03.895 --> 00:24:06.311
these are things that we need to work against

00:24:06.311 --> 00:24:09.889
as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.

00:24:09.889 --> 00:24:11.716
We shouldn't be threatening dissidents.

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:14.730
We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.049
And whatever part I can do to see that end,

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:21.202
I'm happy to do despite the risks.

00:24:21.202 --> 00:24:22.726
CA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback

00:24:22.726 --> 00:24:23.945
from the audience here,

00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:26.049
because I know there's widely differing reactions

00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:27.990
to Edward Snowden.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.278
Suppose you had the following two choices, right?

00:24:30.278 --> 00:24:33.084
You could view what he did

00:24:33.084 --> 00:24:34.978
as fundamentally a reckless act

00:24:34.978 --> 00:24:38.197
that has endangered America

00:24:38.197 --> 00:24:41.760
or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.235
that will work towards America and the world's

00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:46.622
long-term good?

00:24:46.622 --> 00:24:49.940
Those are the two choices I'll give you.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.095
I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with

00:24:52.095 --> 00:24:53.512
the first of those,

00:24:53.512 --> 00:24:56.921
that this was a reckless act?

00:24:56.921 --> 00:24:58.576
There are some hands going up.

00:24:58.576 --> 00:24:59.960
Some hands going up.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.236
It's hard to put your hand up

00:25:01.236 --> 00:25:03.347
when the man is standing right here,

00:25:03.347 --> 00:25:04.912
but I see them.

00:25:04.912 --> 00:25:07.443
ES: I can see you. (Laughter)

00:25:07.443 --> 00:25:09.704
CA: And who goes with the second choice,

00:25:09.704 --> 00:25:11.587
the fundamentally heroic act?

00:25:11.587 --> 00:25:14.234
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:25:14.234 --> 00:25:16.808
And I think it's true to say that
there are a lot of people

00:25:16.808 --> 00:25:19.033
who didn't show a hand and I think

00:25:19.033 --> 00:25:20.743
are still thinking this through,

00:25:20.743 --> 00:25:24.201
because it seems to me that the debate around you

00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:27.310
doesn't split along traditional political lines.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.564
It's not left or right, it's not really about

00:25:29.564 --> 00:25:33.686
pro-government, libertarian, or not just that.

00:25:33.686 --> 00:25:36.399
Part of it is almost a generational issue.

00:25:36.399 --> 00:25:38.207
You're part of a generation that grew up

00:25:38.207 --> 00:25:41.133
with the Internet, and it seems as if

00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:44.341
you become offended at almost a visceral level

00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:45.637
when you see something done

00:25:45.637 --> 00:25:47.699
that you think will harm the Internet.

00:25:47.699 --> 00:25:51.272
Is there some truth to that?

00:25:51.272 --> 00:25:56.320
ES: It is. I think it's very true.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.418
This is not a left or right issue.

00:25:59.418 --> 00:26:01.995
Our basic freedoms, and when I say our,

00:26:01.995 --> 00:26:03.542
I don't just mean Americans,

00:26:03.542 --> 00:26:05.555
I mean people around the world,

00:26:05.555 --> 00:26:07.901
it's not a partisan issue.

00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:09.940
These are things that all people believe,

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.465
and it's up to all of us to protect them,

00:26:12.465 --> 00:26:15.297
and to people who have seen and enjoyed

00:26:15.297 --> 00:26:16.958
a free and open Internet,

00:26:16.958 --> 00:26:20.184
it's up to us to preserve that liberty

00:26:20.184 --> 00:26:22.089
for the next generation to enjoy,

00:26:22.089 --> 00:26:23.954
and if we don't change things,

00:26:23.954 --> 00:26:27.087
if we don't stand up to make the changes

00:26:27.087 --> 00:26:30.294
we need to do to keep the Internet safe,

00:26:30.294 --> 00:26:33.062
not just for us but for everyone,

00:26:33.062 --> 00:26:34.527
we're going to lose that,

00:26:34.527 --> 00:26:35.780
and that would be a tremendous loss,

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.127
not just for us, but for the world.

00:26:38.127 --> 00:26:40.200
CA: Well, I have heard similar language recently

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.048
from the founder of the world wide web,

00:26:42.048 --> 00:26:46.565
who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

00:26:46.565 --> 00:26:49.269
Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say,

00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:51.140
do we have a microphone for Tim?

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.507
(Applause)

00:26:53.507 --> 00:27:00.582
Tim, good to see you. Come up there.

00:27:00.582 --> 00:27:03.019
Which camp are you in, by the way,

00:27:03.019 --> 00:27:06.519
traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but --

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:09.213
Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer

00:27:09.213 --> 00:27:12.268
answers to that question, but hero,

00:27:12.268 --> 00:27:15.670
if I have to make the choice between the two.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:19.003
CA: And Ed, I think you've read

00:27:19.003 --> 00:27:21.087
the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about

00:27:21.087 --> 00:27:24.055
about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.

00:27:24.055 --> 00:27:26.157
Is that something that makes sense?

00:27:26.157 --> 00:27:29.798
ES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up

00:27:29.798 --> 00:27:31.857
not just thinking about the Internet,

00:27:31.857 --> 00:27:34.221
but I grew up in the Internet,

00:27:34.221 --> 00:27:38.881
and although I never expected to have the chance

00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:44.428
to defend it in such a direct and practical manner

00:27:44.428 --> 00:27:48.224
and to embody it in this unusual,

00:27:48.224 --> 00:27:50.353
almost avatar manner,

00:27:50.353 --> 00:27:53.059
I think there's something poetic about the fact that

00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:55.041
one of the sons of the Internet

00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:58.093
has actually become close to the Internet

00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.579
as a result of their political expression.

00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:04.290
And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.252
is exactly what we need.

00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:09.760
We need to encode our values

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.107
not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,

00:28:13.107 --> 00:28:15.347
and it's something that I hope,

00:28:15.347 --> 00:28:17.870
I invite everyone in the audience,

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:21.120
not just here in Vancouver but around the world,

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.476
to join and participate in.

00:28:23.476 --> 00:28:25.790
CA: Do you have a question for Ed?

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.820
TBL: Well, two questions,

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.944
a general question —

00:28:28.944 --> 00:28:30.739
CA: Ed, can you still hear us?

00:28:30.739 --> 00:28:34.255
ES: Yes, I can hear you.
CA: Oh, he's back.


00:28:34.255 --> 00:28:35.850
TBL: The wiretap on your line

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.756
got a little interfered with for a moment.

00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:39.409
(Laughter)

00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:41.611
ES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem.

00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:45.418
TBL: So, from the 25 years,

00:28:45.418 --> 00:28:48.355
stepping back and thinking,

00:28:48.355 --> 00:28:50.101
what would you think would be

00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:52.708
the best that we could achieve

00:28:52.708 --> 00:28:54.568
from all the discussions that we have

00:28:54.568 --> 00:28:57.461
about the web we want?

00:28:57.461 --> 00:29:00.833
ES: When we think about

00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:03.946
in terms of how far we can go,

00:29:03.946 --> 00:29:06.099
I think that's a question that's really only limited

00:29:06.099 --> 00:29:08.636
by what we're willing to put into it.

00:29:08.636 --> 00:29:11.593
I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past

00:29:11.593 --> 00:29:17.151
has been exactly what we as not just a nation

00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:20.490
but as a people around the world need,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.716
and by cooperating, by engaging not just

00:29:24.716 --> 00:29:26.120
the technical parts of society,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.962
but as you said, the users,

00:29:28.962 --> 00:29:31.026
the people around the world who contribute

00:29:31.026 --> 00:29:33.468
through the Internet, through social media,

00:29:33.468 --> 00:29:35.195
who just check the weather,

00:29:35.195 --> 00:29:37.748
who rely on it every day as a part of their life,

00:29:37.748 --> 00:29:40.688
to champion that.

00:29:40.688 --> 00:29:43.225
We'll get not just the Internet we've had,

00:29:43.225 --> 00:29:46.174
but a better Internet, a better now,

00:29:46.174 --> 00:29:50.217
something that we can use to build a future

00:29:50.217 --> 00:29:53.185
that'll be better not just than what we hoped for

00:29:53.185 --> 00:29:55.570
but anything that we could have imagined.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:30:01.032
CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:03.037
A lot of the conversation since then has been

00:30:03.037 --> 00:30:05.091
along the lines that

00:30:05.091 --> 00:30:06.994
actually George Orwell got it wrong.

00:30:06.994 --> 00:30:08.713
It's not Big Brother watching us.

00:30:08.713 --> 00:30:10.327
We, through the power of the web,

00:30:10.327 --> 00:30:12.691
and transparency, are now watching Big Brother.

00:30:12.691 --> 00:30:14.952
Your revelations kind of drove a stake

00:30:14.952 --> 00:30:18.699
through the heart of that rather optimistic view,

00:30:18.699 --> 00:30:22.119
but you still believe there's a way of doing something

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:23.988
about that.

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:25.728
And you do too.

00:30:25.728 --> 00:30:31.896
ES: Right, so there is an argument to be made

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:35.493
that the powers of Big Brother
have increased enormously.

00:30:35.493 --> 00:30:39.822
There was a recent legal article at Yale

00:30:39.822 --> 00:30:43.553
that established something called
the Bankston-Soltani Principle,

00:30:43.553 --> 00:30:48.782
which is that our expectation of privacy is violated

00:30:48.782 --> 00:30:50.651
when the capabilities of government surveillance

00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:53.846
have become cheaper by an order of magnitude,

00:30:53.846 --> 00:30:56.568
and each time that occurs, we need to revisit

00:30:56.568 --> 00:30:59.621
and rebalance our privacy rights.

00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:01.611
Now, that hasn't happened since

00:31:01.611 --> 00:31:03.709
the government's surveillance powers

00:31:03.709 --> 00:31:06.489
have increased by several orders of magnitude,

00:31:06.489 --> 00:31:09.463
and that's why we're in the
problem that we're in today,

00:31:09.463 --> 00:31:13.275
but there is still hope,

00:31:13.275 --> 00:31:15.411
because the power of individuals

00:31:15.411 --> 00:31:18.018
have also been increased by technology.

00:31:18.018 --> 00:31:20.019
I am living proof

00:31:20.019 --> 00:31:22.181
that an individual can go head to head

00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:24.499
against the most powerful adversaries

00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:26.820
and the most powerful intelligence agencies

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.580
around the world and win,

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.240
and I think that's something

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.663
that we need to take hope from,

00:31:34.663 --> 00:31:35.840
and we need to build on

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.277
to make it accessible not just to technical experts

00:31:38.277 --> 00:31:40.794
but to ordinary citizens around the world.

00:31:40.794 --> 00:31:42.461
Journalism is not a crime,

00:31:42.461 --> 00:31:44.251
communication is not a crime,

00:31:44.251 --> 00:31:47.195
and we should not be monitored
in our everyday activities.

00:31:47.195 --> 00:31:49.924
CA: I'm not quite sure how
you shake the hand of a bot,

00:31:49.924 --> 00:31:55.814
but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here.
TBL: That'll come very soon.

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:56.937
ES: Nice to meet you,

00:31:56.937 --> 00:31:58.984
and I hope my beam looks as nice

00:31:58.984 --> 00:32:01.328
as my view of you guys does.

00:32:01.328 --> 00:32:04.048
CA: Thank you, Tim.

00:32:04.048 --> 00:32:09.780
(Applause)

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.832
I mean, The New York Times
recently called for an amnesty for you.

00:32:13.832 --> 00:32:18.058
Would you welcome the chance
to come back to America?

00:32:18.058 --> 00:32:21.943
ES: Absolutely. There's really no question,

00:32:21.943 --> 00:32:24.525
the principles that have been the foundation

00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:26.918
of this project

00:32:26.918 --> 00:32:30.998
have been the public interest

00:32:30.998 --> 00:32:33.941
and the principles that underly

00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:37.217
the journalistic establishment in the United States

00:32:37.217 --> 00:32:39.663
and around the world,

00:32:39.663 --> 00:32:44.508
and I think if the press is now saying,

00:32:44.508 --> 00:32:46.590
we support this,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.678
this is something that needed to happen,

00:32:48.678 --> 00:32:51.322
that's a powerful argument,
but it's not the final argument,

00:32:51.322 --> 00:32:54.035
and I think that's something
that public should decide.

00:32:54.035 --> 00:32:55.877
But at the same time,

00:32:55.877 --> 00:32:57.423
the government has hinted that they want

00:32:57.423 --> 00:32:59.267
some kind of deal,

00:32:59.267 --> 00:33:01.381
that they want me to compromise

00:33:01.381 --> 00:33:03.556
the journalists with which I've been working,

00:33:03.556 --> 00:33:04.989
to come back,

00:33:04.989 --> 00:33:07.542
and I want to make it very clear

00:33:07.542 --> 00:33:10.268
that I did not do this to be safe.

00:33:10.268 --> 00:33:12.536
I did this to do what was right,

00:33:12.536 --> 00:33:14.763
and I'm not going to stop my work

00:33:14.763 --> 00:33:16.137
in the public interest

00:33:16.137 --> 00:33:18.926
just to benefit myself.

00:33:18.926 --> 00:33:24.704
(Applause)

00:33:24.704 --> 00:33:26.623
CA: In the meantime,

00:33:26.623 --> 00:33:30.391
courtesy of the Internet and this technology,

00:33:30.391 --> 00:33:32.041
you're here, back in North America,

00:33:32.041 --> 00:33:36.057
not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.

00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:40.951
I'm curious, how does that feel?

00:33:40.951 --> 00:33:43.089
ES: Canada is different than what I expected.

00:33:43.089 --> 00:33:45.214
It's a lot warmer.

00:33:45.214 --> 00:33:50.921
(Laughter)

00:33:50.921 --> 00:33:54.177
CA: At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading."

00:33:54.177 --> 00:33:56.375
If you could encapsulate it in a single idea,

00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:58.590
what is your idea worth spreading

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:02.665
right now at this moment?

00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:06.315
ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder

00:34:06.315 --> 00:34:09.918
that democracy may die behind closed doors,

00:34:09.918 --> 00:34:11.822
but we as individuals are born

00:34:11.822 --> 00:34:14.471
behind those same closed doors,

00:34:14.471 --> 00:34:16.836
and we don't have to give up

00:34:16.836 --> 00:34:20.069
our privacy to have good government.

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:22.159
We don't have to give up our liberty

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.938
to have security.

00:34:23.938 --> 00:34:26.726
And I think by working together

00:34:26.726 --> 00:34:29.051
we can have both open government

00:34:29.051 --> 00:34:30.988
and private lives,

00:34:30.988 --> 00:34:32.761
and I look forward to working with everyone

00:34:32.761 --> 00:34:35.300
around the world to see that happen.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.638
Thank you very much.

00:34:36.638 --> 00:34:38.878
CA: Ed, thank you.

00:34:38.878 --> 00:34:47.707
(Applause)
