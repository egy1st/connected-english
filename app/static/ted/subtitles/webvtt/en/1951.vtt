00:00:00.694 --> 00:00:05.547
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:08.597
Or another way to say it is,

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:12.071
what's the most dangerous 
thing that you've ever done?

00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:16.254
And why did you do it?

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.872
I know what the most dangerous thing is

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:19.065
that I've ever done

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:21.349
because NASA does the math.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.701
You look back to the first five shuttle launches,

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.289
the odds of a catastrophic event

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.869
during the first five shuttle launches

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.793
was one in nine.

00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:32.691
And even when I first flew in the shuttle

00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:35.379
back in 1995, 74 shuttle flight,

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.369
the odds were still now that we look back

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:43.037
about one in 38 or so -- one in 35, one in 40.

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:45.604
Not great odds, so it's a really interesting day

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:47.896
when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center

00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:50.266
and you're going to go to space that day

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.001
because you realize by the end of the day

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.631
you're either going to be floating 
effortlessly, gloriously in space,

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:58.748
or you'll be dead.

00:00:58.748 --> 00:01:02.108
You go into, at the Kennedy Space Center,

00:01:02.108 --> 00:01:04.098
the suit-up room,

00:01:04.098 --> 00:01:08.353
the same room that our childhood heroes

00:01:08.353 --> 00:01:09.611
got dressed in,

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:12.586
that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:14.727
to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon.

00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:18.194
And I got my pressure suit built around me

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:22.056
and rode down outside in the van

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:23.631
heading out to the launchpad --

00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:26.533
in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad,

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.642
and as you come around the corner

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:30.647
at the Kennedy Space Center,

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:34.017
it's normally predawn, and in the distance,

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:37.034
lit up by the huge xenon lights,

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:40.449
is your spaceship --

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:44.289
the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet.

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.893
The crew is sitting in the Astro van

00:01:46.893 --> 00:01:49.008
sort of hushed, almost holding hands,

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.557
looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger.

00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:54.000
We ride the elevator up

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.355
and we crawl in, on your hands and knees

00:01:56.355 --> 00:01:58.003
into the spaceship, one at a time,

00:01:58.003 --> 00:01:59.650
and you worm your way up

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.217
into your chair and plunk yourself down

00:02:02.217 --> 00:02:04.505
on your back.

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:08.453
And the hatch is closed,

00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:10.600
and suddenly,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.270
what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.725
is becoming real,

00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:17.798
something that I dreamed about,

00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:20.345
in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old,

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:23.719
is now suddenly within not too many minutes

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.577
of actually happening.

00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:28.260
In the astronaut business --

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.133
the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle;

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:33.944
it's the most complicated flying machine ever built.

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:37.305
And in the astronaut business, 
we have a saying, which is,

00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:39.273
there is no problem so bad

00:02:39.273 --> 00:02:41.593
that you can't make it worse.

00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:42.831
(Laughter)

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:45.933
And so you're very conscious in the cockpit;

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.371
you're thinking about all of the things

00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:48.562
that you might have to do,

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:50.873
all the switches and all the 
wickets you have to go through.

00:02:50.873 --> 00:02:53.066
And as the time gets closer and closer,

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:54.735
this excitement is building.

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:56.895
And then about three and a 
half minutes before launch,

00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:58.702
the huge nozzles on the back,

00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:00.386
like the size of big church bells,

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:01.515
swing back and forth

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:02.860
and the mass of them is such

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.557
that it sways the whole vehicle,

00:03:04.557 --> 00:03:07.441
like the vehicle is alive underneath you,

00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:11.095
like an elephant getting up 
off its knees or something.

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:13.391
And then about 30 seconds before launch,

00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:15.223
the vehicle is completely alive --

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:16.430
it is ready to go --

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.591
the APUs are running,

00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:19.460
the computers are all self-contained,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.949
it's ready to leave the planet.

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.237
And 15 seconds before launch, this happens:

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:28.675
(Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10,

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:32.703
nine, eight, seven, six --

00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:35.251
(Space shuttle preparing for takeoff)

00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:38.143
-- start, two, one,

00:03:38.143 --> 00:03:42.286
booster ignition, and liftoff of 
the space shuttle Discovery,

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:46.317
returning to the space station, paving the way ...

00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:57.884
(Space shuttle taking off)

00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:01.161
Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful

00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:02.964
to be on board one of these things.

00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:04.995
You are in the grip of something

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.192
that is vastly more powerful than yourself.

00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:09.815
It's shaking you so hard you can't focus

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.262
on the instruments in front of you.

00:04:11.262 --> 00:04:14.178
It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog

00:04:14.178 --> 00:04:16.924
and there's a foot in the small of your back

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.451
pushing you into space,

00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:20.500
accelerating wildly straight up,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.202
shouldering your way through the air,

00:04:22.202 --> 00:04:24.733
and you're in a very complex place --

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:26.538
paying attention, watching the vehicle

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:28.189
go through each one of its wickets

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.610
with a steadily increasing smile on your face.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.807
After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:36.221
and then you just have the liquid engines,

00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:37.674
the hydrogen and oxygen,

00:04:37.674 --> 00:04:39.141
and it's as if you're in a dragster

00:04:39.141 --> 00:04:40.916
with your foot to the floor

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:43.335
and accelerating like you've never accelerated.

00:04:43.335 --> 00:04:44.650
You get lighter and lighter,

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.076
the force gets on us heavier and heavier.

00:04:47.076 --> 00:04:48.452
It feels like

00:04:48.452 --> 00:04:50.536
someone's pouring cement on you or something.

00:04:50.536 --> 00:04:51.820
Until finally,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.488
after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so,

00:04:54.488 --> 00:04:56.683
we are finally at exactly the right altitude,

00:04:56.683 --> 00:04:58.765
exactly the right speed,

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.845
the right direction, the engine shut off,

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:04.067
and we're weightless.

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:06.969
And we're alive.

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:08.425
It's an amazing experience.

00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:11.733
But why would we take that risk?

00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:15.453
Why would you do something that dangerous?

00:05:15.453 --> 00:05:17.522
In my case the answer is fairly straightforward.

00:05:17.522 --> 00:05:20.576
I was inspired as a youngster

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:22.167
that this was what I wanted to do.

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:24.360
I watched the first people walk on the moon

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.591
and to me, it was just an obvious thing --

00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:29.593
I want to somehow turn myself into that.

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:30.775
But the real question is,

00:05:30.775 --> 00:05:33.390
how do you deal with the danger of it

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.546
and the fear that comes from it?

00:05:35.546 --> 00:05:39.244
How do you deal with fear versus danger?

00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:42.311
And having the goal in mind,
thinking about where it might lead,

00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:44.120
directed me to a life of

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.465
looking at all of the small details to allow

00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:49.166
this to become possible,

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:52.075
to be able to launch and go 
help build a space station

00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:54.535
where you are on board a million-pound creation

00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:57.371
that's going around the world at five miles a second,

00:05:57.371 --> 00:05:58.746
eight kilometers a second,

00:05:58.746 --> 00:06:01.255
around the world 16 times a day,

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:05.240
with experiments on board that are teaching us

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.232
what the substance of the universe is made of

00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:09.818
and running 200 experiments inside.

00:06:09.818 --> 00:06:11.666
But maybe even more importantly,

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:15.483
allowing us to see the world in a way

00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:18.105
that is impossible through any other means,

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:19.644
to be able to look down

00:06:19.644 --> 00:06:22.947
and have -- if your jaw could drop, it would --

00:06:22.947 --> 00:06:26.937
the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb

00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:31.700
like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.411
constantly changing beauty that is the world itself.

00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:36.946
And you see, because of the speed,

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:40.772
a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes

00:06:40.772 --> 00:06:43.941
for half a year.

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:46.392
And the most magnificent part of all that

00:06:46.392 --> 00:06:49.191
is to go outside on a spacewalk.

00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:54.599
You are in a one-person spaceship

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.067
that is your spacesuit,

00:06:56.067 --> 00:06:59.831
and you're going through space with the world.

00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:01.584
It's an entirely different perspective,

00:07:01.584 --> 00:07:02.999
you're not looking up at the universe,

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.481
you and the Earth are going 
through the universe together.

00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:08.280
And you're holding on with one hand,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.404
looking at the world turn beside you.

00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:14.196
It's roaring silently

00:07:14.196 --> 00:07:16.965
with color and texture as it pours by

00:07:16.965 --> 00:07:18.941
mesmerizingly next to you.

00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:21.627
And if you can tear your eyes away from that

00:07:21.627 --> 00:07:23.089
and you look under your arm

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.327
down at the rest of everything,

00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:30.724
it's unfathomable blackness,

00:07:30.724 --> 00:07:33.792
with a texture you feel like you 
could stick your hand into.

00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:36.207
and you are holding on with one hand,

00:07:36.207 --> 00:07:38.632
one link to the other seven billion people.

00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:40.770
And I was outside on my first spacewalk

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.546
when my left eye went blind,

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:46.216
and I didn't know why.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.826
Suddenly my left eye slammed shut

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:48.950
in great pain

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.009
and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:54.365
I was thinking, what do I do next?

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:56.620
I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.873
so I kept working.

00:07:57.873 --> 00:08:01.212
But unfortunately, without gravity,

00:08:01.212 --> 00:08:03.142
tears don't fall.

00:08:03.142 --> 00:08:06.166
So you just get a bigger and 
bigger ball of whatever that is

00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:08.174
mixed with your tears on your eye

00:08:08.174 --> 00:08:10.652
until eventually, the ball becomes so big

00:08:10.652 --> 00:08:13.213
that the surface tension takes it 
across the bridge of your nose

00:08:13.213 --> 00:08:14.947
like a tiny little waterfall

00:08:14.947 --> 00:08:17.022
and goes "goosh" into your other eye,

00:08:17.023 --> 00:08:20.490
and now I was completely blind

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.588
outside the spaceship.

00:08:23.588 --> 00:08:26.167
So what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:29.869
(Laughter)

00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:31.349
Maybe it's spiders.

00:08:31.349 --> 00:08:32.878
A lot of people are afraid of spiders.

00:08:32.878 --> 00:08:34.607
I think you should be afraid of spiders --

00:08:34.607 --> 00:08:37.290
spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs,

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.717
and spiders like this one, the brown recluse --

00:08:40.717 --> 00:08:42.859
it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you,

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:44.593
you end with one of these 
horrible, big necrotic things

00:08:44.593 --> 00:08:45.696
on your leg

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:46.949
and there might be one right now

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:50.027
sitting on the chair behind you, in fact.

00:08:50.027 --> 00:08:51.112
And how do you know?

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:52.486
And so a spider lands on you,

00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:54.527
and you go through this great, spasmy attack

00:08:54.527 --> 00:08:56.255
because spiders are scary.

00:08:56.255 --> 00:08:58.759
But then you could say, well 
is there a brown recluse

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.134
sitting on the chair beside me or not?

00:09:00.134 --> 00:09:02.148
I don't know. Are there brown recluses here?

00:09:02.148 --> 00:09:04.831
So if you actually do the research, you find out that

00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.876
in the world there are about 
50,000 different types of spiders,

00:09:07.876 --> 00:09:10.551
and there are about two dozen that are venomous

00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:11.902
out of 50,000.

00:09:11.902 --> 00:09:14.270
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.750
here in B.C., there's about 720, 
730 different types of spiders

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.652
and there's one -- one --

00:09:20.652 --> 00:09:21.511
that is venomous,

00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.217
and its venom isn't even fatal,

00:09:23.217 --> 00:09:25.118
it's just kind of like a nasty sting.

00:09:25.118 --> 00:09:27.043
And that spider -- not only that,

00:09:27.043 --> 00:09:30.256
but that spider has beautiful markings on it,

00:09:30.256 --> 00:09:34.404
it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation 
symbol on my back, it's the black widow."

00:09:34.404 --> 00:09:36.662
So, if you're even slightly careful

00:09:36.662 --> 00:09:39.104
you can avoid running into the one spider --

00:09:39.104 --> 00:09:41.250
and it lives close the ground,

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.702
you're walking along, you are 
never going to go through

00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:45.552
a spider web where a black widow bites you.

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:47.525
Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those,

00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:49.155
it builds them down in the corners.

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.747
And its a black widow because

00:09:50.747 --> 00:09:52.086
the female spider eats the male;

00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:53.877
it doesn't care about you.

00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:55.342
So in fact,

00:09:55.342 --> 00:09:57.641
the next time you walk into a spiderweb,

00:09:57.641 --> 00:10:01.516
you don't need to panic and go 
with your caveman reaction.

00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:06.105
The danger is entirely different than the fear.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.438
How do you get around it, though?

00:10:08.438 --> 00:10:09.692
How do you change your behavior?

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.176
Well, next time you see a spiderweb,

00:10:11.176 --> 00:10:13.390
have a good look, make sure 
it's not a black widow spider,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.182
and then walk into it.

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:16.820
And then you see another spiderweb

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.042
and walk into that one.

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:20.288
It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal.

00:10:20.288 --> 00:10:23.804
And the spider that may come out is 
no more threat to you than a lady bug

00:10:23.804 --> 00:10:26.672
or a butterfly.

00:10:26.672 --> 00:10:29.600
And then I guarantee you if you 
walk through 100 spiderwebs

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.188
you will have changed

00:10:31.188 --> 00:10:33.743
your fundamental human behavior,

00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:35.248
your caveman reaction,

00:10:35.248 --> 00:10:38.075
and you will now be able to walk 
in the park in the morning

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:39.864
and not worry about that spiderweb --

00:10:39.864 --> 00:10:42.324
or into your grandma's attic or whatever,

00:10:42.324 --> 00:10:47.409
into your own basement.

00:10:47.409 --> 00:10:50.920
And you can apply this to anything.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.735
If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded,

00:10:53.735 --> 00:10:56.359
your natural reaction would be to panic, I think.

00:10:56.359 --> 00:10:58.419
It would make you nervous and worried.

00:10:58.419 --> 00:11:00.907
But we had considered all the venom,

00:11:00.907 --> 00:11:03.788
and we had practiced with a whole 
variety of different spiderwebs.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.522
We knew everything there is to know

00:11:05.522 --> 00:11:06.980
about the spacesuit

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.493
and we trained underwater thousands of times.

00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:11.224
And we don't just practice things going right,

00:11:11.224 --> 00:11:14.048
we practice things going wrong all the time,

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:17.312
so that you are constantly walking 
through those spiderwebs.

00:11:17.312 --> 00:11:20.389
And not just underwater, but 
also in virtual reality labs

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:21.780
with the helmet and the gloves

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.187
so you feel like it's realistic.

00:11:23.187 --> 00:11:26.515
So when you finally actually 
get outside on a spacewalk,

00:11:26.515 --> 00:11:28.477
it feels much different than it would

00:11:28.477 --> 00:11:30.315
if you just went out first time.

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.076
And even if you're blinded,

00:11:32.076 --> 00:11:35.722
your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.

00:11:35.722 --> 00:11:37.081
Instead you kind of look around and go,

00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:38.733
"Okay, I can't see,

00:11:38.733 --> 00:11:41.155
but I can hear, I can talk,

00:11:41.155 --> 00:11:42.884
Scott Parazynski is out here with me.

00:11:42.884 --> 00:11:44.315
He could come over and help me."

00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:48.229
We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue,

00:11:48.229 --> 00:11:50.020
so he could float me like a blimp

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.195
and stuff me into the airlock if he had to.

00:11:52.195 --> 00:11:54.395
I could find my own way back.

00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:55.765
It's not nearly as big a deal.

00:11:55.765 --> 00:11:57.787
And actually, if you keep on crying for a while,

00:11:57.787 --> 00:12:00.182
whatever that gunk was that's 
in your eye starts to dilute

00:12:00.182 --> 00:12:01.702
and you can start to see again,

00:12:01.702 --> 00:12:03.769
and Houston, if you negotiate with them,

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:06.766
they will let you then keep working.

00:12:06.766 --> 00:12:08.825
We finished everything on the spacewalk

00:12:08.825 --> 00:12:10.422
and when we came back inside,

00:12:10.422 --> 00:12:14.145
Jeff got some cotton batting and took 
the crusty stuff around my eyes,

00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:16.597
and it turned out it was just the anti-fog,

00:12:16.597 --> 00:12:20.044
sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye.

00:12:20.044 --> 00:12:23.592
And now we use Johnson's No More Tears,

00:12:23.592 --> 00:12:24.907
which we probably should've been using

00:12:24.907 --> 00:12:28.543
right from the very beginning. (Laughter)

00:12:28.543 --> 00:12:33.489
But the key to that is

00:12:33.489 --> 00:12:35.044
by looking at the difference

00:12:35.044 --> 00:12:37.039
between perceived danger and actual danger,

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.406
where is the real risk?

00:12:38.406 --> 00:12:40.460
What is the real thing that you should be afraid of?

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.228
Not just a generic fear of bad things happening.

00:12:43.228 --> 00:12:45.595
You can fundamentally change 
your reaction to things

00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:48.532
so that it allows you to go places

00:12:48.532 --> 00:12:50.169
and see things and do things

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:52.665
that otherwise would be completely denied to you ...

00:12:52.665 --> 00:12:56.012
where you could see the 
hardpan south of the Sahara,

00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:57.964
or you can see New York City

00:12:57.964 --> 00:13:00.063
in a way that is almost dreamlike,

00:13:00.063 --> 00:13:04.586
or the unconscious gingham 
of Eastern Europe fields

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:06.717
or the Great Lakes

00:13:06.717 --> 00:13:09.458
as a collection of small puddles.

00:13:09.473 --> 00:13:12.703
You can see the fault lines of San Francisco

00:13:12.703 --> 00:13:14.601
and the way the water pours out under the bridge,

00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:16.333
just entirely different

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:18.002
than any other way that you could have

00:13:18.002 --> 00:13:21.285
if you had not found a way to conquer your fear.

00:13:21.285 --> 00:13:23.724
You see a beauty that otherwise

00:13:23.724 --> 00:13:26.201
never would have happened.

00:13:27.694 --> 00:13:29.448
It's time to come home at the end.

00:13:29.448 --> 00:13:30.767
This is our spaceship,

00:13:30.767 --> 00:13:31.874
the Soyuz, that little one.

00:13:31.874 --> 00:13:33.339
Three of us climb in,

00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:35.791
and then this spaceship detaches from the station

00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:37.461
and falls into the atmosphere.

00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:39.083
These two parts here

00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:41.247
actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up

00:13:41.247 --> 00:13:42.329
in the atmosphere.

00:13:42.329 --> 00:13:44.582
The only part that survives is the little bullet

00:13:44.582 --> 00:13:45.758
that we're riding in,

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:47.796
and it falls into the atmosphere,

00:13:47.796 --> 00:13:49.372
and in essence

00:13:49.372 --> 00:13:52.933
you are riding a meteorite home,

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:55.866
and riding meteorites is scary,

00:13:55.866 --> 00:13:57.379
and it ought to be.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.618
But instead of riding into the atmosphere

00:13:59.618 --> 00:14:00.856
just screaming, like you would

00:14:00.856 --> 00:14:03.201
if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite

00:14:03.201 --> 00:14:06.131
back to Earth -- (Laughter) --

00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:08.555
instead, 20 years previously

00:14:08.555 --> 00:14:11.171
we had started studying Russian,

00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:13.751
and then once you learn Russian, then we

00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:16.265
learned orbital mechanics in Russian,

00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:19.235
and then we learned vehicle control theory,

00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:20.704
and then we got into the simulator

00:14:20.704 --> 00:14:23.276
and practiced over and over and over again.

00:14:23.276 --> 00:14:25.286
And in fact, you can fly this meteorite

00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:27.495
and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle

00:14:27.495 --> 00:14:28.919
anywhere on the Earth.

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:31.844
So in fact, when our crew was coming back

00:14:31.844 --> 00:14:34.404
into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz,

00:14:34.404 --> 00:14:36.780
we weren't screaming, we were laughing;

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.848
it was fun.

00:14:37.848 --> 00:14:39.776
And when the great big parachute opened,

00:14:39.776 --> 00:14:40.995
we knew that if it didn't open

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:42.210
there's a second parachute,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.391
and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism.

00:14:44.391 --> 00:14:46.773
So we came back, we came thundering back

00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:48.659
to Earth and this is what it looked like

00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:51.259
to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:53.282
(Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those

00:14:53.282 --> 00:14:55.998
search and recovery helicopters, once again

00:14:55.998 --> 00:14:59.009
that helicopter part of dozen such Russian

00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:03.637
Mi-8 helicopters.

00:15:03.637 --> 00:15:07.546
Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds,

00:15:07.546 --> 00:15:09.021
a.m. Central Time.

00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:10.192
CH: And you roll to a stop

00:15:10.192 --> 00:15:11.861
as if someone threw your 
spaceship at the ground

00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:13.243
and it tumbles end over end,

00:15:13.243 --> 00:15:14.249
but you're ready for it

00:15:14.249 --> 00:15:15.625
you're in a custom-built seat,

00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:17.062
you know how the shock absorber works.

00:15:17.062 --> 00:15:19.053
And then eventually the Russians reach in,

00:15:19.053 --> 00:15:20.211
drag you out,

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.911
plunk you into a chair,

00:15:21.911 --> 00:15:25.354
and you can now look back at

00:15:25.354 --> 00:15:28.536
what was an incredible experience.

00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:30.503
You have taken the dreams of that

00:15:30.503 --> 00:15:32.115
nine-year-old boy,

00:15:32.115 --> 00:15:33.754
which were impossible

00:15:33.754 --> 00:15:36.644
and dauntingly scary,

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.344
dauntingly terrifying,

00:15:38.344 --> 00:15:41.068
and put them into practice,

00:15:41.068 --> 00:15:44.301
and figured out a way to reprogram yourself,

00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:46.429
to change your primal fear

00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:49.328
so that it allowed you to come back

00:15:49.328 --> 00:15:53.268
with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration

00:15:53.268 --> 00:15:54.611
for other people

00:15:54.611 --> 00:15:57.737
that never could have been possible otherwise.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:05.347
Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.

00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:07.607
I know this song,

00:16:07.607 --> 00:16:12.827
and it's really a tribute to the genius

00:16:12.827 --> 00:16:14.860
of David Bowie himself,

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.773
but it's also, I think,

00:16:16.773 --> 00:16:19.211
a reflection of the fact that we are not machines

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:20.544
exploring the universe,

00:16:20.544 --> 00:16:21.657
we are people,

00:16:21.657 --> 00:16:23.821
and we're taking

00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:25.997
that ability to adapt

00:16:25.997 --> 00:16:27.527
and that ability to understand

00:16:27.527 --> 00:16:29.503
and the ability to take

00:16:29.503 --> 00:16:33.862
our own self-perception into a new place.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:40.099
(Music)

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:44.772
♫ This is Major Tom to ground control ♫

00:16:44.772 --> 00:16:49.831
♫ I've left forevermore ♫

00:16:49.831 --> 00:16:56.638
♫ And I'm floating in a most peculiar way ♫

00:16:56.638 --> 00:17:03.743
♫ And the stars look very different today ♫


00:17:03.743 --> 00:17:11.197
♫ For here am I floating in the tin can ♫

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:18.027
♫ A last glimpse of the world ♫

00:17:18.027 --> 00:17:25.205
♫ Planet Earth is blue and 
there's so much left to do ♫

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:44.783
(Music)

00:17:44.783 --> 00:17:46.309
Fear not.

00:17:46.309 --> 00:17:59.552
(Applause)

00:17:59.552 --> 00:18:02.738
That's very nice of you. Thank you very much.

00:18:02.738 --> 00:18:04.905
Thank you.
