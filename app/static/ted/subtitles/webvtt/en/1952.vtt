WEBVTT

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.860
Chris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.398
a couple days ago,

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:06.741
and this is response time.

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:08.996
And several of you have written to me

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:13.639
with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.987
So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:18.552
of the National Security Agency,

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:21.838
and he's a senior civilian officer there,

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:23.823
acts as its chief operating officer,

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:27.093
guiding strategies, setting internal policies,

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:31.473
and serving as the principal advisor to the director.

00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:33.349
And all being well,

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:36.865
welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED.

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:42.191
(Applause)

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:47.283
Richard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here.

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:49.237
I look forward to the conversation,

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:52.219
so thanks for arranging for that.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.757
CA: Thank you, Rick.

00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:56.324
We appreciate you joining us.

00:00:56.324 --> 00:00:58.491
It's certainly quite a strong statement

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.478
that the NSA is willing to reach out

00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:04.475
and show a more open face here.

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:06.428
You saw, I think,

00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:10.321
the talk and interview that Edward Snowden

00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:11.265
gave here a couple days ago.

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.704
What did you make of it?

00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:16.855
RL: So I think it was interesting.

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:19.742
We didn't realize that he 
was going to show up there,

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:22.875
so kudos to you guys for arranging

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.578
a nice surprise like that.

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:30.951
I think that, like a lot of the things

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:35.470
that have come out since Mr. Snowden

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.035
started disclosing classified information,

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.501
there were some kernels of truth in there,

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.995
but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.518
and I'm interested in helping to address those.

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:49.838
I think this is a really important conversation

00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:51.370
that we're having in the United States

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.885
and internationally,

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:57.294
and I think it is important and of import,

00:01:57.294 --> 00:02:00.754
and so given that, we need to have that be

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:02.154
a fact-based conversation,

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:04.606
and we want to help make that happen.

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:09.223
CA: So the question that a lot 
of people have here is,

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:12.137
what do you make of Snowden's motivations

00:02:12.137 --> 00:02:14.388
for doing what he did,

00:02:14.388 --> 00:02:18.878
and did he have an alternative
way that he could have gone?

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:21.217
RL: He absolutely did

00:02:21.217 --> 00:02:25.415
have alternative ways that he could have gone,

00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:31.009
and I actually think that characterizing him

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.999
as a whistleblower

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.527
actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.

00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:40.098
So what if somebody who works in the NSA --

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:43.102
and there are over 35,000 people who do.

00:02:43.102 --> 00:02:45.455
They're all great citizens.

00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:47.758
They're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:51.975
brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:54.145
all of whom are interested in doing the right thing

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:55.332
for their country

00:02:55.332 --> 00:02:58.366
and for our allies internationally,

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:02.448
and so there are a variety of venues to address

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.622
if folks have a concern.

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:05.545
First off, there's their supervisor,

00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:08.237
and up through the supervisory chain

00:03:08.237 --> 00:03:09.979
within their organization.

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.626
If folks aren't comfortable with that,

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.981
there are a number of inspectors general.

00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:17.522
In the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option

00:03:17.522 --> 00:03:19.447
of the NSA inspector general,

00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:20.767
the Navy inspector general,

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.334
the Pacific Command inspector general,

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:24.244
the Department of Defense inspector general,

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:26.350
and the intelligence community inspector general,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.668
any of whom would have both kept
his concerns in classified channels

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:33.299
and been happy to address them.

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.576
(CA and RL speaking at once)

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:38.179
He had the option to go to
congressional committees,

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.298
and there are mechanisms
to do that that are in place,

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:43.837
and so he didn't do any of those things.

00:03:43.837 --> 00:03:46.827
CA: Now, you had said that

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:49.056
Ed Snowden had other avenues

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:51.751
for raising his concerns.

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:55.077
The comeback on that is a couple of things:

00:03:55.077 --> 00:03:58.887
one, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,

00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:02.648
the avenues that would have been available
to him as an employee weren't available,

00:04:02.648 --> 00:04:06.079
two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.690
like [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.837
pretty harshly, by some views,

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:13.490
and thirdly, what he was taking on

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.827
was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,

00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:18.798
but programs that had been approved

00:04:18.798 --> 00:04:21.739
by all three branches of government.

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.538
I mean, in that circumstance,

00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:26.941
couldn't you argue that what he did

00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:29.207
was reasonable?

00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:31.520
RL: No, I don't agree with that.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.257
I think that the —

00:04:35.257 --> 00:04:37.392
sorry, I'm getting feedback

00:04:37.392 --> 00:04:40.949
through the microphone there —

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.776
the actions that he took were inappropriate

00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:50.551
because of the fact that 
he put people's lives at risk,

00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:52.023
basically, in the long run,

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:53.587
and I know there's been a lot of talk

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:58.251
in public by Mr. Snowden
and some of the journalists

00:04:58.251 --> 00:05:01.681
that say that the things that have been disclosed

00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:05.876
have not put national security and people at risk,

00:05:05.876 --> 00:05:10.170
and that is categorically not true.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.077
They actually do.

00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:14.918
I think there's also an amazing arrogance

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:19.053
to the idea that he knows better than

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:22.348
the framers of the Constitution

00:05:22.348 --> 00:05:24.727
in how the government should 
be designed and work

00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:26.869
for separation of powers

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:33.316
and the fact that the executive 
and the legislative branch

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:35.927
have to work together and they have
checks and balances on each other,

00:05:35.927 --> 00:05:37.461
and then the judicial branch,

00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:38.897
which oversees the entire process.

00:05:38.897 --> 00:05:43.118
I think that's extremely arrogant on his part.

00:05:43.118 --> 00:05:45.424
CA: Can you give a specific example

00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:48.880
of how he put people's lives at risk?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.877
RL: Yeah, sure.

00:05:50.877 --> 00:05:54.271
So the things that he's disclosed,

00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:55.786
the capabilities,

00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:58.228
and the NSA is a capabilities-based organization,

00:05:58.228 --> 00:06:02.102
so when we have foreign intelligence targets,

00:06:02.102 --> 00:06:03.733
legitimate things of interest --

00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:05.743
like, terrorists is the iconic example,

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:08.837
but it includes things like human traffickers,

00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:10.699
drug traffickers,

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.663
people who are trying to build
advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,

00:06:14.663 --> 00:06:16.626
and build delivery systems for those,

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:20.257
and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,

00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:22.851
which you may have some visibility

00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:25.605
into some of that that's going on right now,

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:29.567
the capabilities are applied

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:34.568
in very discrete and measured and controlled ways.

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:37.356
So the unconstrained disclosure 
of those capabilities

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.640
means that as adversaries see them

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.003
and recognize, "Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,"

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:43.570
they move away from that,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.779
and we have seen targets in terrorism,

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.911
in the nation-state area,

00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.913
in smugglers of various types, and other folks

00:06:51.913 --> 00:06:53.866
who have, because of the disclosures,

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:56.801
moved away from our ability

00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:58.889
to have insight into what they're doing.

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.853
The net effect of that is that our people

00:07:01.853 --> 00:07:03.746
who are overseas in dangerous places,

00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.610
whether they're diplomats or military,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.201
and our allies who are in similar situations,

00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:11.060
are at greater risk because we don't see

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.011
the threats that are coming their way.

00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:16.070
CA: So that's a general response saying that

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.167
because of his revelations,

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:21.033
access that you had to certain types of information

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:24.604
has been shut down, has been closed down.

00:07:24.604 --> 00:07:28.153
But the concern is that the nature of that access

00:07:28.153 --> 00:07:31.857
was not necessarily legitimate in the first place.

00:07:31.857 --> 00:07:34.639
I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.768
where it's alleged that the NSA

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:39.153
specifically weakened security

00:07:39.153 --> 00:07:43.722
in order to get the type of 
access that you've spoken of.

00:07:43.722 --> 00:07:48.863
RL: So there are, when our

00:07:48.863 --> 00:07:51.575
legitimate foreign intelligence targets
of the type that I described before,

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:54.611
use the global telecommunications system

00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:56.694
as their communications methodology,

00:07:56.694 --> 00:07:58.108
and they do, because it's a great system,

00:07:58.108 --> 00:08:00.946
it's the most complex system ever devised by man,

00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:02.593
and it is a wonder,

00:08:02.593 --> 00:08:04.197
and lots of folks in the room there

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:06.548
are responsible for the creation

00:08:06.548 --> 00:08:07.917
and enhancement of that,

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:10.790
and it's just a wonderful thing.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.287
But it's also used by people who are

00:08:13.287 --> 00:08:15.318
working against us and our allies.

00:08:15.318 --> 00:08:17.749
And so if I'm going to pursue them,

00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:19.484
I need to have the capability

00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:21.659
to go after them,

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:24.485
and again, the controls are in

00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:27.006
how I apply that capability,

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.252
not that I have the capability itself.

00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:31.024
Otherwise, if we could make it so that

00:08:31.024 --> 00:08:33.210
all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.166
we could have a domain, badguy.com.

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:36.660
That would be awesome,

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.802
and we could just concentrate all our efforts there.

00:08:38.802 --> 00:08:40.134
That's not how it works.

00:08:40.134 --> 00:08:42.345
They're trying to hide

00:08:42.345 --> 00:08:44.150
from the government's ability

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.433
to isolate and interdict their actions,

00:08:47.433 --> 00:08:50.245
and so we have to swim in that same space.

00:08:50.245 --> 00:08:51.847
But I will tell you this.

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:53.326
So NSA has two missions.

00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:54.776
One is the Signals Intelligence mission

00:08:54.776 --> 00:08:58.403
that we've unfortunately read so
much about in the press.

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.141
The other one is the Information Assurance mission,

00:09:00.141 --> 00:09:03.052
which is to protect the national security
systems of the United States,

00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:05.020
and by that, that's things like

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.036
the communications that the president uses,

00:09:07.036 --> 00:09:09.641
the communications that
control our nuclear weapons,

00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:11.910
the communications that our
military uses around the world,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.401
and the communications that we use with our allies,

00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:16.125
and that some of our allies themselves use.

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:21.962
And so we make recommendations
on standards to use,

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:23.789
and we use those same standards,

00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:25.667
and so we are invested

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:27.912
in making sure that those communications

00:09:27.912 --> 00:09:31.525
are secure for their intended purposes.

00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:33.474
CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that

00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:37.219
when it comes to the Internet at large,

00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:39.846
any strategy is fair game

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:42.762
if it improves America's safety.

00:09:42.762 --> 00:09:44.820
And I think this is partly where there is such

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.205
a divide of opinion,

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:47.455
that there's a lot of people in this room

00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:48.828
and around the world

00:09:48.828 --> 00:09:50.478
who think very differently about the Internet.

00:09:50.478 --> 00:09:53.465
They think of it as a momentous

00:09:53.465 --> 00:09:55.063
invention of humanity,

00:09:55.063 --> 00:09:58.227
kind of on a par with the
Gutenberg press, for example.

00:09:58.227 --> 00:10:00.682
It's the bringer of knowledge to all.

00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:02.386
It's the connector of all.

00:10:02.386 --> 00:10:05.771
And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.344
And from that lens,

00:10:07.344 --> 00:10:09.941
what the NSA has done is equivalent to

00:10:09.941 --> 00:10:12.101
the authorities back in Germany

00:10:12.101 --> 00:10:14.970
inserting some device into every printing press

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.511
that would reveal which books people bought

00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:20.531
and what they read.

00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:22.762
Can you understand that from that viewpoint,

00:10:22.762 --> 00:10:26.967
it feels outrageous?

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:30.269
RL: I do understand that, and I actually share
the view of the utility of the Internet,

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:31.971
and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.

00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:34.382
It is a global telecommunications system.

00:10:34.382 --> 00:10:36.833
The Internet is a big chunk of 
that, but there is a lot more.

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:40.176
And I think that people have legitimate concerns

00:10:40.176 --> 00:10:46.482
about the balance between
transparency and secrecy.

00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:48.422
That's sort of been couched as a balance

00:10:48.422 --> 00:10:52.058
between privacy and national security.

00:10:52.058 --> 00:10:53.478
I don't think that's the right framing.

00:10:53.478 --> 00:10:55.843
I think it really is transparency and secrecy.

00:10:55.843 --> 00:10:59.402
And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,

00:10:59.402 --> 00:11:00.801
and we want to participate in that, and want

00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:03.241
people to participate in it in an informed way.

00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:05.152
So there are things,

00:11:05.152 --> 00:11:06.602
let me talk there a little bit more,

00:11:06.602 --> 00:11:10.371
there are things that we need
to be transparent about:

00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:12.398
our authorities, our processes,

00:11:12.398 --> 00:11:14.452
our oversight, who we are.

00:11:14.452 --> 00:11:16.218
We, NSA, have not done a good job of that,

00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.606
and I think that's part of the reason

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:20.335
that this has been so revelational

00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:22.531
and so sensational in the media.

00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:26.657
Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.

00:11:26.657 --> 00:11:29.306
There's takeoffs of our logo

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:32.325
of an eagle with headphones on around it.

00:11:32.325 --> 00:11:35.948
And so that's the public characterization.

00:11:35.948 --> 00:11:40.284
And so we need to be more
transparent about those things.

00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:41.702
What we don't need to be transparent about,

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:44.040
because it's bad for the U.S.,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.623
it's bad for all those other
countries that we work with

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.716
and that we help provide information

00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:50.438
that helps them secure themselves

00:11:50.438 --> 00:11:51.947
and their people,

00:11:51.947 --> 00:11:55.837
it's bad to expose operations and capabilities

00:11:55.837 --> 00:12:01.129
in a way that allows the people
that we're all working against,

00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:06.092
the generally recognized bad guys,

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:08.392
to counter those.

00:12:08.392 --> 00:12:11.417
CA: But isn't it also bad to deal

00:12:11.417 --> 00:12:14.821
a kind of body blow to the American companies

00:12:14.821 --> 00:12:16.717
that have essentially given the world

00:12:16.717 --> 00:12:21.897
most of the Internet services that matter?

00:12:21.897 --> 00:12:25.289
RL: It is. It's really the companies are

00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:28.677
in a tough position, as are we,

00:12:28.677 --> 00:12:30.618
because the companies,

00:12:30.618 --> 00:12:32.950
we compel them to provide information,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.933
just like every other nation in the world does.

00:12:34.933 --> 00:12:38.207
Every industrialized nation in the world

00:12:38.207 --> 00:12:40.307
has a lawful intercept program

00:12:40.307 --> 00:12:42.805
where they are requiring companies

00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:44.216
to provide them with information

00:12:44.216 --> 00:12:45.871
that they need for their security,

00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:48.098
and the companies that are involved

00:12:48.098 --> 00:12:49.526
have complied with those programs

00:12:49.526 --> 00:12:51.144
in the same way that they have to do

00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:54.594
when they're operating in Russia or the U.K.

00:12:54.594 --> 00:12:58.880
or China or India or France,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.898
any country that you choose to name.

00:13:00.898 --> 00:13:05.807
And so the fact that these revelations

00:13:05.807 --> 00:13:08.101
have been broadly characterized as

00:13:08.101 --> 00:13:09.991
"you can't trust company A because

00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:13.506
your privacy is suspect with them"

00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:17.547
is actually only accurate in the sense that

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:20.283
it's accurate with every other company in the world

00:13:20.283 --> 00:13:22.442
that deals with any of those countries in the world.

00:13:22.442 --> 00:13:24.570
And so it's being picked up by people

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.164
as a marketing advantage,

00:13:26.164 --> 00:13:27.937
and it's being marketed that 
way by several countries,

00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:29.448
including some of our allied countries,

00:13:29.448 --> 00:13:30.950
where they are saying,

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.479
"Hey, you can't trust the U.S.,

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.065
but you can trust our telecom company,

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.419
because we're safe."

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:38.078
And they're actually using that to counter

00:13:38.078 --> 00:13:40.396
the very large technological edge

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:42.205
that U.S. companies have

00:13:42.205 --> 00:13:46.111
in areas like the cloud and
Internet-based technologies.

00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:49.118
CA: You're sitting there with the American flag,

00:13:49.118 --> 00:13:52.688
and the American Constitution guarantees

00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:55.535
freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:57.496
How do you characterize

00:13:57.496 --> 00:14:01.976
the American citizen's right to privacy?

00:14:01.976 --> 00:14:04.257
Is there such a right?

00:14:04.257 --> 00:14:06.993
RL: Yeah, of course there is.

00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:10.036
And we devote an inordinate
amount of time and pressure,

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:12.320
inordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.528
amount of time and effort in order to ensure

00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:16.860
that we protect that privacy.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.917
and beyond that, the privacy of citizens

00:14:19.917 --> 00:14:23.566
around the world, it's not just Americans.

00:14:23.566 --> 00:14:25.466
Several things come into play here.

00:14:25.466 --> 00:14:27.214
First, we're all in the same network.

00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:28.788
My communications,

00:14:28.788 --> 00:14:32.935
I'm a user of a particular Internet email service

00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:36.906
that is the number one email service of choice

00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:38.499
by terrorists around the world, number one.

00:14:38.499 --> 00:14:41.224
So I'm there right beside them in email space

00:14:41.224 --> 00:14:43.113
in the Internet.

00:14:43.113 --> 00:14:46.705
And so we need to be able to pick that apart

00:14:46.705 --> 00:14:50.560
and find the information that's relevant.

00:14:53.131 --> 00:14:56.493
In doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter

00:14:56.493 --> 00:14:58.561
Americans and innocent foreign citizens

00:14:58.561 --> 00:15:00.107
who are just going about their business,

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:02.805
and so we have procedures in
place that shreds that out,

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.020
that says, when you find that,

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.287
not if you find it, when you find it,
because you're certain to find it,

00:15:07.287 --> 00:15:09.070
here's how you protect that.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.175
These are called minimization procedures.

00:15:11.175 --> 00:15:13.203
They're approved by the attorney general

00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:14.803
and constitutionally based.

00:15:14.803 --> 00:15:17.283
And so we protect those.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:21.754
And then, for people, citizens of the world

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.633
who are going about their lawful business

00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:25.340
on a day-to-day basis,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.636
the president on his January 17 speech,

00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:29.129
laid out some additional protections

00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:31.188
that we are providing to them.

00:15:31.188 --> 00:15:33.060
So I think absolutely,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.595
folks do have a right to privacy,

00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:37.214
and that we work very hard to make sure

00:15:37.214 --> 00:15:40.020
that that right to privacy is protected.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.756
CA: What about foreigners using

00:15:41.756 --> 00:15:43.906
American companies' Internet services?

00:15:43.906 --> 00:15:47.751
Do they have any privacy rights?

00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:50.424
RL: They do. They do, in the sense of,

00:15:50.424 --> 00:15:56.164
the only way that we are able to compel

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.490
one of those companies to provide us information

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.952
is when it falls into one of three categories:

00:16:01.952 --> 00:16:05.504
We can identify that this particular person,

00:16:05.504 --> 00:16:07.894
identified by a selector of some kind,

00:16:07.894 --> 00:16:11.250
is associated with counterterrorist

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:16.499
or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target.

00:16:16.499 --> 00:16:18.281
CA: Much has been made of the fact that

00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:20.747
a lot of the information that you've obtained

00:16:20.747 --> 00:16:23.023
through these programs is essentially metadata.

00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:25.318
It's not necessarily the actual words

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.971
that someone has written in an email

00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:28.320
or given on a phone call.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.369
It's who they wrote to and when, and so forth.

00:16:32.369 --> 00:16:33.905
But it's been argued,

00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:36.016
and someone here in the audience has talked

00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:38.483
to a former NSA analyst who said

00:16:38.483 --> 00:16:40.870
metadata is actually much more invasive

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.273
than the core data,

00:16:42.273 --> 00:16:43.406
because in the core data

00:16:43.406 --> 00:16:46.633
you present yourself as you want to be presented.

00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:49.339
With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are

00:16:49.339 --> 00:16:50.755
that are drawn?

00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:52.761
Is there anything to that?

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.550
RL: I don't really understand that argument.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.450
I think that metadata's important
for a couple of reasons.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.928
Metadata is the information that lets you

00:17:01.928 --> 00:17:05.319
find connections that people are trying to hide.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:07.330
So when a terrorist is corresponding

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.175
with somebody else who's not known to us

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:11.783
but is engaged in doing or
supporting terrorist activity,

00:17:11.783 --> 00:17:14.209
or someone who's violating international sanctions

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:17.286
by providing nuclear weapons-related material

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:19.612
to a country like Iran or North Korea,

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:23.189
is trying to hide that activity
because it's illicit activity.

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:25.999
What metadata lets you do is connect that.

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:27.531
The alternative to that

00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.150
is one that's much less efficient

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.531
and much more invasive of privacy,

00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:34.367
which is gigantic amounts of content collection.

00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:35.760
So metadata, in that sense,

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.156
actually is privacy-enhancing.

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:40.261
And we don't, contrary to some of the stuff

00:17:40.261 --> 00:17:41.976
that's been printed,

00:17:41.976 --> 00:17:44.745
we don't sit there and grind out

00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:47.582
metadata profiles of average people.

00:17:47.582 --> 00:17:49.538
If you're not connected

00:17:49.538 --> 00:17:52.590
to one of those valid intelligence targets,

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.003
you are not of interest to us.

00:17:56.003 --> 00:17:59.175
CA: So in terms of the threats

00:17:59.175 --> 00:18:01.487
that face America overall,

00:18:01.487 --> 00:18:04.699
where would you place terrorism?

00:18:04.699 --> 00:18:07.797
RL: I think terrorism is still number one.

00:18:07.797 --> 00:18:11.701
I think that we have never been in a time

00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:13.692
where there are more places

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:16.545
where things are going badly

00:18:16.545 --> 00:18:20.446
and forming the petri dish in which terrorists

00:18:20.446 --> 00:18:25.756
take advantage of the lack of governance.

00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:29.393
An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,

00:18:29.393 --> 00:18:31.606
used to describe it as arcs of instability.

00:18:31.606 --> 00:18:33.974
And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability

00:18:33.974 --> 00:18:35.667
in the world right now,

00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:37.504
in places like Syria, where there's a civil war

00:18:37.504 --> 00:18:40.214
going on and you have massive numbers,

00:18:40.214 --> 00:18:41.949
thousands and thousands of foreign fighters

00:18:41.949 --> 00:18:43.682
who are coming into Syria

00:18:43.682 --> 00:18:45.185
to learn how to be terrorists

00:18:45.185 --> 00:18:47.286
and practice that activity,

00:18:47.286 --> 00:18:49.985
and lots of those people are Westerners

00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:53.714
who hold passports to European countries

00:18:53.714 --> 00:18:55.466
or in some cases the United States,

00:18:55.466 --> 00:18:57.867
and so they are basically learning how

00:18:57.867 --> 00:19:01.347
to do jihad and have expressed intent

00:19:01.347 --> 00:19:03.760
to go out and do that later on

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.427
in their home countries.

00:19:05.427 --> 00:19:06.748
You've got places like Iraq,

00:19:06.748 --> 00:19:09.530
which is suffering from a high
level of sectarian violence,

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.181
again a breeding ground for terrorism.

00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:14.687
And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa

00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:17.734
and the Sahel area of Africa.

00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:20.262
Again, lots of weak governance

00:19:20.262 --> 00:19:24.153
which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.

00:19:24.153 --> 00:19:26.147
So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.

00:19:26.147 --> 00:19:28.401
I think number two is cyber threat.

00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:34.165
I think cyber is a threat in three ways:

00:19:34.165 --> 00:19:37.919
One way, and probably the most common way

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:40.111
that people have heard about it,

00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:42.111
is due to the theft of intellectual property,

00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:46.415
so basically, foreign countries going in,

00:19:46.415 --> 00:19:48.292
stealing companies' secrets,

00:19:48.292 --> 00:19:50.290
and then providing that information

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.027
to state-owned enterprises

00:19:52.027 --> 00:19:54.976
or companies connected to the government

00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:57.479
to help them leapfrog technology

00:19:57.479 --> 00:19:59.554
or to gain business intelligence

00:19:59.554 --> 00:20:02.222
that's then used to win contracts overseas.

00:20:02.222 --> 00:20:05.961
That is a hugely costly set of
activities that's going on right now.

00:20:05.961 --> 00:20:07.428
Several nation-states are doing it.

00:20:07.428 --> 00:20:10.653
Second is the denial-of-service attacks.

00:20:10.653 --> 00:20:12.032
You're probably aware that there have been

00:20:12.032 --> 00:20:14.003
a spate of those directed against

00:20:14.003 --> 00:20:17.591
the U.S. financial sector since 2012.

00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:20.208
Again, that's a nation-state who
is executing those attacks,

00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:21.281
and they're doing that

00:20:21.281 --> 00:20:26.034
as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.

00:20:26.034 --> 00:20:27.424
And the last one is destructive attacks,

00:20:27.424 --> 00:20:28.950
and those are the ones that concern me the most.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.350
Those are on the rise.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.980
You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.670
August of 2012.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.955
It took down about 35,000 of their computers

00:20:37.955 --> 00:20:39.747
with a Wiper-style virus.

00:20:39.747 --> 00:20:41.660
You had a follow-on a week later

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.194
to a Qatari company.

00:20:43.194 --> 00:20:45.335
You had March of 2013,

00:20:45.335 --> 00:20:48.006
you had a South Korean attack

00:20:48.006 --> 00:20:50.439
that was attributed in the press to North Korea

00:20:50.439 --> 00:20:52.494
that took out thousands of computers.

00:20:52.494 --> 00:20:53.939
Those are on the rise,

00:20:53.939 --> 00:20:56.673
and we see people expressing interest

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:57.849
in those capabilities

00:20:57.849 --> 00:20:59.866
and a desire to employ them.

00:20:59.866 --> 00:21:01.432
CA: Okay, so a couple of things here,

00:21:01.432 --> 00:21:03.374
because this is really the core of this, almost.

00:21:03.374 --> 00:21:04.638
I mean, first of all,

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.196
a lot of people who look at risk

00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:07.413
and look at the numbers

00:21:07.413 --> 00:21:09.673
don't understand this belief that terrorism

00:21:09.673 --> 00:21:11.557
is still the number one threat.

00:21:11.557 --> 00:21:13.185
Apart from September 11,

00:21:13.185 --> 00:21:15.540
I think the numbers are that
in the last 30 or 40 years

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.641
about 500 Americans have died from terrorism,

00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:22.624
mostly from homegrown terrorists.

00:21:22.624 --> 00:21:24.211
The chance in the last few years

00:21:24.211 --> 00:21:25.934
of being killed by terrorism

00:21:25.934 --> 00:21:29.918
is far less than the chance
of being killed by lightning.

00:21:29.918 --> 00:21:33.324
I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident

00:21:33.324 --> 00:21:36.650
or bioterrorism act or something like that

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.551
would change those numbers.

00:21:38.551 --> 00:21:40.713
Would that be the point of view?

00:21:40.713 --> 00:21:41.889
RL: Well, I'd say two things.

00:21:41.889 --> 00:21:43.815
One is, the reason that there hasn't been

00:21:43.815 --> 00:21:45.625
a major attack in the United States since 9/11,

00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:47.181
that is not an accident.

00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:49.367
That's a lot of hard work that we have done,

00:21:49.367 --> 00:21:50.748
that other folks

00:21:50.748 --> 00:21:52.131
in the intelligence community have done,

00:21:52.131 --> 00:21:53.312
that the military has done,

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.360
and that our allies around the globe have done.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.811
You've heard the numbers about

00:21:57.811 --> 00:22:00.343
the tip of the iceberg in terms

00:22:00.343 --> 00:22:02.913
of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs

00:22:02.913 --> 00:22:05.672
contributed to stopping was 54,

00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:07.494
25 of those in Europe,

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:09.624
and of those 25,

00:22:09.624 --> 00:22:12.229
18 of them occurred in three countries,

00:22:12.229 --> 00:22:14.092
some of which are our allies,

00:22:14.092 --> 00:22:16.291
and some of which are beating the heck out of us

00:22:16.291 --> 00:22:20.768
over the NSA programs, by the way.

00:22:20.768 --> 00:22:23.460
So that's not an accident that those things happen.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.785
That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence

00:22:25.785 --> 00:22:27.615
on terrorist activities

00:22:27.615 --> 00:22:29.189
and interdicting them through one way or another,

00:22:29.189 --> 00:22:30.520
through law enforcement,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.350
through cooperative activities with other countries

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.466
and sometimes through military action.

00:22:36.466 --> 00:22:39.359
The other thing I would say is that

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:44.625
your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat

00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:46.141
is not at all far-fetched

00:22:46.141 --> 00:22:47.879
and in fact there are a number of groups

00:22:47.879 --> 00:22:49.766
who have for several years expressed interest

00:22:49.766 --> 00:22:52.306
and desire in obtaining those capabilities

00:22:52.306 --> 00:22:54.066
and work towards that.

00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:55.642
CA: It's also been said that,

00:22:55.642 --> 00:22:58.342
of those 54 alleged incidents,

00:22:58.342 --> 00:23:00.190
that as few as zero of them

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.252
were actually anything to do

00:23:01.252 --> 00:23:03.099
with these controversial programs

00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:06.831
that Mr. Snowden revealed,

00:23:06.831 --> 00:23:10.748
that it was basically through
other forms of intelligence,

00:23:10.748 --> 00:23:13.638
that you're looking for a needle in a haystack,

00:23:13.638 --> 00:23:15.200
and the effects of these programs,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.231
these controversial programs,

00:23:16.231 --> 00:23:18.303
is just to add hay to the stack,

00:23:18.303 --> 00:23:19.883
not to really find the needle.

00:23:19.883 --> 00:23:21.965
The needle was found by other methods.

00:23:21.965 --> 00:23:26.089
Isn't there something to that?

00:23:26.089 --> 00:23:28.497
RL: No, there's actually two programs

00:23:28.497 --> 00:23:30.914
that are typically implicated in that discussion.

00:23:30.914 --> 00:23:33.392
One is the section 215 program,

00:23:33.392 --> 00:23:36.370
the U.S. telephony metadata program,

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.410
and the other one is

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.004
popularly called the PRISM program,

00:23:40.004 --> 00:23:43.252
and it's actually section 702 
of the FISA Amendment Act.

00:23:43.252 --> 00:23:47.442
But the 215 program

00:23:47.442 --> 00:23:49.169
is only relevant to threats

00:23:49.169 --> 00:23:51.428
that are directed against the United States,

00:23:51.428 --> 00:23:54.328
and there have been a dozen threats

00:23:54.328 --> 00:23:55.643
where that was implicated.

00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:58.832
Now what you'll see people say publicly

00:23:58.832 --> 00:24:00.868
is there is no "but for" case,

00:24:00.868 --> 00:24:04.681
and so there is no case where, but for that,

00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:06.382
the threat would have happened.

00:24:06.382 --> 00:24:10.589
But that actually indicates a lack of understanding

00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:15.706
of how terrorist investigations actually work.

00:24:15.706 --> 00:24:17.184
You think about on television,

00:24:17.184 --> 00:24:18.516
you watch a murder mystery.

00:24:18.516 --> 00:24:20.046
What do you start with? You start with a body,

00:24:20.046 --> 00:24:22.282
and then they work their way
from there to solve the crime.

00:24:22.282 --> 00:24:23.813
We're actually starting well before that,

00:24:23.813 --> 00:24:25.314
hopefully before there are any bodies,

00:24:25.314 --> 00:24:27.747
and we're trying to build the case for

00:24:27.747 --> 00:24:30.177
who the people are, what they're trying to do,

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:33.027
and that involves massive amounts of information.

00:24:33.027 --> 00:24:34.508
Think of it is as mosaic,

00:24:34.508 --> 00:24:36.670
and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.302
was necessary to building the mosaic,

00:24:39.302 --> 00:24:41.031
but to build the complete picture,

00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:42.996
you need to have all the pieces of information.

00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:46.101
On the other, the non-U.S.-related
threats out of those 54,

00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:49.290
the other 42 of them,

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:53.920
the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.906
and in fact was material in contributing

00:24:56.906 --> 00:24:58.788
to stopping those attacks.

00:24:58.788 --> 00:25:00.125
CA: Snowden said two days ago

00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:03.495
that terrorism has always been

00:25:03.495 --> 00:25:05.623
what is called in the intelligence world

00:25:05.623 --> 00:25:07.169
"a cover for action,"

00:25:07.169 --> 00:25:09.106
that it's something that,

00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:10.822
because it invokes such a powerful

00:25:10.822 --> 00:25:12.661
emotional response in people,

00:25:12.661 --> 00:25:15.295
it allows the initiation of these programs

00:25:15.295 --> 00:25:18.856
to achieve powers that an organization like yours

00:25:18.856 --> 00:25:20.423
couldn't otherwise have.

00:25:20.423 --> 00:25:23.875
Is there any internal debate about that?

00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:25.287
RL: Yeah.

00:25:25.287 --> 00:25:27.287
I mean, we debate these things all the time,

00:25:27.287 --> 00:25:30.046
and there is discussion that goes on

00:25:30.046 --> 00:25:31.967
in the executive branch

00:25:31.967 --> 00:25:34.030
and within NSA itself

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.685
and the intelligence community about

00:25:35.685 --> 00:25:37.045
what's right, what's proportionate,

00:25:37.045 --> 00:25:38.306
what's the correct thing to do.

00:25:38.306 --> 00:25:39.884
And it's important to note that the programs

00:25:39.884 --> 00:25:41.231
that we're talking about

00:25:41.231 --> 00:25:44.633
were all authorized by two different presidents,

00:25:44.633 --> 00:25:46.378
two different political parties,

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:48.513
by Congress twice,

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:52.349
and by federal judges 16 different times,

00:25:52.349 --> 00:25:57.061
and so this is not NSA running off

00:25:57.061 --> 00:25:58.524
and doing its own thing.

00:25:58.524 --> 00:26:00.972
This is a legitimate activity

00:26:00.972 --> 00:26:03.490
of the United States foreign government

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.665
that was agreed to by all the branches

00:26:05.665 --> 00:26:07.649
of the United States government,

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:10.698
and President Madison would have been proud.

00:26:10.698 --> 00:26:14.787
CA: And yet, when congressmen discovered

00:26:14.787 --> 00:26:17.017
what was actually being done 
with that authorization,

00:26:17.017 --> 00:26:19.886
many of them were completely shocked.

00:26:19.886 --> 00:26:23.232
Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,

00:26:23.232 --> 00:26:25.337
that it's only because it's now come out publicly,

00:26:25.337 --> 00:26:28.439
that they really knew exactly what you were doing

00:26:28.439 --> 00:26:30.775
with the powers they had granted you?

00:26:30.775 --> 00:26:32.449
RL: Congress is a big body.

00:26:32.449 --> 00:26:34.426
There's 535 of them,

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:36.567
and they change out frequently,

00:26:36.567 --> 00:26:38.425
in the case of the House, every two years,

00:26:38.425 --> 00:26:42.201
and I think that the NSA provided

00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:45.338
all the relevant information
to our oversight committees,

00:26:45.338 --> 00:26:47.616
and then the dissemination of that information

00:26:47.616 --> 00:26:49.515
by the oversight committees throughout Congress

00:26:49.515 --> 00:26:52.149
is something that they manage.

00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:57.005
I think I would say that Congress members

00:26:57.005 --> 00:27:00.836
had the opportunity to make themselves aware,

00:27:00.836 --> 00:27:02.705
and in fact a significant number of them,

00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:06.163
the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility,

00:27:06.163 --> 00:27:07.337
did have the ability to do that.

00:27:07.337 --> 00:27:11.275
And you've actually had the chairs of
those committees say that in public.

00:27:11.275 --> 00:27:12.832
CA: Now, you mentioned the 
threat of cyberattacks,

00:27:12.832 --> 00:27:14.999
and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree

00:27:14.999 --> 00:27:16.889
that that is a huge concern,

00:27:16.889 --> 00:27:18.723
but do you accept that there's a tradeoff

00:27:18.723 --> 00:27:21.134
between offensive and defensive strategies,

00:27:21.134 --> 00:27:23.959
and that it's possible that the very measures taken

00:27:23.959 --> 00:27:26.628
to, "weaken encryption,"

00:27:26.628 --> 00:27:28.781
and allow yourself to find the bad guys,

00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:33.054
might also open the door to forms of cyberattack?

00:27:33.054 --> 00:27:35.897
RL: So I think two things.

00:27:35.897 --> 00:27:39.744
One is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't.

00:27:39.744 --> 00:27:44.870
And the other one is that

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.646
the NSA has both of those missions,

00:27:47.646 --> 00:27:49.927
and we are heavily biased towards defense,

00:27:49.927 --> 00:27:53.444
and, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find

00:27:53.444 --> 00:27:55.545
in the overwhelming majority of cases,

00:27:55.545 --> 00:27:58.318
we disclose to the people who are responsible

00:27:58.318 --> 00:28:01.681
for manufacturing or developing those products.

00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:03.064
We have a great track record of that,

00:28:03.064 --> 00:28:05.050
and we're actually working on a proposal right now

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.220
to be transparent and to
publish transparency reports

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.106
in the same way that the Internet companies

00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:14.973
are being allowed to publish
transparency reports for them.

00:28:14.973 --> 00:28:16.971
We want to be more transparent about that.

00:28:16.971 --> 00:28:20.100
So again, we eat our own dog food.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.353
We use the standards, we use the products

00:28:22.353 --> 00:28:25.008
that we recommend,

00:28:25.008 --> 00:28:27.303
and so it's in our interest

00:28:27.303 --> 00:28:29.941
to keep our communications protected

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:33.745
in the same way that other people's need to be.

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:36.935
CA: Edward Snowden,

00:28:36.935 --> 00:28:41.363
when, after his talk, was wandering the halls here

00:28:41.363 --> 00:28:42.608
in the bot,

00:28:42.608 --> 00:28:44.796
and I heard him say to a couple of people,

00:28:44.796 --> 00:28:46.413
they asked him about what he thought

00:28:46.413 --> 00:28:48.006
of the NSA overall,

00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:50.779
and he was very complimentary about the people

00:28:50.779 --> 00:28:52.800
who work with you,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.723
said that it's a really

00:28:56.723 --> 00:28:58.683
impassioned group of employees

00:28:58.683 --> 00:29:01.132
who are seeking to do the right thing,

00:29:01.132 --> 00:29:04.086
and that the problems have come from

00:29:04.086 --> 00:29:07.205
just some badly conceived policies.

00:29:07.205 --> 00:29:11.650
He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.825
He didn't come over like a crazy man.

00:29:13.825 --> 00:29:15.795
Would you accept that at least,

00:29:15.795 --> 00:29:18.811
even if you disagree with how he did it,

00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:22.835
that he has opened a debate that matters?

00:29:22.835 --> 00:29:25.233
RL: So I think that the discussion

00:29:25.233 --> 00:29:27.097
is an important one to have.

00:29:27.097 --> 00:29:30.473
I do not like the way that he did it.

00:29:30.473 --> 00:29:32.478
I think there were a number of other ways

00:29:32.478 --> 00:29:33.940
that he could have done that

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.236
that would have not endangered our people

00:29:37.236 --> 00:29:39.884
and the people of other nations

00:29:39.884 --> 00:29:41.995
through losing visibility

00:29:41.995 --> 00:29:44.726
into what our adversaries are doing.

00:29:44.726 --> 00:29:47.412
But I do think it's an important conversation.

00:29:47.412 --> 00:29:48.951
CA: It's been reported that there's

00:29:48.951 --> 00:29:51.060
almost a difference of opinion

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.531
with you and your colleagues

00:29:52.531 --> 00:29:54.584
over any scenario in which

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:57.187
he might be offered an amnesty deal.

00:29:57.187 --> 00:29:59.898
I think your boss, General Keith Alexander,

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.884
has said that that would be a terrible example

00:30:01.884 --> 00:30:03.349
for others;

00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:05.006
you can't negotiate with someone

00:30:05.006 --> 00:30:07.014
who's broken the law in that way.

00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:09.023
But you've been quoted as saying that,

00:30:09.023 --> 00:30:12.231
if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering

00:30:12.231 --> 00:30:14.027
all undisclosed documents,

00:30:14.027 --> 00:30:16.266
that a deal maybe should be considered.

00:30:16.266 --> 00:30:19.236
Do you still think that?

00:30:19.236 --> 00:30:20.754
RL: Yeah, so actually,

00:30:20.754 --> 00:30:23.337
this is my favorite thing about
that "60 Minutes" interview

00:30:23.337 --> 00:30:25.049
was all the misquotes that came from that.

00:30:25.049 --> 00:30:27.964
What I actually said, in 
response to a question about,

00:30:27.964 --> 00:30:29.776
would you entertain any discussions

00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:36.161
of mitigating action against Snowden,

00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:37.993
I said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.

00:30:37.993 --> 00:30:39.628
This is something that the attorney general

00:30:39.628 --> 00:30:41.558
of the United States and the president also

00:30:41.558 --> 00:30:43.096
actually have both talked about this,

00:30:43.096 --> 00:30:44.465
and I defer to the attorney general,

00:30:44.465 --> 00:30:46.012
because this is his lane.

00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:48.521
But there is a strong tradition

00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:51.713
in American jurisprudence

00:30:51.713 --> 00:30:56.288
of having discussions with people

00:30:56.288 --> 00:30:58.132
who have been charged with crimes in order to,

00:30:58.132 --> 00:30:59.648
if it benefits the government,

00:30:59.648 --> 00:31:02.026
to get something out of that,

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:04.660
that there's always room for that kind of discussion.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.349
So I'm not presupposing any outcome,

00:31:06.349 --> 00:31:10.085
but there is always room for discussion.

00:31:10.085 --> 00:31:11.685
CA: To a lay person it seems like

00:31:11.685 --> 00:31:15.053
he has certain things to offer the U.S.,

00:31:15.053 --> 00:31:16.792
the government, you, others,

00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:18.473
in terms of putting things right

00:31:18.473 --> 00:31:20.531
and helping figure out a smarter policy,

00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:25.737
a smarter way forward for the future.

00:31:26.988 --> 00:31:29.061
Do you see, has that kind of possibility

00:31:29.061 --> 00:31:31.459
been entertained at all?

00:31:31.459 --> 00:31:33.097
RL: So that's out of my lane.

00:31:33.097 --> 00:31:34.626
That's not an NSA thing.

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:36.833
That would be a Department of Justice

00:31:36.833 --> 00:31:39.330
sort of discussion.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.626
I'll defer to them.

00:31:42.626 --> 00:31:45.591
CA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk,

00:31:45.591 --> 00:31:49.336
I offered him the chance to
share an idea worth spreading.

00:31:49.336 --> 00:31:50.989
What would be your idea worth spreading

00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:53.271
for this group?

00:31:53.271 --> 00:31:55.263
RL: So I think, learn the facts.

00:31:55.263 --> 00:31:57.879
This is a really important conversation,

00:31:57.879 --> 00:31:59.955
and it impacts, it's not just NSA,

00:31:59.955 --> 00:32:01.153
it's not just the government,

00:32:01.153 --> 00:32:04.061
it's you, it's the Internet companies.

00:32:04.061 --> 00:32:07.179
The issue of privacy and personal data

00:32:07.179 --> 00:32:08.756
is much bigger than just the government,

00:32:08.756 --> 00:32:10.667
and so learn the facts.

00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:12.263
Don't rely on headlines,

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:13.939
don't rely on sound bites,

00:32:13.939 --> 00:32:16.419
don't rely on one-sided conversations.

00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:19.568
So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.

00:32:19.568 --> 00:32:22.961
We have a sign, a badge tab,

00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:24.850
we wear badges at work with lanyards,

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.263
and if I could make a plug,

00:32:26.263 --> 00:32:29.010
my badge lanyard at work says, "Dallas Cowboys."

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.507
Go Dallas.

00:32:32.507 --> 00:32:35.173
I've just alienated half the audience, I know.

00:32:35.173 --> 00:32:39.069
So the lanyard that our people

00:32:39.069 --> 00:32:40.854
who work in the organization

00:32:40.854 --> 00:32:43.274
that does our crypto-analytic work

00:32:43.274 --> 00:32:45.215
have a tab that says, "Look at the data."

00:32:45.215 --> 00:32:46.751
So that's the idea worth spreading.

00:32:46.751 --> 00:32:49.000
Look at the data.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.992
CA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage,

00:32:51.992 --> 00:32:54.607
I think, actually, to come and speak openly

00:32:54.607 --> 00:32:55.861
to this group.

00:32:55.861 --> 00:32:58.528
It's not something the NSA
has done a lot of in the past,

00:32:58.528 --> 00:33:01.623
and plus the technology has been challenging.

00:33:01.623 --> 00:33:03.404
We truly appreciate you doing that

00:33:03.404 --> 00:33:05.817
and sharing in this very important conversation.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.958
Thank you so much.

00:33:07.958 --> 00:33:09.897
RL: Thanks, Chris.

00:33:09.897 --> 00:33:16.968
(Applause)
