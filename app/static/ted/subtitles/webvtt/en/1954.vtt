00:00:01.228 --> 00:00:05.262
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,

00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:10.487
fathers are usually known by their sons,

00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:13.703
but I'm one of the few fathers

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:15.747
who is known by his daughter,

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:17.373
and I am proud of it.

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:21.542
(Applause)

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.658
Malala started her campaign for education

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:29.545
and stood for her rights in 2007,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:34.103
and when her efforts were honored in 2011,

00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:37.543
and she was given the national youth peace prize,

00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:39.412
and she became a very famous,

00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:43.456
very popular young girl of her country.

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:46.784
Before that, she was my daughter,

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:49.789
but now I am her father.

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:52.496
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:52.496 --> 00:00:55.643
if we glance to human history,

00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:58.471
the story of women

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:01.847
is the story of injustice,

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:03.907
inequality,

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:09.218
violence and exploitation.

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:11.053
You see,

00:01:11.053 --> 00:01:15.204
in patriarchal societies,

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:17.646
right from the very beginning,

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:20.652
when a girl is born,

00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:24.932
her birth is not celebrated.

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:27.096
She is not welcomed,

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:29.872
neither by father nor by mother.

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:31.557
The neighborhood comes

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:34.058
and commiserates with the mother,

00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:39.152
and nobody congratulates the father.

00:01:39.152 --> 00:01:43.467
And a mother is very uncomfortable

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:47.834
for having a girl child.

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:51.094
When she gives birth to the first girl child,

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:55.183
first daughter, she is sad.

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:58.930
When she gives birth to the second daughter,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.777
she is shocked,

00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:04.161
and in the expectation of a son,

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.367
when she gives birth to a third daughter,

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:12.906
she feels guilty like a criminal.

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:15.540
Not only the mother suffers,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.277
but the daughter, the newly born daughter,

00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:20.412
when she grows old,

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:22.547
she suffers too.

00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:24.600
At the age of five,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.929
while she should be going to school,

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.672
she stays at home

00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:34.294
and her brothers are admitted in a school.

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:36.887
Until the age of 12, somehow,

00:02:36.887 --> 00:02:39.528
she has a good life.

00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:41.199
She can have fun.

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.388
She can play with her friends in the streets,

00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:46.427
and she can move around in the streets

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:49.202
like a butterfly.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:53.017
But when she enters her teens,

00:02:53.017 --> 00:02:55.357
when she becomes 13 years old,

00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:58.976
she is forbidden to go out of her home

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:02.468
without a male escort.

00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:07.843
She is confined under the four walls of her home.

00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:13.037
She is no more a free individual.

00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:16.057
She becomes the so-called honor

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:18.538
of her father and of her brothers

00:03:18.538 --> 00:03:21.988
and of her family,

00:03:21.988 --> 00:03:24.676
and if she transgresses

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:27.887
the code of that so-called honor,

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:32.251
she could even be killed.

00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:36.252
And it is also interesting that this so-called

00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:37.615
code of honor,

00:03:37.615 --> 00:03:41.305
it does not only affect the life of a girl,

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:43.431
it also affects the life

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:48.230
of the male members of the family.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.823
I know a family of seven sisters and one brother,

00:03:54.823 --> 00:03:56.645
and that one brother,

00:03:56.645 --> 00:04:00.149
he has migrated to the Gulf countries,

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.844
to earn a living for his seven sisters

00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:05.192
and parents,

00:04:05.192 --> 00:04:11.046
because he thinks that it will be humiliating

00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:13.768
if his seven sisters learn a skill

00:04:13.768 --> 00:04:16.148
and they go out of the home

00:04:16.148 --> 00:04:20.299
and earn some livelihood.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.889
So this brother,

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.242
he sacrifices the joys of his life

00:04:25.242 --> 00:04:28.634
and the happiness of his sisters

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:33.218
at the altar of so-called honor.

00:04:33.218 --> 00:04:34.752
And there is one more norm

00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:37.110
of the patriarchal societies

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.560
that is called obedience.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.346
A good girl is supposed to be

00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:50.594
very quiet, very humble

00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:54.565
and very submissive.

00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:55.904
It is the criteria.

00:04:55.904 --> 00:04:59.736
The role model good girl should be very quiet.

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:02.025
She is supposed to be silent

00:05:02.025 --> 00:05:05.196
and she is supposed to accept the decisions

00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:07.416
of her father and mother

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:10.641
and the decisions of elders,

00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:13.047
even if she does not like them.

00:05:13.047 --> 00:05:16.376
If she is married to a man she doesn't like

00:05:16.376 --> 00:05:19.118
or if she is married to an old man,

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.678
she has to accept,

00:05:20.678 --> 00:05:23.196
because she does not want to be dubbed

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:25.819
as disobedient.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.451
If she is married very early,

00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:28.925
she has to accept.

00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:32.947
Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.

00:05:32.947 --> 00:05:35.750
And what happens at the end?

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.505
In the words of a poetess,

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:40.292
she is wedded, bedded,

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:45.463
and then she gives birth
to more sons and daughters.

00:05:45.463 --> 00:05:48.232
And it is the irony of the situation

00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:50.564
that this mother,

00:05:50.564 --> 00:05:53.616
she teaches the same lesson of obedience

00:05:53.616 --> 00:05:54.676
to her daughter

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:59.109
and the same lesson of honor to her sons.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:04.222
And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.

00:06:05.997 --> 00:06:08.524
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:08.524 --> 00:06:11.746
this plight of millions of women

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.578
could be changed

00:06:14.578 --> 00:06:16.953
if we think differently,

00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:20.934
if women and men think differently,

00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:25.152
if men and women in the
tribal and patriarchal societies

00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:27.135
in the developing countries,

00:06:27.135 --> 00:06:30.046
if they can break a few norms

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:34.650
of family and society,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.130
if they can abolish the discriminatory laws

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.658
of the systems in their states,

00:06:42.658 --> 00:06:44.949
which go against the basic human rights

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:48.743
of the women.

00:06:48.743 --> 00:06:53.987
Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,

00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:56.140
and for the first time,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.414
believe me,

00:06:57.414 --> 00:07:02.391
I don't like newborn children, to be honest,

00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:06.173
but when I went and I looked into her eyes,

00:07:06.173 --> 00:07:08.293
believe me,

00:07:08.293 --> 00:07:12.274
I got extremely honored.

00:07:12.274 --> 00:07:14.444
And long before she was born,

00:07:14.444 --> 00:07:17.480
I thought about her name,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.765
and I was fascinated with a heroic

00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:24.630
legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.639
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand,

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:33.924
and I named my daughter after her.

00:07:33.924 --> 00:07:36.916
A few days after Malala was born,

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:38.655
my daughter was born,

00:07:38.655 --> 00:07:40.313
my cousin came --

00:07:40.313 --> 00:07:42.281
and it was a coincidence --

00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:44.996
he came to my home

00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:47.701
and he brought a family tree,

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:51.369
a family tree of the Yousafzai family,

00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:53.925
and when I looked at the family tree,

00:07:53.925 --> 00:07:59.978
it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.

00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:04.375
But when I looked, all were men,

00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:06.797
and I picked my pen,

00:08:06.797 --> 00:08:08.801
drew a line from my name,

00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:12.500
and wrote, "Malala."

00:08:13.585 --> 00:08:16.355
And when she grow old,

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:19.938
when she was four and a half years old,

00:08:19.938 --> 00:08:23.474
I admitted her in my school.

00:08:23.474 --> 00:08:26.380
You will be asking, then, why should I mention about

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.882
the admission of a girl in a school?

00:08:28.882 --> 00:08:30.937
Yes, I must mention it.

00:08:30.937 --> 00:08:34.022
It may be taken for granted in Canada,

00:08:34.022 --> 00:08:37.849
in America, in many developed countries,

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:40.307
but in poor countries,

00:08:40.307 --> 00:08:43.875
in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:47.489
it's a big event for the life of girl.

00:08:47.489 --> 00:08:51.128
Enrollment in a school means

00:08:51.128 --> 00:08:56.877
recognition of her identity and her name.

00:08:56.877 --> 00:08:58.555
Admission in a school means

00:08:58.555 --> 00:09:02.237
that she has entered the world of dreams

00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:03.900
and aspirations

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.412
where she can explore her potentials

00:09:07.412 --> 00:09:10.658
for her future life.

00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:12.737
I have five sisters,

00:09:12.737 --> 00:09:16.051
and none of them could go to school,

00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:17.625
and you will be astonished,

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:21.719
two weeks before,

00:09:21.735 --> 00:09:26.018
when I was filling out the Canadian visa form,

00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:30.683
and I was filling out the family part of the form,

00:09:30.683 --> 00:09:32.767
I could not recall

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:36.772
the surnames of some of my sisters.

00:09:36.772 --> 00:09:38.621
And the reason was

00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:41.913
that I have never, never seen the names

00:09:41.913 --> 00:09:47.739
of my sisters written on any document.

00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:50.679
That was the reason that

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:54.212
I valued my daughter.

00:09:54.212 --> 00:09:58.525
What my father could not give to my sisters

00:09:58.525 --> 00:10:00.280
and to his daughters,

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.521
I thought I must change it.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:07.528
I used to appreciate the intelligence

00:10:07.528 --> 00:10:11.200
and the brilliance of my daughter.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.794
I encouraged her to sit with me

00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:15.453
when my friends used to come.

00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:20.237
I encouraged her to go with
me to different meetings.

00:10:20.237 --> 00:10:21.898
And all these good values,

00:10:21.898 --> 00:10:25.108
I tried to inculcate in her personality.

00:10:25.108 --> 00:10:28.771
And this was not only she, only Malala.

00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:31.507
I imparted all these good values

00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:36.050
to my school, girl students 
and boy students as well.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.429
I used education for emancipation.

00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:42.294
I taught my girls,

00:10:42.294 --> 00:10:44.249
I taught my girl students,

00:10:44.249 --> 00:10:49.318
to unlearn the lesson of obedience.

00:10:49.318 --> 00:10:52.283
I taught my boy students

00:10:52.283 --> 00:10:57.764
to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.

00:11:01.696 --> 00:11:05.681
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:10.264
we were striving for more rights for women,

00:11:10.264 --> 00:11:13.886
and we were struggling to have more,

00:11:13.886 --> 00:11:18.113
more and more space for the women in society.

00:11:18.113 --> 00:11:21.326
But we came across a new phenomenon.

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:23.819
It was lethal to human rights

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:27.267
and particularly to women's rights.

00:11:27.267 --> 00:11:31.944
It was called Talibanization.

00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:35.632
It means a complete negation

00:11:35.632 --> 00:11:37.842
of women's participation

00:11:37.842 --> 00:11:44.037
in all political, economical and social activities.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.584
Hundreds of schools were lost.

00:11:47.584 --> 00:11:53.815
Girls were prohibited from going to school.

00:11:53.815 --> 00:11:57.521
Women were forced to wear veils

00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:01.077
and they were stopped from going to the markets.

00:12:01.077 --> 00:12:03.661
Musicians were silenced,

00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:05.618
girls were flogged

00:12:05.618 --> 00:12:09.101
and singers were killed.

00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:10.975
Millions were suffering,

00:12:10.975 --> 00:12:14.220
but few spoke,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.444
and it was the most scary thing

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:22.530
when you have all around such people

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.556
who kill and who flog,

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:25.852
and you speak for your rights.

00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:30.059
It's really the most scary thing.

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:31.952
At the age of 10,

00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:36.196
Malala stood, and she stood for the right

00:12:36.196 --> 00:12:38.507
of education.

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:43.279
She wrote a diary for the BBC blog,

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.483
she volunteered herself

00:12:45.483 --> 00:12:49.077
for the New York Times documentaries,

00:12:49.077 --> 00:12:53.993
and she spoke from every platform she could.

00:12:53.993 --> 00:12:58.381
And her voice was the most powerful voice.

00:12:58.381 --> 00:13:04.634
It spread like a crescendo all around the world.

00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:06.486
And that was the reason the Taliban

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:10.817
could not tolerate her campaign,

00:13:10.817 --> 00:13:13.666
and on October 9 2012,

00:13:13.666 --> 00:13:19.415
she was shot in the head at point blank range.

00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:23.560
It was a doomsday for my family and for me.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.379
The world turned into a big black hole.

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:31.045
While my daughter was

00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:34.497
on the verge of life and death,

00:13:34.497 --> 00:13:38.336
I whispered into the ears of my wife,

00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:41.438
"Should I be blamed for what happened

00:13:41.438 --> 00:13:45.114
to my daughter and your daughter?"

00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:47.635
And she abruptly told me,

00:13:47.635 --> 00:13:50.146
"Please don't blame yourself.

00:13:50.146 --> 00:13:53.362
You stood for the right cause.

00:13:53.362 --> 00:13:55.497
You put your life at stake

00:13:55.497 --> 00:13:56.900
for the cause of truth,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.081
for the cause of peace,

00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:00.189
and for the cause of education,

00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:02.238
and your daughter in inspired from you

00:14:02.238 --> 00:14:04.469
and she joined you.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.144
You both were on the right path

00:14:06.144 --> 00:14:09.517
and God will protect her."

00:14:09.517 --> 00:14:12.863
These few words meant a lot to me,

00:14:12.863 --> 00:14:16.974
and I didn't ask this question again.

00:14:16.974 --> 00:14:21.094
When Malala was in the hospital,

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:24.341
and she was going through the severe pains

00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:26.861
and she had had severe headaches

00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:30.049
because her facial nerve was cut down,

00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:32.501
I used to see a dark shadow

00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:38.038
spreading on the face of my wife.

00:14:38.038 --> 00:14:44.139
But my daughter never complained.

00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:46.200
She used to tell us,

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.251
"I'm fine with my crooked smile

00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:50.993
and with my numbness in my face.

00:14:50.993 --> 00:14:53.072
I'll be okay. Please don't worry."

00:14:53.072 --> 00:14:55.201
She was a solace for us,

00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:58.098
and she consoled us.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.341
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:06.963
we learned from her how to be resilient

00:15:06.963 --> 00:15:10.268
in the most difficult times,

00:15:10.268 --> 00:15:13.276
and I'm glad to share with you

00:15:13.276 --> 00:15:19.168
that despite being an icon

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.997
for the rights of children and women,

00:15:21.997 --> 00:15:27.290
she is like any 16-year old girl.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:32.422
She cries when her homework is incomplete.

00:15:32.422 --> 00:15:34.490
She quarrels with her brothers,

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.213
and I am very happy for that.

00:15:38.213 --> 00:15:40.616
People ask me,

00:15:40.616 --> 00:15:44.108
what special is in my mentorship

00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:46.648
which has made Malala so bold

00:15:46.648 --> 00:15:51.140
and so courageous and so vocal and poised?

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:57.415
I tell them, don't ask me what I did.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:01.276
Ask me what I did not do.

00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:06.533
I did not clip her wings, and that's all.

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:09.415
Thank you very much.

00:16:09.415 --> 00:16:14.911
(Applause)

00:16:14.911 --> 00:16:18.911
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)
