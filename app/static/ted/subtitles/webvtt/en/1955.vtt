00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:03.196
A herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,

00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:04.825
a flock of birds.

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:06.893
Many animals gather in large groups

00:00:06.893 --> 00:00:08.879
that are among the most wonderful spectacles

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.597
in the natural world.

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:13.321
But why do these groups form?

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:14.958
The common answers include things like

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.924
seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:20.420
or gathering to mate or breed,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.088
and all of these explanations,

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.325
while often true,

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:26.368
make a huge assumption about animal behavior,

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:29.545
that the animals are in control of their own actions,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.796
that they are in charge of their bodies.

00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:35.223
And that is often not the case.

00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:38.147
This is Artemia, a brine shrimp.

00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:40.911
You probably know it better as a sea monkey.

00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:42.906
It's small, and it typically lives alone,

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:45.983
but it can gather in these large red swarms

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:48.230
that span for meters,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.320
and these form because of a parasite.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.006
These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.257
A tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:59.145
with genitals at one end and
a hooked mouth at the other.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.680
As a freelance journalist, I sympathize.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.835
(Laughter)

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:06.743
The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body,

00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:08.820
but it also does other things.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.440
It castrates them,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.158
it changes their color from transparent to bright red,

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.674
it makes them live longer,

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:19.031
and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found,

00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:22.390
it makes them swim in groups.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.842
Why? Because the tapeworm,
like many other parasites,

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:27.423
has a complicated life cycle

00:01:27.423 --> 00:01:29.687
involving many different hosts.

00:01:29.687 --> 00:01:32.091
The shrimp are just one step on its journey.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.703
Its ultimate destination is this,

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:36.650
the greater flamingo.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.675
Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce,

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:42.964
so to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts

00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:46.055
into forming these conspicuous colored swarms

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.772
that are easier for a flamingo to spot

00:01:48.772 --> 00:01:50.331
and to devour,

00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:53.263
and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm.

00:01:53.263 --> 00:01:55.426
They aren't sociable through their own volition,

00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:57.502
but because they are being controlled.

00:01:57.502 --> 00:01:59.196
It's not safety in numbers.

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:01.055
It's actually the exact opposite.

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:04.096
The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies,

00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:05.492
turning them into vehicles

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:09.459
for getting itself into a flamingo.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.889
And here is another example

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.415
of a parasitic manipulation.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:16.391
This is a suicidal cricket.

00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:19.695
This cricket swallowed the 
larvae of a Gordian worm,

00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:21.588
or horsehair worm.

00:02:21.588 --> 00:02:23.744
The worm grew to adult size within it,

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:26.782
but it needs to get into water in order to mate,

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:29.000
and it does that by releasing proteins

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.188
that addle the cricket's brain,

00:02:31.188 --> 00:02:33.352
causing it to behave erratically.

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.307
When the cricket nears a body of water,

00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:36.926
such as this swimming pool,

00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:39.183
it jumps in and drowns,

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:40.908
and the worm wriggles out

00:02:40.908 --> 00:02:44.764
of its suicidal corpse.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:48.367
Crickets are really roomy. Who knew?

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.582
The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone.

00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:53.302
They are part of an entire cavalcade

00:02:53.302 --> 00:02:55.379
of mind-controlling parasites,

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.328
of fungi, viruses, and worms and insects and more

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:01.901
that all specialize in subverting and overriding

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:04.110
the wills of their hosts.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.847
Now, I first learned about this way of life

00:03:05.847 --> 00:03:08.340
through David Attenborough's "Trials of Life"

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.062
about 20 years ago,

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:11.764
and then later through a wonderful book called

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:14.438
"Parasite Rex" by my friend Carl Zimmer.

00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:16.581
And I've been writing about
these creatures ever since.

00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:19.392
Few topics in biology enthrall me more.

00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:23.098
It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain.

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:25.709
Because after all, they are always compelling

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.997
and they are delightfully macabre.

00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:28.389
When you write about parasites,

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.473
your lexicon swells with phrases like

00:03:30.473 --> 00:03:33.519
"devoured alive" and "bursts out of its body."

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.756
(Laughter)

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.296
But there's more to it than that.

00:03:36.296 --> 00:03:38.398
I'm a writer, and fellow writers in the audience

00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:41.107
will know that we love stories.

00:03:41.107 --> 00:03:43.500
Parasites invite us to resist the allure

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.350
of obvious stories.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.660
Their world is one of plot twists

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.267
and unexpected explanations.

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:52.763
Why, for example,

00:03:52.763 --> 00:03:54.941
does this caterpillar

00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:56.915
start violently thrashing about

00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:58.583
when another insect gets close to it

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:00.840
and those white cocoons that it seems

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.278
to be standing guard over?

00:04:02.278 --> 00:04:05.374
Is it maybe protecting its siblings?

00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:06.823
No.

00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:08.280
This caterpillar was attacked

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.499
by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it.

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.933
The eggs hatched and the young wasps

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:14.247
devoured the caterpillar alive

00:04:14.247 --> 00:04:15.918
before bursting out of its body.

00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:18.193
See what I mean?

00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:21.031
Now, the caterpillar didn't die.

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:23.616
Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:26.953
and controlled it into defending their siblings

00:04:26.953 --> 00:04:28.587
which are metamorphosing

00:04:28.587 --> 00:04:30.607
into adults within those cocoons.

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:34.146
This caterpillar is a head-banging 
zombie bodyguard

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:35.447
defending the offspring

00:04:35.447 --> 00:04:37.669
of the creature that killed it.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.535
(Applause)

00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:45.830
We have a lot to get through. 
I only have 13 minutes. (Laughter)

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.641
Now, some of you are probably just

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:49.859
desperately clawing for some solace

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:52.119
in the idea that these things are oddities

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:54.050
of the natural world, that they are outliers,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.870
and that point of view is understandable,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.248
because by their nature, parasites are quite small

00:04:58.248 --> 00:04:59.588
and they spend a lot of their time

00:04:59.588 --> 00:05:02.542
inside the bodies of other things.

00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:04.313
They're easy to overlook,

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:06.898
but that doesn't mean that they aren't important.

00:05:06.898 --> 00:05:09.103
A few years back, a man called Kevin Lafferty

00:05:09.103 --> 00:05:12.472
took a group of scientists
into three Californian estuaries

00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:14.220
and they pretty much weighed and dissected

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.215
and recorded everything they could find,

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.443
and what they found

00:05:17.443 --> 00:05:20.659
were parasites in extreme abundance.

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.703
Especially common were trematodes,

00:05:22.703 --> 00:05:25.353
tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts

00:05:25.353 --> 00:05:27.899
like this unfortunate snail.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.788
Now, a single trematode is tiny, microscopic,

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:32.587
but collectively they weighed as much

00:05:32.587 --> 00:05:34.773
as all the fish in the estuaries

00:05:34.773 --> 00:05:38.480
and three to nine times more than all the birds.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.474
And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you,

00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:41.862
the cricket thing?

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:44.415
One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato

00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:46.111
found that in one stream,

00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:48.082
these things drive so many crickets

00:05:48.082 --> 00:05:49.381
and grasshoppers into the water

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:50.690
that the drowned insects

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.994
make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout.

00:05:54.994 --> 00:05:57.928
Manipulation is not an oddity.

00:05:57.928 --> 00:06:00.048
It is a critical and common part

00:06:00.048 --> 00:06:01.939
of the world around us,

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:03.460
and scientists have now found

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.942
hundreds of examples of such manipulators,

00:06:05.942 --> 00:06:08.379
and more excitingly, they're starting to understand

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.437
exactly how these creatures control their hosts.

00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:14.961
And this is one of my favorite examples.

00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:17.418
This is Ampulex compressa,

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:19.642
the emerald cockroach wasp,

00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:21.936
and it is a truth universally acknowledged

00:06:21.936 --> 00:06:23.579
that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:25.375
of some fertilized eggs

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:27.841
must be in want of a cockroach.

00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:29.041
When she finds one,

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:31.252
she stabs it with a stinger

00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:32.701
that is also a sense organ.

00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:35.372
This discovery came out three weeks ago.

00:06:35.372 --> 00:06:37.677
She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ

00:06:37.677 --> 00:06:39.471
equipped with small sensory bumps

00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:42.026
that allow her to feel the distinctive texture

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:44.133
of a roach's brain.

00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:47.174
So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag,

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:49.651
she finds the brain, and she injects it with venom

00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:53.852
into two very specific clusters of neurons.

00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:56.935
Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal

00:06:56.935 --> 00:07:00.660
found that the venom is a
very specific chemical weapon.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.204
It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.

00:07:03.204 --> 00:07:05.331
The roach could walk away

00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.356
or fly or run if it chose to,

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:10.231
but it doesn't choose to,

00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:13.611
because the venom nixes its motivation to walk,

00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:14.725
and only that.

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:18.431
The wasp basically un-checks
the escape-from-danger box

00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:20.271
in the roach's operating system,

00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:23.504
allowing her to lead her helpless victim

00:07:23.504 --> 00:07:25.615
back to her lair by its antennae

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:28.254
like a person walking a dog.

00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:29.931
And once there, she lays an egg on it,

00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:32.207
egg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body,

00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:34.396
yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill.

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:37.626
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:37.626 --> 00:07:40.506
Now I would argue that, once stung,

00:07:40.506 --> 00:07:42.511
the cockroach isn't a roach anymore.

00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:44.861
It's more of an extension of the wasp,

00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:47.704
just like the cricket was an
extension of the Gordian worm.

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:50.519
These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:52.318
They have as much control over their own fates

00:07:52.318 --> 00:07:54.102
as my car.

00:07:54.102 --> 00:07:55.602
Once the parasites get in,

00:07:55.602 --> 00:07:58.167
the hosts don't get a say.

00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.481
Now humans, of course,

00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:01.513
are no stranger to manipulation.

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:03.873
We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains

00:08:03.873 --> 00:08:05.004
and to change our moods,

00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:09.024
and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas

00:08:09.024 --> 00:08:12.727
if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind?

00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:14.254
But our attempts at doing this

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:16.032
are crude and blundering compared

00:08:16.032 --> 00:08:19.127
to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites.

00:08:19.127 --> 00:08:21.519
Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:26.479
and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp.

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:30.219
Now, I think this is part of what makes parasites

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:33.005
so sinister and so compelling.

00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:35.627
We place such a premium on our free will

00:08:35.627 --> 00:08:36.888
and our independence

00:08:36.888 --> 00:08:38.469
that the prospect of losing those qualities

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:39.747
to forces unseen

00:08:39.747 --> 00:08:42.915
informs many of our deepest societal fears.

00:08:42.915 --> 00:08:45.368
Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals

00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:47.222
and mind-controlling supervillains --

00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:50.250
these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:55.048
but in nature, they happen all the time.

00:08:55.048 --> 00:08:57.680
Which leads me to an obvious

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.980
and disquieting question:

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.703
Are there dark, sinister parasites

00:09:01.703 --> 00:09:03.659
that are influencing our behavior

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:05.234
without us knowing about it,

00:09:05.234 --> 00:09:08.053
besides the NSA?

00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:09.360
If there are any —

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.326
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:15.648
I've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I?

00:09:15.648 --> 00:09:18.175
(Laughter)

00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:21.129
If there are any, this is a good candidate for them.

00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:24.407
This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short,

00:09:24.407 --> 00:09:25.996
because the terrifying creature

00:09:25.996 --> 00:09:28.206
always deserves a cute nickname.

00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:30.488
Toxo infects mammals,

00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:31.966
a wide variety of mammals,

00:09:31.966 --> 00:09:35.047
but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.

00:09:35.047 --> 00:09:37.808
And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that

00:09:37.808 --> 00:09:40.001
if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse,

00:09:40.001 --> 00:09:43.473
it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.

00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:46.549
If the infected rat smells the delightful odor

00:09:46.549 --> 00:09:47.773
of cat piss,

00:09:47.773 --> 00:09:50.493
it runs towards the source of the smell

00:09:50.493 --> 00:09:54.412
rather than the more sensible direction of away.

00:09:54.412 --> 00:09:56.947
The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex.

00:09:56.947 --> 00:09:59.819
It's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love.

00:09:59.819 --> 00:10:04.487
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:10:07.512 --> 00:10:10.714
You're very charitable, generous people.

00:10:10.714 --> 00:10:13.299
Hi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk.

00:10:13.299 --> 00:10:16.667
How does the parasite control its host

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:17.871
in this way?

00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:19.197
We don't really know.

00:10:19.197 --> 00:10:20.885
We know that Toxo releases an enzyme

00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:22.877
that makes dopamine, a substance involved

00:10:22.877 --> 00:10:24.690
in reward and motivation.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.121
We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain,

00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:29.586
including those involved in sexual arousal.

00:10:29.586 --> 00:10:31.787
But how those puzzle pieces fit together

00:10:31.787 --> 00:10:33.631
is not immediately clear.

00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:35.927
What is clear is that this thing

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:37.319
is a single cell.

00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:38.689
This has no nervous system.

00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:39.821
It has no consciousness.

00:10:39.821 --> 00:10:41.122
It doesn't even have a body.

00:10:41.122 --> 00:10:43.746
But it's manipulating a mammal?

00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:45.172
We are mammals.

00:10:45.172 --> 00:10:47.606
We are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure,

00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:50.130
but our brains have the same basic structure,

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.523
the same types of cells,

00:10:51.523 --> 00:10:53.111
the same chemicals running through them,

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.430
and the same parasites.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.778
Estimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest

00:10:57.778 --> 00:11:00.138
that one in three people around the world

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:01.851
have Toxo in their brains.

00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:05.339
Now typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness.

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:07.217
The parasite holds up in a dormant state

00:11:07.217 --> 00:11:09.400
for a long period of time.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.439
But there's some evidence that those people

00:11:11.439 --> 00:11:14.473
who are carriers score slightly differently

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:17.202
on personality questionnaires than other people,

00:11:17.202 --> 00:11:19.686
that they have a slightly 
higher risk of car accidents,

00:11:19.686 --> 00:11:22.289
and there's some evidence
that people with schizophrenia

00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:24.835
are more likely to be infected.

00:11:24.835 --> 00:11:27.018
Now, I think this evidence is still inconclusive,

00:11:27.018 --> 00:11:28.929
and even among Toxo researchers,

00:11:28.929 --> 00:11:31.369
opinion is divided as to whether the parasite

00:11:31.369 --> 00:11:33.754
is truly influencing our behavior.

00:11:33.754 --> 00:11:36.413
But given the widespread
nature of such manipulations,

00:11:36.413 --> 00:11:38.258
it would be completely implausible

00:11:38.258 --> 00:11:39.907
for humans to be the only species

00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:42.853
that weren't similarly affected.

00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:47.246
And I think that this capacity to constantly

00:11:47.246 --> 00:11:50.113
subvert our way of thinking about the world

00:11:50.113 --> 00:11:51.660
makes parasites amazing.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.869
They're constantly inviting us to
look at the natural world sideways,

00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:57.040
and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.527
whether they're simple and obvious

00:11:58.527 --> 00:12:00.060
or baffling and puzzling,

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.146
are not the results of individuals

00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:03.999
acting through their own accord

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:05.808
but because they are being bent

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.478
to the control of something else.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.518
And while that idea may be disquieting,

00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:13.441
and while parasites' habits may be very grisly,

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.233
I think that ability to surprise us

00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:18.408
makes them as wonderful and as charismatic

00:12:18.408 --> 00:12:21.772
as any panda or butterfly or dolphin.

00:12:21.772 --> 00:12:23.991
At the end of "On the Origin of Species,"

00:12:23.991 --> 00:12:26.980
Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.633
and of endless forms most beautiful

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:31.065
and most wonderful,

00:12:31.065 --> 00:12:33.644
and I like to think he could easily have been talking

00:12:33.644 --> 00:12:36.824
about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:40.073
or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks.

00:12:40.073 --> 00:12:43.222
But perhaps, that's just a parasite talking.

00:12:43.222 --> 00:12:44.953
Thank you.

00:12:44.953 --> 00:12:48.953
(Applause)
