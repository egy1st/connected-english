00:00:01.062 --> 00:00:03.327
Good morning.

00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:05.114
When I was a little boy,

00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:08.191
I had an experience that changed my life,

00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.099
and is in fact why I'm here today.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.040
That one moment

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.302
profoundly affected how I think about

00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:18.523
art, design and engineering.

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:21.280
As background, I was fortunate enough to grow up

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.993
in a family of loving and talented artists

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.557
in one of the world's great cities.

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:31.434
My dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.964
was an artist by both passion and profession,

00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:37.224
as is my mom, Rae.

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:39.029
He was one of the New York School

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:40.790
abstract expressionists who,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.302
together with his contemporaries,

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:46.200
invented American modern art,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.385
and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:53.928
towards modernism in the 20th century.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:56.849
Isn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years

00:00:56.849 --> 00:01:00.490
of people doing mostly representational art,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.523
that modern art, comparatively speaking,

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:04.863
is about 15 minutes old,

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:06.761
yet now pervasive.

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:08.705
As with many other important innovations,

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:12.325
those radical ideas required no new technology,

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:15.218
just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,

00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:19.386
plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:20.840
and rejection.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.357
In our home, art was everywhere.

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:24.928
It was like oxygen,

00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:28.090
around us and necessary for life.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.949
As I watched him paint,

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.256
Dad taught me that art

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:34.465
was not about being decorative,

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:37.579
but was a different way of communicating ideas,

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.616
and in fact one that could bridge the worlds

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:42.544
of knowledge and insight.

00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:44.684
Given this rich artistic environment,

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:46.299
you'd assume that I would have been compelled

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.408
to go into the family business,

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:51.024
but no.

00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:52.811
I followed the path of most kids

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:54.161
who are genetically programmed

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:56.360
to make their parents crazy.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.983
I had no interest in becoming an artist,

00:01:58.983 --> 00:02:00.543
certainly not a painter.

00:02:00.543 --> 00:02:03.842
What I did love was electronics and machines --

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:05.462
taking them apart, building new ones,

00:02:05.462 --> 00:02:07.349
and making them work.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.251
Fortunately, my family also had engineers in it,

00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:12.459
and with my parents,

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.087
these were my first role models.

00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:16.444
What they all had in common

00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:19.152
was they worked very, very hard.

00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:21.522
My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:24.222
kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.

00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:27.646
On weekends, we would go
together to Cortlandt Street,

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:30.321
which was New York City's radio row.

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:33.124
There we would explore massive piles

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:34.345
of surplus electronics,

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:36.647
and for a few bucks bring home treasures

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:38.079
like Norden bombsights

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.590
and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.656
I found these objects both useful and fascinating.

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:48.287
I learned about engineering and how things worked,

00:02:48.287 --> 00:02:49.747
not at school

00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:51.536
but by taking apart and studying

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:54.013
these fabulously complex devices.

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:56.597
I did this for hours every day,

00:02:56.597 --> 00:02:59.895
apparently avoiding electrocution.

00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:01.467
Life was good.

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:03.788
However, every summer, sadly,

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:05.821
the machines got left behind

00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:08.025
while my parents and I traveled overseas

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:11.665
to experience history, art and design.

00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:14.059
We visited the great museums and historic buildings

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.919
of both Europe and the Middle East,

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.179
but to encourage my growing interest

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:19.994
in science and technology,

00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:22.278
they would simply drop me off in places

00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:24.718
like the London Science Museum,

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:28.436
where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself

00:03:28.436 --> 00:03:32.412
studying the history of science and technology.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:35.676
Then, when I was about nine years old,

00:03:35.676 --> 00:03:37.544
we went to Rome.

00:03:37.544 --> 00:03:39.905
On one particularly hot summer day,

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:42.784
we visited a drum-shaped
building that from the outside

00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:45.028
was not particularly interesting.

00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:47.353
My dad said it was called the Pantheon,

00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:49.821
a temple for all of the gods.

00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:52.095
It didn't look all that special from the outside,

00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:54.534
as I said, but when we walked inside,

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.847
I was immediately struck by three things:

00:03:57.847 --> 00:04:01.077
First of all, it was pleasantly cool

00:04:01.077 --> 00:04:03.155
despite the oppressive heat outside.

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:05.869
It was very dark, the only source of light

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.342
being an big open hole in the roof.

00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:10.575
Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole,

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:12.389
but it was called the oculus,

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.765
an eye to the heavens.

00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:16.910
And there was something about this place,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.913
I didn't know why, that just felt special.

00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:21.911
As we walked to the center of the room,

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.732
I looked up at the heavens through the oculus.

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:27.029
This was the first church that I'd been to

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.232
that provided an unrestricted view

00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:32.390
between God and man.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.820
But I wondered, what about when it rained?

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.677
Dad may have called this an oculus,

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:40.764
but it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.

00:04:40.764 --> 00:04:42.593
I looked down and saw floor drains

00:04:42.593 --> 00:04:45.178
had been cut into the stone floor.

00:04:45.178 --> 00:04:47.637
As I became more accustomed to the dark,

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:49.901
I was able to make out details of the floor

00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:51.631
and the surrounding walls.

00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:54.208
No big deal here, just the same statuary stuff

00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:56.124
that we'd seen all over Rome.

00:04:56.124 --> 00:04:57.796
In fact, it looked like the Appian Way

00:04:57.796 --> 00:04:59.992
marble salesman showed up

00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:02.440
with his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.080
and Hadrian said, "We'll take all of it."

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.786
(Laughter)

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:10.004
But the ceiling was amazing.

00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:12.840
It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.149
I'd seen these before,

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:16.393
and Bucky was friends with my dad.

00:05:16.393 --> 00:05:19.884
It was modern, high-tech, impressive,

00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:22.321
a huge 142-foot clear span

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:25.564
which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.

00:05:25.564 --> 00:05:26.826
I loved this place.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:30.245
It was really beautiful and unlike
anything I'd ever seen before,

00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:33.815
so I asked my dad, "When was this built?"

00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:36.947
He said, "About 2,000 years ago."

00:05:36.947 --> 00:05:39.451
And I said, "No, I mean, the roof."

00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:41.410
You see, I assumed that this was a modern roof

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.328
that had been put on because the original

00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:46.874
was destroyed in some long-past war.

00:05:46.874 --> 00:05:50.336
He said, "It's the original roof."

00:05:50.336 --> 00:05:52.814
That moment changed my life,

00:05:52.814 --> 00:05:55.463
and I can remember it as if it were yesterday.

00:05:55.463 --> 00:05:58.058
For the first time, I realized people were smart

00:05:58.058 --> 00:06:00.198
2,000 years ago. (Laughter)

00:06:00.198 --> 00:06:02.312
This had never crossed my mind.

00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:06.183
I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,

00:06:06.183 --> 00:06:08.111
we visited those the year before,

00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:11.031
and sure they're impressive, nice enough design,

00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:13.486
but look, give me an unlimited budget,

00:06:13.486 --> 00:06:17.483
20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years

00:06:17.483 --> 00:06:21.099
to cut and drag stone blocks 
across the countryside,

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.863
and I'll build you pyramids too.

00:06:23.863 --> 00:06:26.666
But no amount of brute force

00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:29.708
gets you the dome of the Pantheon,

00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:32.727
not 2,000 years ago, nor today.

00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:35.467
And incidentally, it is still the largest

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:39.281
unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.

00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:42.276
To build the Pantheon took some miracles.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:44.708
By miracles, I mean things that are

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:47.295
technically barely possible,

00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:50.367
very high-risk, and might not be

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:52.951
actually accomplishable at this moment in time,

00:06:52.951 --> 00:06:57.203
certainly not by you.

00:06:57.203 --> 00:07:00.328
For example, here are some
of the Pantheon's miracles.

00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:03.021
To make it even structurally possible,

00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:05.588
they had to invent super-strong concrete,

00:07:05.588 --> 00:07:07.537
and to control weight,

00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:09.605
varied the density of the aggregate

00:07:09.605 --> 00:07:12.373
as they worked their way up the dome.

00:07:12.373 --> 00:07:14.674
For strength and lightness, the dome structure

00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:16.711
used five rings of coffers,

00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:18.318
each of diminishing size,

00:07:18.318 --> 00:07:21.054
which imparts a dramatic forced perspective

00:07:21.054 --> 00:07:23.061
to the design.

00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:24.986
It was wonderfully cool inside

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.169
because of its huge thermal mass,

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.254
natural convection of air rising up

00:07:29.254 --> 00:07:30.655
through the oculus,

00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:33.130
and a Venturi effect when wind blows across

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.433
the top of the building.

00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:39.393
I discovered for the first time that light itself

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:41.360
has substance.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.037
The shaft of light beaming through the oculus

00:07:44.037 --> 00:07:46.527
was both beautiful and palpable,

00:07:46.527 --> 00:07:48.784
and I realized for the first time

00:07:48.784 --> 00:07:50.685
that light could be designed.

00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:55.559
Further, that of all of the forms of design,

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:56.935
visual design,

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.766
they were all kind of irrelevant without it,

00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:02.627
because without light, you can't see any of them.

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:05.079
I also realized that I wasn't the first person

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:08.338
to think that this place was really special.

00:08:08.338 --> 00:08:12.715
It survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers

00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:14.614
and the ravages of time to become

00:08:14.614 --> 00:08:15.994
what I believe is the longest

00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:18.951
continuously occupied building in history.

00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:21.167
Largely because of that visit,

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.704
I came to understand that,

00:08:22.704 --> 00:08:25.343
contrary to what I was being told in school,

00:08:25.343 --> 00:08:27.372
the worlds of art and design

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:29.388
were not, in fact, incompatible

00:08:29.388 --> 00:08:31.064
with science and engineering.

00:08:31.064 --> 00:08:33.157
I realized, when combined,

00:08:33.157 --> 00:08:35.920
you could create things that were amazing

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.766
that couldn't be done in either domain alone.

00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:41.199
But in school, with few exceptions,

00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:43.119
they were treated as separate worlds,

00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:45.262
and they still are.

00:08:45.262 --> 00:08:47.958
My teachers told me that I had to get serious

00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.131
and focus on one or the other.

00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:53.226
However, urging me to specialize

00:08:53.226 --> 00:08:56.536
only caused me to really 
appreciate those polymaths

00:08:56.536 --> 00:09:00.686
like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,

00:09:00.686 --> 00:09:02.111
Benjamin Franklin,

00:09:02.111 --> 00:09:04.821
people who did exactly the opposite.

00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:07.010
And this led me to embrace

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.980
and want to be in both worlds.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.808
So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity

00:09:15.808 --> 00:09:18.302
like the Pantheon actually happen?

00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:22.230
Someone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.421
needed a brilliant creative vision.

00:09:25.421 --> 00:09:28.214
They also needed the storytelling
and leadership skills

00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:30.992
necessary to fund and execute it,

00:09:30.992 --> 00:09:33.854
and a mastery of science and technology

00:09:33.854 --> 00:09:35.937
with the ability and knowhow

00:09:35.937 --> 00:09:39.983
to push existing innovations even farther.

00:09:39.983 --> 00:09:43.903
It is my belief that to create
these rare game changers

00:09:43.903 --> 00:09:48.033
requires you to pull off at least five miracles.

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:50.726
The problem is, no matter how talented,

00:09:50.726 --> 00:09:52.458
rich or smart you are,

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.484
you only get one to one and a half miracles.

00:09:55.484 --> 00:09:57.266
That's it. That's the quota.

00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:59.879
Then you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.258
whatever.

00:10:01.258 --> 00:10:03.535
Remember, most people can't even imagine

00:10:03.535 --> 00:10:05.442
one of these technical miracles,

00:10:05.442 --> 00:10:08.551
and you need at least five to make a Pantheon.

00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:11.052
In my experience, these rare visionaries

00:10:11.052 --> 00:10:12.889
who can think across the worlds of art,

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:14.716
design and engineering

00:10:14.716 --> 00:10:16.918
have the ability to notice

00:10:16.918 --> 00:10:19.635
when others have provided enough of the miracles

00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:22.191
to bring the goal within reach.

00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:24.828
Driven by the clarity of their vision,

00:10:24.828 --> 00:10:27.138
they summon the courage and determination

00:10:27.138 --> 00:10:29.235
to deliver the remaining miracles

00:10:29.235 --> 00:10:32.785
and they often take what other people think to be

00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:34.831
insurmountable obstacles

00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:36.616
and turn them into features.

00:10:36.616 --> 00:10:39.543
Take the oculus of the Pantheon.

00:10:39.543 --> 00:10:41.441
By insisting that it be in the design,

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:44.314
it meant you couldn't use much
of the structural technology

00:10:44.314 --> 00:10:47.288
that had been developed for Roman arches.

00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:50.186
However, by instead embracing it

00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:52.774
and rethinking weight and stress distribution,

00:10:52.774 --> 00:10:55.256
they came up with a design that only works

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:57.160
if there's a big hole in the roof.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.167
That done, you now get the aesthetic

00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:04.548
and design benefits of light, cooling

00:11:04.548 --> 00:11:07.848
and that critical direct connection with the heavens.

00:11:07.848 --> 00:11:09.892
Not bad.

00:11:09.892 --> 00:11:11.953
These people not only believed

00:11:11.953 --> 00:11:14.009
that the impossible can be done,

00:11:14.009 --> 00:11:16.835
but that it must be done.

00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:18.936
Enough ancient history.

00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:22.069
What are some recent examples of innovations

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:23.948
that combine creative design

00:11:23.948 --> 00:11:27.191
and technological advances in a way so profound

00:11:27.191 --> 00:11:28.520
that they will be remembered

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.353
a thousand years from now?

00:11:30.353 --> 00:11:33.449
Well, putting a man on the moon was a good one,

00:11:33.449 --> 00:11:36.466
and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either.

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:38.958
Talk about one giant leap:

00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.406
It's hard to imagine a more profound moment

00:11:41.406 --> 00:11:42.718
in human history

00:11:42.718 --> 00:11:44.891
than when we first left our world

00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:46.782
to set foot on another.

00:11:46.782 --> 00:11:49.003
So what came after the moon?

00:11:49.003 --> 00:11:51.811
One is tempted to say that today's pantheon

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.472
is the Internet,

00:11:53.472 --> 00:11:55.941
but I actually think that's quite wrong,

00:11:55.941 --> 00:11:58.796
or at least it's only part of the story.

00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:01.312
The Internet isn't a Pantheon.

00:12:01.312 --> 00:12:03.903
It's more like the invention of concrete:

00:12:03.903 --> 00:12:06.478
important, absolutely necessary

00:12:06.478 --> 00:12:07.918
to build the Pantheon,

00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:09.274
and enduring,

00:12:09.274 --> 00:12:12.465
but entirely insufficient by itself.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.397
However, just as the technology of concrete

00:12:15.397 --> 00:12:18.984
was critical in realization of the Pantheon,

00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:22.199
new designers will use the
technologies of the Internet

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:25.397
to create novel concepts that will endure.

00:12:25.397 --> 00:12:27.455
The smartphone is a perfect example.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.200
Soon the majority of people on the planet

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.534
will have one,

00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:32.935
and the idea of connecting everyone

00:12:32.935 --> 00:12:36.185
to both knowledge and each other will endure.

00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:37.493
So what's next?

00:12:37.493 --> 00:12:40.899
What imminent advance will be
the equivalent of the Pantheon?

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:42.334
Thinking about this,

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:44.881
I rejected many very plausible

00:12:44.881 --> 00:12:46.777
and dramatic breakthroughs to come,

00:12:46.777 --> 00:12:48.794
such as curing cancer.

00:12:48.794 --> 00:12:52.132
Why? Because Pantheons are anchored

00:12:52.132 --> 00:12:55.067
in designed physical objects,

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:57.389
ones that inspire by simply seeing

00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:58.809
and experiencing them,

00:12:58.809 --> 00:13:01.691
and will continue to do so indefinitely.

00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:06.264
It is a different kind of language, like art.

00:13:06.264 --> 00:13:09.036
These other vital contributions that extend life

00:13:09.036 --> 00:13:11.729
and relieve suffering are, of course, critical,

00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:13.416
and fantastic,

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:15.209
but they're part of the continuum of

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:17.721
our overall knowledge and technology,

00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:20.245
like the Internet.

00:13:20.245 --> 00:13:22.589
So what is next?

00:13:22.589 --> 00:13:24.308
Perhaps counterintuitively,

00:13:24.308 --> 00:13:26.620
I'm guessing it's a visionary idea

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.474
from the late 1930s

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.634
that's been revived every decade since:

00:13:31.634 --> 00:13:33.648
autonomous vehicles.

00:13:33.648 --> 00:13:35.386
Now you're thinking, give me a break.

00:13:35.386 --> 00:13:38.904
How can a fancy version of cruise control

00:13:38.904 --> 00:13:40.604
be profound?

00:13:40.604 --> 00:13:42.728
Look, much of our world

00:13:42.728 --> 00:13:46.211
has been designed around 
roads and transportation.

00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:48.086
These were as essential to the success

00:13:48.086 --> 00:13:49.584
of the Roman Empire

00:13:49.584 --> 00:13:51.569
as the interstate highway system

00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:53.363
to the prosperity and development

00:13:53.363 --> 00:13:55.573
of the United States.

00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:58.607
Today, these roads that interconnect our world

00:13:58.607 --> 00:14:00.705
are dominated by cars and trucks

00:14:00.705 --> 00:14:02.573
that have remained largely unchanged

00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:05.144
for 100 years.

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:08.403
Although perhaps not obvious today,

00:14:08.403 --> 00:14:12.988
autonomous vehicles will be the key technology

00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:16.086
that enables us to redesign our cities

00:14:16.086 --> 00:14:18.305
and, by extension, civilization.

00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:19.907
Here's why:

00:14:19.907 --> 00:14:21.660
Once they become ubiquitous,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.197
each year, these vehicles will save

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.305
tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone

00:14:27.305 --> 00:14:30.432
and a million globally.

00:14:30.432 --> 00:14:33.331
Automotive energy consumption and air pollution

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.704
will be cut dramatically.

00:14:35.704 --> 00:14:37.109
Much of the road congestion

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:40.919
in and out of our cities will disappear.

00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:43.606
They will enable compelling new concepts

00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:46.075
in how we design cities, work,

00:14:46.075 --> 00:14:48.012
and the way we live.

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:50.558
We will get where we're going faster

00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:53.556
and society will recapture vast amounts

00:14:53.556 --> 00:14:54.847
of lost productivity

00:14:54.847 --> 00:14:58.488
now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.

00:14:58.488 --> 00:15:01.761
But why now? Why do we think this is ready?

00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:03.955
Because over the last 30 years,

00:15:03.955 --> 00:15:06.003
people from outside the automotive industry

00:15:06.003 --> 00:15:08.111
have spent countless billions

00:15:08.111 --> 00:15:09.846
creating the needed miracles,

00:15:09.846 --> 00:15:12.718
but for entirely different purposes.

00:15:12.718 --> 00:15:15.346
It took folks like DARPA, universities,

00:15:15.346 --> 00:15:18.510
and companies completely
outside of the automotive industry

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.811
to notice that if you were clever about it,

00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:23.341
autonomy could be done now.

00:15:23.341 --> 00:15:26.724
So what are the five miracles
needed for autonomous vehicles?

00:15:26.724 --> 00:15:28.367
One, you need to know

00:15:28.367 --> 00:15:31.101
where you are and exactly what time it is.

00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:33.509
This was solved neatly by the GPS system,

00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:34.821
Global Positioning System,

00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:37.487
that the U.S. Government put in place.

00:15:37.487 --> 00:15:40.010
You need to know where all the roads are,

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.913
what the rules are, and where you're going.

00:15:42.913 --> 00:15:45.496
The various needs of personal navigation systems,

00:15:45.496 --> 00:15:47.251
in-car navigation systems,

00:15:47.251 --> 00:15:50.284
and web-based maps address this.

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:52.911
You must have near-continuous communication

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.804
with high-performance computing networks

00:15:54.804 --> 00:15:56.474
and with others nearby

00:15:56.474 --> 00:15:59.789
to understand their intent.

00:15:59.789 --> 00:16:02.897
The wireless technologies
developed for mobile devices,

00:16:02.897 --> 00:16:04.690
with some minor modifications,

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.649
are completely suitable to solve this.

00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:10.139
You'll probably want some restricted roadways

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:11.329
to get started

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:13.807
that both society and its lawyers

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.679
agree are safe to use for this.

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:17.528
This will start with the HOV lanes

00:16:17.528 --> 00:16:19.661
and move from there.

00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:22.212
But finally, you need to recognize

00:16:22.212 --> 00:16:24.315
people, signs and objects.

00:16:24.315 --> 00:16:27.369
Machine vision, special sensors,
and high-performance computing

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:28.941
can do a lot of this,

00:16:28.941 --> 00:16:31.499
but it turns out a lot is not good enough

00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:33.440
when your family is on board.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.961
Occasionally, humans will 
need to do sense-making.

00:16:36.961 --> 00:16:40.573
For this, you might actually have to wake up

00:16:40.573 --> 00:16:42.669
your passenger and ask them what the hell

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.471
that big lump is in the middle of the road.

00:16:45.487 --> 00:16:47.831
Not so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose

00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:49.684
in this new world.

00:16:49.684 --> 00:16:52.424
Besides, once the first drivers explain

00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:53.750
to their confused car

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.416
that the giant chicken at the fork in the road

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:57.959
is actually a restaurant,

00:16:57.959 --> 00:17:00.263
and it's okay to keep driving,

00:17:00.263 --> 00:17:03.683
every other car on the surface of the Earth

00:17:03.683 --> 00:17:06.605
will know that from that point on.

00:17:06.605 --> 00:17:08.868
Five miracles, mostly delivered,

00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:10.746
and now you just need a clear vision

00:17:10.746 --> 00:17:13.583
of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles

00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:17.196
with seductively beautiful 
and new functional designs

00:17:17.196 --> 00:17:19.650
plus a lot of money and hard work

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.246
to bring it home.

00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:24.268
The beginning is now only a handful of years away,

00:17:24.268 --> 00:17:26.136
and I predict that autonomous vehicles

00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:28.207
will permanently change our world

00:17:28.207 --> 00:17:32.391
over the next several decades.

00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:35.043
In conclusion, I've come to believe

00:17:35.043 --> 00:17:37.281
that the ingredients for the next Pantheons

00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:38.668
are all around us,

00:17:38.668 --> 00:17:40.855
just waiting for visionary people

00:17:40.855 --> 00:17:42.589
with the broad knowledge,

00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:44.199
multidisciplinary skills,

00:17:44.199 --> 00:17:46.067
and intense passion

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:51.153
to harness them to make their dreams a reality.

00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:53.649
But these people don't spontaneously

00:17:53.649 --> 00:17:54.988
pop into existence.

00:17:54.988 --> 00:17:56.827
They need to be nurtured and encouraged

00:17:56.827 --> 00:17:58.606
from when they're little kids.

00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.466
We need to love them and help them

00:18:00.466 --> 00:18:02.185
discover their passions.

00:18:02.185 --> 00:18:04.399
We need to encourage them to work hard

00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:06.836
and help them understand that failure

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.707
is a necessary ingredient for success,

00:18:09.707 --> 00:18:11.888
as is perseverance.

00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:14.986
We need to help them to find their own role models,

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:17.658
and give them the confidence
to believe in themselves

00:18:17.658 --> 00:18:20.435
and to believe that anything is possible,

00:18:20.435 --> 00:18:23.944
and just as my grandpa did when
he took me shopping for surplus,

00:18:23.944 --> 00:18:25.727
and just as my parents did

00:18:25.727 --> 00:18:27.749
when they took me to science museums,

00:18:27.749 --> 00:18:31.030
we need to encourage them to find their own path,

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.687
even if it's very different from our own.

00:18:33.687 --> 00:18:35.095
But a cautionary note:

00:18:35.095 --> 00:18:37.529
We also need to periodically pry them away

00:18:37.529 --> 00:18:38.998
from their modern miracles,

00:18:38.998 --> 00:18:40.969
the computers, phones, tablets,

00:18:40.969 --> 00:18:42.563
game machines and TVs,

00:18:42.563 --> 00:18:44.807
take them out into the sunlight

00:18:44.807 --> 00:18:46.936
so they can experience both the natural

00:18:46.936 --> 00:18:49.833
and design wonders of our world,

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:52.075
our planet and our civilization.

00:18:52.075 --> 00:18:55.002
If we don't, they won't understand

00:18:55.002 --> 00:18:56.884
what these precious things are

00:18:56.884 --> 00:18:59.479
that someday they will be resopnsible

00:18:59.479 --> 00:19:01.761
for protecting and improving.

00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:03.404
We also need them to understand

00:19:03.404 --> 00:19:06.433
something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated

00:19:06.433 --> 00:19:08.896
in our increasingly tech-dependent world,

00:19:08.896 --> 00:19:10.579
that art and design

00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:12.492
are not luxuries,

00:19:12.492 --> 00:19:14.318
nor somehow incompatible

00:19:14.318 --> 00:19:16.187
with science and engineering.

00:19:16.187 --> 00:19:21.762
They are in fact essential to what makes us special.

00:19:21.762 --> 00:19:24.277
Someday, if you get the chance,

00:19:24.277 --> 00:19:25.814
perhaps you can take your kids

00:19:25.814 --> 00:19:27.585
to the actual Pantheon,

00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:30.245
as we will our daughter Kira,

00:19:30.245 --> 00:19:32.323
to experience firsthand

00:19:32.323 --> 00:19:36.580
the power of that astonishing design,

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.324
which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome,

00:19:40.324 --> 00:19:43.351
reached 2,000 years into the future

00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:46.009
to set the course for my life.

00:19:46.009 --> 00:19:48.140
Thank you.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.448
(Applause)
