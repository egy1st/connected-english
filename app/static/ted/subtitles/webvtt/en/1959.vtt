00:00:01.252 --> 00:00:03.958
Looking deeply inside nature,

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:07.071
through the magnifying glass of science,

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.676
designers extract principles,
processes and materials

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.815
that are forming the very basis
of design methodology.

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:20.328
From synthetic constructs
that resemble biological materials,

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:23.719
to computational methods
that emulate neural processes,

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:26.208
nature is driving design.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:29.200
Design is also driving nature.

00:00:30.128 --> 00:00:33.863
In realms of genetics, regenerative
medicine and synthetic biology,

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:36.592
designers are growing novel technologies,

00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:39.693
not foreseen or anticipated by nature.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.083
Bionics explores the interplay
between biology and design.

00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:50.002
As you can see, my legs are bionic.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.514
Today, I will tell human stories
of bionic integration;

00:00:56.538 --> 00:01:02.237
how electromechanics attached
to the body, and implanted inside the body

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:06.975
are beginning to bridge the gap
between disability and ability,

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:11.808
between human limitation
and human potential.

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.363
Bionics has defined my physicality.

00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:18.680
In 1982, both of my legs were amputated

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:20.808
due to tissue damage from frostbite,

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:23.084
incurred during
a mountain-climbing accident.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.537
At that time, I didn't
view my body as broken.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:32.758
I reasoned that a human being
can never be "broken."

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:35.584
Technology is broken.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.742
Technology is inadequate.

00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:44.096
This simple but powerful idea
was a call to arms,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.627
to advance technology
for the elimination of my own disability,

00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:51.143
and ultimately, the disability of others.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.418
I began by developing specialized limbs

00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:57.903
that allowed me to return
to the vertical world

00:01:57.927 --> 00:01:59.394
of rock and ice climbing.

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:04.036
I quickly realized that the artificial
part of my body is malleable;

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.410
able to take on any form, any function --

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:11.373
a blank slate for which to create,

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:16.565
perhaps, structures that could extend
beyond biological capability.

00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:18.741
I made my height adjustable.

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.445
I could be as short as five feet
or as tall as I'd like.

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.898
(Laughter)

00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:27.272
So when I was feeling bad about myself,

00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:29.133
insecure, I would jack my height up.

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:31.038
(Laughter)

00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:33.259
But when I was feeling
confident and suave,

00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:37.052
I would knock my height down a notch,
just to give the competition a chance.

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:39.171
(Laughter)

00:02:39.195 --> 00:02:41.298
(Applause)

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:44.591
Narrow-edged feet allowed me
to climb steep rock fissures,

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:47.217
where the human foot cannot penetrate,

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:51.423
and spiked feet enabled me
to climb vertical ice walls,

00:02:51.447 --> 00:02:54.320
without ever experiencing
muscle leg fatigue.

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.589
Through technological innovation,

00:02:57.613 --> 00:03:00.454
I returned to my sport,
stronger and better.

00:03:00.478 --> 00:03:03.061
Technology had eliminated my disability,

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:05.427
and allowed me a new climbing prowess.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:09.014
As a young man, I imagined a future world
where technology so advanced

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:10.820
could rid the world of disability,

00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:12.940
a world in which neural
implants would allow

00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:14.613
the visually impaired to see.

00:03:15.026 --> 00:03:19.359
A world in which the paralyzed
could walk, via body exoskeletons.

00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:23.423
Sadly, because of
deficiencies in technology,

00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:25.181
disability is rampant in the world.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.213
This gentleman is missing three limbs.

00:03:27.903 --> 00:03:31.726
As a testimony to current technology,
he is out of the wheelchair,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.671
but we need to do a better job in bionics,
to allow, one day, full rehabilitation

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:40.900
for a person with this level of injury.

00:03:41.876 --> 00:03:45.455
At the MIT Media Lab, we've established
the Center for Extreme Bionics.

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.027
The mission of the center
is to put forth fundamental science

00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.887
and technological capability

00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:55.658
that will allow the biomechatronic
and regenerative repair of humans,

00:03:55.682 --> 00:04:00.603
across a broad range
of brain and body disabilities.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:05.444
Today, I'm going to tell you
how my legs function, how they work,

00:04:05.468 --> 00:04:08.746
as a case in point for this center.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.897
Now, I made sure to shave
my legs last night,

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:12.868
because I knew I'd be showing them off.

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:14.341
(Laughter)

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:17.595
Bionics entails the engineering
of extreme interfaces.

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:20.491
There's three extreme
interfaces in my bionic limbs:

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:24.595
mechanical, how my limbs
are attached to my biological body;

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:27.918
dynamic, how they move
like flesh and bone;

00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:30.832
and electrical, how they communicate
with my nervous system.

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:33.102
I'll begin with mechanical interface.

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:37.047
In the area of design,
we still do not understand

00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:39.947
how to attach devices
to the body mechanically.

00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:44.328
It's extraordinary to me
that in this day and age,

00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:46.677
one of the most mature,
oldest technologies

00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:51.097
in the human timeline, the shoe,
still gives us blisters.

00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:52.578
How can this be?

00:04:52.602 --> 00:04:55.554
We have no idea how to attach
things to our bodies.

00:04:56.364 --> 00:04:59.269
This is the beautifully
lyrical design work

00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:01.714
of Professor Neri Oxman
at the MIT Media Lab,

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:05.162
showing spatially varying
exoskeletal impedances,

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:09.200
shown here by color variation
in this 3D-printed model.

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:14.335
Imagine a future where clothing
is stiff and soft where you need it,

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:17.889
when you need it, for optimal
support and flexibility,

00:05:17.913 --> 00:05:19.588
without ever causing discomfort.

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:23.534
My bionic limbs are attached
to my biological body

00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:27.620
via synthetic skins
with stiffness variations,

00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:31.264
that mirror my underlying
tissue biomechanics.

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:35.533
To achieve that mirroring, we first
developed a mathematical model

00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:37.105
of my biological limb.

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.411
To that end, we used
imaging tools such as MRI,

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:41.999
to look inside my body,

00:05:42.023 --> 00:05:45.728
to figure out the geometries
and locations of various tissues.

00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:47.139
We also took robotic tools --

00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:52.074
here's a 14-actuator circle
that goes around the biological limb.

00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:55.439
The actuators come in,
find the surface of the limb,

00:05:55.463 --> 00:05:57.708
measure its unloaded shape,

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.383
and then they push on the tissues

00:05:59.407 --> 00:06:02.978
to measure tissue compliances
at each anatomical point.

00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:05.789
We combine these imaging and robotic data

00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:09.455
to build a mathematical description
of my biological limb, shown on the left.

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.233
You see a bunch of points, or nodes?

00:06:11.257 --> 00:06:14.407
At each node, there's a color
that represents tissue compliance.

00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:18.373
We then do a mathematical transformation
to the design of the synthetic skin,

00:06:18.397 --> 00:06:19.596
shown on the right.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.492
And we've discovered optimality is:

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:25.373
where the body is stiff,
the synthetic skin should be soft,

00:06:25.397 --> 00:06:28.857
where the body is soft,
the synthetic skin is stiff,

00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.164
and this mirroring occurs
across all tissue compliances.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.481
With this framework,
we've produced bionic limbs

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:38.426
that are the most comfortable
limbs I've ever worn.

00:06:39.077 --> 00:06:45.166
Clearly, in the future, our clothing,
our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.846
will no longer be designed
and manufactured using artisan strategies,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.074
but rather, data-driven
quantitative frameworks.

00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:56.302
In that future, our shoes
will no longer give us blisters.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.937
We're also embedding
sensing and smart materials

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.532
into the synthetic skins.

00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:06.024
This is a material developed
by SRI International, California.

00:07:06.048 --> 00:07:09.036
Under electrostatic effect,
it changes stiffness.

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:12.674
So under zero voltage,
the material is compliant,

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:14.072
it's floppy like paper.

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:16.564
Then the button's pushed,
a voltage is applied,

00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:18.580
and it becomes stiff as a board.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.722
(Tapping sounds)

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:24.314
We embed this material
into the synthetic skin

00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:27.447
that attaches my bionic limb
to my biological body.

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:30.318
When I walk here, it's no voltage.

00:07:30.342 --> 00:07:32.399
My interface is soft and compliant.

00:07:32.423 --> 00:07:35.414
The button's pushed,
voltage is applied, and it stiffens,

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:38.454
offering me a greater maneuverability
over the bionic limb.

00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:40.751
We're also building exoskeletons.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.583
This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft

00:07:43.607 --> 00:07:46.545
in just the right areas
of the running cycle,

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:50.823
to protect the biological joints
from high impacts and degradation.

00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:53.633
In the future, we'll all
be wearing exoskeletons

00:07:53.657 --> 00:07:55.942
in common activities, such as running.

00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:58.450
Next, dynamic interface.

00:07:58.474 --> 00:08:00.982
How do my bionic limbs
move like flesh and bone?

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:05.784
At my MIT lab, we study how humans
with normal physiologies

00:08:05.808 --> 00:08:07.314
stand, walk and run.

00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:08.729
What are the muscles doing,

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:11.126
and how are they controlled
by the spinal cord?

00:08:11.697 --> 00:08:14.142
This basic science
motivates what we build.

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.504
We're building bionic ankles,
knees and hips.

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:19.044
We're building body parts
from the ground up.

00:08:19.854 --> 00:08:23.017
The bionic limbs that I'm wearing
are called BiOMs.

00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:26.995
They've been fitted
to nearly 1,000 patients,

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:29.981
400 of which have been
wounded U.S. soldiers.

00:08:30.005 --> 00:08:31.163
How does it work?

00:08:31.187 --> 00:08:33.202
At heel strike, under computer control,

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:35.202
the system controls stiffness,

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:38.263
to attenuate the shock
of the limb hitting the ground.

00:08:38.287 --> 00:08:42.383
Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb
outputs high torques and powers

00:08:42.407 --> 00:08:44.762
to lift the person
into the walking stride,

00:08:44.786 --> 00:08:48.271
comparable to how muscles
work in the calf region.

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:52.826
This bionic propulsion is very important
clinically to patients.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.904
So on the left, you see
the bionic device worn by a lady,

00:08:55.928 --> 00:08:58.863
on the right, a passive device
worn by the same lady,

00:08:58.887 --> 00:09:01.713
that fails to emulate
normal muscle function,

00:09:01.737 --> 00:09:05.415
enabling her to do something
everyone should be able to do:

00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:07.214
go up and down their steps at home.

00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:10.649
Bionics also allows
for extraordinary athletic feats.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:13.792
Here's a gentleman running
up a rocky pathway.

00:09:15.784 --> 00:09:18.609
This is Steve Martin --
not the comedian --

00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:21.612
who lost his legs in a bomb blast
in Afghanistan.

00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:27.194
We're also building exoskeletal
structures using these same principles,

00:09:27.218 --> 00:09:29.461
that wrap around the biological limb.

00:09:30.311 --> 00:09:35.522
This gentleman does not have
any leg condition, any disability.

00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:37.802
He has a normal physiology,

00:09:37.826 --> 00:09:42.395
so these exoskeletons are applying
muscle-like torques and powers,

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:46.119
so that his own muscles need not
apply those torques and powers.

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:52.477
This is the first exoskeleton in history
that actually augments human walking.

00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:55.306
It significantly reduces metabolic cost.

00:09:55.668 --> 00:09:58.382
It's so profound in its augmentation,

00:09:58.406 --> 00:10:01.555
that when a normal, healthy person
wears the device for 40 minutes

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:03.278
and then takes it off,

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:07.357
their own biological legs feel
ridiculously heavy and awkward.

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:11.450
We're beginning the age in which
machines attached to our bodies

00:10:11.474 --> 00:10:14.484
will make us stronger
and faster and more efficient.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.446
Moving on to electrical interface:

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.627
How do my bionic limbs communicate
with my nervous system?

00:10:20.651 --> 00:10:22.493
Across my residual limb are electrodes

00:10:22.517 --> 00:10:25.262
that measure the electrical
pulse of my muscles.

00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:27.205
That's communicated to the bionic limb,

00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:30.282
so when I think about moving
my phantom limb,

00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:33.020
the robot tracks those movement desires.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.262
This diagram shows fundamentally
how the bionic limb is controlled.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.075
So we model the missing biological limb,

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.913
and we've discovered
what reflexes occurred,

00:10:43.937 --> 00:10:47.278
how the reflexes of the spinal cord
are controlling the muscles.

00:10:47.302 --> 00:10:52.199
And that capability is embedded
in the chips of the bionic limb.

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:56.969
What we've done, then, is we modulate
the sensitivity of the reflex,

00:10:56.993 --> 00:11:00.088
the modeled spinal reflex,
with the neural signal,

00:11:00.112 --> 00:11:03.541
so when I relax my muscles
in my residual limb,

00:11:03.565 --> 00:11:06.412
I get very little torque and power,

00:11:06.436 --> 00:11:09.157
but the more I fire my muscles,
the more torque I get,

00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:10.593
and I can even run.

00:11:12.014 --> 00:11:16.958
And that was the first demonstration
of a running gait under neural command.

00:11:16.982 --> 00:11:18.134
Feels great.

00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:23.324
(Applause)

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:25.534
We want to go a step further.

00:11:25.558 --> 00:11:28.605
We want to actually close the loop

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:31.865
between the human
and the bionic external limb.

00:11:32.407 --> 00:11:33.558
We're doing experiments

00:11:33.582 --> 00:11:36.051
where we're growing nerves,
transected nerves,

00:11:36.075 --> 00:11:38.105
through channels, or micro-channel arrays.

00:11:38.129 --> 00:11:39.823
On the other side of the channel,

00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:42.176
the nerve then attaches to cells,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.108
skin cells and muscle cells.

00:11:44.926 --> 00:11:49.046
In the motor channels, we can sense
how the person wishes to move.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.707
That can be sent out wirelessly
to the bionic limb,

00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:55.112
then [sensory information]
on the bionic limb

00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:58.637
can be converted to stimulations
in adjacent channels,

00:11:58.662 --> 00:11:59.894
sensory channels.

00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:03.946
So when this is fully developed
and for human use,

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.606
persons like myself will not only have

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.163
synthetic limbs that move
like flesh and bone,

00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:12.949
but actually feel like flesh and bone.

00:12:14.187 --> 00:12:16.177
This video shows Lisa Mallette,

00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:18.852
shortly after being fitted
with two bionic limbs.

00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:22.964
Indeed, bionics is making
a profound difference in people's lives.

00:12:22.988 --> 00:12:24.741
(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:30.654
LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!

00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:32.121
(Video) (Laughter)

00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:35.094
LM: It's just like I've got a real leg!

00:12:37.237 --> 00:12:38.831
Woman: Now, don't start running.

00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:41.649
Man: Now turn around,
and do the same thing walking up,

00:12:41.673 --> 00:12:45.402
but get on your heel to toe, like you
would normally just walk on level ground.

00:12:45.426 --> 00:12:47.252
Try to walk right up the hill.

00:12:49.411 --> 00:12:51.514
LM: Oh my God.

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.283
Man: Is it pushing you up?

00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:58.262
LM: Yes! I'm not even --
I can't even describe it.

00:12:58.286 --> 00:12:59.799
Man: It's pushing you right up.

00:13:00.608 --> 00:13:03.156
Hugh Herr: Next week,
I'm visiting the Center --

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.332
Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:07.862
(Applause)

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:09.169
Thank you.

00:13:09.193 --> 00:13:13.018
Next week I'm visiting the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services,

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.645
and I'm going to try to convince CMS

00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:18.224
to grant appropriate
code language and pricing,

00:13:18.248 --> 00:13:21.979
so this technology can be made available
to the patients that need it.

00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:23.026
(Applause)

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.210
Thank you.

00:13:24.234 --> 00:13:27.849
(Applause)

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:31.817
It's not well appreciated,
but over half of the world's population

00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:36.608
suffers from some form of cognitive,
emotional, sensory or motor condition,

00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:41.042
and because of poor technology,
too often, conditions result in disability

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:42.701
and a poorer quality of life.

00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:48.053
Basic levels of physiological function
should be a part of our human rights.

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:52.033
Every person should have the right
to live life without disability

00:13:52.057 --> 00:13:53.954
if they so choose --

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:56.700
the right to live life
without severe depression;

00:13:56.724 --> 00:14:00.105
the right to see a loved one,
in the case of seeing-impaired;

00:14:00.129 --> 00:14:02.018
or the right to walk or to dance,

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:04.799
in the case of limb paralysis
or limb amputation.

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:09.299
As a society, we can
achieve these human rights,

00:14:09.323 --> 00:14:14.817
if we accept the proposition
that humans are not disabled.

00:14:15.794 --> 00:14:17.714
A person can never be broken.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.175
Our built environment, our technologies,

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:23.074
are broken and disabled.

00:14:23.444 --> 00:14:26.476
We the people need not
accept our limitations,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.197
but can transcend disability
through technological innovation.

00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:34.559
Indeed, through fundamental advances
in bionics in this century,

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:38.741
we will set the technological foundation
for an enhanced human experience,

00:14:38.765 --> 00:14:40.702
and we will end disability.

00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:45.011
I'd like to finish up
with one more story, a beautiful story.

00:14:45.613 --> 00:14:47.630
The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.198
Adrianne lost her left leg
in the Boston terrorist attack.

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:56.721
I met Adrianne when this photo was taken,
at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.

00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:59.221
Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.

00:14:59.245 --> 00:15:01.858
Adrianne breathes and lives dance.

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:04.636
It is her expression. It is her art form.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.659
Naturally, when she lost her limb
in the Boston terrorist attack,

00:15:08.683 --> 00:15:10.850
she wanted to return to the dance floor.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.987
After meeting her
and driving home in my car,

00:15:14.011 --> 00:15:17.864
I thought, I'm an MIT professor.
I have resources.

00:15:17.888 --> 00:15:19.426
Let's build her a bionic limb,

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.380
to enable her to go back
to her life of dance.

00:15:23.396 --> 00:15:26.872
I brought in MIT scientists
with expertise in prosthetics,

00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:29.205
robotics, machine learning
and biomechanics,

00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:33.064
and over a 200-day research period,
we studied dance.

00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:37.286
We brought in dancers
with biological limbs,

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.945
and we studied how they move,

00:15:39.969 --> 00:15:43.142
what forces they apply on the dance floor,

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:44.693
and we took those data,

00:15:44.717 --> 00:15:48.492
and we put forth
fundamental principles of dance,

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:50.303
reflexive dance capability,

00:15:50.327 --> 00:15:53.492
and we embedded that intelligence
into the bionic limb.

00:15:53.992 --> 00:15:57.737
Bionics is not only about making
people stronger and faster.

00:15:57.761 --> 00:16:03.173
Our expression, our humanity
can be embedded into electromechanics.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.296
It was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts
in the Boston terrorist attack.

00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:15.296
In 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards
took Adrianne off the dance floor.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.026
In 200 days, we put her back.

00:16:18.495 --> 00:16:23.468
We will not be intimidated, brought down,
diminished, conquered or stopped

00:16:23.492 --> 00:16:25.037
by acts of violence.

00:16:25.061 --> 00:16:31.997
(Applause)

00:16:33.046 --> 00:16:37.348
Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me
to introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis,

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.602
her first performance since the attack.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.517
She's dancing with Christian Lightner.

00:16:42.541 --> 00:16:49.233
(Applause)

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:59.694
(Music: "Ring My Bell"
performed by Enrique Iglesias)

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:46.037
(Applause)

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.938
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the research team:

00:18:12.962 --> 00:18:14.957
Elliott Rouse

00:18:14.981 --> 00:18:17.377
and Nathan Villagaray-Carski.

00:18:17.776 --> 00:18:20.163
Elliott and Nathan.

00:18:20.187 --> 00:18:26.772
(Applause)
