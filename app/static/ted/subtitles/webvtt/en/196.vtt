00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the history of music and television on the Internet

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in three minutes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A TED medley --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a TEDley.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
♫ It's nine o' clock on a Saturday ♫

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
♫ The record store's closed for the night ♫

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
♫ So I fire up the old iTunes music store ♫

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ And soon I am feelin' all right ♫

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
♫ I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody ♫

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
♫ With one dollar pricing that rocks ♫

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
♫ I can type in the track and get album names back ♫

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
♫ While still in my PJs and socks ♫

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
♫ Sell us a song, you're the music man ♫

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ My iPod's still got 10 gigs to go ♫

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
♫ Yes, we might prefer more compatibility ♫

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
♫ But Steve likes to run the whole show ♫

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
♫ I heard "Desperate Housewives" was great last night ♫

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
♫ But I had a bad piece of cod ♫

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
♫ As I threw up my meal, I thought, "It's no big deal" ♫

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
♫ I'll watch it tonight on my 'Pod ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
♫ And now all of the networks are joining in ♫

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
♫ Two bucks a show without ads ♫

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
♫ It's a business those guys always wanted to try ♫

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
♫ But only Steve Jobs had the 'nads ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
♫ They say we're young, don't watch TV ♫

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
♫ They say the Internet is all we see ♫

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
♫ But that's not true; they've got it wrong ♫

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
♫ See, all our shows are just two minutes long ♫

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
♫ Hey ♫

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
♫ I got YouTube ♫

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
♫ I got YouTube ♫

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the RIAA!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
♫ Young man, you were surfin' along ♫

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
♫ And then, young man, you downloaded a song ♫

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
♫ And then, dumb man, copied it to your 'Pod ♫

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
♫ Then a phone call came to tell you ... ♫

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
♫ You've just been sued by the R-I-A-A ♫

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
♫ You've just been screwed by the R-I-A-A ♫

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
♫ Their attorneys say you committed a crime ♫

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
♫ And there'd better not be a next time ♫

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
♫ They've lost their minds at the R-I-A-A ♫

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
♫ Justice is blind at the R-I-A-A ♫

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
♫ You're depriving the bands ♫

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
♫ You are learning to steal ♫

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
♫ You can't do whatever you feel ♫

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
♫ CD sales have dropped every year ♫

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
♫ They're not greedy, they're just quaking with fear ♫

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
♫ Yes indeedy, what if their end is near ♫

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
♫ And we download all our music ♫

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
♫ Yeah, that would piss off the R-I-A-A ♫

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
♫ No plastic discs from the R-I-A-A ♫

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
♫ What a way to make friends ♫

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
♫ It's a plan that can't fail ♫

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
♫ All your customers off to jail ♫

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
♫ Who'll be next for the R-I-A-A? ♫

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
♫ What else is vexing the R-I-A-A? ♫

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
♫ Maybe whistling a tune ♫

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
♫ Maybe humming along ♫

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
♫ Maybe mocking 'em in a song ♫
