00:00:01.115 --> 00:00:06.520
So a chip, a poet and a boy.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.485
It's just about 20 years ago,

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:11.989
June 1994, when Intel announced

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.002
that there was a flaw

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.819
at the core of their Pentium chip.

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:19.200
Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.451
to calculate intermediate quotients necessary

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.285
for iterative floating points of divisions --

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:26.384
I don't know what that means, but 
it's what it says on Wikipedia —

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.263
there was a flaw and an error

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.479
that meant that there was a certain probability

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.487
that the result of the calculation would be an error,

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:37.080
and the probability was one out of every

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.617
360 billion calculations.

00:00:40.617 --> 00:00:42.611
So Intel said your average spreadsheet

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:47.117
would be flawed once every 27,000 years.

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:48.411
They didn't think it was significant,

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:51.637
but there was an outrage in the community.

00:00:51.637 --> 00:00:53.987
The community, the techies, said, this flaw

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.068
has to be addressed.

00:00:55.068 --> 00:00:57.069
They were not going to stand by quietly

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.017
as Intel gave them these chips.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.063
So there was a revolution across the world.

00:01:01.063 --> 00:01:04.093
People marched to demand --

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:06.202
okay, not really exactly like that —

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.943
but they rose up and they demanded

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:11.935
that Intel fix the flaw.

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:17.787
And Intel set aside 475 million dollars

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:20.029
to fund the replacement of millions of chips

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:21.120
to fix the flaw.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.332
So billions of dollars in our society

00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:25.516
was spent to address a problem

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:29.607
which would come once out of every 360 billion

00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:31.694
calculations.

00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:34.297
Number two, a poet.

00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:36.577
This is Martin Niemöller.

00:01:36.577 --> 00:01:38.110
You're familiar with his poetry.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.886
Around the height of the Nazi period,

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:42.158
he started repeating the verse,

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:43.893
"First they came for the communists,

00:01:43.893 --> 00:01:45.424
and I did nothing,

00:01:45.424 --> 00:01:47.674
did not speak out because I was not a communist.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.728
Then they came for the socialists.

00:01:48.728 --> 00:01:50.690
Then they came for the trade unions.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.936
Then they came for the Jews.

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.838
And then they came for me.

00:01:54.838 --> 00:01:59.509
But there was no one left to speak for me."

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.638
Now, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.

00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:05.970
This is an insight at the core of intelligence.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.684
We could call it cluefulness.

00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:11.245
It's a certain kind of test:

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:13.037
Can you recognize

00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:15.541
an underlying threat and respond?

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:19.031
Can you save yourself or save your kind?

00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:20.770
Turns out ants are pretty good at this.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.853
Cows, not so much.

00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:25.283
So can you see the pattern?

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:27.630
Can you see a pattern and then recognize

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.682
and do something about it? Number two.

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:33.609
Number three, a boy.

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.910
This is my friend Aaron Swartz.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.341
He's Tim's friend.

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:39.373
He's friends of many of you in this audience,

00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:40.798
and seven years ago,

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:43.784
Aaron came to me with a question.

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:46.367
It was just before I was going
to give my first TED Talk.

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:48.790
I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.297
"Laws that choke creativity."

00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:52.906
And Aaron looked at me

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.857
and was a little impatient, and he said,

00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:58.950
"So how are you ever

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.990
going to solve the problems you're talking about?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.792
Copyright policy, Internet policy,

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:05.982
how are you ever going to address those problems

00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:09.215
so long as there's this fundamental corruption

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:12.060
in the way our government works?"

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.665
So I was a little put off by this.

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.650
He wasn't sharing in my celebration.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.817
And I said to him, "You know, Aaron,

00:03:17.817 --> 00:03:20.911
it's not my field, not my field."

00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:23.467
He said, "You mean as an
academic, it's not your field?"

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:26.061
I said, "Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field."

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:29.392
He said, "What about as a citizen?

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:32.819
As a citizen."

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.415
Now, this is the way Aaron was.

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:39.476
He didn't tell. He asked questions.

00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:41.226
But his questions spoke as clearly

00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:43.914
as my four-year-old's hug.

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:45.330
He was saying to me,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.262
"You've got to get a clue.

00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:48.938
You have got to get a clue, because there is

00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:52.000
a flaw at the core of the operating system

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.507
of this democracy,

00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:57.805
and it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times

00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:59.597
our democracy tries to make a decision.

00:03:59.597 --> 00:04:01.418
It is every time,

00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:03.814
every single important issue.

00:04:03.814 --> 00:04:08.347
We've got to end the bovinity of this political society.

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:09.990
We've got to adopt, it turns out,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.762
the word is fourmi-formatic attitude --

00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:14.532
that's what the Internet tells me the word is --

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:16.604
the ant's appreciative attitude

00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:19.242
that gets us to recognize this flaw,

00:04:19.242 --> 00:04:25.055
save our kind and save our demos.

00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:26.533
Now if you know Aaron Swartz,

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:30.171
you know that we lost him

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:32.503
just over a year ago.

00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:34.039
It was about six weeks

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.919
before I gave my TED Talk,

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.814
and I was so grateful to Chris

00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:39.245
that he asked me to give this TED Talk,

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.445
not because I had the chance to talk to you,

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.729
although that was great,

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.162
but because it pulled me out
of an extraordinary depression.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:51.671
I couldn't begin to describe the sadness.

00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:52.951
Because I had to focus.

00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:57.266
I had to focus on, what was I going to say to you?

00:04:57.266 --> 00:04:59.468
It saved me.

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:01.417
But after the buzz, the excitement,

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:05.892
the power that comes from this community,

00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:08.443
I began to yearn for a less sterile,

00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:10.960
less academic way to address these issues,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.749
the issues that I was talking about.

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.605
We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire

00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:19.273
as a target for this political movement,

00:05:19.273 --> 00:05:21.810
because the primary in New Hampshire

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.600
is so incredibly important.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.201
It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.519
that was beginning to talk about, how would we make

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.769
this issue of this corruption central in 2016?

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:35.210
But it was another soul that caught my imagination,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.547
a woman named Doris Haddock, aka Granny D.

00:05:40.547 --> 00:05:43.909
On January 1, 1999, 15 years ago,

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.738
at the age of 88, Granny D started a walk.

00:05:48.738 --> 00:05:52.008
She started in Los Angeles

00:05:52.008 --> 00:05:54.970
and began to walk to Washington, D.C.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.698
with a single sign on her chest that said,

00:05:57.698 --> 00:06:00.282
"campaign finance reform."

00:06:00.282 --> 00:06:03.010
Eighteen months later,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.820
at the age of 90,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.346
she arrived in Washington
with hundreds following her,

00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:09.664
including many congressmen
who had gotten in a car

00:06:09.664 --> 00:06:12.572
and driven out about a mile outside of the city

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:14.460
to walk in with her.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.602
(Laughter)

00:06:16.602 --> 00:06:19.892
Now, I don't have 13 months

00:06:19.892 --> 00:06:21.534
to walk across the country.

00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:24.176
I've got three kids who hate to walk,

00:06:24.176 --> 00:06:25.578
and a wife who, it turns out,

00:06:25.578 --> 00:06:27.476
still hates when I'm not there

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:28.645
for mysterious reasons,

00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:29.950
so this was not an option,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.110
but the question I asked,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.658
could we remix Granny D a bit?

00:06:33.658 --> 00:06:35.790
What about a walk not of 3,200 miles

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.710
but of 185 miles across New Hampshire

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.314
in January?

00:06:43.314 --> 00:06:45.540
So on January 11,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.426
the anniversary of Aaron's death,

00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:52.169
we began a walk that ended on January 24th,

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.515
the day that Granny D was born.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:01.095
A total of 200 people joined us across this walk,

00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:04.869
as we went from the very top to the
very bottom of New Hampshire

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:07.265
talking about this issue.

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:08.865
And what was astonishing to me,

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:11.426
something I completely did not expect to find,

00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:14.021
was the passion and anger

00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:19.496
that there was among everyone
that we talked to about this issue.

00:07:19.496 --> 00:07:24.602
We had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans

00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:26.441
believe it important to reduce the influence

00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:28.687
of money in politics.

00:07:28.687 --> 00:07:30.703
Now politicians and pundits tell you,

00:07:30.703 --> 00:07:32.523
there's nothing we can do about this issue,

00:07:32.523 --> 00:07:33.859
Americans don't care about it,

00:07:33.859 --> 00:07:36.155
but the reason for that is

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:38.009
that 91 percent of Americans

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.531
think there's nothing that can
be done about this issue.

00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:45.353
And it's this gap between 96 and 91

00:07:45.353 --> 00:07:47.830
that explains our politics of resignation.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.913
I mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:51.775
wish we could fly like Superman,

00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:54.939
but because at least 91 percent
of us believe we can't,

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:57.605
we don't leap off of tall buildings every time

00:07:57.605 --> 00:07:58.915
we have that urge.

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:00.921
That's because we accept our limits,

00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:03.680
and so too with this reform.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.973
But when you give people the sense of hope,

00:08:07.973 --> 00:08:14.690
you begin to thaw that
absolute sense of impossibility.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.305
As Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope,

00:08:18.305 --> 00:08:21.020
you give 'em a chance, a way to think

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.109
about how this change is possible.

00:08:23.109 --> 00:08:25.960
Hope.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.530
And hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.527
failed him with, because we let him

00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:38.127
lose that sense of hope.

00:08:38.127 --> 00:08:42.079
I loved that boy like I love my son.

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:50.202
But we failed him.

00:08:50.202 --> 00:08:53.790
And I love my country,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.144
and I'm not going to fail that.

00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:57.316
I'm not going to fail that.

00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:01.009
That sense of hope, we're going to hold,

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:02.475
and we're going to fight for,

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:07.175
however impossible this battle looks.

00:09:07.175 --> 00:09:08.469
What's next?

00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:11.630
Well, we started with this march with 200 people,

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.032
and next year, there will be 1,000

00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:16.671
on different routes

00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:19.181
that march in the month of January

00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:23.009
and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause,

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:25.569
and then in 2016, before the primary,

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:28.530
there will be 10,000 who march across that state,

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.594
meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause.

00:09:31.594 --> 00:09:34.365
And as we have marched, people around the country

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:36.223
have begun to say, "Can we do the same thing

00:09:36.223 --> 00:09:37.340
in our state?"

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.719
So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers,

00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:41.710
that is, Granny D walkers,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.837
and Granny D walkers across the country

00:09:43.837 --> 00:09:46.939
will be marching for this reform. Number one.

00:09:46.939 --> 00:09:49.219
Number two, on this march,

00:09:49.219 --> 00:09:52.011
one of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino,

00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:53.630
was with us,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.488
and he said, "Well what can we do?"

00:09:55.488 --> 00:09:57.817
And so they developed a platform,

00:09:57.817 --> 00:09:59.739
which we are announcing today,

00:09:59.739 --> 00:10:02.205
that allows us to pull together voters

00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:04.883
who are committed to this idea of reform.

00:10:04.883 --> 00:10:06.029
Regardless of where you are,

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:08.681
in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire,

00:10:08.681 --> 00:10:10.591
you can sign up and directly be informed

00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:13.579
where the candidates are on this issue

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.219
so you can decide who to vote for

00:10:15.219 --> 00:10:18.137
as a function of which is going

00:10:18.137 --> 00:10:22.605
to make this possibility real.

00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:26.677
And then finally number three, the hardest.

00:10:26.677 --> 00:10:28.500
We're in the age of the Super PAC.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.609
Indeed yesterday, Merriam announced

00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:34.859
that Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.

00:10:34.859 --> 00:10:38.499
It is now an official word in the dictionary.

00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:43.894
So on May 1, aka May Day,

00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:46.681
we're going to try an experiment.

00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:48.498
We're going to try a launching

00:10:48.498 --> 00:10:50.796
of what we can think of as a Super PAC

00:10:50.796 --> 00:10:54.060
to end all Super PACs.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.860
And the basic way this works is this.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.632
For the last year, we have been working

00:10:57.632 --> 00:11:01.352
with analysts and political experts

00:11:01.352 --> 00:11:04.684
to calculate, how much would it cost

00:11:04.684 --> 00:11:07.106
to win enough votes in the United States Congress

00:11:07.106 --> 00:11:08.926
to make fundamental reform possible?

00:11:08.926 --> 00:11:11.728
What is that number? Half a billion? A billion?

00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:13.568
What is that number?

00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:16.333
And then whatever that number is,

00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.438
we are going to kickstart, sort of,

00:11:18.438 --> 00:11:20.369
because you can't use KickStarter for political work,

00:11:20.369 --> 00:11:23.140
but anyway, kickstart, sort of,

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.496
first a bottom-up campaign

00:11:25.496 --> 00:11:28.476
where people will make small dollar commitments

00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:31.438
contingent on reaching very ambitious goals,

00:11:31.438 --> 00:11:33.438
and when those goals have been reached,

00:11:33.438 --> 00:11:37.577
we will turn to the large dollar contributors,

00:11:37.577 --> 00:11:40.959
to get them to contribute to make it possible

00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:44.482
for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary

00:11:44.482 --> 00:11:45.824
to win this issue,

00:11:45.824 --> 00:11:48.718
to change the way money influences politics,

00:11:48.718 --> 00:11:52.489
so that on November 8,

00:11:52.489 --> 00:11:54.817
which I discovered yesterday is the day

00:11:54.817 --> 00:11:58.508
that Aaron would have been 30 years old,

00:11:58.508 --> 00:12:01.200
on November 8,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.739
we will celebrate 218 representatives

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:06.826
in the House and 60 Senators

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:08.847
in the United States Senate

00:12:08.847 --> 00:12:11.140
who have committed to this idea

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.006
of fundamental reform.

00:12:13.006 --> 00:12:16.768
So last night, we heard about wishes.

00:12:16.768 --> 00:12:18.856
Here's my wish.

00:12:18.856 --> 00:12:22.100
May one.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.483
May the ideals of one boy

00:12:25.483 --> 00:12:29.964
unite one nation behind one critical idea

00:12:29.964 --> 00:12:32.425
that we are one people,

00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:35.902
we are the people who were promised a government,

00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:38.031
a government that was promised to be

00:12:38.031 --> 00:12:42.752
dependent upon the people alone, the people,

00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:45.601
who, as Madison told us,

00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:49.178
meant not the rich more than the poor.

00:12:49.178 --> 00:12:51.324
May one.

00:12:51.324 --> 00:12:55.503
And then may you, may you join this movement,

00:12:55.503 --> 00:12:57.511
not because you're a politician,

00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:59.127
not because you're an expert,

00:12:59.127 --> 00:13:02.419
not because this is your field,

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:04.099
but because if you are,

00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:07.770
you are a citizen.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.807
Aaron asked me that.

00:13:10.807 --> 00:13:13.662
Now I've asked you.

00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:15.340
Thank you very much.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:23.385
(Applause)
