00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:06.071
The world makes you something that you're not,

00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:08.972
but you know inside what you are,

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:11.852
and that question burns in your heart:

00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:14.846
How will you become that?

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:17.212
I may be somewhat unique in this,

00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:19.241
but I am not alone,

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:22.341
not alone at all.

00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:24.461
So when I became a fashion model,

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:26.161
I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.417
that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:33.547
My outside self finally matched my inner truth,

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:35.925
my inner self.

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:40.082
For complicated reasons which I'll get to later,

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:43.030
when I look at this picture,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.574
at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,

00:00:45.574 --> 00:00:46.913
you've made it,

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:49.734
you have arrived.

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:52.324
But this past October,

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:56.982
I realized that I'm only just beginning.

00:00:56.982 --> 00:01:01.112
All of us are put in boxes by our family,

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:02.782
by our religion,

00:01:02.782 --> 00:01:04.726
by our society,

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:07.099
our moment in history,

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.571
even our own bodies.

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.347
Some people have the courage to break free,

00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:14.786
not to accept the limitations imposed by

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:16.506
the color of their skin

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:20.293
or by the beliefs of those that surround them.

00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:22.085
Those people are always the threat

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:23.309
to the status quo,

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:27.804
to what is considered acceptable.

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:33.593
In my case, for the last nine years,

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.287
some of my neighbors,

00:01:35.287 --> 00:01:38.291
some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.901
did not know about my history.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.657
I think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.

00:01:44.657 --> 00:01:48.282
Here is mine.

00:01:48.282 --> 00:01:51.095
I was assigned boy at birth

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.177
based on the appearance of my genitalia.

00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:56.095
I remember when I was five years old

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.575
in the Philippines walking around our house,

00:01:58.575 --> 00:02:01.946
I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:03.441
And my mom asked me,

00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:06.021
"How come you always wear
that t-shirt on your head?"

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:11.219
I said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.656
I knew then how to self-identify.

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:20.363
Gender has always been considered a fact,

00:02:20.363 --> 00:02:22.235
immutable,

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:25.862
but we now know it's actually more fluid,

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:29.877
complex and mysterious.

00:02:29.877 --> 00:02:32.290
Because of my success, I never had the courage

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.940
to share my story,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.553
not because I thought what I am is wrong,

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:40.555
but because of how the world treats those of us

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.757
who wish to break free.

00:02:43.757 --> 00:02:45.495
Every day,

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:49.431
I am so grateful because I am a woman.

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:52.907
I have a mom and dad and family

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:55.752
who accepted me for who I am.

00:02:55.752 --> 00:03:00.631
Many are not so fortunate.

00:03:00.631 --> 00:03:02.706
There's a long tradition in Asian culture

00:03:02.706 --> 00:03:06.284
that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.

00:03:06.284 --> 00:03:09.085
There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:13.351
There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.

00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:15.700
So when I was eight years old,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.310
I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.428
these mysteries.

00:03:20.428 --> 00:03:22.866
I was in front of the stage,

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:25.977
and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:27.137
right in front of me,

00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:29.423
and I remember that moment something hit me:

00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:33.133
That is the kind of woman I would like to be.

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.693
So when I was 15 years old,

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:37.110
still dressing as a boy,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.524
I met this woman named T.L.

00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:43.188
She is a transgender beauty pageant manager.

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:44.870
That night she asked me,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.636
"How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"

00:03:47.636 --> 00:03:49.852
She convinced me that if I joined

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:53.175
that she would take care of the registration fee

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:54.787
and the garments,

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:56.946
and that night,

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:59.026
I won best in swimsuit

00:03:59.026 --> 00:04:00.540
and best in long gown

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.189
and placed second runner up

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.928
among 40-plus candidates.

00:04:05.928 --> 00:04:08.554
That moment changed my life.

00:04:08.554 --> 00:04:10.197
All of a sudden, I was introduced

00:04:10.197 --> 00:04:13.066
to the world of beauty pageants.

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:15.890
Not a lot of people could say that your first job

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.702
is a pageant queen for transgender women,

00:04:17.702 --> 00:04:20.578
but I'll take it.

00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:22.871
So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined

00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.338
the most prestigious pageant

00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:29.879
to the pageant where it's at
the back of the truck, literally,

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.046
or sometimes it would be a
pavement next to a rice field,

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:34.967
and when it rains --

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.714
it rains a lot in the Philippines --

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:39.022
the organizers would have to move it

00:04:39.022 --> 00:04:43.097
inside someone's house.

00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:45.374
I also experienced the goodness of strangers,

00:04:45.374 --> 00:04:46.719
especially when we would travel

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.688
in remote provinces in the Philippines.

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:51.179
But most importantly, I met

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:54.571
some of my best friends in that community.

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.997
In 2001,

00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:59.024
my mom, who had moved to San Francisco,

00:04:59.024 --> 00:05:02.851
called me and told me that my
green card petition came through,

00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:06.134
that I could now move to the United States.

00:05:06.134 --> 00:05:07.528
I resisted it.

00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:09.597
I told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.

00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:10.507
I'm here with my friends,

00:05:10.507 --> 00:05:14.041
I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:17.138
But then two weeks later she called me, she said,

00:05:17.138 --> 00:05:19.835
"Did you know that if you move to the United States

00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:23.068
you could change your name and gender marker?"

00:05:23.068 --> 00:05:26.113
That was all I needed to hear.

00:05:26.113 --> 00:05:27.949
My mom also told me to put two E's

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.030
in the spelling of my name.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.413
She also came with me when I had my surgery

00:05:32.413 --> 00:05:35.412
in Thailand at 19 years old.

00:05:35.412 --> 00:05:38.940
It's interesting, in some of the
most rural cities in Thailand,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.051
they perform some of the most prestigious,

00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:46.440
safe and sophisticated surgery.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.075
At that time in the United States,

00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:49.543
you needed to have surgery

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:52.858
before you could change your
name and gender marker.

00:05:52.858 --> 00:05:57.094
So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,

00:05:57.094 --> 00:06:01.523
and I remember looking at
my California driver's license

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:03.509
with the name Geena

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.913
and gender marker F.

00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:08.505
That was a powerful moment.

00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:10.367
For some people,

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:12.294
their I.D. is their license to drive

00:06:12.294 --> 00:06:14.741
or even to get a drink,

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:18.395
but for me, that was my license to live,

00:06:18.395 --> 00:06:20.937
to feel dignified.

00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:23.524
All of a sudden, my fears were minimized.

00:06:23.524 --> 00:06:25.881
I felt that I could conquer my dream

00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:29.778
and move to New York and be a model.

00:06:29.778 --> 00:06:33.085
Many are not so fortunate.

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:36.536
I think of this woman named Islan Nettles.

00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:38.504
She's from New York, she's a young woman

00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:41.024
who was courageously living her truth,

00:06:41.024 --> 00:06:44.077
but hatred ended her life.

00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:46.638
For most of my community,

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:49.570
this is the reality in which we live.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.058
Our suicide rate is nine times higher

00:06:52.058 --> 00:06:54.994
than that of the general population.

00:06:54.994 --> 00:06:56.961
Every November 20,

00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.927
we have a global vigil

00:06:58.927 --> 00:07:02.077
for Transgender Day of Remembrance.

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:03.438
I'm here at this stage

00:07:03.438 --> 00:07:06.287
because it's a long history of people who fought

00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:08.551
and stood up for injustice.

00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:13.076
This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:16.797
Today, this very moment,

00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:19.924
is my real coming out.

00:07:19.924 --> 00:07:22.487
I could no longer live my truth

00:07:22.487 --> 00:07:25.318
for and by myself.

00:07:25.318 --> 00:07:27.483
I want to do my best to help others

00:07:27.483 --> 00:07:32.236
live their truth without shame and terror.

00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:36.819
I am here, exposed,

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:39.261
so that one day there will never be a need

00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:43.132
for a November 20 vigil.

00:07:43.132 --> 00:07:49.397
My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.

00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:51.182
Will you?

00:07:51.182 --> 00:07:53.156
Thank you very much.

00:07:53.156 --> 00:07:56.113
(Applause)

00:07:56.113 --> 00:08:00.899
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:04.376
Kathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.

00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:06.213
I'm wondering what you would say,

00:08:06.213 --> 00:08:08.086
especially to parents,

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:10.043
but in a more broad way, to friends,

00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:12.607
to family, to anyone who finds themselves

00:08:12.607 --> 00:08:14.729
encountering a child or a person

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:16.289
who is struggling with and uncomfortable with

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:18.178
a gender that's being assigned them,

00:08:18.178 --> 00:08:20.019
what might you say

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:22.178
to the family members of that person

00:08:22.178 --> 00:08:24.957
to help them become good and caring and kind

00:08:24.957 --> 00:08:26.571
family members to them?

00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:28.623
Geena Rocero: Sure. Well,
first, really, I'm so blessed.

00:08:28.623 --> 00:08:31.724
The support system, with my mom especially,

00:08:31.724 --> 00:08:33.430
and my family, that in itself

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.691
is just so powerful.

00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:37.511
I remember every time I would coach

00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:40.063
young trans women, I would mentor them,

00:08:40.063 --> 00:08:42.481
and sometimes when they would call me

00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:44.984
and tell me that their parents can't accept it,

00:08:44.984 --> 00:08:46.790
I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.113
"Mom, can you call this woman?"

00:08:48.113 --> 00:08:51.614
And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so —

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:55.128
But it's just, gender identity

00:08:55.128 --> 00:08:57.500
is in the core of our being, right?

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.142
I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,

00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:03.017
so what I'm trying to do

00:09:03.017 --> 00:09:05.488
is to have this conversation that

00:09:05.488 --> 00:09:08.897
sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,

00:09:08.897 --> 00:09:10.828
and there should be a space

00:09:10.828 --> 00:09:13.523
that would allow people to self-identify,

00:09:13.523 --> 00:09:15.130
and that's a conversation that we should have

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.222
with parents, with colleagues.

00:09:18.222 --> 00:09:19.597
The transgender movement,

00:09:19.597 --> 00:09:22.222
it's at the very beginning,

00:09:22.222 --> 00:09:25.181
to compare to how the gay movement started.

00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:27.731
There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.

00:09:27.731 --> 00:09:29.336
There should be an understanding.

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:31.295
There should be a space of curiosity

00:09:31.295 --> 00:09:33.869
and asking questions,

00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:36.512
and I hope all of you guys will be my allies.

00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:38.759
KS: Thank you. That was so lovely.
GR: Thank you.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:42.147
