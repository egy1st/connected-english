00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:04.420
If you look deep into the night sky,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.036
you see stars,

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:08.608
and if you look further, you see more stars,

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:10.767
and further, galaxies, and 
further, more galaxies.

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:14.640
But if you keep looking further and further,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.756
eventually you see nothing for a long while,

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:22.218
and then finally you see a
faint, fading afterglow,

00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:25.242
and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:28.059
Now, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:30.230
when everything we see in the night sky

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.640
was condensed into an incredibly small,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.966
incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.658
and from it sprung everything we see.

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:42.517
Now, we've mapped that afterglow

00:00:42.517 --> 00:00:44.196
with great precision,

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.240
and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.116
We've mapped the afterglow

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:49.438
with spectacular precision,

00:00:49.438 --> 00:00:50.986
and one of the shocks about it

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:53.932
is that it's almost completely uniform.

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:55.890
Fourteen billion light years that way

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.750
and 14 billion light years that way,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.158
it's the same temperature.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.472
Now it's been 14 billion years

00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:04.290
since that Big Bang,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.762
and so it's got faint and cold.

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:09.070
It's now 2.7 degrees.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.350
But it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.644
It's only 2.7 degrees to about

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:15.486
10 parts in a million.

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:16.480
Over here, it's a little hotter,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.348
and over there, it's a little cooler,

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:21.436
and that's incredibly important
to everyone in this room,

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:23.160
because where it was a little hotter,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.856
there was a little more stuff,

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.423
and where there was a little more stuff,

00:01:26.423 --> 00:01:28.392
we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:29.644
and superclusters

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:32.352
and all the structure you see in the cosmos.

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:35.464
And those small, little, inhomogeneities,

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.746
20 parts in a million,

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:40.500
those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.308
in that early universe that were stretched

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:44.587
across the size of the entire cosmos.

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:46.301
That is spectacular,

00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:47.966
and that's not what they found on Monday;

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.002
what they found on Monday is cooler.

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.268
So here's what they found on Monday:

00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:55.771
Imagine you take a bell,

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:57.382
and you whack the bell with a hammer.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.058
What happens? It rings.

00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:01.266
But if you wait, that ringing fades

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.886
and fades and fades

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:04.828
until you don't notice it anymore.

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:07.476
Now, that early universe was incredibly dense,

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:09.555
like a metal, way denser,

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:11.960
and if you hit it, it would ring,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.823
but the thing ringing would be

00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:15.911
the structure of space-time itself,

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:18.727
and the hammer would be quantum mechanics.

00:02:18.727 --> 00:02:20.658
What they found on Monday

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:23.020
was evidence of the ringing

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.335
of the space-time of the early universe,

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:27.440
what we call gravitational waves

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.960
from the fundamental era,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.935
and here's how they found it.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:33.007
Those waves have long since faded.

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:34.495
If you go for a walk,

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:36.083
you don't wiggle.

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:38.831
Those gravitational waves in the structure of space

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:41.605
are totally invisible for all practical purposes.

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:44.509
But early on, when the universe was making

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.879
that last afterglow,

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.437
the gravitational waves

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:51.300
put little twists in the structure

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.827
of the light that we see.

00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:55.793
So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper --

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:58.431
in fact, these guys spent
three years on the South Pole

00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:01.020
looking straight up through the coldest, clearest,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.370
cleanest air they possibly could find

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.799
looking deep into the night sky and studying

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.175
that glow and looking for the faint twists

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:11.523
which are the symbol, the signal,

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:13.343
of gravitational waves,

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.684
the ringing of the early universe.

00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:17.471
And on Monday, they announced

00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.215
that they had found it.

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:21.642
And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me

00:03:21.642 --> 00:03:24.390
is not just the ringing, though that is awesome.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.748
The thing that's totally amazing,

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.850
the reason I'm on this stage, is because

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.318
what that tells us is something
deep about the early universe.

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:32.982
It tells us that we

00:03:32.982 --> 00:03:34.418
and everything we see around us

00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:37.372
are basically one large bubble --

00:03:37.372 --> 00:03:39.128
and this is the idea of inflationâ€”

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:43.020
one large bubble surrounded by something else.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.150
This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.324
but anything that isn't inflation that explains this

00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:48.641
will look the same.

00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:50.286
This is a theory, an idea,

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:51.510
that has been around for a while,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.235
and we never thought we we'd really see it.

00:03:53.235 --> 00:03:55.073
For good reasons, we thought we'd never see

00:03:55.073 --> 00:03:57.321
killer evidence, and this is killer evidence.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:59.331
But the really crazy idea

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.363
is that our bubble is just one bubble

00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:06.989
in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.815
We're never going to see the stuff outside,

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.389
but by going to the South Pole
and spending three years

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.949
looking at the detailed structure of the night sky,

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.805
we can figure out

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:18.895
that we're probably in a universe
that looks kind of like that.

00:04:18.895 --> 00:04:21.317
And that amazes me.

00:04:21.317 --> 00:04:22.653
Thanks a lot.

00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:25.589
(Applause)
