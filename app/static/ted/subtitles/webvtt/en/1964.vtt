WEBVTT

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.947
Chris Anderson: So, this is an
interview with a difference.

00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:09.015
On the basis that a picture
is worth a thousand words,

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:11.911
what I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.118
to dig out from their archive

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.216
some images that would help explain

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.652
some of what they've done,

00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:20.249
and do a few things that way.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.980
So, we're going to start here.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.183
Melinda, when and where was this,

00:00:26.183 --> 00:00:28.217
and who is that handsome man next to you?

00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:30.226
Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:32.265
This is in Africa, our very first trip,

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.170
the first time either of us had ever been to Africa,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.780
in the fall of 1993.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.768
We were already engaged to be married.

00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:39.474
We married a few months later,

00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:41.691
and this was the trip where we really went to see

00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:43.583
the animals and to see the savanna.

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:45.571
It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:46.983
off from work.

00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:51.610
But what really touched us, actually, were the people,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.218
and the extreme poverty.

00:00:54.218 --> 00:00:55.791
We started asking ourselves questions.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.595
Does it have to be like this?

00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:58.546
And at the end of the trip,

00:00:58.546 --> 00:00:59.646
we went out to Zanzibar,

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:01.134
and took some time to walk on the beach,

00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:02.500
which is something we had done a lot

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.818
while we were dating.

00:01:03.818 --> 00:01:06.791
And we'd already been talking about during that time

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:08.648
that the wealth that had come from Microsoft

00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:09.923
would be given back to society,

00:01:09.923 --> 00:01:11.497
but it was really on that beach walk

00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:13.069
that we started to talk about, well,

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:16.602
what might we do and how might we go about it?

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:19.334
CA: So, given that this vacation

00:01:19.334 --> 00:01:21.526
led to the creation of

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:24.342
the world's biggest private foundation,

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:27.474
it's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter)

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.942
MG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:32.840
CA: Which of you was the key instigator here,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.793
or was it symmetrical?

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:38.186
Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excited

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:39.653
that there'd be a phase of our life

00:01:39.653 --> 00:01:41.714
where we'd get to work together

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:48.325
and figure out how to give this money back.

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:51.474
At this stage, we were talking about the poorest,

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:53.876
and could you have a big impact on them?

00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:55.801
Were there things that weren't being done?

00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.701
There was a lot we didn't know.

00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.789
Our naïveté is pretty incredible,

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:00.881
when we look back on it.

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.437
But we had a certain enthusiasm

00:02:02.437 --> 00:02:05.434
that that would be the phase,

00:02:05.434 --> 00:02:08.160
the post-Microsoft phase

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.388
would be our philanthropy.

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:12.534
MG: Which Bill always thought was going to come

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:13.670
after he was 60,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.332
so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:18.525
so some things change along the way.

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:20.969
CA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.489
So that was '93, and it was '97, really,

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.227
before the foundation itself started.

00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:27.532
MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article

00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:30.946
about diarrheal diseases killing
so many kids around the world,

00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:32.560
and we kept saying to ourselves,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.800
"Well that can't be.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.554
In the U.S., you just go down to the drug store."

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.719
And so we started gathering scientists

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.185
and started learning about population,

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:41.545
learning about vaccines,

00:02:41.545 --> 00:02:43.932
learning about what had worked and what had failed,

00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:45.838
and that's really when we got going,

00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:50.215
was in late 1998, 1999.

00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:52.966
CA: So, you've got a big pot of money

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:55.293
and a world full of so many different issues.

00:02:55.293 --> 00:02:59.515
How on Earth do you decide what to focus on?

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.060
BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.920
whatever the biggest inequity was globally,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.180
and there we looked at children dying,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.920
children not having enough nutrition to ever develop,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.419
and countries that were really stuck,

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.679
because with that level of death,

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.647
and parents would have so many kids

00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:17.165
that they'd get huge population growth,

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:20.291
and that the kids were so sick

00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:22.937
that they really couldn't be educated

00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:24.809
and lift themselves up.

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:25.917
So that was our global thing,

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:28.637
and then in the U.S.,

00:03:28.637 --> 00:03:31.411
both of us have had amazing educations,

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.460
and we saw that as the way that the U.S.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.472
could live up to its promise of equal opportunity

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:40.057
is by having a phenomenal education system,

00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:42.685
and the more we learned, the more we realized

00:03:42.685 --> 00:03:45.113
we're not really fulfilling that promise.

00:03:45.113 --> 00:03:46.950
And so we picked those two things,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.602
and everything the foundation does

00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:51.616
is focused there.

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:53.952
CA: So, I asked each of you to pick an image

00:03:53.952 --> 00:03:56.384
that you like that illustrates your work,

00:03:56.384 --> 00:03:59.452
and Melinda, this is what you picked.

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:00.919
What's this about?

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.950
MG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.060
is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.658
whether it's Bangladesh, India,
lots of countries in Africa,

00:04:09.658 --> 00:04:12.066
and I go in as a Western woman without a name.

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:15.475
I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.

00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:16.979
And I kept hearing from women,

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.862
over and over and over, the more I traveled,

00:04:19.862 --> 00:04:22.271
"I want to be able to use this shot."

00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:24.840
I would be there to talk to them
about childhood vaccines,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.240
and they would bring the conversation around to

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.221
"But what about the shot I get?"

00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:31.673
which is an injection they were
getting called Depo-Provera,

00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:33.654
which is a contraceptive.

00:04:33.654 --> 00:04:35.986
And I would come back and
talk to global health experts,

00:04:35.986 --> 00:04:37.539
and they'd say, "Oh no, contraceptives

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.931
are stocked in in the developing world."

00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:41.921
Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports,

00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.697
and this is what the team came to me with,

00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:45.843
which is, to have the number one thing

00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:48.981
that women tell you in Africa they want to use

00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:51.598
stocked out more than 200 days a year

00:04:51.598 --> 00:04:53.502
explains why women were saying to me,

00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:57.054
"I walked 10 kilometers without
my husband knowing it,

00:04:57.054 --> 00:05:00.363
and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there."

00:05:00.363 --> 00:05:03.170
And so condoms were stocked in in Africa

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.447
because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.

00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:06.851
and others supported.

00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:08.522
But women will tell you over and over again,

00:05:08.522 --> 00:05:11.132
"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband.

00:05:11.132 --> 00:05:15.340
I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.100
and I need that tool because then I can space

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.517
the births of my children, and I can feed them

00:05:20.517 --> 00:05:23.055
and have a chance of educating them."

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:25.105
CA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,

00:05:25.105 --> 00:05:28.674
and you've often been embroiled

00:05:28.674 --> 00:05:30.628
in controversy over this issue,

00:05:30.628 --> 00:05:32.877
and on the abortion question,

00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:34.332
on both sides, really.

00:05:34.332 --> 00:05:36.023
How do you navigate that?

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:39.133
MG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:42.216
which is, we had backed away from contraceptives

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:43.383
as a global community.

00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:46.677
We knew that 210 million women

00:05:46.677 --> 00:05:48.936
were saying they wanted access to contraceptives,

00:05:48.936 --> 00:05:51.576
even the contraceptives we have
here in the United States,

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:53.881
and we weren't providing them

00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:57.632
because of the political controversy in our country,

00:05:57.632 --> 00:05:59.809
and to me that was just a crime,

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:02.574
and I kept looking around trying to find the person

00:06:02.574 --> 00:06:04.924
that would get this back on the global stage,

00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:06.930
and I finally realized I just had to do it.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.601
And even though I'm Catholic,

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.042
I believe in contraceptives

00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:12.338
just like most of the Catholic
women in the United States

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:14.169
who report using contraceptives,

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.454
and I shouldn't let that controversy

00:06:16.454 --> 00:06:18.269
be the thing that holds us back.

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:20.227
We used to have consensus in the United States

00:06:20.227 --> 00:06:21.492
around contraceptives,

00:06:21.492 --> 00:06:23.972
and so we got back to that global consensus,

00:06:23.972 --> 00:06:26.616
and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars

00:06:26.616 --> 00:06:29.149
around exactly this issue for women.

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:34.616
(Applause)

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:41.105
CA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?

00:06:41.105 --> 00:06:43.090
BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.208
(Laughter)

00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:47.025
I really like this graph.

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:50.000
This is the number of children

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.562
who die before the age of five every year.

00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:54.405
And what you find is really

00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.355
a phenomenal success story

00:06:56.355 --> 00:06:58.509
which is not widely known,

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:01.184
that we are making incredible progress.

00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:03.562
We go from 20 million

00:07:03.562 --> 00:07:05.266
not long after I was born

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:08.952
to now we're down to about six million.

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:11.089
So this is a story

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:12.756
largely of vaccines.

00:07:12.756 --> 00:07:15.880
Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.070
That was eradicated, so that got down to zero.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.910
Measles was killing a couple million a year.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.613
That's down to a few hundred thousand.

00:07:21.613 --> 00:07:23.521
Anyway, this is a chart

00:07:23.521 --> 00:07:27.708
where you want to get that number to continue,

00:07:27.708 --> 00:07:29.448
and it's going to be possible,

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:31.124
using the science of new vaccines,

00:07:31.124 --> 00:07:33.016
getting the vaccines out to kids.

00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:34.740
We can actually accelerate the progress.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.303
The last decade,

00:07:36.303 --> 00:07:38.115
that number has dropped faster

00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:40.393
than ever in history,

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:43.116
and so I just love the fact that

00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:45.381
you can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:46.889
we can get them out there,

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:49.374
use the very latest understanding of these things,

00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:53.985
and get the delivery right, that
we can perform a miracle.

00:07:53.985 --> 00:07:55.143
CA: I mean, you do the math on this,

00:07:55.143 --> 00:07:57.017
and it works out, I think, literally

00:07:57.017 --> 00:07:59.143
to thousands of kids' lives saved every day

00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:01.197
compared to the prior year.

00:08:01.197 --> 00:08:03.044
It's not reported.

00:08:03.044 --> 00:08:06.290
An airliner with 200-plus deaths

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.500
is a far, far bigger story than that.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.049
Does that drive you crazy?

00:08:10.049 --> 00:08:13.040
BG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.710
It's a kid, one kid at a time.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.173
Ninety-eight percent of this

00:08:17.173 --> 00:08:19.050
has nothing to do with natural disasters,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.527
and yet, people's charity,

00:08:20.527 --> 00:08:22.050
when they see a natural disaster, are wonderful.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.286
It's incredible how people think, okay,

00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:27.062
that could be me, and the money flows.

00:08:27.062 --> 00:08:30.468
These causes have been a bit invisible.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.679
Now that the Millennium Development Goals

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.229
and various things are getting out there,

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:37.073
we are seeing some increased generosity,

00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:40.344
so the goal is to get this well below a million,

00:08:40.344 --> 00:08:42.762
which should be possible in our lifetime.

00:08:42.762 --> 00:08:43.942
CA: Maybe it needed someone

00:08:43.942 --> 00:08:46.038
who is turned on by numbers and graphs

00:08:46.038 --> 00:08:48.452
rather than just the big, sad face

00:08:48.452 --> 00:08:50.107
to get engaged.

00:08:50.107 --> 00:08:51.830
I mean, you've used it in your letter this year,

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.281
you used basically this argument to say that aid,

00:08:55.281 --> 00:08:56.952
contrary to the current meme

00:08:56.952 --> 00:09:00.035
that aid is kind of worthless and broken,

00:09:00.035 --> 00:09:01.988
that actually it has been effective.

00:09:01.988 --> 00:09:03.968
BG: Yeah, well people can take,

00:09:03.968 --> 00:09:07.148
there is some aid that was well-meaning

00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:09.071
and didn't go well.

00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:11.004
There's some venture capital investments

00:09:11.004 --> 00:09:13.904
that were well-meaning and didn't go well.

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:16.743
You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,

00:09:16.743 --> 00:09:19.861
because we don't have a perfect record,

00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.393
this is a bad endeavor.

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:23.263
You should look at, what was your goal?

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:25.871
How are you trying to uplift nutrition

00:09:25.871 --> 00:09:29.275
and survival and literacy

00:09:29.275 --> 00:09:30.910
so these countries can take care of themselves,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.914
and say wow, this is going well,

00:09:32.914 --> 00:09:34.186
and be smarter.

00:09:34.186 --> 00:09:36.026
We can spend aid smarter.

00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:39.438
It is not all a panacea.

00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:42.370
We can do better than venture capital, I think,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.157
including big hits like this.

00:09:45.157 --> 00:09:47.900
CA: Traditional wisdom is that

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.948
it's pretty hard for married couples to work together.

00:09:51.948 --> 00:09:53.564
How have you guys managed it?

00:09:53.564 --> 00:09:55.234
MG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,

00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:57.093
"I really don't think I could work with my husband.

00:09:57.093 --> 00:09:59.240
That just wouldn't work out."

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.829
You know, we enjoy it, and we don't --

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:05.315
this foundation has been a coming to for both of us

00:10:05.315 --> 00:10:08.143
in its continuous learning journey,

00:10:08.143 --> 00:10:10.902
and we don't travel together as much

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.830
for the foundation, actually, as we used to

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.286
when Bill was working at Microsoft.

00:10:14.286 --> 00:10:16.509
We have more trips where
we're traveling separately,

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:18.651
but I always know when I come home,

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.790
Bill's going to be interested in what I learned,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.533
whether it's about women or girls

00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:25.219
or something new about the vaccine delivery chain,

00:10:25.219 --> 00:10:27.455
or this person that is a great leader.

00:10:27.455 --> 00:10:29.922
He's going to listen and be really interested.

00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:31.525
And he knows when he comes home,

00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:33.358
even if it's to talk about the speech he did

00:10:33.358 --> 00:10:35.100
or the data or what he's learned,

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.342
I'm really interested,

00:10:36.342 --> 00:10:39.242
and I think we have a really
collaborative relationship.

00:10:39.242 --> 00:10:41.916
But we don't every minute together, that's for sure.

00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:46.091
(Laughter)

00:10:46.091 --> 00:10:48.586
CA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:52.172
Melinda, early on, you were basically

00:10:52.172 --> 00:10:54.173
largely running the show.

00:10:54.173 --> 00:10:55.385
Six years ago, I guess,

00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:57.968
Bill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft

00:10:57.968 --> 00:10:59.079
and became full time.

00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:00.058
That must have been hard,

00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:02.094
adjusting to that. No?

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:05.148
MG: Yeah. I think actually,

00:11:05.148 --> 00:11:07.137
for the foundation employees,

00:11:07.137 --> 00:11:09.684
there was way more angst for them

00:11:09.684 --> 00:11:11.050
than there was for me about Bill coming.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.256
I was actually really excited.

00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.875
I mean, Bill made this decision

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:16.558
even obviously before it got announced in 2006,

00:11:16.558 --> 00:11:18.260
and it was really his decision,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.146
but again, it was a beach vacation

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.450
where we were walking on the beach

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.714
and he was starting to think of this idea.

00:11:23.714 --> 00:11:26.326
And for me, the excitement of Bill

00:11:26.326 --> 00:11:29.035
putting his brain and his heart

00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:31.382
against these huge global problems,

00:11:31.382 --> 00:11:33.710
these inequities, to me that was exciting.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.444
Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that.

00:11:37.444 --> 00:11:39.119
(Applause)

00:11:39.119 --> 00:11:41.235
CA: That's cool.

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:42.919
MG: But that went away within three months,

00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:43.846
once he was there.

00:11:43.846 --> 00:11:45.511
BG: Including some of the employees.

00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:46.784
MG: That's what I said, the employees,

00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:48.906
it went away for them three
months after you were there.

00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:51.226
BG: No, I'm kidding.
MG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away.

00:11:51.226 --> 00:11:53.127
BG: A few of them did, but —

00:11:53.127 --> 00:11:54.960
(Laughter)

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.903
CA: So what do you guys argue about?

00:11:56.903 --> 00:11:59.560
Sunday, 11 o'clock,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.981
you're away from work,

00:12:00.981 --> 00:12:03.494
what comes up? What's the argument?

00:12:03.494 --> 00:12:05.139
BG: Because we built this thing

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:08.258
together from the beginning,

00:12:08.258 --> 00:12:09.904
it's this great partnership.

00:12:09.904 --> 00:12:11.758
I had that with Paul Allen

00:12:11.758 --> 00:12:13.669
in the early days of Microsoft.

00:12:13.669 --> 00:12:16.481
I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,

00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:19.485
and now Melinda, and in even stronger,

00:12:19.485 --> 00:12:21.371
equal ways, is the partner,

00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:23.128
so we talk a lot about

00:12:23.128 --> 00:12:25.256
which things should we give more to,

00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:27.800
which groups are working well?

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.053
She's got a lot of insight.

00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:30.700
She'll sit down with the employees a lot.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.816
We'll take the different trips she described.

00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:36.433
So there's a lot of collaboration.

00:12:36.433 --> 00:12:38.409
I can't think of anything where one of us

00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:41.679
had a super strong opinion

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.515
about one thing or another?

00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:46.317
CA: How about you, Melinda, 
though? Can you? (Laughter)

00:12:46.317 --> 00:12:47.533
You never know.

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.059
MG: Well, here's the thing.

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:50.798
We come at things from different angles,

00:12:50.798 --> 00:12:52.730
and I actually think that's really good.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.738
So Bill can look at the big data

00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:57.750
and say, "I want to act based
on these global statistics."

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.616
For me, I come at it from intuition.

00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:01.549
I meet with lots of people on the ground

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:03.529
and Bill's taught me to take that

00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:06.152
and read up to the global data and see if they match,

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:07.241
and I think what I've taught him

00:13:07.241 --> 00:13:08.669
is to take that data

00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:10.283
and meet with people on the ground to understand,

00:13:10.283 --> 00:13:12.667
can you actually deliver that vaccine?

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.868
Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops

00:13:15.868 --> 00:13:17.198
in her child's mouth?

00:13:17.198 --> 00:13:18.756
Because the delivery piece

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.959
is every bit as important as the science.

00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:23.481
So I think it's been more a coming to over time

00:13:23.481 --> 00:13:24.776
towards each other's point of view,

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:28.046
and quite frankly, the work is better because of it.

00:13:28.046 --> 00:13:30.319
CA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,

00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:34.118
you've had some amazing successes.

00:13:34.118 --> 00:13:35.350
What about failure, though?

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.041
Can you talk about a failure

00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:39.137
and maybe what you've learned from it?

00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:41.705
BG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,

00:13:41.705 --> 00:13:43.842
because we've certainly had them.

00:13:43.842 --> 00:13:48.216
We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work

00:13:48.216 --> 00:13:51.492
that you know you're going to have different failures.

00:13:51.492 --> 00:13:53.719
Like, we put out, one that got a lot of publicity

00:13:53.719 --> 00:13:55.020
was asking for a better condom.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.514
Well, we got hundreds of ideas.

00:13:56.514 --> 00:13:59.708
Maybe a few of those will work out.

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:03.087
We were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drug

00:14:03.087 --> 00:14:05.703
for a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,

00:14:05.703 --> 00:14:07.354
that I thought, once I got this drug,

00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:08.710
we can just go wipe out the disease.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.290
Well, turns out it took an injection

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.926
every day for 10 days.

00:14:12.926 --> 00:14:15.313
It took three more years to get it than we expected,

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:16.771
and then there was no way

00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:19.139
it was going to get out there.

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:20.358
Fortunately, we found out

00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:23.520
that if you go kill the sand flies,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.642
you probably can have success there,

00:14:25.642 --> 00:14:27.497
but we spent five years,

00:14:27.497 --> 00:14:28.875
you could say wasted five years,

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:30.882
and about 60 million,

00:14:30.882 --> 00:14:32.222
on a path that turned out to have

00:14:32.222 --> 00:14:36.387
very modest benefit when we got there.

00:14:36.387 --> 00:14:39.831
CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year

00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:41.766
in education, I think, something like that.

00:14:41.766 --> 00:14:45.790
Is anything, the story of what's gone right there

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.246
is quite a long and complex one.

00:14:48.246 --> 00:14:52.168
Are there any failures that you can talk about?

00:14:52.168 --> 00:14:53.958
MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us

00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.206
out of the early work is we thought

00:14:55.206 --> 00:14:57.739
that these small schools were the answer,

00:14:57.739 --> 00:14:59.209
and small schools definitely help.

00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:00.733
They bring down the dropout rate.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.333
They have less violence and crime in those schools.

00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:05.479
But the thing that we learned from that work,

00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:08.013
and what turned out to be the fundamental key,

00:15:08.013 --> 00:15:10.077
is a great teacher in front of the classroom.

00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:11.684
If you don't have an effective teacher

00:15:11.684 --> 00:15:12.750
in the front of the classroom,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.906
I don't care how big or small the building is,

00:15:14.906 --> 00:15:16.560
you're not going to change the trajectory

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.513
of whether that student will be ready for college.

00:15:18.513 --> 00:15:23.108
(Applause)

00:15:23.108 --> 00:15:25.418
CA: So Melinda, this is you and

00:15:25.418 --> 00:15:28.972
your eldest daughter, Jenn.

00:15:28.972 --> 00:15:30.871
And just taken about three weeks ago, I think,

00:15:30.871 --> 00:15:32.455
three or four weeks ago. Where was this?

00:15:32.455 --> 00:15:34.211
MG: So we went to Tanzania.

00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:35.053
Jenn's been to Tanzania.

00:15:35.053 --> 00:15:37.756
All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.

00:15:37.756 --> 00:15:39.971
And we did something very different,

00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:41.798
which is, we decided to go spend

00:15:41.798 --> 00:15:44.217
two nights and three days with a family.

00:15:44.217 --> 00:15:47.318
Anna and Sanare are the parents.

00:15:47.318 --> 00:15:50.352
They invited us to come and stay in their boma.

00:15:50.352 --> 00:15:51.851
Actually, the goats had been there, I think,

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:53.250
living in that particular little hut

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.921
on their little compound before we got there.

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.419
And we stayed with their family,

00:15:57.419 --> 00:15:59.353
and we really, really learned

00:15:59.353 --> 00:16:01.206
what life is like in rural Tanzania.

00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:02.820
And the difference between just going

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.539
and visiting for half a day

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:06.001
or three quarters of a day

00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:08.399
versus staying overnight was profound,

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:11.890
and so let me just give you one explanation of that.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.019
They had six children, and as I talked to Anna

00:16:14.019 --> 00:16:15.794
in the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours

00:16:15.794 --> 00:16:17.437
in the cooking hut that day,

00:16:17.437 --> 00:16:19.248
and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned

00:16:19.248 --> 00:16:20.718
and spaced with her husband

00:16:20.718 --> 00:16:22.155
the births of their children.

00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:23.810
It was a very loving relationship.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.113
This was a Maasai warrior and his wife,

00:16:26.113 --> 00:16:28.022
but they had decided to get married,

00:16:28.022 --> 00:16:31.357
they clearly had respect and love in the relationship.

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:32.968
Their children, their six children,

00:16:32.968 --> 00:16:35.487
the two in the middle were twins, 13,

00:16:35.487 --> 00:16:37.740
a boy, and a girl named Grace.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.313
And when we'd go out to chop wood

00:16:39.313 --> 00:16:41.748
and do all the things that Grace
and her mother would do,

00:16:41.748 --> 00:16:44.340
Grace was not a child, she was an adolescent,

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.817
but she wasn't an adult.

00:16:45.817 --> 00:16:47.568
She was very, very shy.

00:16:47.568 --> 00:16:49.329
So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.

00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:52.164
We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.

00:16:52.164 --> 00:16:53.770
And at night, though,

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.577
when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,

00:16:56.577 --> 00:16:58.081
and there was no moon that night,

00:16:58.081 --> 00:16:59.803
the first night, and no stars,

00:16:59.803 --> 00:17:01.629
and Jenn came out of our hut

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:04.446
with her REI little headlamp on,

00:17:04.446 --> 00:17:06.584
Grace went immediately,

00:17:06.584 --> 00:17:07.940
and got the translator,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.030
came straight up to my Jenn and said,

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.263
"When you go home,

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:12.438
can I have your headlamp

00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:14.168
so I can study at night?"

00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:15.250
CA: Oh, wow.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.734
MG: And her dad had told me

00:17:16.734 --> 00:17:18.821
how afraid he was that unlike the son,

00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:20.483
who had passed his secondary exams,

00:17:20.483 --> 00:17:22.013
because of her chores,

00:17:22.013 --> 00:17:23.451
she'd not done so well

00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:25.255
and wasn't in the government school yet.

00:17:25.255 --> 00:17:27.790
He said, "I don't know how I'm
going to pay for her education.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.616
I can't pay for private school,

00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:32.195
and she may end up on this farm like my wife."

00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:33.324
So they know the difference

00:17:33.324 --> 00:17:34.349
that an education can make

00:17:34.349 --> 00:17:37.346
in a huge, profound way.

00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:38.767
CA: I mean, this is another pic

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:42.173
of your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe,

00:17:42.173 --> 00:17:46.311
along with Paul Farmer.

00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:47.925
Bringing up three children

00:17:47.925 --> 00:17:50.927
when you're the world's richest family

00:17:50.927 --> 00:17:53.223
seems like a social experiment

00:17:53.223 --> 00:17:56.795
without much prior art.

00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:58.330
How have you managed it?

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.545
What's been your approach?

00:18:00.545 --> 00:18:03.178
BG: Well, I'd say overall

00:18:03.178 --> 00:18:04.940
the kids get a great education,

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.838
but you've got to make sure

00:18:05.838 --> 00:18:07.540
they have a sense of their own ability

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.529
and what they're going to go and do,

00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:11.902
and our philosophy has been

00:18:11.902 --> 00:18:13.124
to be very clear with them --

00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:14.669
most of the money's going to the foundation --

00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:19.010
and help them find something they're excited about.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.405
We want to strike a balance where they have

00:18:20.405 --> 00:18:22.198
the freedom to do anything

00:18:22.198 --> 00:18:25.538
but not a lot of money showered on them

00:18:25.538 --> 00:18:28.667
so they could go out and do nothing.

00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:31.645
And so far, they're fairly diligent,

00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:34.853
excited to pick their own direction.

00:18:34.853 --> 00:18:40.421
CA: You've obviously guarded their 
privacy carefully for obvious reasons.

00:18:40.421 --> 00:18:42.615
I'm curious why you've given me permission

00:18:42.615 --> 00:18:44.240
to show this picture now here at TED.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.377
MG: Well, it's interesting.

00:18:45.377 --> 00:18:47.218
As they get older, they so know

00:18:47.218 --> 00:18:50.227
that our family belief is about responsibility,

00:18:50.227 --> 00:18:52.342
that we are in an unbelievable situation

00:18:52.342 --> 00:18:53.960
just to live in the United States

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.651
and have a great education,

00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:57.699
and we have a responsibility
to give back to the world.

00:18:57.699 --> 00:18:58.752
And so as they get older

00:18:58.752 --> 00:18:59.772
and we are teaching them --

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:02.132
they have been to so many
countries around the world —

00:19:02.132 --> 00:19:03.264
they're saying,

00:19:03.264 --> 00:19:05.016
we do want people to know that we believe

00:19:05.016 --> 00:19:06.517
in what you're doing, Mom and Dad,

00:19:06.517 --> 00:19:08.478
and it is okay to show us more.

00:19:08.478 --> 00:19:11.130
So we have their permission to show this picture,

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.845
and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it

00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:15.300
eventually in some of his work.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.902
But they really care deeply

00:19:16.902 --> 00:19:19.327
about the mission of the foundation, too.

00:19:19.327 --> 00:19:21.249
CA: You've easily got enough money

00:19:21.249 --> 00:19:23.840
despite your vast contributions to the foundation

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.474
to make them all billionaires.

00:19:25.474 --> 00:19:26.991
Is that your plan for them?

00:19:26.991 --> 00:19:29.327
BG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.

00:19:29.327 --> 00:19:31.262
They need to have a sense

00:19:31.262 --> 00:19:37.798
that their own work is meaningful and important.

00:19:37.798 --> 00:19:41.270
We read an article long, actually,
before we got married,

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.915
where Warren Buffett talked about that,

00:19:43.915 --> 00:19:46.164
and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor

00:19:46.164 --> 00:19:49.418
either to society or to the kids.

00:19:49.418 --> 00:19:51.486
CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,

00:19:51.486 --> 00:19:54.150
something really amazing happened in 2006,

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.110
when somehow your only real rival

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.662
for richest person in America

00:19:58.662 --> 00:20:00.032
suddenly turned around and agreed to give

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.625
80 percent of his fortune

00:20:02.625 --> 00:20:04.342
to your foundation.

00:20:04.342 --> 00:20:06.078
How on Earth did that happen?

00:20:06.078 --> 00:20:08.056
I guess there's a long version
and a short version of that.

00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:09.438
We've got time for the short version.

00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:13.193
BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,

00:20:13.193 --> 00:20:17.850
and he was going to have his wife Suzie

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.405
give it all away.

00:20:19.405 --> 00:20:22.846
Tragically, she passed away before he did,

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:26.444
and he's big on delegation, and

00:20:26.444 --> 00:20:28.602
— (Laughter) —

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:30.013
he said —

00:20:30.013 --> 00:20:30.868
CA: Tweet that.

00:20:30.868 --> 00:20:34.029
BG: If he's got somebody
who is doing something well,

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:38.486
and is willing to do it at no charge,

00:20:38.486 --> 00:20:40.864
maybe that's okay. But we were stunned.

00:20:40.864 --> 00:20:42.960
MG: Totally stunned.
BG: We had never expected it,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.525
and it has been unbelievable.

00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:47.665
It's allowed us to increase our ambition

00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:51.282
in what the foundation can do quite dramatically.

00:20:51.282 --> 00:20:52.786
Half the resources we have

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:55.670
come from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:56.554
CA: And I think you've pledged that

00:20:56.554 --> 00:20:58.344
by the time you're done,

00:20:58.344 --> 00:21:00.222
more than, or 95 percent of your wealth,

00:21:00.222 --> 00:21:02.117
will be given to the foundation.

00:21:02.117 --> 00:21:03.271
BG: Yes.

00:21:03.271 --> 00:21:07.020
CA: And since this relationship, it's amazing—

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.386
(Applause)

00:21:10.386 --> 00:21:13.023
And recently, you and Warren

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.903
have been going around trying to persuade

00:21:14.903 --> 00:21:16.879
other billionaires and successful people

00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:18.402
to pledge to give, what,

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:24.160
more than half of their assets for philanthropy.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.575
How is that going?

00:21:26.575 --> 00:21:29.747
BG: Well, we've got about 120 people

00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:32.185
who have now taken this giving pledge.

00:21:32.185 --> 00:21:34.791
The thing that's great is that we get together

00:21:34.791 --> 00:21:36.900
yearly and talk about, okay,

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.865
do you hire staff, what do you give to them?

00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:40.092
We're not trying to homogenize it.

00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:41.140
I mean, the beauty of philanthropy

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.147
is this mind-blowing diversity.

00:21:43.147 --> 00:21:44.310
People give to some things.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.989
We look and go, "Wow."

00:21:46.989 --> 00:21:48.097
But that's great.

00:21:48.097 --> 00:21:49.226
That's the role of philanthropy

00:21:49.226 --> 00:21:51.713
is to pick different approaches,

00:21:51.713 --> 00:21:53.705
including even in one space, like education.

00:21:53.705 --> 00:21:56.076
We need more experimentation.

00:21:56.076 --> 00:21:58.980
But it's been wonderful, meeting those people,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.212
sharing their journey to philanthropy,

00:22:01.212 --> 00:22:02.316
how they involve their kids,

00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:04.150
where they're doing it differently,

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.856
and it's been way more successful than we expected.

00:22:06.856 --> 00:22:09.551
Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size

00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:12.114
in the years ahead.

00:22:12.114 --> 00:22:15.626
MG: And having people see that other people

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.330
are making change with philanthropy,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.666
I mean, these are people who have

00:22:19.666 --> 00:22:20.711
created their own businesses,

00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:23.359
put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.

00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:25.585
If they put their ideas and their brain

00:22:25.585 --> 00:22:28.118
behind philanthropy, they can change the world.

00:22:28.118 --> 00:22:30.409
And they start to see others doing it, and saying,

00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:32.449
"Wow, I want to do that with my own money."

00:22:32.449 --> 00:22:34.493
To me, that's the piece that's incredible.

00:22:34.493 --> 00:22:37.411
CA: It seems to me, it's actually really hard

00:22:37.411 --> 00:22:38.657
for some people to figure out

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:41.340
even how to remotely spend that much money

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.513
on something else.

00:22:43.513 --> 00:22:45.606
There are probably some billionaires in the room

00:22:45.606 --> 00:22:47.715
and certainly some successful people.

00:22:47.715 --> 00:22:49.775
I'm curious, can you make the pitch?

00:22:49.775 --> 00:22:51.009
What's the pitch?

00:22:51.009 --> 00:22:52.390
BG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.872
we've ever done,

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:56.842
and you can't take it with you,

00:22:56.842 --> 00:23:00.024
and if it's not good for your kids,

00:23:00.024 --> 00:23:01.313
let's get together and brainstorm

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:04.000
about what we can be done.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.190
The world is a far better place

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.828
because of the philanthropists of the past,

00:23:08.828 --> 00:23:11.861
and the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,

00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:13.212
is the envy of the world.

00:23:13.212 --> 00:23:15.130
And part of the reason I'm so optimistic

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.074
is because I do think philanthropy

00:23:17.074 --> 00:23:18.688
is going to grow

00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:19.807
and take some of these things

00:23:19.807 --> 00:23:22.706
government's not just good at
working on and discovering

00:23:22.706 --> 00:23:26.176
and shine some light in the right direction.

00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:29.118
CA: The world's got this terrible inequality,

00:23:29.118 --> 00:23:30.279
growing inequality problem

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:31.740
that seems structural.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.606
It does seem to me that if more of your peers

00:23:34.606 --> 00:23:36.982
took the approach that you two have made,

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:38.574
it would make a dent

00:23:38.574 --> 00:23:39.840
both in that problem and certainly

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.440
in the perception of that problem.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.844
Is that a fair comment?

00:23:42.844 --> 00:23:44.502
BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy

00:23:44.502 --> 00:23:47.834
and give to the least wealthy, it's good.

00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:49.966
It tries to balance out, and that's just.

00:23:49.966 --> 00:23:51.722
MG: But you change systems.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:54.335
In the U.S., we're trying to
change the education system

00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:56.403
so it's just for everybody

00:23:56.403 --> 00:23:57.960
and it works for all students.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.850
That, to me, really changes

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.007
the inequality balance.

00:24:01.007 --> 00:24:02.589
BG: That's the most important.

00:24:02.589 --> 00:24:06.137
(Applause)

00:24:06.137 --> 00:24:09.552
CA: Well, I really think that most people here

00:24:09.552 --> 00:24:11.297
and many millions around the world

00:24:11.297 --> 00:24:13.846
are just in awe of the trajectory

00:24:13.846 --> 00:24:15.154
your lives have taken

00:24:15.154 --> 00:24:18.885
and the spectacular degree to which

00:24:18.885 --> 00:24:21.000
you have shaped the future.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.340
Thank you so much for coming to TED

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.801
and for sharing with us and for all you do.

00:24:23.801 --> 00:24:25.737
BG: Thank you.
MG: Thank you.

00:24:25.737 --> 00:24:28.524
(Applause)

00:24:34.515 --> 00:24:38.910
BG: Thank you.
MG: Thank you very much.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:43.081
BG: All right, good job. (Applause)
