00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:02.797
Right now

00:00:02.797 --> 00:00:05.539
there is an aspiring teacher

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.190
who is working on a 60-page paper

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.700
based on some age-old education theory

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.893
developed by some dead education professor

00:00:16.893 --> 00:00:19.611
wondering to herself what this task

00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:21.251
that she's engaging in

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:23.779
has to do with what she wants to do with her life,

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.005
which is be an educator,

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:30.119
change lives, and spark magic.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.003
Right now there is an aspiring teacher

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:36.959
in a graduate school of education

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:39.967
who is watching a professor babble on and on

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:42.091
about engagement

00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:47.265
in the most disengaging way possible.

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:48.915
Right now

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.114
there's a first-year teacher at home

00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:53.666
who is pouring through lesson plans

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.996
trying to make sense of standards,

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:59.186
who is trying to make sense of how
to grade students appropriately,

00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:00.825
while at the same time saying to herself

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:03.039
over and over again,

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.997
"Don't smile till November,"

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:07.080
because that's what she was taught

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.102
in her teacher education program.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.958
Right now there's a student

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.642
who is coming up with a way

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:17.130
to convince his mom or dad

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.638
that he's very, very sick

00:01:18.638 --> 00:01:22.511
and can't make it to school tomorrow.

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:25.408
On the other hand, right now

00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:27.758
there are amazing educators

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:29.532
that are sharing information,

00:01:29.532 --> 00:01:32.179
information that is shared in such a beautiful way

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.570
that the students are sitting
at the edge of their seats

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.682
just waiting for a bead of sweat

00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:39.267
to drop off the face of this person

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:42.312
so they can soak up all that knowledge.

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:46.030
Right now there is also a person

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.391
who has an entire audience rapt with attention,

00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:52.283
a person that is weaving a powerful narrative

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:53.959
about a world

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.514
that the people who are listening

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:57.880
have never imagined or seen before,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.398
but if they close their eyes tightly enough,

00:02:00.398 --> 00:02:02.037
they can envision that world

00:02:02.037 --> 00:02:06.032
because the storytelling is so compelling.

00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:09.171
Right now there's a person who can tell an audience

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:11.074
to put their hands up in the air

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:12.724
and they will stay there till he says,

00:02:12.724 --> 00:02:14.468
"Put them down."

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.136
Right now.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.540
So people will then say,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.403
"Well, Chris, you describe the guy

00:02:20.403 --> 00:02:22.427
who is going through some awful training

00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:24.960
but you're also describing these powerful educators.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.494
If you're thinking about the world of education

00:02:26.494 --> 00:02:28.092
or urban education in particular,

00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:30.138
these guys will probably cancel each other out,

00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:32.384
and then we'll be okay."

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:34.886
The reality is, the folks I described

00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:36.602
as the master teachers,

00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:38.939
the master narrative builders,

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.890
the master storytellers

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.488
are far removed from classrooms.

00:02:44.488 --> 00:02:46.870
The folks who know the skills about how to teach

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.192
and engage an audience

00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:51.112
don't even know what teacher certification means.

00:02:51.112 --> 00:02:53.174
They may not even have the degrees

00:02:53.174 --> 00:02:56.435
to be able to have anything

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:58.739
to call an education.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.471
And that to me is sad.

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:03.470
It's sad because the people who I described,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.237
they were very disinterested in the learning process,

00:03:06.237 --> 00:03:08.095
want to be effective teachers,

00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:09.447
but they have no models.

00:03:09.447 --> 00:03:11.192
I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain.

00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:13.722
Mark Twain says that proper preparation,

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:15.122
or teaching,

00:03:15.122 --> 00:03:18.738
is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good,

00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:21.410
it can turn awful practices into powerful ones,

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.994
it can change men and transform them

00:03:23.994 --> 00:03:26.595
into angels.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:28.898
The folks who I described earlier

00:03:28.898 --> 00:03:30.888
got proper preparation in teaching,

00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:32.972
not in any college or university,

00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:36.967
but by virtue of just being in the
same spaces of those who engage.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.210
Guess where those places are?

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.276
Barber shops,

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:44.464
rap concerts, and most importantly,

00:03:44.464 --> 00:03:46.112
in the black church.

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:49.031
And I've been framing this idea
called Pentecostal pedagogy.

00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:51.341
Who here has been to a black church?

00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:53.650
We got a couple of hands.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.013
You go to a black church,

00:03:55.013 --> 00:03:56.624
their preacher starts off

00:03:56.624 --> 00:03:59.510
and he realizes that he has to engage the audience,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.356
so he starts off with this sort of wordplay

00:04:01.356 --> 00:04:03.040
in the beginning oftentimes,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.858
and then he takes a pause,

00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:07.039
and he says, "Oh my gosh, they're
not quite paying attention."

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.640
So he says, "Can I get an amen?"

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.626
Audience: Amen.

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:11.925
Chris Emdin: So I can I get an amen?
Audience: Amen.

00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:15.257
CE: And all of a sudden, everybody's reawoken.

00:04:15.257 --> 00:04:17.318
That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention.

00:04:17.318 --> 00:04:19.978
He drops his voice at a very, very low volume

00:04:19.978 --> 00:04:21.852
when he wants people to key into him,

00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:24.108
and those things are the skills that we need

00:04:24.108 --> 00:04:26.183
for the most engaging teachers.

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.621
So why does teacher education

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:29.694
only give you theory and theory

00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:31.930
and tell you about standards and tell you about

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.874
all of these things that have nothing to do

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:37.190
with the basic skills, that magic that you need

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.159
to engage an audience, to engage a student?

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.177
So I make the argument that
we reframe teacher education,

00:04:43.177 --> 00:04:45.962
that we could focus on content, and that's fine,

00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:48.268
and we could focus on theories, and that's fine,

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:49.839
but content and theories

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:52.443
with the absence of the magic

00:04:52.443 --> 00:04:55.354
of teaching and learning means nothing.

00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:58.109
Now people oftentimes say,
"Well, magic is just magic."

00:04:58.109 --> 00:04:59.490
There are teachers who,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.954
despite all their challenges, who have those skills,

00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:04.675
get into those schools and are 
able to engage an audience,

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:05.969
and the administrator walks by and says,

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.897
"Wow, he's so good, I wish all
my teachers could be that good."

00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:10.940
And when they try to describe what that is,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.170
they just say, "He has that magic."

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.432
But I'm here to tell you

00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:16.890
that magic can be taught.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.237
Magic can be taught.

00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:22.049
Magic can be taught.

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:23.580
Now, how do you teach it?

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.251
You teach it by allowing people

00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:26.656
to go into those spaces

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:28.258
where the magic is happening.

00:05:28.258 --> 00:05:30.990
If you want to be an aspiring
teacher in urban education,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.272
you've got to leave the confines of that university

00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:35.030
and go into the hood.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.140
You've got to go in there and
hang out at the barbershop,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.522
you've got to attend that black church,

00:05:38.522 --> 00:05:39.977
and you've got to view those folks

00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:41.780
that have the power to engage

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.560
and just take notes on what they do.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.560
At our teacher education classes at my university,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.954
I've started a project where every single student

00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:53.546
that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts.

00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:55.769
They watch the way that the rappers move

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:57.302
and talk with their hands.

00:05:57.302 --> 00:06:00.282
They study the way that he
walks proudly across that stage.

00:06:00.282 --> 00:06:02.488
They listen to his metaphors and analogies,

00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:04.100
and they start learning these little things

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.900
that if they practice enough

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.589
becomes the key to magic.

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:09.850
They learn that if you just stare at a student

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.353
and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch,

00:06:12.353 --> 00:06:13.820
you don't have to say a word

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.393
because they know that that
means that you want more.

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:19.848
And if we could transform teacher education

00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:22.110
to focus on teaching teachers

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.063
how to create that magic

00:06:24.063 --> 00:06:27.860
then poof! we could make dead classes come alive,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.574
we could reignite imaginations,

00:06:29.574 --> 00:06:31.290
and we can change education.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.384
Thank you.

00:06:34.384 --> 00:06:37.223
(Applause)
