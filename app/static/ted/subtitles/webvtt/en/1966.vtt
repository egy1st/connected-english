00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:02.698
When people think about cities,

00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:05.000
they tend to think of certain things.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.060
They think of buildings and streets

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.956
and skyscrapers, noisy cabs.

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:11.890
But when I think about cities,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.691
I think about people.

00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.161
Cities are fundamentally about people,

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:19.005
and where people go

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.520
and where people meet

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.850
are at the core of what makes a city work.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.030
So even more important than buildings in a city

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.038
are the public spaces in between them.

00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:32.696
And today, some of the most transformative

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:34.373
changes in cities

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:37.559
are happening in these public spaces.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.752
So I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces

00:00:41.752 --> 00:00:44.872
are the key to planning a great city.

00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:48.292
They are what makes it come alive.

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:51.972
But what makes a public space work?

00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:55.523
What attracts people to successful public spaces,

00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:57.945
and what is it about unsuccessful places

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.625
that keeps people away?

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.984
I thought, if I could answer those questions,

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:07.764
I could make a huge contribution to my city.

00:01:07.764 --> 00:01:09.918
But one of the more wonky things about me

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:13.469
is that I am an animal behaviorist,

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.046
and I use those skills not to study animal behavior

00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:19.980
but to study how people in cities

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.228
use city public spaces.

00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:25.549
One of the first spaces that I studied

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.954
was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.262
in midtown Manhattan.

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:35.387
This little space became a small phenomenon,

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.255
and because it had such a profound impact

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:39.471
on New Yorkers,

00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:43.555
it made an enormous impression on me.

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:46.052
I studied this park very early on in my career

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:47.638
because it happened to have been built

00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:49.416
by my stepfather,

00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:52.048
so I knew that places like Paley Park

00:01:52.048 --> 00:01:54.448
didn't happen by accident.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:57.000
I saw firsthand that they required

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.456
incredible dedication

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:01.514
and enormous attention to detail.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:03.248
But what was it about this space

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:07.050
that made it special and drew people to it?

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.951
Well, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully,

00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:11.843
and first among other things

00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:14.906
were the comfortable, movable chairs.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:17.416
People would come in, find their own seat,

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:20.810
move it a bit, actually, and then stay a while,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.658
and then interestingly,

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:25.633
people themselves attracted other people,

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:28.410
and ironically, I felt more peaceful

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.391
if there were other people around.

00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:32.281
And it was green.

00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:36.042
This little park provided what New Yorkers crave:

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:38.580
comfort and greenery.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.268
But my question was,

00:02:40.268 --> 00:02:43.330
why weren't there more places with greenery

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.839
and places to sit in the middle of the city

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.319
where you didn't feel alone,

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.776
or like a trespasser?

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:53.008
Unfortunately, that's not how cities

00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:55.026
were being designed.

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:58.720
So here you see a familiar sight.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.001
This is how plazas have been
designed for generations.

00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:06.131
They have that stylish, Spartan look

00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.951
that we often associate with modern architecture,

00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:12.262
but it's not surprising that people

00:03:12.262 --> 00:03:14.124
avoid spaces like this.

00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:16.234
They not only look desolate,

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:18.946
they feel downright dangerous.

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:22.223
I mean, where would you sit here?

00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:24.769
What would you do here?

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.245
But architects love them.

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:31.518
They are plinths for their creations.

00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:33.451
They might tolerate a sculpture or two,

00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:35.204
but that's about it.

00:03:35.204 --> 00:03:38.408
And for developers, they are ideal.

00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:40.995
There's nothing to water, nothing to maintain,

00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:44.955
and no undesirable people to worry about.

00:03:44.955 --> 00:03:48.199
But don't you think this is a waste?

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.520
For me, becoming a city planner

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.192
meant being able to truly change the city

00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:55.682
that I lived in and loved.

00:03:55.682 --> 00:03:58.170
I wanted to be able to create places

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.135
that would give you the feeling that you got

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:01.673
in Paley Park,

00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:06.461
and not allow developers to
build bleak plazas like this.

00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:07.876
But over the many years,

00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:10.472
I have learned how hard it is

00:04:10.472 --> 00:04:13.060
to create successful, meaningful,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.088
enjoyable public spaces.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.665
As I learned from my stepfather,

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:18.953
they certainly do not happen by accident,

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:21.781
especially in a city like New York,

00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:25.060
where public space has to
be fought for to begin with,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.168
and then for them to be successful,

00:04:27.168 --> 00:04:29.190
somebody has to think very hard

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.214
about every detail.

00:04:31.214 --> 00:04:35.160
Now, open spaces in cities are opportunities.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.964
Yes, they are opportunities
for commercial investment,

00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:42.533
but they are also opportunities for the common good

00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:44.299
of the city,

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:47.814
and those two goals are often
not aligned with one another,

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.423
and therein lies the conflict.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:53.075
The first opportunity I had to fight

00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:56.237
for a great public open space was in the early 1980s,

00:04:56.237 --> 00:04:58.575
when I was leading a team of planners

00:04:58.575 --> 00:05:01.887
at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City

00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:04.500
in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.314
And this sandy wasteland had lain barren

00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:08.764
for 10 years,

00:05:08.764 --> 00:05:11.408
and we were told, unless we found a developer

00:05:11.408 --> 00:05:13.536
in six months, it would go bankrupt.

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:15.537
So we came up with a radical,

00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:17.927
almost insane idea.

00:05:17.927 --> 00:05:19.775
Instead of building a park

00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:22.283
as a complement to future development,

00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:24.368
why don't we reverse that equation

00:05:24.368 --> 00:05:27.421
and build a small but very high-quality

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:29.406
public open space first,

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:32.412
and see if that made a difference.

00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:36.110
So we only could afford to build a two-block section

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.570
of what would become a mile-long esplanade,

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.537
so whatever we built had to be perfect.

00:05:42.537 --> 00:05:45.533
So just to make sure, I insisted

00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:47.750
that we build a mock-up

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.684
in wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.708
And when I sat down on that test bench

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.906
with sand still swirling all around me,

00:05:57.906 --> 00:06:00.999
the railing hit exactly at eye level,

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.990
blocking my view and ruining my experience

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.120
at the water's edge.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.427
So you see, details really do make a difference.

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:13.358
But design is not just how something looks,

00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:19.250
it's how your body feels on that seat in that space,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.390
and I believe that successful design always depends

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.815
on that very individual experience.

00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:30.186
In this photo, everything looks very finished,

00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:32.904
but that granite edge, those lights,

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:34.792
the back on that bench,

00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:36.486
the trees in planting,

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:39.089
and the many different kinds of places to sit

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.271
were all little battles that turned this project

00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:46.315
into a place that people wanted to be.

00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:50.150
Now, this proved very valuable 20 years later

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.158
when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be

00:06:52.158 --> 00:06:53.740
his planning commissioner

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.587
and put me in charge of shaping

00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:57.658
the entire city of New York.

00:06:57.658 --> 00:06:59.757
And he said to me on that very day,

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:01.853
he said that New York was projected

00:07:01.853 --> 00:07:04.910
to grow from eight to nine million people.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.440
And he asked me,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.283
"So where are you going to put

00:07:08.283 --> 00:07:10.999
one million additional New Yorkers?"

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:13.644
Well, I didn't have any idea.

00:07:13.644 --> 00:07:16.683
Now, you know that New York does

00:07:16.683 --> 00:07:19.381
place a high value on attracting immigrants,

00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:22.301
so we were excited about the prospect of growth,

00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:25.180
but honestly, where were we going to grow

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.574
in a city that was already built out to its edges

00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:31.374
and surrounded by water?

00:07:31.374 --> 00:07:32.976
How were we going to find housing

00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:35.274
for that many new New Yorkers?

00:07:35.274 --> 00:07:37.087
And if we couldn't spread out,

00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:38.901
which was probably a good thing,

00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:41.720
where could new housing go?

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.353
And what about cars?

00:07:43.353 --> 00:07:47.465
Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars.

00:07:47.465 --> 00:07:50.299
So what were we going to do?

00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:54.276
If we couldn't spread out, we had to go up.

00:07:54.276 --> 00:07:55.310
And if we had to go up,

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.092
we had to go up in places

00:07:57.092 --> 00:07:59.101
where you wouldn't need to own a car.

00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:01.964
So that meant using one of our greatest assets:

00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:04.416
our transit system.

00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:05.989
But we had never before thought

00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:08.225
of how we could make the most of it.

00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:11.438
So here was the answer to our puzzle.

00:08:11.438 --> 00:08:15.069
If we were to channel and redirect

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:17.363
all new development around transit,

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:20.990
we could actually handle that population increase,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.264
we thought.

00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:24.822
And so here was the plan,

00:08:24.822 --> 00:08:26.470
what we really needed to do:

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.318
We needed to redo our zoning --

00:08:29.318 --> 00:08:32.669
and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool --

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.980
and basically reshape the entire city,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.125
targeting where new development could go

00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:40.316
and prohibiting any development at all

00:08:40.316 --> 00:08:42.030
in our car-oriented,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.192
suburban-style neighborhoods.

00:08:44.192 --> 00:08:47.924
Well, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea,

00:08:47.924 --> 00:08:50.500
ambitious because communities

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.115
had to approve those plans.

00:08:54.115 --> 00:08:57.134
So how was I going to get this done?

00:08:57.134 --> 00:09:00.042
By listening. So I began listening,

00:09:00.042 --> 00:09:03.396
in fact, thousands of hours of listening

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:05.214
just to establish trust.

00:09:05.214 --> 00:09:07.303
You know, communities can tell

00:09:07.303 --> 00:09:09.455
whether or not you understand their neighborhoods.

00:09:09.455 --> 00:09:12.551
It's not something you can just fake.

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:15.257
And so I began walking.

00:09:15.257 --> 00:09:17.577
I can't tell you how many blocks I walked,

00:09:17.577 --> 00:09:20.986
in sweltering summers, in freezing winters,

00:09:20.986 --> 00:09:22.816
year after year,

00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:24.904
just so I could get to understand

00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:26.931
the DNA of each neighborhood

00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:29.506
and know what each street felt like.

00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:33.001
I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert,

00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:35.070
finding ways that zoning could address

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.132
communities' concerns.

00:09:37.132 --> 00:09:39.704
So little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood,

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.139
block by block,

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:43.012
we began to set height limits

00:09:43.012 --> 00:09:44.744
so that all new development

00:09:44.744 --> 00:09:48.361
would be predictable and near transit.

00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:50.142
Over the course of 12 years,

00:09:50.142 --> 00:09:52.611
we were able to rezone

00:09:52.611 --> 00:09:55.180
124 neighborhoods,

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.959
40 percent of the city,

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:02.498
12,500 blocks, so that now,

00:10:02.498 --> 00:10:05.735
90 percent of all new development of New York

00:10:05.735 --> 00:10:08.383
is within a 10-minute walk of a subway.

00:10:08.383 --> 00:10:11.033
In other words, nobody in those new buildings

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:12.909
needs to own a car.

00:10:12.909 --> 00:10:17.002
Well, those rezonings were exhausting

00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:20.040
and enervating and important,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.590
but rezoning was never my mission.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.081
You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning.

00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:28.169
My mission was always to create

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.093
great public spaces.

00:10:30.093 --> 00:10:33.985
So in the areas where we zoned
for significant development,

00:10:33.985 --> 00:10:36.176
I was determined to create places

00:10:36.176 --> 00:10:38.870
that would make a difference in people's lives.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.956
Here you see what was

00:10:40.956 --> 00:10:43.380
two miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.147
in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint

00:10:45.147 --> 00:10:46.929
and Williamsburg in Brooklyn,

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:50.489
impossible to get to and impossible to use.

00:10:50.489 --> 00:10:52.983
Now the zoning here was massive,

00:10:52.983 --> 00:10:56.005
so I felt an obligation to create

00:10:56.005 --> 00:10:59.030
magnificent parks on these waterfronts,

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.770
and I spent an incredible amount of time

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.875
on every square inch of these plans.

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:06.940
I wanted to make sure that there were

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.479
tree-lined paths from the upland to the water,

00:11:09.479 --> 00:11:11.890
that there were trees and plantings everywhere,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.078
and, of course, lots and lots of places to sit.

00:11:16.078 --> 00:11:19.448
Honestly, I had no idea how it would turn out.

00:11:19.448 --> 00:11:21.073
I had to have faith.

00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:24.036
But I put everything that I had studied and learned

00:11:24.036 --> 00:11:25.770
into those plans.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.430
And then it opened,

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.717
and I have to tell you, it was incredible.

00:11:30.717 --> 00:11:32.802
People came from all over the city

00:11:32.802 --> 00:11:34.459
to be in these parks.

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:37.879
I know they changed the lives
of the people who live there,

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:40.374
but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image

00:11:40.374 --> 00:11:42.150
of their city.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.729
I often come down and watch people

00:11:43.729 --> 00:11:45.245
get on this little ferry

00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:47.223
that now runs between the boroughs,

00:11:47.223 --> 00:11:48.710
and I can't tell you why,

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.282
but I'm completely moved

00:11:50.282 --> 00:11:52.429
by the fact that people are using it

00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:54.611
as if it had always been there.

00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:57.884
And here is a new park in lower Manhattan.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:00.641
Now, the water's edge in lower Manhattan

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.574
was a complete mess before 9/11.

00:12:03.574 --> 00:12:05.489
Wall Street was essentially landlocked

00:12:05.489 --> 00:12:08.075
because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge.

00:12:08.075 --> 00:12:11.909
And after 9/11, the city had very little control.

00:12:11.909 --> 00:12:13.454
But I thought if we went

00:12:13.454 --> 00:12:15.599
to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation

00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:18.560
and got money to reclaim this two miles

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.356
of degraded waterfront

00:12:20.356 --> 00:12:22.207
that it would have an enormous effect

00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:24.668
on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.

00:12:24.668 --> 00:12:25.848
And it did.

00:12:25.848 --> 00:12:29.239
Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront

00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:31.353
on all three sides.

00:12:31.353 --> 00:12:33.737
I really love this park.

00:12:33.737 --> 00:12:35.962
You know, railings have to be higher now,

00:12:35.962 --> 00:12:38.506
so we put bar seating at the edge,

00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:40.618
and you can get so close to the water

00:12:40.618 --> 00:12:42.346
you're practically on it.

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:44.215
And see how the railing widens

00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:45.631
and flattens out so you can lay down

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.513
your lunch or your laptop.

00:12:47.513 --> 00:12:49.493
And I love when people come there

00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:51.353
and look up and they say,

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:55.380
"Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close."

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.732
So what's the trick?

00:12:57.732 --> 00:12:59.541
How do you turn a park

00:12:59.541 --> 00:13:02.707
into a place that people want to be?

00:13:02.707 --> 00:13:05.550
Well, it's up to you,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.915
not as a city planner but as a human being.

00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:12.315
You don't tap into your design expertise.

00:13:12.315 --> 00:13:15.830
You tap into your humanity.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.156
I mean, would you want to go there?

00:13:19.156 --> 00:13:21.139
Would you want to stay there?

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:23.277
Can you see into it and out of it?

00:13:23.277 --> 00:13:25.529
Are there other people there?

00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:28.176
Does it seem green and friendly?

00:13:28.176 --> 00:13:31.414
Can you find your very own seat?

00:13:31.414 --> 00:13:34.443
Well now, all over New York City,

00:13:34.443 --> 00:13:35.947
there are places where you can

00:13:35.947 --> 00:13:37.801
find your very own seat.

00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:40.323
Where there used to be parking spaces,

00:13:40.323 --> 00:13:42.616
there are now pop-up cafes.

00:13:42.616 --> 00:13:44.594
Where Broadway traffic used to run,

00:13:44.594 --> 00:13:46.558
there are now tables and chairs.

00:13:46.558 --> 00:13:50.112
Where 12 years ago, sidewalk
cafes were not allowed,

00:13:50.112 --> 00:13:52.085
they are now everywhere.

00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:55.080
But claiming these spaces for public use

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.219
was not simple,

00:13:56.219 --> 00:13:58.881
and it's even harder to keep them that way.

00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:00.570
So now I'm going to tell you a story

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.850
about a very unusual park called the High Line.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.904
The High Line was an elevated railway.

00:14:06.904 --> 00:14:13.535
(Applause)

00:14:13.535 --> 00:14:15.811
The High Line was an elevated railway

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:17.623
that ran through three neighborhoods

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.493
on Manhattan's West Side,

00:14:19.493 --> 00:14:21.238
and when the train stopped running,

00:14:21.238 --> 00:14:23.394
it became a self-seeded landscape,

00:14:23.394 --> 00:14:26.001
a kind of a garden in the sky.

00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:28.150
And when I saw it the first time,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.796
honestly, when I went up on that old viaduct,

00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:33.612
I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person,

00:14:33.612 --> 00:14:34.839
honestly.

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:36.960
And when I was appointed,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.036
saving the first two sections of the High Line

00:14:39.036 --> 00:14:42.408
from demolition became my first priority

00:14:42.408 --> 00:14:45.080
and my most important project.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.348
I knew if there was a day that I didn't

00:14:48.348 --> 00:14:51.951
worry about the High Line, it would come down.

00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:53.940
And the High Line,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.400
even though it is widely known now

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.219
and phenomenally popular,

00:14:58.219 --> 00:15:02.123
it is the most contested public space in the city.

00:15:02.123 --> 00:15:04.998
You might see a beautiful park,

00:15:04.998 --> 00:15:07.445
but not everyone does.

00:15:07.445 --> 00:15:10.082
You know, it's true, commercial interests

00:15:10.082 --> 00:15:13.299
will always battle against public space.

00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:15.123
You might say,

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.693
"How wonderful it is that more than

00:15:16.693 --> 00:15:19.124
four million people come from all over the world

00:15:19.124 --> 00:15:20.771
to visit the High Line."

00:15:20.771 --> 00:15:25.387
Well, a developer sees just one thing: customers.

00:15:25.387 --> 00:15:28.112
Hey, why not take out those plantings

00:15:28.112 --> 00:15:30.120
and have shops all along the High Line?

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.617
Wouldn't that be terrific

00:15:31.617 --> 00:15:34.152
and won't it mean a lot more money for the city?

00:15:34.152 --> 00:15:36.644
Well no, it would not be terrific.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:39.943
It would be a mall, and not a park.

00:15:39.943 --> 00:15:47.322
(Applause)

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:48.830
And you know what, it might mean

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.040
more money for the city,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.089
but a city has to take the long view,

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:58.025
the view for the common good.

00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:01.740
Most recently, the last section of the High Line,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.356
the third section of the High Line,

00:16:03.356 --> 00:16:04.926
the final section of the High Line,

00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:07.728
has been pitted against development interests,

00:16:07.728 --> 00:16:10.028
where some of the city's leading developers

00:16:10.028 --> 00:16:12.710
are building more than 17 million square feet

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.010
at the Hudson Yards.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.971
And they came to me and proposed

00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:19.530
that they "temporarily disassemble"

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.260
that third and final section.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.723
Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in

00:16:24.723 --> 00:16:27.610
with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.073
on a hill.

00:16:29.073 --> 00:16:31.797
Perhaps it was just in their way.

00:16:31.797 --> 00:16:34.285
But in any case, it took nine months

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.759
of nonstop daily negotiation

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:38.772
to finally get the signed agreement

00:16:38.772 --> 00:16:40.796
to prohibit its demolition,

00:16:40.796 --> 00:16:44.605
and that was only two years ago.

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:47.063
So you see, no matter how popular

00:16:47.063 --> 00:16:49.899
and successful a public space may be,

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.315
it can never be taken for granted.

00:16:52.315 --> 00:16:54.896
Public spaces always -- this is it saved --

00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:58.608
public spaces always need vigilant champions,

00:16:58.608 --> 00:17:02.308
not only to claim them at the outset for public use,

00:17:02.308 --> 00:17:05.839
but to design them for the people that use them,

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.870
then to maintain them to ensure

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.840
that they are for everyone,

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.253
that they are not violated, invaded,

00:17:12.253 --> 00:17:14.890
abandoned or ignored.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.534
If there is any one lesson

00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:19.686
that I have learned in my life as a city planner,

00:17:19.686 --> 00:17:23.446
it is that public spaces have power.

00:17:23.446 --> 00:17:26.515
It's not just the number of people using them,

00:17:26.515 --> 00:17:28.469
it's the even greater number of people

00:17:28.469 --> 00:17:30.588
who feel better about their city

00:17:30.588 --> 00:17:33.820
just knowing that they are there.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.292
Public space can change how you live in a city,

00:17:37.292 --> 00:17:39.462
how you feel about a city,

00:17:39.462 --> 00:17:42.750
whether you choose one city over another,

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.521
and public space is one of
the most important reasons

00:17:45.521 --> 00:17:48.642
why you stay in a city.

00:17:48.642 --> 00:17:51.107
I believe that a successful city

00:17:51.107 --> 00:17:53.728
is like a fabulous party.

00:17:53.728 --> 00:17:57.633
People stay because they are having a great time.

00:17:57.633 --> 00:17:59.576
Thank you.

00:17:59.576 --> 00:18:05.529
(Applause)

00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:10.159
Thank you. (Applause)
