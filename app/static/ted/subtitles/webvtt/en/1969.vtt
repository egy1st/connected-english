00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.404
What is the intersection
between technology, art and science?

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:08.875
Curiosity and wonder,

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.622
because it drives us to explore,

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:14.272
because we're surrounded
by things we can't see.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.036
And I love to use film
to take us on a journey

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.916
through portals of time and space,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.554
to make the invisible visible,

00:00:23.578 --> 00:00:24.940
because what that does,

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:26.863
it expands our horizons,

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:29.547
it transforms our perception,

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.654
it opens our minds

00:00:31.678 --> 00:00:32.975
and it touches our heart.

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:36.743
So here are some scenes
from my 3D IMAX film,

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.591
"Mysteries of the Unseen World."

00:00:39.353 --> 00:00:41.775
(Music)

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.229
There is movement which is too slow
for our eyes to detect,

00:00:46.253 --> 00:00:49.380
and time lapse makes us discover

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:51.766
and broaden our perspective of life.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.288
We can see how organisms emerge and grow,

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:59.677
how a vine survives by creeping
from the forest floor

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.284
to look at the sunlight.

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.779
And at the grand scale,

00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:08.884
time lapse allows us to see
our planet in motion.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:13.700
We can view not only
the vast sweep of nature,

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:15.946
but the restless movement of humanity.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:20.626
Each streaking dot
represents a passenger plane,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.191
and by turning air traffic data
into time-lapse imagery,

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:26.536
we can see something
that's above us constantly

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.277
but invisible:

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:31.594
the vast network of air travel
over the United States.

00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:36.251
We can do the same thing
with ships at sea.

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:41.598
We can turn data into a time-lapse view
of a global economy in motion.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:53.340
And decades of data give us
the view of our entire planet

00:01:53.364 --> 00:01:55.569
as a single organism

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:58.831
sustained by currents circulating
throughout the oceans

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:02.952
and by clouds swirling
through the atmosphere,

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.825
pulsing with lightning,

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.675
crowned by the aurora Borealis.

00:02:07.937 --> 00:02:10.157
It may be the ultimate time-lapse image:

00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:14.195
the anatomy of Earth brought to life.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.265
At the other extreme,

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.678
there are things that move
too fast for our eyes,

00:02:24.702 --> 00:02:27.965
but we have technology
that can look into that world as well.

00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:32.906
With high-speed cameras,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.961
we can do the opposite of time lapse.

00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:36.306
We can shoot images

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.779
that are thousands of times
faster than our vision.

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.961
And we can see how nature's
ingenious devices work,

00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:47.143
and perhaps we can even imitate them.

00:02:50.648 --> 00:02:52.641
When a dragonfly flutters by,

00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:54.700
you may not realize,

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:56.923
but it's the greatest flier in nature.

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:59.439
It can hover, fly backwards,

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.541
even upside down.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.553
And by tracking markers
on an insect's wings,

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:10.247
we can visualize the air flow
that they produce.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:12.667
Nobody knew the secret,

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.300
but high speed shows that a dragonfly

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:17.808
can move all four wings
in different directions

00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:19.109
at the same time.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.268
And what we learn can lead us
to new kinds of robotic flyers

00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:25.086
that can expand our vision

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.137
of important and remote places.

00:03:32.392 --> 00:03:33.663
We're giants,

00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:36.722
and we're unaware of things
that are too small for us to see.

00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:41.345
The electron microscope
fires electrons which creates images

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.328
which can magnify things
by as much as a million times.

00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:47.102
This is the egg of a butterfly.

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:52.520
And there are unseen creatures
living all over your body,

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:55.235
including mites
that spend their entire lives

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.266
dwelling on your eyelashes,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.169
crawling over your skin at night.

00:04:00.722 --> 00:04:02.423
Can you guess what this is?

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.114
Shark skin.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.355
A caterpillar's mouth.

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.988
The eye of a fruit fly.

00:04:17.283 --> 00:04:18.316
An eggshell.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.975
A flea.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.719
A snail's tongue.

00:04:32.098 --> 00:04:34.449
We think we know
most of the animal kingdom,

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:36.968
but there may be millions of tiny species

00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:38.515
waiting to be discovered.

00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:45.755
A spider also has great secrets,

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.493
because spiders' silk thread
is pound for pound stronger than steel

00:04:49.517 --> 00:04:51.000
but completely elastic.

00:04:51.744 --> 00:04:55.184
This journey will take us
all the way down to the nano world.

00:04:55.987 --> 00:05:00.101
The silk is 100 times thinner
than human hair.

00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:04.996
On there is bacteria,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.197
and near that bacteria, 10 times smaller,

00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:09.351
a virus.

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:14.623
Inside of that, 10 times smaller,

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.402
three strands of DNA.

00:05:17.743 --> 00:05:21.052
And nearing the limit
of our most powerful microscopes,

00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:23.218
single carbon atoms.

00:05:25.787 --> 00:05:27.911
With the tip of a powerful microscope,

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:30.132
we can actually move atoms

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:33.062
and begin to create amazing nano devices.

00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:39.896
Some could one day patrol our body
for all kinds of diseases

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.655
and clean out clogged arteries
along the way.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.060
Tiny chemical machines of the future

00:05:47.084 --> 00:05:49.855
can one day, perhaps, repair DNA.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:54.127
We are on the threshold
of extraordinary advances,

00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:57.539
born of our drive
to unveil the mysteries of life.

00:06:00.554 --> 00:06:03.458
So under an endless rain of cosmic dust,

00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:05.575
the air is full of pollen,

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.235
micro-diamonds and jewels

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.842
from other planets
and supernova explosions.

00:06:11.573 --> 00:06:15.704
People go about their lives
surrounded by the unseeable.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.638
Knowing that there's so much
around us we can't see

00:06:21.662 --> 00:06:24.792
forever changes
our understanding of the world,

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:26.632
and by looking at unseen worlds,

00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:29.408
we recognize that we exist
in the living universe,

00:06:29.432 --> 00:06:32.288
and this new perspective creates wonder

00:06:32.312 --> 00:06:34.891
and inspires us to become explorers

00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:36.213
in our own backyards.

00:06:38.602 --> 00:06:41.012
Who knows what awaits to be seen

00:06:41.036 --> 00:06:43.583
and what new wonders
will transform our lives.

00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:46.172
We'll just have to see.

00:06:49.674 --> 00:06:54.427
(Applause)

00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:55.625
Thank you.

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.720
(Applause)
