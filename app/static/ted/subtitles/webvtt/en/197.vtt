00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You will understand nothing with my type of English.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I must tell you I am like that, not very comfortable,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because usually, in life, I think my job is absolutely useless.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I mean, I feel useless.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now after Carolyn, and all the other guys, I feel like shit.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And definitively, I don't know why I am here,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!"

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I don't know. (Laughter)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, so, because I have nothing to show, nothing to say,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we shall try to speak about something else.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We can start, if you want, by understanding --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
it's just to start, it's not interesting, but -- how I work.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and why not -- a toothbrush?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I don't try to design the toothbrush.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I don't try to say, "Oh, that will be a beautiful object," or something like that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That doesn't interest me.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Because there is different types of design.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The one, we can call it the cynical design,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '50s,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
who said, what is ugly is a bad sale, la laideur se vend mal, which is terrible.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
for producer to make product more sexy, like that,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
they sell more: it's shit, it's obsolete, it's ridiculous.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I call that the cynical design.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
After, there is the narcissistic design:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers. (Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
After, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
for the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If we take the toothbrush -- I don't think about the toothbrush.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I think, "What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth?"

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I must imagine: Who owns this mouth?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
What is the life of the owner of this mouth? In what society [does] this guy live?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
What civilization creates this society?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
What animal species creates this civilization?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
When I arrive -- and I take one minute, I am not so intelligent --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
when I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes real interesting.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Me, I have strictly no power to change anything.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But when I come back, I can understand why I shall not do it,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
because today to not do it, it's more positive than do it, or how I shall do it.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But to come back, where I am at the animal species, there is things to see.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
There is things to see, there is the big challenge.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The big challenge in front of us.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Because there is not a human production

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
which exists outside of what I call "the big image."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Our poetry is our mutation, our life.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We must remember, and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that life appears four billion years ago, around -- four billion point two?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Voice offstage: Four point five.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Yes, point five, OK, OK, OK! (Laughter) I'm a designer,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that's all, of Christmas gifts.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And before, there was this soup, called "soupe primordiale,"

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
sort of dirty mud, no life, nothing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So then -- pshoo-shoo -- lightning -- pshoo -- arrive --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
pshoo-shoo -- makes life -- bloop bloop -- and that dies.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Some million years after -- pshoo-shoo, bloop-bloop -- ah, wake up!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
At the end, finally, that succeeds, and life appears.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We was so, so stupid. The most stupid bacteria.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Even, I think, we copy our way to reproduce, you know what I mean,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and something of -- oh no, forget it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
After, we become a fish; after, we become a frog;

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
after, we become a monkey; after, we become what we are today: a super-monkey,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and the fun is, the super-monkey we are today, is at half of the story.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Can you imagine? From that stupid bacteria to us,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
with a microphone, with a computer, with an iPod: four billion years.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And we know, and especially Carolyn knows, that when the sun will implode,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the earth will burn, explode, I don't know what,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and this is scheduled for four, four billion years?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yes, she said, something like that. OK, that means we are at half of the story.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Fantastic! It's a beauty!

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Can you imagine? It's very symbolic.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And today, we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And this territory is fantastic.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
That is our poetry. That is our beautiful story.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It's our romanticism. Mu-ta-tion. We are mutants.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
we completely miss the story.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Because every generation thinks we are the final one.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
We have a way to look at Earth like that, you know,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
"I am the man. The final man.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
For the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Something like that. I am not sure of that. (Laughter)

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
There is so many things to do; it's so fresh.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And here is something: nobody is obliged to be a genius,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
but everybody is obliged to participate.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And to participate, for a mutant, there is a minimum of exercise, a minimum of sport.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
We can say that.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The first, if you want -- there is so many --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
but one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I can explain you. I shall try.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
If you walk like that, it's OK, it's OK, you can walk,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
but perhaps, because you walk with the eyes like that, you will not see, oh, there is a hole.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And you will fall, and you will die. Dangerous.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
That's why, perhaps, you will try to have this angle of vision.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
OK, I can see, if I found something, up, up, and they continue, up up up.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I raise the angle of vision, but it's still very -- selfish, selfish, egoiste -- yes, selfish.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You, you survive. It's OK.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
"I see you, oh my God you are here, how are you, I can help you,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I can design for you a new toothbrush, new toilet brush," something like that.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I live in society; I live in community.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
From this level, the more you can raise this angle of view,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
the more you will be important for the society.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The more you will rise, the more you will be important for the civilization.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
The more you will rise, to see far and high, like that,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
the more you will be important for the story of our mutation.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
That means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
From this to here, that, it's genius.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Ptolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Nobody's obliged to be a genius.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It's better, but nobody.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Take care, in this training, to be a good mutant.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
There is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Because at the vertical of us, if you look like that,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
"Ah! my God, there is God. Ah! God!"

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
That means, when your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
you go, "Ah, it's God, it's God." That's ridiculous.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
That's why -- jump, like that? No, don't jump.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Come back. Because, after, there is another trap.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
If you look like that, you look to the past,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
or you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
It's called schizophrenia, and you are dead also.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
That's why every morning, now, because you are a good mutant,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
you will raise your angle of view.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Out, more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Never forget -- like that, like that.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It's very, very, very important.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:32.000
What, what else we can say about that? Why do that?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:43.000
It's because we -- if we look from far, we see our line of evolution.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
This line of evolution is clearly positive.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
From far, this line looks very smooth, like that.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But if you take a lens, like that, this line is ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. Like that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
It's made of light and shadow.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We can say light is civilization, shadow is barbaria.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And it's very important to know where we are.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Because some cycle, there is a spot in the cycle,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
That means, we can imagine -- I don't say it was fantastic,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000
but in the '80s, there was not too much war, like that, it was --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
In this case, people like me are acceptable.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
We can say, "It's luxurious time."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
We have time to think, we have time to I don't know what,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
speak about art and things like that.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
It's OK. We are in the light.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But sometimes, like today, we fall, we fall so fast, so fast to shadow, we fall so fast to barbaria.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
With many, many, many, many face of barbaria.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Because it's not, the barbaria we have today, it's perhaps not the barbaria we think.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
There is different type of barbaria.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
That's why we must adapt.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:37.000
That means, when barbaria is back, forget the beautiful chairs, forget the beautiful hotel,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
forget design, even -- I'm sorry to say -- forget art.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Forget all that. There is priority; there is urgency.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You must go back to politics, you must go back to radicalization,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I'm sorry if that's not very English.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You must go back to fight, to battle.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
That's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
That's why I am here, to try to do it the best possible.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But I know that even I do it the best possible

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
-- that's why I'm the best -- it's nothing.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Because it's not the right time.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:21.000
That's why I say that. I say that, because, I repeat, nothing exist if it's not in the good rhythym,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
the rhythym of our beautiful dream, of this civilization.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And because we must all work to finish this story.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Because the scenario of this civilization

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
-- about love, progress, and things like that -- it's OK,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
but there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000
This scenario, of this civilization, was about becoming powerful, intelligent,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
like this idea we have invented, this concept of God.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
We are God now. We are. It's almost done.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
We have just to finish the story.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
That is very, very important.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And when you don't understand really what's happened,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You go to the future back, back, back, back, like that.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And you can fall, and it's very dangerous.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
No, you must really understand that.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Because we have almost finished, I'll repeat this story.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
a new poetry, a new romanticism.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000
With billions of people who have been born, worked, lived and died before us,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
these people who have worked so much,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000
we have now bring beautiful things, beautiful gifts, we know so many things.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
We can say to our children, OK, done, that was our story. That passed.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Now you have a duty: invent a new story. Invent a new poetry.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000
The only rule is, we have not to have any idea about the next story.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We give you white pages. Invent.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
We give you the best tools, the best tools, and now, do it.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
That's why I continue to work, even if it's for toilet brush.
