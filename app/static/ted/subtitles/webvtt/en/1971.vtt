00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.126
I was born and raised in Sierra Leone,

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:07.371
a small and very beautiful country

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:09.076
in West Africa,

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.980
a country rich both in physical resources

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.312
and creative talent.

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:16.274
However, Sierra Leone is infamous

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:18.688
for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:21.778
when entire villages were burnt down.

00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:25.990
An estimated 8,000 men, women and children

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.256
had their arms and legs amputated during this time.

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:33.240
As my family and I ran for safety

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.932
when I was about 12 from one of those attacks,

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:39.364
I resolved that I would do everything I could

00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:41.644
to ensure that my own children

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:45.030
would not go through the 
same experiences we had.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.644
They would, in fact, be part of a Sierra Leone

00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:50.132
where war and amputation

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:54.838
were no longer a strategy for gaining power.

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:58.571
As I watched people who I knew, loved ones,

00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:00.462
recover from this devastation,

00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:03.126
one thing that deeply troubled me

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:05.630
was that many of the amputees in the country

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.686
would not use their prostheses.

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:09.642
The reason, I would come to find out,

00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:11.977
was that their prosthetic sockets

00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:17.437
were painful because they did not fit well.

00:01:17.437 --> 00:01:19.623
The prosthetic socket is the part

00:01:19.623 --> 00:01:23.019
in which the amputee inserts their residual limb,

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.299
and which connects to the prosthetic ankle.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.037
Even in the developed world,

00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:30.529
it takes a period of three weeks to often years

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:34.791
for a patient to get a comfortable socket, if ever.

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:37.673
Prosthetists still use conventional processes

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:40.029
like molding and casting

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:43.747
to create single-material prosthetic sockets.

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:46.535
Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:49.363
of pressure on the limbs of the patient,

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:53.663
leaving them with pressure sores and blisters.

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:55.775
It does not matter

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:58.997
how powerful your prosthetic ankle is.

00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:01.693
If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable,

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:03.265
you will not use your leg,

00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:07.145
and that is just simply unacceptable in our age.

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:09.565
So one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:11.090
about two and a half years ago,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.577
and he asked me if I knew 
how to solve this problem,

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:15.677
I said, "No, not yet,

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:18.287
but I would love to figure it out."

00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:21.577
And so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab,

00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:24.470
I designed custom prosthetic sockets

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.377
quickly and cheaply

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:29.232
that are more comfortable

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.229
than conventional prostheses.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.471
I used magnetic resonance imaging

00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:38.360
to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.464
then use finite element modeling to better predict

00:02:41.464 --> 00:02:43.407
the internal stresses and strains

00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:45.405
on the normal forces,

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:50.018
and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture.

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:53.432
We use a 3D printer to create

00:02:53.432 --> 00:02:57.248
a multi-material prosthetic socket

00:02:57.248 --> 00:02:59.714
which relieves pressure where needed

00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:03.246
on the anatomy of the patient.

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:06.177
In short, we're using data

00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:09.976
to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply.

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:11.772
In a recent trial we just wrapped up

00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:13.534
at the Media Lab,

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:16.044
one of our patients, a U.S. veteran

00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:18.970
who has been an amputee for about 20 years

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.052
and worn dozens of legs,

00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:26.140
said of one of our printed parts,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.544
"It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows,

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:32.480
and it's effing sexy."

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.198
(Laughter)

00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:39.474
Disability in our age

00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:41.107
should not prevent anyone

00:03:41.107 --> 00:03:43.970
from living meaningful lives.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.313
My hope and desire is that the tools and processes

00:03:47.313 --> 00:03:49.311
we develop in our research group

00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:52.249
can be used to bring highly functional prostheses

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:54.540
to those who need them.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.991
For me, a place to begin healing the souls

00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:03.880
of those affected by war and disease

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.629
is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.585
for their bodies.

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:12.813
Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston,

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:16.419
I hope this not only restores

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.680
but indeed transforms their
sense of human potential.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.591
Thank you very much.

00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:26.540
(Applause)
