00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:02.407
So I've been thinking about the difference between

00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:05.541
the résumé virtues and 
the eulogy virtues.

00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:08.443
The résumé virtues are the
ones you put on your résumé,

00:00:08.443 --> 00:00:11.909
which are the skills 
you bring to the marketplace.

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:13.647
The eulogy virtues are the ones

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.129
that get mentioned in the eulogy,

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.067
which are deeper: who are you, 
in your depth,

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:19.843
what is the nature of your relationships,

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:23.407
are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency?

00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:24.901
And most of us, including 
me, would say

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.117
that the eulogy virtues are the
more important of the virtues.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.200
But at least in my case, 
are they the ones that

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.002
I think about the most? 
And the answer is no.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.295
So I've been thinking about that problem,

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:36.463
and a thinker who has 
helped me think about it

00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:38.076
is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:41.446
who wrote a book called "The
Lonely Man Of Faith" in 1965.

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:44.766
Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures,

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.156
which he called Adam I
and Adam II.

00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:48.888
Adam I is the worldly, ambitious,

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:51.111
external side of our nature.

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:53.184
He wants to build, create,
create companies,

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:54.730
create innovation.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.468
Adam II is the humble
side of our nature.

00:00:57.468 --> 00:01:00.285
Adam II wants not only 
to do good but to be good,

00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:02.232
to live in a way internally

00:01:02.232 --> 00:01:06.035
that honors God, creation and our possibilities.

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:07.923
Adam I wants to conquer the world.

00:01:07.923 --> 00:01:10.687
Adam II wants to hear 
a calling and obey the world.

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:13.175
Adam I savors accomplishment.

00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:15.857
Adam II savors inner 
consistency and strength.

00:01:15.857 --> 00:01:18.600
Adam I asks how things work.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.918
Adam II asks why we're here.

00:01:20.918 --> 00:01:23.022
Adam I's motto is "success."

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:27.268
Adam II's motto is "love, redemption and return."

00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:29.118
And Soloveitchik argued 
that these two sides

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:31.766
of our nature are 
at war with each other.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.830
We live in perpetual self-confrontation

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.094
between the external success and the internal value.

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:39.578
And the tricky thing, 
I'd say, about these

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:41.270
two sides of our nature is they work

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.680
by different logics.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.914
The external logic is 
an economic logic:

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:49.380
input leads to output, 
risk leads to reward.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.156
The internal side of our nature

00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:54.577
is a moral logic and 
often an inverse logic.

00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:56.451
You have to give to receive.

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:58.167
You have to surrender 
to something outside yourself

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.449
to gain strength within yourself.

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:02.770
You have to conquer the
desire to get what you want.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.561
In order to fulfill yourself,
you have to forget yourself.

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:09.873
In order to find yourself, 
you have to lose yourself.

00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:12.809
We happen to live in a society 
that favors Adam I,

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.049
and often neglects Adam II.

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.281
And the problem is, that turns
you into a shrewd animal

00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.838
who treats life as a game,

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:22.563
and you become a cold, 
calculating creature

00:02:22.563 --> 00:02:25.369
who slips into a sort of mediocrity

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:26.829
where you realize there's a difference

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.401
between your desired 
self and your actual self.

00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:33.374
You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want,

00:02:33.374 --> 00:02:34.934
you hope someone will give to you.

00:02:34.934 --> 00:02:36.660
You don't have the 
depth of conviction.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.197
You don't have an emotional sonorousness.

00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:40.966
You don't have 
commitment to tasks

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:44.180
that would take more than a lifetime to commit.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.627
I was reminded of a common
response through history

00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:50.389
of how you build a solid Adam II,

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.399
how you build a depth of character.

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.124
Through history, people 
have gone back

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:57.010
into their own pasts,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.260
sometimes to a precious 
time in their life,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.719
to their childhood,

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.685
and often, the mind 
gravitates in the past

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.073
to a moment of shame,

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:09.000
some sin committed, 
some act of selfishness,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.290
an act of omission, of shallowness,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.033
the sin of anger, the sin of self-pity,

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:17.618
trying to be a people-pleaser, 
a lack of courage.

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:22.313
Adam I is built by 
building on your strengths.

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:26.409
Adam II is built by fighting 
your weaknesses.

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.267
You go into yourself, 
you find the sin

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:30.939
which you've committed over
and again through your life,

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.740
your signature sin

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.431
out of which the others emerge,

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.295
and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin,

00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:41.431
and out of that wrestling, 
that suffering,

00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:45.049
then a depth of character is constructed.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.951
And we're often not
taught to recognize

00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:48.087
the sin in ourselves,

00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:49.935
in that we're not taught in this culture

00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:51.882
how to wrestle with it,

00:03:51.882 --> 00:03:54.555
how to confront it, 
and how to combat it.

00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:57.885
We live in a culture 
with an Adam I mentality

00:03:57.885 --> 00:04:01.054
where we're inarticulate 
about Adam II.

00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:02.710
Finally, Reinhold Niebuhr

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.845
summed up the confrontation, the fully lived

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:08.398
Adam I and Adam II life, this way:

00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:11.660
"Nothing that is worth doing
can be achieved in our lifetime;

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.042
therefore we must 
be saved by hope.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:17.148
Nothing which is true or
beautiful or good makes

00:04:17.148 --> 00:04:20.104
complete sense in any immediate context of history;

00:04:20.104 --> 00:04:22.782
therefore we must be saved by faith.

00:04:22.782 --> 00:04:26.672
Nothing we do, however virtuous,
can be accomplished alone;

00:04:26.672 --> 00:04:29.718
therefore we must 
be saved by love.

00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:32.155
No virtuous act is quite as virtuous

00:04:32.155 --> 00:04:36.141
from the standpoint of our friend
or foe as from our own standpoint.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:38.968
Therefore we must be saved 
by that final form of love,

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:40.604
which is forgiveness.”

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:42.680
Thanks.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.398
(Applause)
