00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:02.056
When I was born,

00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:03.736
there was really only one book

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:05.622
about how to raise your children,

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:08.789
and it was written by Dr. Spock.

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.725
(Laughter)

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:11.956
Thank you for indulging me.

00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:15.562
I have always wanted to do that.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.665
No, it was Benjamin Spock,

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:21.515
and his book was called "The Common
Sense Book of Baby And Child Care."

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:27.162
It sold almost 50 million copies 
by the time he died.

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:30.807
Today, I, as the mother of a six-year-old,

00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:32.484
walk into Barnes and Noble,

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:35.165
and see this.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:37.124
And it is amazing

00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:40.828
the variety that one finds 
on those shelves.

00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:45.250
There are guides to raising 
an eco-friendly kid,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.445
a gluten-free kid,

00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:49.810
a disease-proof kid,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.763
which, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy.

00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:56.300
There are guides to raising a bilingual kid

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.151
even if you only speak one language at home.

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:02.767
There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.529
and a science-minded kid

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:08.639
and a kid who is a whiz at yoga.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:11.849
Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:13.199
a nuclear bomb,

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:19.705
there is pretty much a guide to everything.

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.319
All of these books are well-intentioned.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.829
I am sure that many of them are great.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.930
But taken together, I am sorry,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.281
I do not see help

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:37.130
when I look at that shelf.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.404
I see anxiety.

00:01:39.404 --> 00:01:42.131
I see a giant candy-colored monument

00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:45.074
to our collective panic,

00:01:45.074 --> 00:01:47.655
and it makes me want to know,

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:50.038
why is it that raising our children

00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:51.820
is associated with so much anguish

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.078
and so much confusion?

00:01:54.078 --> 00:01:56.792
Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:59.768
about the one thing human beings

00:01:59.768 --> 00:02:01.632
have been doing successfully for millennia,

00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:04.468
long before parenting message boards

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:07.345
and peer-reviewed studies came along?

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:09.998
Why is it that so many mothers and fathers

00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:16.220
experience parenthood as a kind of crisis?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.566
Crisis might seem like a strong word,

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:21.544
but there is data suggesting it probably isn't.

00:02:21.544 --> 00:02:24.300
There was, in fact, a paper of just this very name,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.386
"Parenthood as Crisis," published in 1957,

00:02:28.386 --> 00:02:30.924
and in the 50-plus years since,

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:33.010
there has been plenty of scholarship

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.417
documenting a pretty clear pattern

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:37.472
of parental anguish.

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:40.778
Parents experience more stress than non-parents.

00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:43.694
Their marital satisfaction is lower.

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.211
There have been a number of studies

00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:46.500
looking at how parents feel

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.917
when they are spending time with their kids,

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.817
and the answer often is, not so great.

00:02:52.817 --> 00:02:54.855
Last year, I spoke with a researcher

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:56.151
named Matthew Killingsworth

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:59.611
who is doing a very, very imaginative project

00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:01.509
that tracks people's happiness,

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:05.478
and here is what he told me he found:

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:07.092
"Interacting with your friends

00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:10.004
is better than interacting with your spouse,

00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:13.360
which is better than interacting with other relatives,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.585
which is better than interacting with acquaintances,

00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:19.530
which is better than interacting with parents,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.306
which is better than interacting with children.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.306
Who are on par with strangers."

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:29.812
(Laughter)

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:32.179
But here's the thing.

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.257
I have been looking at what underlies these data

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.168
for three years,

00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:40.394
and children are not the problem.

00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:45.381
Something about parenting right now at this moment

00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:47.421
is the problem.

00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:49.910
Specifically, I don't think we know

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.426
what parenting is supposed to be.

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:54.606
Parent, as a verb,

00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:58.868
only entered common usage in 1970.

00:03:58.868 --> 00:04:02.190
Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.031
The roles of our children have changed.

00:04:05.031 --> 00:04:07.373
We are all now furiously improvising

00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:09.279
our way through a situation

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.872
for which there is no script,

00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:14.913
and if you're an amazing jazz musician,

00:04:14.913 --> 00:04:17.100
then improv is great,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.505
but for the rest of us,

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:23.321
it can kind of feel like a crisis.

00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.901
So how did we get here?

00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:28.017
How is it that we are all now navigating

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:29.569
a child-rearing universe

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.397
without any norms to guide us?

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.557
Well, for starters, there has been

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:36.396
a major historical change.

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:38.589
Until fairly recently,

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:42.301
kids worked, on our farms primarily,

00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:45.169
but also in factories, mills, mines.

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.085
Kids were considered economic assets.

00:04:48.085 --> 00:04:50.181
Sometime during the Progressive Era,

00:04:50.181 --> 00:04:51.809
we put an end to this arrangement.

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.080
We recognized kids had rights,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.600
we banned child labor,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.370
we focused on education instead,

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.546
and school became a child's new work.

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:03.252
And thank God it did.

00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:05.649
But that only made a parent's role

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:07.420
more confusing in a way.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.972
The old arrangement might not have been

00:05:08.972 --> 00:05:12.090
particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.446
We provided food, clothing, shelter,

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:16.570
and moral instruction to our kids,

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.210
and they in return provided income.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.178
Once kids stopped working,

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:27.482
the economics of parenting changed.

00:05:27.482 --> 00:05:30.054
Kids became, in the words of one

00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:33.496
brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist,

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:38.258
"economically worthless but emotionally priceless."

00:05:38.258 --> 00:05:40.649
Rather than them working for us,

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:42.552
we began to work for them,

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.412
because within only a matter of decades

00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:45.820
it became clear:

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.190
if we wanted our kids to succeed,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.183
school was not enough.

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:55.980
Today, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.737
but that's work for us too,

00:05:57.737 --> 00:06:00.920
because we are the ones
driving them to soccer practice.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.783
Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work,

00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:05.351
but that's also work for us,

00:06:05.351 --> 00:06:07.462
because we have to check it.

00:06:07.462 --> 00:06:09.787
About three years ago, a Texas woman

00:06:09.787 --> 00:06:10.841
told something to me

00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:14.120
that totally broke my heart.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.160
She said, almost casually,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.594
"Homework is the new dinner."

00:06:22.594 --> 00:06:25.194
The middle class now pours all of its time

00:06:25.194 --> 00:06:28.636
and energy and resources into its kids,

00:06:28.636 --> 00:06:29.989
even though the middle class

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.602
has less and less of those things to give.

00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:36.886
Mothers now spend more time with their children

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:39.269
than they did in 1965,

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:44.663
when most women were not even in the workforce.

00:06:44.663 --> 00:06:46.775
It would probably be easier for parents

00:06:46.775 --> 00:06:48.166
to do their new roles

00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:51.731
if they knew what they were preparing their kids for.

00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:54.175
This is yet another thing that
makes modern parenting

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:56.245
so very confounding.

00:06:56.245 --> 00:06:59.933
We have no clue what portion our wisdom, if any,

00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:01.690
is of use to our kids.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.123
The world is changing so rapidly,

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:05.326
it's impossible to say.

00:07:05.326 --> 00:07:07.401
This was true even when I was young.

00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:10.425
When I was a kid, high school specifically,

00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:12.409
I was told that I would be at sea

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.194
in the new global economy

00:07:14.194 --> 00:07:18.700
if I did not know Japanese.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.202
And with all due respect to the Japanese,

00:07:21.202 --> 00:07:23.643
it didn't turn out that way.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.931
Now there is a certain kind of middle-class parent

00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:28.635
that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin,

00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:31.245
and maybe they're onto something,

00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:33.980
but we cannot know for sure.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.609
So, absent being able to anticipate the future,

00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:39.234
what we all do, as good parents,

00:07:39.234 --> 00:07:41.161
is try and prepare our kids

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:44.209
for every possible kind of future,

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:48.266
hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off.

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:50.194
We teach our kids chess,

00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:52.829
thinking maybe they will need analytical skills.

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:55.274
We sign them up for team sports,

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:58.561
thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills,

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.081
you know, for when they go
to Harvard Business School.

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:04.310
We try and teach them to be financially savvy

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.767
and science-minded and eco-friendly

00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:10.733
and gluten-free,

00:08:10.733 --> 00:08:12.705
though now is probably a good time to tell you

00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:18.245
that I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child.

00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:23.035
I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.212
And you know what? I'm doing okay.

00:08:25.212 --> 00:08:27.625
I pay my taxes.

00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:30.842
I hold down a steady job.

00:08:30.842 --> 00:08:35.170
I was even invited to speak at TED.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.552
But the presumption now is that

00:08:36.552 --> 00:08:39.950
what was good enough for me,
or for my folks for that matter,

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.761
isn't good enough anymore.

00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:45.425
So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf,

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:48.737
because we feel like if we aren't trying everything,

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.867
it's as if we're doing nothing

00:08:50.867 --> 00:08:56.204
and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids.

00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:58.812
So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles

00:08:58.812 --> 00:09:00.334
as mothers and fathers.

00:09:00.334 --> 00:09:02.780
Now add to this problem something else:

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.708
we are also navigating new roles

00:09:04.708 --> 00:09:06.312
as husbands and wives

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:09.960
because most women today are in the workforce.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.490
This is another reason, I think,

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.812
that parenthood feels like a crisis.

00:09:13.812 --> 00:09:16.462
We have no rules, no scripts, no norms

00:09:16.462 --> 00:09:19.002
for what to do when a child comes along

00:09:19.002 --> 00:09:22.193
now that both mom and dad are breadwinners.

00:09:22.193 --> 00:09:24.598
The writer Michael Lewis once put this

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:25.835
very, very well.

00:09:25.835 --> 00:09:28.347
He said that the surest way

00:09:28.347 --> 00:09:30.142
for a couple to start fighting

00:09:30.142 --> 00:09:33.170
is for them to go out to dinner with another couple

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.355
whose division of labor

00:09:34.355 --> 00:09:37.965
is ever so slightly different from theirs,

00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:41.641
because the conversation in
the car on the way home

00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:43.858
goes something like this:

00:09:44.775 --> 00:09:49.408
"So, did you catch that Dave is the one

00:09:49.408 --> 00:09:53.309
who walks them to school every morning?"

00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:57.130
(Laughter)

00:09:57.742 --> 00:10:00.257
Without scripts telling us who does what

00:10:00.257 --> 00:10:03.306
in this brave new world, couples fight,

00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:06.545
and both mothers and fathers each have

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:08.475
their legitimate gripes.

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:10.330
Mothers are much more likely

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.408
to be multi-tasking when they are at home,

00:10:12.408 --> 00:10:14.619
and fathers, when they are at home,

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:17.578
are much more likely to be mono-tasking.

00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:20.146
Find a guy at home, and odds are

00:10:20.146 --> 00:10:23.907
he is doing just one thing at a time.

00:10:23.907 --> 00:10:26.811
In fact, UCLA recently did a study

00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:29.344
looking at the most common configuration

00:10:29.344 --> 00:10:32.390
of family members in middle-class homes.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.123
Guess what it was?

00:10:34.123 --> 00:10:36.770
Dad in a room by himself.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.210
According to the American Time Use Survey,

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.435
mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers,

00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:46.034
which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day,

00:10:46.034 --> 00:10:48.300
but I still think that something she wrote

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.172
is highly relevant:

00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:54.890
"I have not been alone in the
bathroom since October."

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:59.224
(Laughter)

00:10:59.224 --> 00:11:04.054
But here is the thing: Men are doing plenty.

00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:05.830
They spend more time with their kids

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.164
than their fathers ever spent with them.

00:11:09.164 --> 00:11:11.144
They work more paid hours, on average,

00:11:11.144 --> 00:11:12.837
than their wives,

00:11:12.837 --> 00:11:14.671
and they genuinely want to be good,

00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:16.250
involved dads.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.618
Today, it is fathers, not mothers,

00:11:19.618 --> 00:11:23.729
who report the most work-life conflict.

00:11:23.729 --> 00:11:25.961
Either way, by the way,

00:11:25.961 --> 00:11:28.296
if you think it's hard for traditional families

00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:29.920
to sort out these new roles,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.756
just imagine what it's like now

00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:33.651
for non-traditional families:

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.246
families with two dads, families with two moms,

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:37.951
single-parent households.

00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:42.344
They are truly improvising as they go.

00:11:42.344 --> 00:11:46.135
Now, in a more progressive country,

00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:48.865
and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché

00:11:48.865 --> 00:11:51.919
and invoking, yes, Sweden,

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.840
parents could rely on the state

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.489
for support.

00:11:57.489 --> 00:11:59.368
There are countries that acknowledge

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:00.801
the anxieties and the changing roles

00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:03.165
of mothers and fathers.

00:12:03.165 --> 00:12:06.429
Unfortunately, the United States is not one of them,

00:12:06.429 --> 00:12:08.394
so in case you were wondering what the U.S.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:13.697
has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia,

00:12:13.697 --> 00:12:16.728
it's this:

00:12:16.728 --> 00:12:20.455
We too have no paid maternity leave policy.

00:12:20.455 --> 00:12:27.702
We are one of eight known countries that does not.

00:12:27.702 --> 00:12:31.273
In this age of intense confusion,

00:12:31.273 --> 00:12:34.675
there is just one goal upon which

00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:36.507
all parents can agree,

00:12:36.507 --> 00:12:37.971
and that is whether they are

00:12:37.971 --> 00:12:42.537
tiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones,

00:12:42.537 --> 00:12:46.678
our kids' happiness is paramount.

00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:48.560
That is what it means

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.010
to raise kids in an age

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.235
when they are economically worthless

00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:55.480
but emotionally priceless.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.880
We are all the custodians of their self-esteem.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.713
The one mantra no parent ever questions is,

00:13:02.713 --> 00:13:08.444
"All I want is for my children to be happy."

00:13:08.444 --> 00:13:10.157
And don't get me wrong:

00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:15.037
I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child.

00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:18.743
But it is a very elusive one.

00:13:18.743 --> 00:13:22.683
Happiness and self-confidence,

00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:24.664
teaching children that is not like teaching them

00:13:24.664 --> 00:13:26.180
how to plow a field.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.881
It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike.

00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:31.438
There's no curriculum for it.

00:13:31.438 --> 00:13:35.035
Happiness and self-confidence can
be the byproducts of other things,

00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:38.090
but they cannot really be goals unto themselves.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.756
A child's happiness

00:13:39.756 --> 00:13:43.511
is a very unfair burden to place on a parent.

00:13:43.521 --> 00:13:46.359
And happiness is an even more unfair burden

00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:49.199
to place on a kid.

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:51.222
And I have to tell you,

00:13:51.222 --> 00:13:55.104
I think it leads to some very strange excesses.

00:13:55.104 --> 00:13:57.506
We are now so anxious

00:13:57.506 --> 00:14:00.824
to protect our kids from the world's ugliness

00:14:00.824 --> 00:14:05.576
that we now shield them from "Sesame Street."

00:14:05.576 --> 00:14:07.712
I wish I could say I was kidding about this,

00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:10.384
but if you go out and you buy

00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:13.323
the first few episodes of "Sesame Street" on DVD,

00:14:13.323 --> 00:14:16.404
as I did out of nostalgia,

00:14:16.404 --> 00:14:19.517
you will find a warning at the beginning

00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:22.147
saying that the content is not suitable

00:14:22.147 --> 00:14:23.915
for children.

00:14:23.915 --> 00:14:26.025
(Laughter)

00:14:26.025 --> 00:14:27.230
Can I just repeat that?

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.861
The content of the original "Sesame Street"

00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:33.203
is not suitable for children.

00:14:33.203 --> 00:14:36.845
When asked about this by The New York Times,

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:40.150
a producer for the show gave
a variety of explanations.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.909
One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe

00:14:42.909 --> 00:14:44.670
in one skit and then swallowed it.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.105
Bad modeling. I don't know.

00:14:46.105 --> 00:14:49.087
But the thing that stuck with me

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:51.542
is she said that she didn't know

00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:55.881
whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today

00:14:55.881 --> 00:15:00.779
because he was too depressive.

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:03.187
I cannot tell you how much this distresses me.

00:15:03.187 --> 00:15:04.706
(Laughter)

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:06.559
You are looking at a woman

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:09.603
who has a periodic table of the Muppets

00:15:09.603 --> 00:15:13.395
hanging from her cubicle wall.

00:15:13.395 --> 00:15:17.154
The offending muppet, right there.

00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:23.025
That's my son the day he was born.

00:15:23.025 --> 00:15:25.217
I was high as a kite on morphine.

00:15:25.217 --> 00:15:29.080
I had had an unexpected C-section.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.596
But even in my opiate haze,

00:15:32.596 --> 00:15:35.529
I managed to have one very clear thought

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:38.481
the first time I held him.

00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:40.385
I whispered it into his ear.

00:15:40.385 --> 00:15:49.269
I said, "I will try so hard not to hurt you."

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:50.589
It was the Hippocratic Oath,

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:54.467
and I didn't even know I was saying it.

00:15:54.467 --> 00:15:56.791
But it occurs to me now

00:15:56.791 --> 00:15:58.870
that the Hippocratic Oath

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:03.202
is a much more realistic aim than happiness.

00:16:03.202 --> 00:16:06.802
In fact, as any parent will tell you,

00:16:06.802 --> 00:16:09.570
it's awfully hard.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:14.424
All of us have said or done hurtful things

00:16:14.424 --> 00:16:20.398
that we wish to God we could take back.

00:16:20.398 --> 00:16:23.246
I think in another era

00:16:23.246 --> 00:16:27.238
we did not expect quite so much from ourselves,

00:16:27.238 --> 00:16:30.920
and it is important that we all remember that

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.754
the next time we are staring with our hearts racing

00:16:34.754 --> 00:16:38.800
at those bookshelves.

00:16:40.254 --> 00:16:43.508
I'm not really sure how to create new norms

00:16:43.508 --> 00:16:45.186
for this world,

00:16:45.186 --> 00:16:48.270
but I do think that

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.588
in our desperate quest to create happy kids,

00:16:51.588 --> 00:16:54.615
we may be assuming the wrong moral burden.

00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:56.333
It strikes me as a better goal,

00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:58.549
and, dare I say, a more virtuous one,

00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:01.268
to focus on making productive kids

00:17:01.268 --> 00:17:02.608
and moral kids,

00:17:02.608 --> 00:17:04.924
and to simply hope that happiness will come to them

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:07.670
by virtue of the good that they do

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.898
and their accomplishments

00:17:09.898 --> 00:17:12.796
and the love that they feel from us.

00:17:12.796 --> 00:17:18.429
That, anyway, is one response to having no script.

00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:21.762
Absent having new scripts,

00:17:21.762 --> 00:17:25.447
we just follow the oldest ones in the book --

00:17:25.447 --> 00:17:31.046
decency, a work ethic, love —

00:17:31.046 --> 00:17:35.370
and let happiness and self-esteem
take care of themselves.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.414
I think if we all did that,

00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:40.955
the kids would still be all right,

00:17:40.955 --> 00:17:43.601
and so would their parents,

00:17:43.601 --> 00:17:47.569
possibly in both cases even better.

00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:49.448
Thank you.

00:17:49.448 --> 00:17:53.448
(Applause)
