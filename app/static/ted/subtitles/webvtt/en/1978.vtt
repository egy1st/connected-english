WEBVTT

00:00:01.506 --> 00:00:03.708
I feel so fortunate that my first job

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.140
was working at the Museum of Modern Art

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.594
on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray.

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:11.980
I learned so much from her.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.748
After the curator Robert Storr

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.267
selected all the paintings

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:18.019
from her lifetime body of work,

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.661
I loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s.

00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:24.217
There were some motifs and elements

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:27.723
that would come up again later in her life.

00:00:27.723 --> 00:00:29.362
I remember asking her

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.920
what she thought of those early works.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.384
If you didn't know they were hers,

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:35.954
you might not have been able to guess.

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:38.877
She told me that a few didn't quite meet

00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:42.484
her own mark for what she wanted them to be.

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:43.913
One of the works, in fact,

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:45.434
so didn't meet her mark,

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:48.406
she had set it out in the trash in her studio,

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:50.247
and her neighbor had taken it

00:00:50.247 --> 00:00:52.817
because she saw its value.

00:00:52.817 --> 00:00:55.766
In that moment, my view of success

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.282
and creativity changed.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:01.170
I realized that success is a moment,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.106
but what we're always celebrating

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:07.114
is creativity and mastery.

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:10.751
But this is the thing: What gets us to convert success

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:12.980
into mastery?

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.771
This is a question I've long asked myself.

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:18.352
I think it comes when we start to value

00:01:18.352 --> 00:01:21.944
the gift of a near win.

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:24.139
I started to understand this when I went

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:26.122
on one cold May day

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:28.673
to watch a set of varsity archers,

00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:30.970
all women as fate would have it,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.050
at the northern tip of Manhattan

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.469
at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.138
I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox,

00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:42.969
the idea that in order to actually hit your target,

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.411
you have to aim at something slightly skew from it.

00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:49.404
I stood and watched as the coach

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:52.118
drove up these women in this gray van,

00:01:52.118 --> 00:01:55.096
and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus.

00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:57.990
One held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.507
and arrows in the left with yellow fletching.

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:03.190
And they passed me and smiled,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.990
but they sized me up as they

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.609
made their way to the turf,

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.363
and spoke to each other not with words

00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:11.080
but with numbers, degrees, I thought,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.378
positions for how they might plan

00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:14.911
to hit their target.

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.294
I stood behind one archer as her coach

00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:19.316
stood in between us to maybe assess

00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:21.773
who might need support, and watched her,

00:02:21.773 --> 00:02:23.860
and I didn't understand how even one

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.711
was going to hit the ten ring.

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:29.359
The ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance,

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.269
it looks as small as a matchstick tip

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.366
held out at arm's length.

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:37.645
And this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight

00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:40.352
on each shot.

00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:43.044
She first hit a seven, I remember, and then a nine,

00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:44.324
and then two tens,

00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:45.560
and then the next arrow

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.779
didn't even hit the target.

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.780
And I saw that gave her more tenacity,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.566
and she went after it again and again.

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:55.512
For three hours this went on.

00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:57.933
At the end of the practice, one of the archers

00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:00.519
was so taxed that she lied out on the ground

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.460
just star-fished,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.492
her head looking up at the sky,

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:07.104
trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:10.990
that still point of the turning world.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.005
It's so rare in American culture,

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.015
there's so little that's vocational about it anymore,

00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:18.609
to look at what doggedness looks like

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.720
with this level of exactitude,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.101
what it means to align your body posture

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:26.468
for three hours in order to hit a target,

00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:30.538
pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity.

00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:32.763
But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing

00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:35.098
what's so rare to glimpse,

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:38.971
that difference between success and mastery.

00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:41.595
So success is hitting that ten ring,

00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:43.711
but mastery is knowing that it means nothing

00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:47.267
if you can't do it again and again.

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:50.988
Mastery is not just the same as excellence, though.

00:03:50.988 --> 00:03:52.821
It's not the same as success,

00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:55.054
which I see as an event,

00:03:55.054 --> 00:03:56.640
a moment in time,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.938
and a label that the world confers upon you.

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:03.072
Mastery is not a commitment to a goal

00:04:03.072 --> 00:04:05.977
but to a constant pursuit.

00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:07.854
What gets us to do this,

00:04:07.854 --> 00:04:10.400
what get us to forward thrust more

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.057
is to value the near win.

00:04:14.057 --> 00:04:16.209
How many times have we designated something

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.080
a classic, a masterpiece even,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.658
while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished,

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:24.881
riddled with difficulties and flaws,

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.899
in other words, a near win?

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.793
Elizabeth Murray surprised me

00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:33.003
with her admission about her earlier paintings.

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:36.665
Painter Paul Cézanne so often
thought his works were incomplete

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:38.487
that he would deliberately leave them aside

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:41.037
with the intention of picking them back up again,

00:04:41.037 --> 00:04:42.780
but at the end of his life,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.995
the result was that he had only signed

00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:47.735
10 percent of his paintings.

00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:51.885
His favorite novel was "The [Unknown]
Masterpiece" by Honoré de Balzac,

00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:57.481
and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself.

00:04:57.481 --> 00:04:59.415
Franz Kafka saw incompletion

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:02.666
when others would find only works to praise,

00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:05.099
so much so that he wanted all of his diaries,

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.196
manuscripts, letters and even sketches

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:09.525
burned upon his death.

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:12.320
His friend refused to honor the request,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.998
and because of that, we now have all the works

00:05:13.998 --> 00:05:15.767
we now do by Kafka:

00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:19.160
"America," "The Trial" and "The Castle,"

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.785
a work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence.

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:25.320
The pursuit of mastery, in other words,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.958
is an ever-onward almost.

00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.934
"Lord, grant that I desire

00:05:31.934 --> 00:05:34.010
more than I can accomplish,"

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.569
Michelangelo implored,

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.000
as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.949
and he himself was that Adam

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.455
with his finger outstretched

00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:47.028
and not quite touching that God's hand.

00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:51.616
Mastery is in the reaching, not the arriving.

00:05:51.616 --> 00:05:54.921
It's in constantly wanting to close that gap

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:59.119
between where you are and where you want to be.

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:02.707
Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft

00:06:02.707 --> 00:06:06.925
and not for the sake of crafting your career.

00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:09.590
How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.359
live out this phenomenon?

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:13.864
We see it even in the life

00:06:13.864 --> 00:06:16.674
of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders,

00:06:16.674 --> 00:06:18.348
who tells me that his triumphs

00:06:18.348 --> 00:06:20.271
are not merely the result

00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:22.066
of a grand achievement,

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:27.060
but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.796
We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge.

00:06:30.796 --> 00:06:33.491
It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington,

00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:36.417
who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:38.552
was always the next one,

00:06:38.552 --> 00:06:42.211
always the one he had yet to compose.

00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:44.340
Part of the reason that the near win

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.632
is inbuilt to mastery

00:06:46.632 --> 00:06:48.985
is because the greater our proficiency,

00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:51.145
the more clearly we might see

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:54.363
that we don't know all that we thought we did.

00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:56.994
It's called the Dunning–Kruger effect.

00:06:56.994 --> 00:06:59.921
The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin

00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:00.949
when they asked him,

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.646
"What do you think increases with knowledge?"

00:07:03.646 --> 00:07:08.328
and he said, "You learn how little you know."

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:10.652
Success motivates us, but a near win

00:07:10.652 --> 00:07:13.527
can propel us in an ongoing quest.

00:07:13.527 --> 00:07:15.646
One of the most vivid examples of this comes

00:07:15.646 --> 00:07:17.436
when we look at the difference

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:19.382
between Olympic silver medalists

00:07:19.382 --> 00:07:22.333
and bronze medalists after a competition.

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:24.946
Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell

00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:27.092
studied this difference and found

00:07:27.092 --> 00:07:29.616
that the frustration silver medalists feel

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.577
compared to bronze, who are typically a bit

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:34.050
more happy to have just not received fourth place

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.729
and not medaled at all,

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:37.684
gives silver medalists a focus

00:07:37.684 --> 00:07:40.107
on follow-up competition.

00:07:40.107 --> 00:07:42.389
We see it even in the gambling industry

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.375
that once picked up on this phenomenon

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:45.867
of the near win

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:48.130
and created these scratch-off tickets

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.458
that had a higher than average rate of near wins

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:54.267
and so compelled people to buy more tickets

00:07:54.267 --> 00:07:56.216
that they were called heart-stoppers,

00:07:56.216 --> 00:07:59.279
and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.670
in Britain in the 1970s.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.919
The reason the near win has a propulsion

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:07.803
is because it changes our view of the landscape

00:08:07.803 --> 00:08:10.454
and puts our goals, which we tend to put

00:08:10.454 --> 00:08:13.059
at a distance, into more proximate vicinity

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:14.905
to where we stand.

00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:18.083
If I ask you to envision what a
great day looks like next week,

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:21.788
you might describe it in more general terms.

00:08:21.788 --> 00:08:25.439
But if I ask you to describe a
great day at TED tomorrow,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:28.900
you might describe it with granular, practical clarity.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.563
And this is what a near win does.

00:08:30.563 --> 00:08:33.109
It gets us to focus on what, right now,

00:08:33.109 --> 00:08:37.890
we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.046
It's Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who in 1984

00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:43.052
missed taking the gold in the heptathlon

00:08:43.052 --> 00:08:45.313
by one third of a second,

00:08:45.313 --> 00:08:47.194
and her husband predicted that would give her

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:51.156
the tenacity she needed in follow-up competition.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:54.528
In 1988, she won the gold in the heptathlon

00:08:54.528 --> 00:08:58.703
and set a record of 7,291 points,

00:08:58.703 --> 00:09:03.810
a score that no athlete has come very close to since.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.521
We thrive not when we've done it all,

00:09:06.521 --> 00:09:09.928
but when we still have more to do.

00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:12.010
I stand here thinking and wondering

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.708
about all the different ways

00:09:13.708 --> 00:09:16.105
that we might even manufacture a near win

00:09:16.105 --> 00:09:17.370
in this room,

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.439
how your lives might play this out,

00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:24.230
because I think on some gut level we do know this.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.982
We know that we thrive when we stay

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.499
at our own leading edge,

00:09:27.499 --> 00:09:29.965
and it's why the deliberate incomplete

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:32.458
is inbuilt into creation myths.

00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:34.980
In Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.423
would deliberately put an imperfection

00:09:37.423 --> 00:09:39.070
in textiles and ceramics.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.861
It's what's called a spirit line,

00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:43.970
a deliberate flaw in the pattern

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.998
to give the weaver or maker a way out,

00:09:46.998 --> 00:09:51.670
but also a reason to continue making work.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.447
Masters are not experts because they take

00:09:53.447 --> 00:09:56.065
a subject to its conceptual end.

00:09:56.065 --> 00:09:57.774
They're masters because they realize

00:09:57.774 --> 00:10:00.352
that there isn't one.

00:10:00.352 --> 00:10:03.462
Now it occurred to me, as I thought about this,

00:10:03.462 --> 00:10:05.250
why the archery coach

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.420
told me at the end of that practice,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.665
out of earshot of his archers,

00:10:09.665 --> 00:10:11.642
that he and his colleagues never feel

00:10:11.642 --> 00:10:13.902
they can do enough for their team,

00:10:13.902 --> 00:10:16.779
never feel there are enough visualization techniques

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:19.566
and posture drills to help them overcome

00:10:19.566 --> 00:10:21.846
those constant near wins.

00:10:21.846 --> 00:10:24.293
It didn't sound like a complaint, exactly,

00:10:24.293 --> 00:10:26.886
but just a way to let me know,

00:10:26.886 --> 00:10:28.366
a kind of tender admission,

00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:31.631
to remind me that he knew
he was giving himself over

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.786
to a voracious, unfinished path

00:10:34.786 --> 00:10:37.711
that always required more.

00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:40.860
We build out of the unfinished idea,

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.316
even if that idea is our former self.

00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:48.331
This is the dynamic of mastery.

00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:51.364
Coming close to what you thought you wanted

00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:54.090
can help you attain more than you ever dreamed

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.701
you could.

00:10:55.701 --> 00:10:58.575
It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:00.590
was thinking when I saw her smiling

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.851
at those early paintings one day

00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:05.922
in the galleries.

00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:08.288
Even if we created utopias, I believe

00:11:08.288 --> 00:11:11.590
we would still have the incomplete.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.754
Completion is a goal,

00:11:13.754 --> 00:11:17.747
but we hope it is never the end.

00:11:17.747 --> 00:11:20.528
Thank you.

00:11:20.528 --> 00:11:24.384
(Applause)
