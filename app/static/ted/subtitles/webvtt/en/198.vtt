00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
with a mathematician named Georg Cantor.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So he starts out with one line, and then two,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then four, and then 16, and so on.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
he ends up with an infinite number of lines,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
each of which has an infinite number of points in it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium. (Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And when he came out of the sanitarium,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
He was a very religious man.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He was a mathematician on a mission.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A Swedish mathematician, von Koch,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
decided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And so he came up with this beautiful curve.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we can use any seed shape we like.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere -- down there, OK --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So these all have the property of self-similarity:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the part looks like the whole.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's the same pattern at many different scales.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now, mathematicians thought this was very strange

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
because as you shrink a ruler down, you measure a longer and longer length.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
as the ruler shrinks down to infinity, the length goes to infinity.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This made no sense at all,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
They said these are pathological curves, and we don't have to discuss them.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
(Laughter)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And that worked for a hundred years.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you get the shapes of nature.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
you get these beautiful natural forms.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
go ahead and do that now --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
-- and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Your body is covered with fractals.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
They were breathing those words with fractal lungs.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Again, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So nature has this self-similar structure.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Nature uses self-organizing systems.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And I thought, "This is fabulous! I wonder why?"

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
asking people why they were building fractals,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which is a great job if you can get it.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
(Laughter)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
just to see how it would sort of unfold --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and my French is not very good; I said something like,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
"I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But he was really cool about it, and he took me up there,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and we talked about fractals.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And he said, "Oh yeah, yeah! We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we know all about that."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This is a village in southern Zambia.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You have a huge ring.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and then the chief's immediate family in that ring.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So here's a little fractal model for it.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Here's one house with the sacred altar,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
here's the house of houses, the family enclosure,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
with the humans here where the sacred altar would be,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and then here's the village as a whole --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and here there's a tiny village only this big.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now you might wonder, how can people fit in a tiny village only this big?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So it's just like Georg Cantor said, the recursion continues forever.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This is in the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and I thought, "Wow! What a beautiful fractal!"

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I came up with this structure here.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Let's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Now, after I did the simulation,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and here's that replicating line -- a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Well, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So, when I got to the village,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I said, "Can you take me to the square building?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I think something's going on there."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
because that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So here's a Nankani village in Mali.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And you can see, you go inside the family enclosure --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and they're stacked recursively.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Now, the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And when she dies, they have a ceremony

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Once again, infinity is important.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Now, you might ask yourself three questions at this point.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And that was actually my original hypothesis.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
When I first saw those African fractals,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I thought, "Wow, so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that sort of hierarchy, must have a kind of bottom-up architecture."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But that turns out not to be true.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture;

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
only the African ones were fractal.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You can see on the pottery and the baskets.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Here's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
you can see it's circular at the largest scale, but it's rectangular at the smaller scale, right?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It is not the same pattern at two different scales.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Second, you might ask,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
"Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?"

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And three times, the answer is no.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
First of all, I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book, "The Invention of Africa,"

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and then oppositional movements.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
No, because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and it definitely is not "in the DNA."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And finally, the fractals have self-similarity --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
so they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
you see very different uses for fractals.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It's a shared technology in Africa.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And finally, well, isn't this just intuition?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's not really mathematical knowledge.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry, right?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
It wasn't invented until the 1970s.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Well, it's true that some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So some of these things, I'd wander around the streets of Dakar

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
asking people, "What's the algorithm? What's the rule for making this?"

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and they'd say,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
"Well, we just make it that way because it looks pretty, stupid." (Laughter)

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But sometimes, that's not the case.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
In some cases, there would actually be algorithms, and very sophisticated algorithms.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
In Ethiopian crosses, you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
In Angola, the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph;

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
we now call it an Eulerian path --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you can never lift your stylus from the surface

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and you can never go over the same line twice.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
But they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
so the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
then the next age-grade initiation, you learn this one.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And with each iteration of that algorithm,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
you learn the iterations of the myth.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
You learn the next level of knowledge.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it;

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
it's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Well, you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and would use them strategically.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So this is very conscious knowledge.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Here's a wonderful fractal.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Anywhere you go in the Sahel, you'll see this windscreen.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian, all strictly linear.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
"How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is."

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And his answer was very interesting.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
He said, "Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
because they're very quick and they're very cheap.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It doesn't take much time, doesn't take much straw."

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
He said, "but wind and dust goes through pretty easily.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Now, the tight rows up at the very top, they really hold out the wind and dust.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight."

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
"Now," he said, "we know from experience

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that the farther up from the ground you go, the stronger the wind blows."

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Right? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And I measured out the lengths of straw,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
put it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
in the wind engineering handbook.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and this was Bamana sand divination.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And the same divination system is found all over Africa.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and often the symbols are very well preserved,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word --

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And they did this very rapidly,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and I couldn't understand where they were getting --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
they only did the randomness four times --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And they wouldn't tell me.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
They said, "No, no, I can't tell you about this."

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And I said, "Well look, I'll pay you, you can be my teacher,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and I'll come each day and pay you."

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
They said, "It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter."

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And finally, out of desperation, I said,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
"Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877."

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And I started explaining why I was there in Africa,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And one of them said, "Come here. I think I can help you out here."

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And of course, I was only interested in the math,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
"You know, I didn't learn it this way."

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
When you have a four-bit symbol, you then put it together with another one sideways.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So even plus odd gives you odd.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Odd plus even gives you odd.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
It's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And then you take this symbol, and you put it back in

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Now, because it's a binary code,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
you can actually implement this in hardware --

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
In the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy:

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
divination through the earth.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Leibniz, the German mathematician,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
talked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria."

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And he said, "Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
let's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two."

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Right? Ones and zeros, the binary code.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So all these little PDAs and laptops --

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
but you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And you can go to our website,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
the applets are all free; they just run in the browser.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Anybody in the world can use them.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
so hopefully in three years, anybody'll be able to go on the Web

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and create their own simulations and their own artifacts.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
in comparison with a control group that did not have the software.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
that it's not just about singing and dancing.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We've started a pilot program in Ghana.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this;

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
we're very excited about the future possibilities for that.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We've also been working in design.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I didn't put his name up here -- my colleague, Kerry, in Kenya, has come up with this great idea

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
it doesn't quite fit.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:27.000
David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
in which he's used some of these fractal structures.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
as we heard earlier, it's in the brain.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Actually, the reason that Google was such a success

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
It's in ecological sustainability.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
It's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the ethical power of democracy.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
It's also in some bad things.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Self-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And if you don't think that capitalism, which is self-organizing, can have destructive effects,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
you haven't opened your eyes enough.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So we need to think about, as was spoken earlier,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
the traditional African methods for doing self-organization.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
These are robust algorithms.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
These are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that are gentle, that are egalitarian.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Thank you.
