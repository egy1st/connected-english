00:00:01.202 --> 00:00:02.711
Scientific breakthrough,

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.324
the kind that can potentially save lives,

00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:07.388
can sometimes be lying right out in the open

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:08.950
for us to discover,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.156
in the evolved, accumulated body

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.748
of human anecdote, for example,

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.774
or in the time-tested adaptations

00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:19.236
that we observe in the natural world around us.

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:21.856
Science starts with observation,

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:25.252
but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures

00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:27.197
that we might otherwise dismiss

00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:29.064
as myth or coincidence,

00:00:29.064 --> 00:00:32.917
isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.

00:00:32.917 --> 00:00:36.975
And when we do, the results will often surprise.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:38.855
Western Australia has had a particular problem

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:42.070
with shark attacks over the last three years,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.251
unfortunately and tragically culminating

00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.331
in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.091
during that time.

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:51.220
But Western Australia is not alone in this.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.125
The incident of shark engagements on humans

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.469
is escalating worldwide.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.213
And so it's not surprising, perhaps,

00:00:58.213 --> 00:00:59.856
that in July of this year,

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:02.335
Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:05.399
with the University of Western
Australia Oceans Institute

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.173
made an announcement which captured the attention

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:10.409
of the worldwide media and of ocean users

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200
worldwide,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.931
and that was around the development of technology

00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:16.572
to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:19.720
based on the science of what sharks can see.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.309
And I have for you today

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:23.176
the story of that journey,

00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:25.516
but also the notion that science can be

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:27.981
as powerful as a translator

00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:31.340
as it can be for invention.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.046
When we began this process,

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:36.228
we were looking, it was about three years ago,

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:39.650
and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.421
in Western Australia,

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.628
and by chance, in a previous role,

00:01:43.628 --> 00:01:46.551
I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.

00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:50.258
Now Harry Butler, who most Australians
would know is a famous naturalist,

00:01:50.258 --> 00:01:52.593
had spent a lot of time in the marine environment.

00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:54.699
Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like,

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:56.610
to the late Steve Irwin.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.921
When I asked him about

00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.219
what the solution to the problem might be,

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.731
the answer was quite surprising.

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:04.606
He said, "Take a black wetsuit,

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:07.371
band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:09.659
and you'll be mimicking the warning systems

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.968
of most marine species."

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:13.866
I didn't think about that much at the time,

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:17.456
and it wasn't until the next three
fatal shark attacks happened,

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:18.890
and it caused me to think,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.021
maybe there's some merit to this idea.

00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.486
And I turned to the web

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:24.741
to see if there might be some clues.

00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:27.018
And it turns out the web is awash

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:29.414
with this sort of evidence that supports

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:30.976
this sort of thinking.

00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:32.960
So biologically, there are plenty of species

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.556
that display banding or patterns, warning patterns,

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.258
to either be cryptical in the water

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:39.842
or warn against being attacked,

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:41.955
not the least of which is the pilot fish

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:44.111
which spends a big slab of its life

00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:46.390
around the business end of a shark.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.481
On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:52.343
has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,

00:02:52.343 --> 00:02:53.965
and anthropologically,

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.595
Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands

00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:59.376
in a sea snake ceremony

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.970
to ward off the shark god.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.412
So what's going on here?

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:06.290
Is this an idea lying wide out in the open

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.421
for us to consider and define?

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:13.790
We know that sharks use a range of sensors

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.162
when they engage, particularly for attack,

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:19.122
but the sight sensor is the one that they use

00:03:19.122 --> 00:03:20.686
to identify the target, and particularly

00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:24.420
in the last number of meters before the attack.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.378
It makes sense to pay attention
to the biological anecdote

00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:29.230
because that's time-tested evolution

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.703
over many millennia.

00:03:31.703 --> 00:03:35.180
But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.911
the idea that there's a kernel of truth

00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.503
thought to be important,

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:41.788
passed down from generation to generation,

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.103
so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior?

00:03:45.103 --> 00:03:46.763
I wanted to test this idea.

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:47.981
I wanted to put some science

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.317
to this anecdotal evidence,

00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:52.273
because if science could support this concept,

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.368
then we might have at least part of the solution

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.426
to shark attack right under our very nose.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:03:59.221
To do that, I needed some experts

00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:01.074
in shark vision and shark neurology,

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.883
and a worldwide search, again,

00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:04.322
led to the University of W.A.

00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:06.725
on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:09.322
And professor Nathan Hart and his team

00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:11.982
had just written a paper which tells us,

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.334
confirms that predatory sharks see

00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:17.197
in black and white, or grayscale.

00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:19.000
So I called up Nathan,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.866
a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:22.747
that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes

00:04:22.747 --> 00:04:26.253
to produce a wetsuit to try and
mitigate the risk of shark attack,

00:04:26.253 --> 00:04:28.425
and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.

00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:30.887
So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:33.511
supported by the West Australian State Government.

00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.070
And we did three key things.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.790
The first is that we mapped the characteristics,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.810
the physical characteristics of the eyes

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.748
of the three main predatory sharks,

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:46.466
so the great white, tiger and bull shark.

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:48.020
We did that genetically

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.920
and we did that anatomically.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.762
The next thing we did was to understand,

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:54.197
using complex computer modeling,

00:04:54.197 --> 00:04:56.251
what that eye can see

00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:58.020
at different depths, distances,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.261
light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:03.451
And from there, we were able to pinpoint

00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:05.251
two key characteristics:

00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:08.284
what patterns and shapes would present the wearer

00:05:08.284 --> 00:05:11.516
as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:13.012
and what patterns and shapes might provide

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.933
the greatest contrast but provide the greatest

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:17.390
breakup of profile

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.034
so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:23.387
or shark food.

00:05:23.387 --> 00:05:25.579
The next thing we needed to do was to convert this

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.328
into wetsuits that people might actually wear,

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.950
and to that end, I invited Ray Smith,

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.180
a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.542
and in fact the guy that designed
the original Quiksilver logo,

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:38.827
to come over and sit with the science team

00:05:38.827 --> 00:05:42.423
and interpret that science

00:05:42.423 --> 00:05:45.565
into aesthetic wetsuits that
people might actually wear.

00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:48.021
And here's an example of one of the first drawings.

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:51.025
So this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit.

00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:55.294
So this takes that banding idea,

00:05:55.294 --> 00:05:57.880
takes that banding idea, it's highly visible,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.885
provides a highly disruptive profile,

00:05:59.885 --> 00:06:01.712
and is intended to prevent the shark

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:04.380
from considering that you would be ordinary food,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.726
and potentially even create confusion for the shark.

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:11.501
And this one's configured to go with a surfboard.

00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:14.114
You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:16.841
and it's particularly better for the surface,

00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:19.689
where being backlit and providing a silhouette

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:21.301
is problematic.

00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:24.209
Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:25.820
or the one which attempts to hide the wearer

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.310
in the water column.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.000
There are three panels on this suit,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.624
and in any given conditions,

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:31.979
one or more of those panels

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.569
will match the reflective spectra of the water

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.168
so as to disappear fully or partially,

00:06:37.168 --> 00:06:39.360
leaving the last panel or panels

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.247
to create a disruptive profile in the water column.

00:06:42.247 --> 00:06:44.412
And this one's particularly well-suited

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:46.859
to the dive configuration,

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:49.927
so when you're deeper under the water.

00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:51.637
So we knew that we had

00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:53.407
some really solid science here.

00:06:53.407 --> 00:06:55.033
We knew, if you wanted to stand out,

00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:56.205
you needed to look stripy,

00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:57.629
and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.181
you needed to look like this.

00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.007
But the acid test is always going to be,

00:07:01.007 --> 00:07:02.339
how would sharks really behave

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.070
in the context of these patterns and shapes.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.381
And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit

00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:09.929
in the water with a predatory shark

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.295
in a natural environment

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:13.247
is actually a lot harder than you might think.

00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:16.598
(Laughter)

00:07:16.598 --> 00:07:19.164
So we have to bait the rig,

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:20.708
because we need to get the statistical number

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:23.732
of samples through to get the scientific evidence,

00:07:23.732 --> 00:07:24.521
and by baiting the rig,

00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:26.750
we're obviously changing shark behavior.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.567
We can't put humans in the water.

00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:31.453
We're ethically precluded from even using

00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:34.100
humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.372
But nevertheless, we started the testing process

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.220
in January of this year,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.356
initially with tiger sharks

00:07:39.356 --> 00:07:42.695
and subsequently with great white sharks.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.130
The way we did that

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.885
was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.781
wrap it in a neoprene skin,

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.344
and then run two stereo underwater cameras

00:07:53.344 --> 00:07:56.693
to watch how the shark
actually engages with that rig.

00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:58.381
And because we use stereo,

00:07:58.381 --> 00:08:01.173
we can capture all the statistics
on how big the shark is,

00:08:01.173 --> 00:08:03.429
what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,

00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:05.285
and what its behavior is

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.491
in an empirical rather than a subjective way.

00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:10.979
Because we needed to
preserve the scientific method,

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:12.677
we ran a control rig

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:16.389
which was a black neoprene rig

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:18.198
just like a normal black wetsuit

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:19.677
against the, what we call,

00:08:19.677 --> 00:08:21.805
SAMS technology rig.

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:24.533
And the results were not just exciting,

00:08:24.533 --> 00:08:25.971
but very encouraging,

00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:28.519
and today I would like to just give you a snapshot

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:32.181
of two of those engagements.

00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:34.301
So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark

00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:37.388
engaging the black control rig,

00:08:37.388 --> 00:08:38.729
which it had encountered about

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:42.689
a minute and a half before.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.210
Now that exact same shark had engaged,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.040
or encountered this SAMS rig,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.652
which is the Elude SAMS rig,

00:09:05.652 --> 00:09:06.831
about eight minutes before,

00:09:06.831 --> 00:09:09.974
and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,

00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:12.779
looking for what it could
smell and sense but not see,

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:15.251
and this was the final engagement.

00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:20.687
Great white sharks are more
confident than the tigers,

00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:22.735
and here you see great white shark

00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:24.142
engaging a control rig,

00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:25.975
so a black neoprene wetsuit,

00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:27.559
and going straight to the bottom,

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:30.110
coming up

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.147
and engaging.

00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:36.940
In contrast to the SAMS technology rig,

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.409
this is the banded one,

00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:40.350
where it's more tactile,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.860
it's more investigative,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.494
it's more apprehensive,

00:09:43.494 --> 00:09:47.499
and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.

00:09:56.297 --> 00:10:03.600
(Applause)

00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:10.877
So, it's important for us that all 
the testing is done independently,

00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:13.195
and the University of W.A. is doing the testing.

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:14.947
It'll be an ongoing process.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.356
It's subject to peer review and subject to publication.

00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:19.699
It's so important that this concept

00:10:19.699 --> 00:10:21.497
is led with the science.

00:10:21.497 --> 00:10:23.741
From the perspective of Shark 
Attack Mitigation Systems,

00:10:23.741 --> 00:10:26.146
we're a biotechnology licensing company,

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.433
so we don't make wetsuits ourselves.

00:10:28.433 --> 00:10:30.713
We'll license others to do that.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:31.672
But I thought you might be interested

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:33.673
in seeing what SAMS technology looks like

00:10:33.673 --> 00:10:36.672
embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end,

00:10:36.672 --> 00:10:39.888
for the first time, live, worldwide --

00:10:39.888 --> 00:10:41.862
(Laughter) —

00:10:41.862 --> 00:10:44.758
I can show you what biological adaptation,

00:10:44.758 --> 00:10:48.285
science and design looks like in real life.

00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:50.182
So I can welcome Sam, the surfer,

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:52.890
from this side. Where are you, Sam?

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.686
(Applause)

00:10:54.686 --> 00:10:56.356
And Eduardo.

00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:58.172
(Applause)

00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:00.866
Cheers, mate.

00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:02.956
Cheers.

00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:07.920
Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause)

00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:10.943
So what have we done here?

00:11:10.943 --> 00:11:13.960
Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.280
and use science as a tool for invention,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.136
we've paid attention to the biological evidence,

00:11:20.136 --> 00:11:21.826
we've put importance to the

00:11:21.826 --> 00:11:23.536
human anecdotal evidence,

00:11:23.536 --> 00:11:26.618
and we've used science as a tool

00:11:26.618 --> 00:11:28.021
for translation,

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.248
translation of something that was already there

00:11:30.248 --> 00:11:33.819
into something that we can 
use for the benefit of mankind.

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:35.743
And it strikes me that this idea of science

00:11:35.743 --> 00:11:38.799
as a tool for translation rather than invention

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.463
is one that we can apply much more widely than this

00:11:41.463 --> 00:11:43.410
in the pursuit of innovation.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.735
After all, did the Wright brothers

00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:47.787
discover manned flight,

00:11:47.787 --> 00:11:50.976
or did they observe the biological fact of flight

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:54.168
and translate that mechanically, replicate it

00:11:54.168 --> 00:11:56.685
in a way that humans could use?

00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.219
As for the humble wetsuit,

00:11:58.219 --> 00:12:00.160
who knows what oceanwear will look like

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.111
in two years' time, in five years' time

00:12:03.111 --> 00:12:06.203
or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking,

00:12:06.203 --> 00:12:07.469
I'm guessing there's a fair chance

00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:09.190
it won't be pure black.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.359
Thank you.

00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:15.270
(Applause)
