00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:03.786
The Earth needs no introduction.

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:08.596
It needs no introduction in part 
because the Apollo 17 astronauts,

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:11.324
when they were hurtling 
around the moon in 1972,

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:15.396
took this iconic image.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:18.875
It galvanized a whole 
generation of human beings

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.553
to realize that we're on 
Spaceship Earth,

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:23.840
fragile and finite as it is,


00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.643
and that we need 
to take care of it.

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:28.624
But while this picture
is beautiful, it's static,

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:31.177
and the Earth is constantly changing.

00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:34.676
It's changing on days' time
scales with human activity.

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:37.975
And the satellite imagery we 
have of it today is old.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:40.470
Typically, years old.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.735
And that's important because
you can't fix what you can't see.

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:49.595
What we'd ideally want is images
of the whole planet every day.

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:51.871
So, what's standing in our way?

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:53.882
What's the problem?

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:55.908
This is the problem:

00:00:55.908 --> 00:01:00.191
Satellites are big, expensive 
and they're slow.

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:02.332
This one weighs three tons.

00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:05.097
It's six meters tall, four meters wide.

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.330
It took up the entire fairing
of a rocket just to launch it.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.180
One satellite, one rocket.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.380
It cost 855 million dollars.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.614
Satellites like these have 
done an amazing job

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:18.730
at helping us to understand our planet.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.356
But if we want to understand 
it much more regularly,

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.402
we need lots of satellites,

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.373
and this model isn't scalable.

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:28.476
So me and my friends, 
we started Planet Labs

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:30.562
to make satellites ultra-compact


00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:32.849
and small and highly capable.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:37.860
I'm going to show you what 
our satellite looks like:

00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:42.900
This is our satellite.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.863
This is not a scale model,


00:01:44.863 --> 00:01:46.371
this is the real size.

00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.757
It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters,

00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:51.046
it weighs four kilograms,

00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:53.583
and we've stuffed the latest 
and greatest electronics

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:55.840
and sensor systems into 
this little package

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.884
so that even though this is really small,

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:02.977
this can take pictures 10 times the
resolution of the big satellite here,

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:07.387
even though it weighs one 
thousandth of the mass.

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:11.140
And we call this satellite 
"Dove" — Thank you.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.435
(Applause)

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:15.480
We call this satellite "Dove,"

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.499
and we call it "Dove" because 
satellites are typically named

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.865
after birds, but normally birds of prey:

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:23.702
like Eagle, Hawk, Swoop, 
Kill, I don't know,

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:25.417
Kestrel, these sort of things.

00:02:25.417 --> 00:02:27.342
But ours have a 
humanitarian mission,

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:29.175
so we wanted to call them Doves.

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.109
And we haven't just 
built them, though.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.450
We've launched them.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.568
And not just one, but many.

00:02:38.586 --> 00:02:40.953
It all started in our garage.

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.767
Yes, we built our first satellite
prototype in our garage.

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.984
Now, this is pretty normal for a
Silicon Valley company that we are,

00:02:46.984 --> 00:02:49.927
but we believe it's the first time 
for a space company.

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:53.395
And that's not the only trick
we learned from Silicon Valley.

00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:56.587
We rapidly prototype our satellites.

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:59.472
We use "release early, 
release often" on our software.

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:01.389
And we take a different 
risk approach.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.392
We take them outside and test them.

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:06.281
We even put satellites in space
just to test the satellites,

00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.144
and we've learned to manufacture
our satellites at scale.

00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:11.210
We've used modern production techniques

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.923
so we can build large numbers of them,

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.120
I think for the first time.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.120
We call it agile aerospace,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.808
and that's what's enabled us to put
so much capability into this little box.

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:29.300
Now, what has bonded 
our team over the years

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.436
is the idea of democratizing
access to satellite information.

00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:37.221
In fact, the founders of our 
company, Chris, Robbie and I,

00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:39.526
we met over 15 years ago 
at the United Nations

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:42.511
when they were hosting a conference 
about exactly that question:

00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:44.180
How do you use satellites 
to help humanity?

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.932
How do you use satellites to help 
people in developing countries

00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:47.939
or with climate change?

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.405
And this is what has bonded us.

00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:54.970
Our entire team is passionate about
using satellites to help humanity.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.747
You could say 
we're space geeks,

00:03:56.747 --> 00:03:59.284
but not only do we care 
about what's up there,

00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:01.376
we care about what's down here, too.

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:03.102
I'm going to show you a video

00:04:03.102 --> 00:04:05.561
from just four weeks ago 
of two of our satellites

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:08.450
being launched from the
International Space Station.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.240
This is not an animation, 


00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.490
this is a video taken by the astronaut 
looking out of the window.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.479
It gives you a bit of a sense of 
scale of our two satellites.

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.796
It's like some of the 
smallest satellites ever

00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:21.290
are being launched from 
the biggest satellite ever.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.872
And right at the end, the
solar array glints in the sun.

00:04:23.872 --> 00:04:26.241
It's really cool. Wait for it.

00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.854
Boom! Yeah. It's the money shot.

00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:31.864
(Laughter)

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:34.875
So we didn't just launch 
two of them like this,

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.601
we launched 28 of them.

00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:40.214
It's the largest constellation of
Earth-imaging satellites in human history,

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:43.463
and it's going to provide a
completely radical new data set

00:04:43.463 --> 00:04:45.467
about our changing planet.

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:47.695
But that's just the beginning.

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:50.777
You see, we're going to launch
more than 100 of these satellites

00:04:50.777 --> 00:04:53.031
like these over the 
course of the next year.

00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:56.680
It's going to be the largest constellation
of satellites in human history.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.337
And this is what it's going to do:

00:04:58.337 --> 00:05:01.896
Acting in a single-orbit plane that 
stays fixed with respect to the sun,

00:05:01.896 --> 00:05:03.569
the Earth rotates underneath.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.864
They're all cameras pointed down,

00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:08.833
and they slowly scan across as 
the Earth rotates underneath.

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.957
The Earth rotates every 24 hours,

00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:13.929
so we scan every point on the 
planet every 24 hours.

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.180
It's a line scanner for the planet.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.634
We don't take a picture of 
anywhere on the planet every day,

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:22.820
we take a picture of every single
place on the planet every day.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.513
Even though we launched these
just a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:28.278
we've already got some initial
imagery from the satellites

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:31.694
and I'm going to show it
publicly for the first time right now.

00:05:31.694 --> 00:05:34.504
This is the very first picture
taken by our satellite.

00:05:34.504 --> 00:05:36.500
It happened to be over 
UC-Davis' campus

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.544
in California when we 
turned the camera on.

00:05:38.544 --> 00:05:40.073
But what's even cooler is when

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:43.200
we compare it to the previous
latest image of that area,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.609
which was taken many months ago.

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:48.174
And the image on the left 
is from our satellite,

00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:50.221
and we see buildings are being built.

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:54.210
The general point is that we will be able
to track urban growth as it happens

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.052
around the whole world
in all cities, every day.

00:05:58.052 --> 00:05:59.579
Water as well.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:01.420
Thank you.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.987
(Applause)

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:05.609
We'll be able to see 
the extent of all water bodies

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:08.820
around the whole world every day
and help water security.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.992
From water security 
to food security.

00:06:10.992 --> 00:06:13.495
We'll see crops as they 
grow in all the fields

00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:16.520
in every farmer's field around
the planet every day.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.423
and help them to improve crop yield.

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:21.562
This is a beautiful image that was taken

00:06:21.562 --> 00:06:25.680
just a few hours ago when the 
satellite was flying over Argentina.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.104
The general point is

00:06:27.104 --> 00:06:30.517
there are probably hundreds and 
thousands of applications of this data,

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:32.469
I've mentioned a few, but there's others:

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:34.193
deforestation, the ice caps melting.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:37.480
We can track all of these things,
every tree on the planet every day.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.598
If you took the difference between
today's image and yesterday's image,

00:06:40.598 --> 00:06:44.674
you'd see much of the world news —
you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.

00:06:44.674 --> 00:06:48.283
And we have decided, therefore, that the 
best thing that we could do with our data

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.275
is to ensure universal access to it.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:53.400
We want to ensure everyone can see it.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.979
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.780
We want to empower NGOs and 
companies and scientists and journalists

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.253
to be able to answer the questions
that they have about the planet.

00:07:04.254 --> 00:07:09.413
We want to enable the developer community
to run their apps on our data.

00:07:09.413 --> 00:07:13.500
In short, we want to democratize access
to information about our planet.

00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:16.311
Which brings me back to this.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:20.874
You see, this will be an entirely
new global data set.

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:22.801
And we believe that together,

00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:27.384
we can help to take care 
of our Spaceship Earth.

00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:30.899
And what I would like to leave
you with is the following question:

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:35.170
If you had access to imagery of the
whole planet every single day,

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.804
what would you do with that data?

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:38.412
What problems would you solve?

00:07:38.412 --> 00:07:40.382
What exploration would you do?

00:07:40.382 --> 00:07:42.474
Well, I invite you to come
and explore with us.

00:07:42.474 --> 00:07:44.080
Thank you very much.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:08:16.180
(Applause)
