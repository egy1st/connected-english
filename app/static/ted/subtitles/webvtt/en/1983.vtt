00:00:00.797 --> 00:00:03.578
So, a few years ago I was at JFK Airport

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:05.370
about to get on a flight,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.186
when I was approached by two women

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:08.848
who I do not think would be insulted

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:10.242
to hear themselves described

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:14.184
as tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads.

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:17.330
The taller one, who is like up here,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.381
she comes marching up to me, and she goes,

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:21.700
"Honey, I gotta ask you something.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.128
You got something to do with that whole

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:26.150
'Eat, Pray, Love' thing that's been going on lately?"

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.264
And I said, "Yes, I did."

00:00:28.264 --> 00:00:30.052
And she smacks her friend and she goes,

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:32.206
"See, I told you, I said, that's that girl.

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:34.156
That's that girl who wrote that book

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:36.190
based on that movie."

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.344
(Laughter)

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:40.520
So that's who I am.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.225
And believe me, I'm extremely
grateful to be that person,

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:46.223
because that whole "Eat, Pray, Love" thing

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:47.967
was a huge break for me.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.475
But it also left me in a really tricky position

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:52.383
moving forward as an author

00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:54.110
trying to figure out how in the world

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.364
I was ever going to write a book again

00:00:55.364 --> 00:00:57.209
that would ever please anybody,

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:59.199
because I knew well in advance

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.151
that all of those people who
had adored "Eat, Pray, Love"

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:03.740
were going to be incredibly disappointed

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.123
in whatever I wrote next

00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:06.951
because it wasn't going to be "Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:09.397
and all of those people who
had hated "Eat, Pray, Love"

00:01:09.397 --> 00:01:10.765
were going to be incredibly disappointed

00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:12.208
in whatever I wrote next

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:14.661
because it would provide evidence that I still lived.

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:17.823
So I knew that I had no way to win,

00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:20.279
and knowing that I had no way to win

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.183
made me seriously consider for a while

00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:23.625
just quitting the game

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:27.267
and moving to the country to raise corgis.

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:29.327
But if I had done that, if I had given up writing,

00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:31.391
I would have lost my beloved vocation,

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.599
so I knew that the task was that I had to find

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.998
some way to gin up the inspiration

00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:37.430
to write the next book

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.926
regardless of its inevitable negative outcome.

00:01:39.926 --> 00:01:41.534
In other words, I had to find a way to make sure

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.177
that my creativity survived its own success.

00:01:44.177 --> 00:01:46.600
And I did, in the end, find that inspiration,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.138
but I found it in the most unlikely

00:01:48.138 --> 00:01:49.552
and unexpected place.

00:01:49.552 --> 00:01:52.692
I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life

00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:55.800
about how creativity can survive its own failure.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.406
So just to back up and explain,

00:01:57.406 --> 00:01:59.719
the only thing I have ever wanted to be

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.316
for my whole life was a writer.

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:03.688
I wrote all through childhood,
all through adolescence,

00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:05.504
by the time I was a teenager I was sending

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:07.340
my very bad stories to The New Yorker,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.616
hoping to be discovered.

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:11.060
After college, I got a job as a diner waitress,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.196
kept working, kept writing,

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.444
kept trying really hard to get published,

00:02:15.444 --> 00:02:17.156
and failing at it.

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:18.628
I failed at getting published

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:20.204
for almost six years.

00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:21.812
So for almost six years, every single day,

00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:23.468
I had nothing but rejection letters

00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:25.120
waiting for me in my mailbox.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.870
And it was devastating every single time,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.114
and every single time, I had to ask myself

00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:31.500
if I should just quit while I was behind

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.190
and give up and spare myself this pain.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.484
But then I would find my resolve,

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:38.006
and always in the same way,

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.151
by saying, "I'm not going to quit,

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:41.972
I'm going home."

00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:42.920
And you have to understand that for me,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.492
going home did not mean
returning to my family's farm.

00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:48.050
For me, going home

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.601
meant returning to the work of writing

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:51.486
because writing was my home,

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:54.702
because I loved writing more
than I hated failing at writing,

00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:56.207
which is to say that I loved writing

00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:57.780
more than I loved my own ego,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.184
which is ultimately to say

00:02:59.184 --> 00:03:01.776
that I loved writing more than I loved myself.

00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:03.742
And that's how I pushed through it.

00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:05.606
But the weird thing is that 20 years later,

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:07.104
during the crazy ride of "Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:09.710
I found myself identifying all over again

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.110
with that unpublished young diner waitress

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.278
who I used to be, thinking about her constantly,

00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:16.136
and feeling like I was her again,

00:03:16.136 --> 00:03:17.901
which made no rational sense whatsoever

00:03:17.901 --> 00:03:19.878
because our lives could not
have been more different.

00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:21.326
She had failed constantly.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.970
I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.320
We had nothing in common.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.486
Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again?

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:30.856
And it was only when I was trying to unthread that

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:32.458
that I finally began to comprehend

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:34.862
the strange and unlikely psychological connection

00:03:34.862 --> 00:03:37.396
in our lives between the way
we experience great failure

00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:39.632
and the way we experience great success.

00:03:39.632 --> 00:03:41.102
So think of it like this:

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:42.852
For most of your life, you live out your existence

00:03:42.852 --> 00:03:45.295
here in the middle of the chain of human experience

00:03:45.295 --> 00:03:48.373
where everything is normal
and reassuring and regular,

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:51.833
but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:54.767
into the blinding darkness of disappointment.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:58.321
Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.689
way out over here

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.551
into the equally blinding glare

00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:04.403
of fame and recognition and praise.

00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:05.605
And one of these fates

00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:07.822
is objectively seen by the world as bad,

00:04:07.822 --> 00:04:09.879
and the other one is objectively
seen by the world as good,

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.527
but your subconscious is completely incapable

00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:15.255
of discerning the difference between bad and good.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.396
The only thing that it is capable of feeling

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:20.856
is the absolute value of this emotional equation,

00:04:20.856 --> 00:04:23.471
the exact distance that you have been flung

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:24.839
from yourself.

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:26.895
And there's a real equal danger in both cases

00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:28.441
of getting lost out there

00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:30.465
in the hinterlands of the psyche.

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:31.998
But in both cases, it turns out that there is

00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:34.822
also the same remedy for self-restoration,

00:04:34.822 --> 00:04:38.420
and that is that you have got to
find your way back home again

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.687
as swiftly and smoothly as you can,

00:04:40.687 --> 00:04:42.159
and if you're wondering what your home is,

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.245
here's a hint:

00:04:43.245 --> 00:04:45.471
Your home is whatever in this world you love

00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:47.385
more than you love yourself.

00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:49.471
So that might be creativity, it might be family,

00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:51.447
it might be invention, adventure,

00:04:51.447 --> 00:04:54.239
faith, service, it might be raising corgis,

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:56.139
I don't know, your home is that thing

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.911
to which you can dedicate your energies

00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:59.957
with such singular devotion

00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:03.359
that the ultimate results become inconsequential.

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:05.863
For me, that home has always been writing.

00:05:05.863 --> 00:05:08.435
So after the weird, disorienting success

00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:10.133
that I went through with "Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:11.547
I realized that all I had to do was exactly

00:05:11.547 --> 00:05:13.531
the same thing that I used to have to do all the time

00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:15.761
when I was an equally disoriented failure.

00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.539
I had to get my ass back to work,

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.047
and that's what I did, and that's how, in 2010,

00:05:20.047 --> 00:05:22.401
I was able to publish the dreaded follow-up

00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:23.289
to "Eat, Pray, Love."

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.865
And you know what happened with that book?

00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:27.576
It bombed, and I was fine.

00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:29.425
Actually, I kind of felt bulletproof,

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:31.545
because I knew that I had broken the spell

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:33.190
and I had found my way back home

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.801
to writing for the sheer devotion of it.

00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:37.937
And I stayed in my home of writing after that,

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.769
and I wrote another book that just came out last year

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:41.414
and that one was really beautifully received,

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:42.910
which is very nice, but not my point.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.200
My point is that I'm writing another one now,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.387
and I'll write another book after that

00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:48.217
and another and another and another

00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:49.415
and many of them will fail,

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.043
and some of them might succeed,

00:05:51.043 --> 00:05:52.639
but I will always be safe

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.011
from the random hurricanes of outcome

00:05:55.011 --> 00:05:58.561
as long as I never forget where I rightfully live.

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:00.963
Look, I don't know where you rightfully live,

00:06:00.963 --> 00:06:02.633
but I know that there's something in this world

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:04.705
that you love more than you love yourself.

00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:06.120
Something worthy, by the way,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.111
so addiction and infatuation don't count,

00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:12.218
because we all know that those
are not safe places to live. Right?

00:06:12.218 --> 00:06:14.265
The only trick is that you've got to identify

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:16.729
the best, worthiest thing that you love most,

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.100
and then build your house right on top of it

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.977
and don't budge from it.

00:06:20.977 --> 00:06:23.321
And if you should someday, somehow

00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:25.265
get vaulted out of your home

00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:27.705
by either great failure or great success,

00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:29.870
then your job is to fight your
way back to that home

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.655
the only way that it has ever been done,

00:06:31.655 --> 00:06:33.844
by putting your head down and performing

00:06:33.844 --> 00:06:35.666
with diligence and devotion

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:37.352
and respect and reverence

00:06:37.352 --> 00:06:39.396
whatever the task is that love

00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:41.476
is calling forth from you next.

00:06:41.476 --> 00:06:43.660
You just do that, and keep doing that

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.309
again and again and again,

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.965
and I can absolutely promise you,
from long personal experience

00:06:47.965 --> 00:06:50.220
in every direction, I can assure you

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.290
that it's all going to be okay.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.981
Thank you.

00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:57.981
(Applause)
