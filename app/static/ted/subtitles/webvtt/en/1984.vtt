00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:03.388
A computer is an incredibly powerful means

00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:05.042
of creative expression,

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:06.613
but for the most part,

00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:08.778
that expression is confined to the screens

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:11.196
of our laptops and mobile phones.

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:13.396
And I'd like to tell you a story about

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.352
bringing this power of the computer

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:17.722
to move things around and interact with us

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.635
off of the screen and into the physical world

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:21.824
in which we live.

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:23.442
A few years ago, I got a call from

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.928
a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York,

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:27.192
and the next thing I knew,

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:29.885
I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:31.277
for their window displays.

00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:32.672
This one's called "The Chase."

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:34.018
There are two pairs of shoes,

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:35.643
a man's pair and a woman's pair,

00:00:35.643 --> 00:00:38.547
and they play out this slow, tense chase

00:00:38.547 --> 00:00:39.825
around the window

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:42.050
in which the man scoots up behind the woman

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.623
and gets in her personal space,

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:45.558
and then she moves away.

00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:47.399
Each of the shoes has magnets in it,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.402
and there are magnets underneath the table

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:51.366
that move the shoes around.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.398
My friend Andy Cavatorta was building

00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:56.940
a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.332
and I wound up building the electronics

00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:01.521
and motion control software

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.987
to make the harps move and play music.

00:01:03.987 --> 00:01:05.998
The harp has four separate pendulums,

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:08.124
and each pendulum has 11 strings,

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.612
so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.815
in order to play different musical notes,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:14.977
and the harps are all networked together

00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:16.777
so that they can play the right notes

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:19.403
at the right time in the music.

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:21.827
I built an interactive chemistry exhibit

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:24.426
at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago,

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:27.407
and this exhibit lets people use physical objects

00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:30.443
to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table

00:01:30.443 --> 00:01:31.851
and bring them together to cause

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:33.617
chemical reactions to happen.

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:35.541
And the museum noticed that people

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:37.767
were spending a lot of time with this exhibit,

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:40.914
and a researcher from a science education center

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:43.719
in Australia decided to study this exhibit

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.959
and try to figure out what was going on.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.252
And she found that the physical objects

00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:49.916
that people were using were helping people

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:51.930
understand how to use the exhibit,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.873
and were helping people learn in a social way.

00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:57.139
And when you think about
it, this makes a lot of sense,

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.379
that using specialized physical objects

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.651
would help people use an interface more easily.

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:05.490
I mean, our hands and our minds are optimized

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.759
to think about and interact with tangible objects.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.821
Think about which you find easier to use,

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:13.140
a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.240
like on a phone?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.265
But the thing that struck me

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:18.264
about all of these different projects

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:21.381
is that they really had to be built from scratch,

00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:23.171
down to the level of the electronics

00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:24.277
and the printed circuit boards and

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:27.022
all the mechanisms all the way up to the software.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.784
I wanted to create something

00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:32.103
where we could move objects
under computer control

00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:34.352
and create interactions around that idea

00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:36.567
without having to go through this process

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:37.950
of building something from scratch

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.325
every single time.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.316
So my first attempt at this

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:43.000
was at the MIT Media Lab

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.581
with Professor Hiroshi Ishii,

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.416
and we built this array of

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.673
512 different electromagnets,

00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:51.300
and together they were able to move objects around

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.836
on top of their surface.

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.384
But the problem with this

00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:56.040
was that these magnets

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.200
cost over 10,000 dollars.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.866
Although each one was pretty small,

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.575
altogether they weighed so much

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:02.830
that the table that they were on

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.388
started to sag.

00:03:04.388 --> 00:03:05.720
So I wanted to build something

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.336
where you could have this kind of interaction

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.979
on any tabletop surface.

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.060
So to explore this idea,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.210
I built an army of small robots,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.975
and each of these robots has
what are called omni wheels.

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.280
They're these special wheels

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.946
that can move equally easily in all directions,

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:23.535
and when you couple these robots

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:25.445
with a video projector,

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:27.253
you have these physical tools

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:30.153
for interacting with digital information.

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:31.995
So here's an example of what I mean.

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:33.917
This is a video editing application

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:35.403
where all of the controls

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:37.710
for manipulating the video are physical.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.292
So if we want to tweak the color,

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:40.644
we just enter the color mode,

00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:41.940
and then we get three different dials

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.318
for tweaking the color,

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:45.279
or if we want to adjust the audio,

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.620
then we get two different dials
for that, these physical objects.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.466
So here the left and right channel stay in sync,

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:53.209
but if we want to, we can override that

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.208
by grabbing both of them at the same time.

00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:58.136
So the idea is that we get the speed

00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:01.253
and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials

00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:04.043
together with the flexibility and versatility

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.374
of a system that's designed in software.

00:04:07.374 --> 00:04:09.309
And this is a mapping application

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.436
for disaster response.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:13.381
So you have these physical objects

00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:15.608
that represent police, fire and rescue,

00:04:15.608 --> 00:04:17.161
and a dispatcher can grab them

00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:18.487
and place them on the map

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:20.476
to tell those units where to go,

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.852
and then the position of the units on the map

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:24.821
gets synced up with the position

00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.448
of those units in the real world.

00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:30.060
This is a video chat application.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.412
It's amazing how much emotion you can convey

00:04:32.412 --> 00:04:33.625
with just a few simple movements

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.050
of a physical object.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.102
With this interface, we open up
a huge array of possibilities

00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:41.180
in between traditional board games

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.594
and arcade games,

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:45.141
where the physical possibilities of interaction

00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:48.854
make so many different styles of play possible.

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:51.243
But one of the areas that I'm most excited

00:04:51.243 --> 00:04:53.057
about using this platform for

00:04:53.057 --> 00:04:55.600
is applying it to problems that are difficult

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.854
for computers or people to solve alone.

00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:00.476
One example of those is protein folding.

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:01.888
So here we have an interface

00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:05.402
where we have physical handles onto a protein,

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:07.153
and we can grab those handles

00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:10.140
and try to move the protein and
try to fold it in different ways.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.140
And if we move it in a way that
doesn't really make sense

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.107
with the underlying molecular simulation,

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:17.309
we get this physical feedback where we can

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.282
actually feel these physical handles

00:05:19.282 --> 00:05:20.890
pulling back against us.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.421
So feeling what's going on

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.660
inside a molecular simulation

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.606
is a whole different level of interaction.

00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:30.587
So we're just beginning to explore

00:05:30.587 --> 00:05:33.098
what's possible when we use software

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.589
to control the movement

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.832
of objects in our environment.

00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:39.736
Maybe this is the computer of the future.

00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:41.352
There's no touchscreen.

00:05:41.352 --> 00:05:43.383
There's no technology visible at all.

00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:45.227
But when we want to have a video chat

00:05:45.227 --> 00:05:46.688
or play a game

00:05:46.688 --> 00:05:49.401
or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk,

00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:51.674
the objects on the table come alive.

00:05:51.674 --> 00:05:53.026
Thank you.

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:55.149
(Applause)
