00:00:00.722 --> 00:00:02.231
"Why?"

00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:03.689
"Why?" is a question

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.325
that parents ask me all the time.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:09.172
"Why did my child develop autism?"

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:13.626
As a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher,

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:16.069
we try and address that question.

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:18.018
But autism is not a single condition.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.733
It's actually a spectrum of disorders,

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.267
a spectrum that ranges, for instance,

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:25.940
from Justin, a 13-year-old boy

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.163
who's not verbal, who can't speak,

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:31.125
who communicates by using an iPad

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.023
to touch pictures to communicate

00:00:33.023 --> 00:00:35.174
his thoughts and his concerns,

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:37.585
a little boy who, when he gets upset,

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:39.233
will start rocking,

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.830
and eventually, when he's disturbed enough,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.433
will bang his head to the point

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:46.275
that he can actually cut it open and require stitches.

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:48.890
That same diagnosis of autism, though,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.812
also applies to Gabriel,

00:00:50.812 --> 00:00:52.779
another 13-year-old boy

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:55.474
who has quite a different set of challenges.

00:00:55.474 --> 00:00:58.588
He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics.

00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:00.609
He can multiple three numbers by three numbers

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.396
in his head with ease,

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:06.154
yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation,

00:01:06.154 --> 00:01:08.215
he has great difficulty.

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:10.274
He doesn't make eye contact.

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:12.397
He has difficulty starting a conversation,

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:14.132
feels awkward,

00:01:14.132 --> 00:01:15.950
and when he gets nervous,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.675
he actually shuts down.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:19.157
Yet both of these boys

00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:23.341
have the same diagnosis of
autism spectrum disorder.

00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:25.769
One of the things that concerns us

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.366
is whether or not there really is

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.339
an epidemic of autism.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.819
These days, one in 88 children

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.861
will be diagnosed with autism,

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:35.334
and the question is,

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:37.337
why does this graph look this way?

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:39.304
Has that number been increasing

00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:41.238
dramatically over time?

00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:45.769
Or is it because we have now started labeling

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:47.331
individuals with autism,

00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:49.579
simply giving them a diagnosis

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.132
when they were still present there before

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.525
yet simply didn't have that label?

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:58.516
And in fact, in the late 1980s, the early 1990s,

00:01:58.516 --> 00:01:59.926
legislation was passed

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:02.565
that actually provided individuals with autism

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:06.291
with resources, with access to educational materials

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.063
that would help them.

00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:11.551
With that increased awareness, more parents,

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.297
more pediatricians, more educators

00:02:14.297 --> 00:02:17.552
learned to recognize the features of autism.

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:21.562
As a result of that, more individuals were diagnosed

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:24.750
and got access to the resources they needed.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.182
In addition, we've changed our definition over time,

00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:31.320
so in fact we've widened the definition of autism,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.440
and that accounts for some of

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.455
the increased prevalence that we see.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:38.115
The next question everyone wonders is,

00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:39.891
what caused autism?

00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.786
And a common misconception

00:02:42.786 --> 00:02:45.570
is that vaccines cause autism.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.621
But let me be very clear:

00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:53.108
Vaccines do not cause autism.

00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:59.812
(Applause)

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.935
In fact, the original research study

00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:03.934
that suggested that was the case

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:06.809
was completely fraudulent.

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.985
It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet,

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:11.577
in which it was published,

00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:13.467
and that author, a physician,

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.721
had his medical license taken away from him.

00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.675
(Applause)

00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:22.257
The Institute of Medicine,

00:03:22.257 --> 00:03:23.820
The Centers for Disease Control,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.164
have repeatedly investigated this

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:29.771
and there is no credible evidence

00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:32.456
that vaccines cause autism.

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:34.093
Furthermore,

00:03:34.093 --> 00:03:36.562
one of the ingredients in vaccines,

00:03:36.562 --> 00:03:38.614
something called thimerosal,

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:41.930
was thought to be what the cause of autism was.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.193
That was actually removed from vaccines

00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:45.918
in the year 1992,

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:48.962
and you can see that it really did not have an effect

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.601
in what happened with the prevalence of autism.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:53.334
So again, there is no evidence

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:55.416
that this is the answer.

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:59.559
So the question remains, what does cause autism?

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.390
In fact, there's probably not one single answer.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.147
Just as autism is a spectrum,

00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:06.337
there's a spectrum of etiologies,

00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:07.989
a spectrum of causes.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.980
Based on epidemiological data,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.773
we know that one of the causes,

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:13.930
or one of the associations, I should say,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.214
is advanced paternal age,

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.151
that is, increasing age of the father

00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:20.330
at the time of conception.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.474
In addition, another vulnerable

00:04:22.474 --> 00:04:25.104
and critical period in terms of development

00:04:25.104 --> 00:04:27.010
is when the mother is pregnant.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.000
During that period, while
the fetal brain is developing,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.942
we know that exposure to certain agents

00:04:31.942 --> 00:04:35.027
can actually increase the risk of autism.

00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:37.962
In particular, there's a medication, valproic acid,

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:40.548
which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take,

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:44.220
we know can increase that risk of autism.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.519
In addition, there can be some infectious agents

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.419
that can also cause autism.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.999
And one of the things I'm going to spend

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.060
a lot of time focusing on

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.621
are the genes that can cause autism.

00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:58.077
I'm focusing on this not because genes

00:04:58.077 --> 00:05:00.221
are the only cause of autism,

00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:01.790
but it's a cause of autism

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.667
that we can readily define

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.460
and be able to better understand the biology

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.729
and understand better how the brain works

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.714
so that we can come up with strategies

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:13.044
to be able to intervene.

00:05:13.044 --> 00:05:15.990
One of the genetic factors that we don't understand,

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.138
however, is the difference that we see

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:21.044
in terms of males and females.

00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:24.049
Males are affected four to one compared to females

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:25.151
with autism,

00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:29.142
and we really don't understand what that cause is.

00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:30.860
One of the ways that we can understand

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.723
that genetics is a factor

00:05:32.723 --> 00:05:34.060
is by looking at something called

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.950
the concordance rate.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.138
In other words, if one sibling has autism,

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:40.625
what's the probability

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:43.629
that another sibling in that family will have autism?

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.194
And we can look in particular

00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:47.362
at three types of siblings:

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:49.233
identical twins,

00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:51.452
twins that actually share 100 percent

00:05:51.452 --> 00:05:53.054
of their genetic information

00:05:53.054 --> 00:05:56.230
and shared the same intrauterine environment,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.475
versus fraternal twins,

00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:00.464
twins that actually share 50 percent

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.491
of their genetic information,

00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:03.707
versus regular siblings,

00:06:03.707 --> 00:06:05.576
brother-sister, sister-sister,

00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:08.444
also sharing 50 percent of their genetic information,

00:06:08.444 --> 00:06:11.523
yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment.

00:06:11.523 --> 00:06:13.823
And when you look at those concordance ratios,

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:15.880
one of the striking things that you will see

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.000
is that in identical twins,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.353
that concordance rate is 77 percent.

00:06:21.353 --> 00:06:22.457
Remarkably, though,

00:06:22.457 --> 00:06:24.605
it's not 100 percent.

00:06:24.605 --> 00:06:28.608
It is not that genes account
for all of the risk for autism,

00:06:28.608 --> 00:06:30.849
but yet they account for a lot of that risk,

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.162
because when you look at fraternal twins,

00:06:33.162 --> 00:06:36.238
that concordance rate is only 31 percent.

00:06:36.238 --> 00:06:38.149
On the other hand, there is a difference

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:41.092
between those fraternal twins and the siblings,

00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:43.756
suggesting that there are common exposures

00:06:43.756 --> 00:06:45.179
for those fraternal twins

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:47.296
that may not be shared as commonly

00:06:47.296 --> 00:06:49.470
with siblings alone.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.156
So this provides some of the data

00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:52.778
that autism is genetic.

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:54.742
Well, how genetic is it?

00:06:54.742 --> 00:06:56.585
When we compare it to other conditions

00:06:56.585 --> 00:06:58.197
that we're familiar with,

00:06:58.197 --> 00:07:02.077
things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:06.030
in fact, genetics plays a much larger role in autism

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.470
than it does in any of these other conditions.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.812
But with this, that doesn't
tell us what the genes are.

00:07:11.812 --> 00:07:14.479
It doesn't even tell us in any one child,

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:16.140
is it one gene

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.396
or potentially a combination of genes?

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.950
And so in fact, in some individuals with autism,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.464
it is genetic!

00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:26.694
That is, that it is one single,

00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:28.866
powerful, deterministic gene

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:30.713
that causes the autism.

00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:32.507
However, in other individuals,

00:07:32.507 --> 00:07:34.213
it's genetic, that is,

00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:37.333
that it's actually a combination of genes

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:40.128
in part with the developmental process

00:07:40.128 --> 00:07:43.508
that ultimately determines that risk for autism.

00:07:43.508 --> 00:07:46.378
We don't know in any one person, necessarily,

00:07:46.378 --> 00:07:48.471
which of those two answers it is

00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:50.512
until we start digging deeper.

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.799
So the question becomes,

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:54.040
how can we start to identify

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.912
what exactly those genes are.

00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:57.021
And let me pose something

00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:59.211
that might not be intuitive.

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:01.570
In certain individuals,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.294
they can have autism

00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:05.747
for a reason that is genetic

00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:09.311
but yet not because of autism running in the family.

00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:11.690
And the reason is because in certain individuals,

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.751
they can actually have genetic changes or mutations

00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:17.794
that are not passed down from the mother

00:08:17.794 --> 00:08:19.281
or from the father,

00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.014
but actually start brand new in them,

00:08:22.014 --> 00:08:23.601
mutations that are present

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:25.004
in the egg or the sperm

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.617
at the time of conception

00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:28.359
but have not been passed down

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:31.365
generation through generation within the family.

00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:33.546
And we can actually use that strategy

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.880
to now understand and to identify

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.980
those genes causing autism in those individuals.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.990
So in fact, at the Simons Foundation,

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.716
we took 2,600 individuals

00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:46.427
that had no family history of autism,

00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:49.597
and we took that child and their mother and father

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:52.068
and used them to try and understand

00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:53.687
what were those genes

00:08:53.687 --> 00:08:56.005
causing autism in those cases?

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:59.072
To do that, we actually had to comprehensively

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:01.802
be able to look at all that genetic information

00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:03.984
and determine what those differences were

00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:07.685
between the mother, the father and the child.

00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:09.639
In doing so, I apologize,

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.523
I'm going to use an outdated analogy

00:09:11.523 --> 00:09:14.181
of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia,

00:09:14.181 --> 00:09:17.180
but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.538
that as we did this inventory,

00:09:19.538 --> 00:09:21.131
we needed to be able to look at

00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:23.304
massive amounts of information.

00:09:23.304 --> 00:09:25.591
Our genetic information is organized

00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:28.478
into a set of 46 volumes,

00:09:28.478 --> 00:09:30.387
and when we did that, we had to be able to account

00:09:30.387 --> 00:09:32.371
for each of those 46 volumes,

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:34.224
because in some cases with autism,

00:09:34.224 --> 00:09:36.680
there's actually a single volume that's missing.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.990
We had to get more granular than that, though,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.310
and so we had to start opening those books,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.190
and in some cases, the genetic change

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.578
was more subtle.

00:09:44.578 --> 00:09:47.764
It might have been a single
paragraph that was missing,

00:09:47.764 --> 00:09:51.042
or yet, even more subtle than that,

00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:52.734
a single letter,

00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:55.536
one out of three billion letters

00:09:55.536 --> 00:09:57.810
that was changed, that was altered,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.407
yet had profound effects

00:09:59.407 --> 00:10:01.320
in terms of how the brain functions

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.137
and affects behavior.

00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:05.514
In doing this within these families,

00:10:05.514 --> 00:10:07.832
we were able to account for approximately

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:10.157
25 percent of the individuals

00:10:10.157 --> 00:10:12.704
and determine that there was a single

00:10:12.704 --> 00:10:14.900
powerful genetic factor

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.024
that caused autism within those families.

00:10:18.024 --> 00:10:20.276
On the other hand, there's 75 percent

00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:22.727
that we still haven't figured out.

00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:24.197
As we did this, though,

00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:26.291
it was really quite humbling,

00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.656
because we realized that there was not simply

00:10:28.656 --> 00:10:30.597
one gene for autism.

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:32.346
In fact, the current estimates are

00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:35.098
that there are 200 to 400 different genes

00:10:35.098 --> 00:10:36.990
that can cause autism.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.359
And that explains, in part,

00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:40.476
why we see such a broad spectrum

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.519
in terms of its effects.

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:44.744
Although there are that many genes,

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.092
there is some method to the madness.

00:10:47.092 --> 00:10:49.040
It's not simply random

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.270
200, 400 different genes,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.064
but in fact they fit together.

00:10:53.064 --> 00:10:54.930
They fit together in a pathway.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.402
They fit together in a network

00:10:56.402 --> 00:10:58.234
that's starting to make sense now

00:10:58.234 --> 00:11:00.932
in terms of how the brain functions.

00:11:00.932 --> 00:11:03.078
We're starting to have a bottom-up approach

00:11:03.078 --> 00:11:04.787
where we're identifying those genes,

00:11:04.787 --> 00:11:07.265
those proteins, those molecules,

00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:09.175
understanding how they interact together

00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:10.572
to make that neuron work,

00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:13.309
understanding how those neurons interact together

00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:14.528
to make circuits work,

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:16.544
and understand how those circuits work

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:18.370
to now control behavior,

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.170
and understand that both in individuals with autism

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.071
as well as individuals who have normal cognition.

00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:27.529
But early diagnosis is a key for us.

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:29.488
Being able to make that diagnosis

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.995
of someone who's susceptible

00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:33.050
at a time in a window

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.397
where we have the ability to transform,

00:11:35.397 --> 00:11:37.000
to be able to impact

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.740
that growing, developing brain is critical.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.549
And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods

00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:46.117
to be able to take infants, small babies,

00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:48.650
and be able to use biomarkers,

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.988
in this case eye contact and eye tracking,

00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:54.074
to identify an infant at risk.

00:11:54.074 --> 00:11:56.239
This particular infant, you can see,

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:58.440
making very good eye contact with this woman

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.800
as she's singing "Itsy, Bitsy Spider,"

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.840
in fact is not going to develop autism.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.720
This baby we know is going to be in the clear.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.080
On the other hand, this other baby

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.415
is going to go on to develop autism.

00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:13.642
In this particular child, you can see,

00:12:13.642 --> 00:12:15.843
it's not making good eye contact.

00:12:15.843 --> 00:12:17.810
Instead of the eyes focusing in

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.088
and having that social connection,

00:12:20.088 --> 00:12:22.726
looking at the mouth, looking at the nose,

00:12:22.726 --> 00:12:24.509
looking off in another direction,

00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:27.422
but not again socially connecting,

00:12:27.422 --> 00:12:30.135
and being able to do this on a very large scale,

00:12:30.135 --> 00:12:33.135
screen infants, screen children for autism,

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:36.059
through something very robust, very reliable,

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.775
is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being

00:12:38.775 --> 00:12:40.869
able to intervene at an early stage

00:12:40.869 --> 00:12:44.301
when we can have the greatest impact.

00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:46.547
How are we going to intervene?

00:12:46.547 --> 00:12:49.377
It's probably going to be a combination of factors.

00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:51.416
In part, in some individuals,

00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:53.295
we're going to try and use medications.

00:12:53.295 --> 00:12:56.017
And so in fact, identifying the genes for autism

00:12:56.017 --> 00:12:57.543
is important for us

00:12:57.543 --> 00:12:59.409
to identify drug targets,

00:12:59.409 --> 00:13:02.032
to identify things that we might be able to impact

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.730
and can be certain that that's really

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.425
what we need to do in autism.

00:13:05.425 --> 00:13:08.166
But that's not going to be the only answer.

00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:11.676
Beyond just drugs, we're going
to use educational strategies.

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:12.951
Individuals with autism,

00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:15.248
some of them are wired a little bit differently.

00:13:15.248 --> 00:13:17.107
They learn in a different way.

00:13:17.107 --> 00:13:19.441
They absorb their surroundings in a different way,

00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:21.660
and we need to be able to educate them

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.753
in a way that serves them best.

00:13:24.753 --> 00:13:26.671
Beyond that, there are a lot of individuals

00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:28.817
in this room who have great ideas

00:13:28.817 --> 00:13:31.361
in terms of new technologies we can use,

00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:34.480
everything from devices we can use to train the brain

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.029
to be able to make it more efficient

00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:37.702
and to compensate for areas in which

00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:39.296
it has a little bit of trouble,

00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:41.575
to even things like Google Glass.

00:13:41.575 --> 00:13:43.359
You could imagine, for instance, Gabriel,

00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:45.180
with his social awkwardness,

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.638
might be able to wear Google Glass

00:13:46.638 --> 00:13:48.169
with an earpiece in his ear,

00:13:48.169 --> 00:13:50.096
and have a coach be able to help him,

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:52.754
be able to help think about conversations,

00:13:52.754 --> 00:13:54.070
conversation-starters,

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.181
being able to even perhaps one day

00:13:56.181 --> 00:13:58.549
invite a girl out on a date.

00:13:58.549 --> 00:14:00.761
All of these new technologies

00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:02.767
just offer tremendous opportunities

00:14:02.767 --> 00:14:04.672
for us to be able to impact

00:14:04.672 --> 00:14:07.357
the individuals with autism,

00:14:07.357 --> 00:14:09.893
but yet we have a long way to go.

00:14:09.893 --> 00:14:11.203
As much as we know,

00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:14.160
there is so much more that we don't know,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.293
and so I invite all of you

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:18.535
to be able to help us think about

00:14:18.535 --> 00:14:19.946
how to do this better,

00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:22.825
to use as a community our collective wisdom

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:24.631
to be able to make a difference,

00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:25.888
and in particular,

00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:28.592
for the individuals in families with autism,

00:14:28.592 --> 00:14:31.847
I invite you to join the interactive autism network,

00:14:31.847 --> 00:14:34.041
to be part of the solution to this,

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.920
because it's going to take really a lot of us

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.190
to think about what's important,

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.115
what's going to be a meaningful difference.

00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:42.620
As we think about something

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.452
that's potentially a solution,

00:14:44.452 --> 00:14:46.111
how well does it work?

00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:48.059
Is it something that's really
going to make a difference

00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:50.428
in your lives, as an individual,

00:14:50.428 --> 00:14:52.081
as a family with autism?

00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:54.501
We're going to need individuals of all ages,

00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:56.228
from the young to the old,

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.387
and with all different shapes and sizes

00:14:58.387 --> 00:15:00.224
of the autism spectrum disorder

00:15:00.224 --> 00:15:02.400
to make sure that we can have an impact.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.605
So I invite all of you to join the mission

00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:07.579
and to help to be able to make the lives

00:15:07.579 --> 00:15:09.265
of individuals with autism

00:15:09.265 --> 00:15:11.196
so much better and so much richer.

00:15:11.196 --> 00:15:13.921
Thank you.

00:15:13.921 --> 00:15:17.921
(Applause)
