WEBVTT

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.081
The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius."

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:06.850
Faster, Higher, Stronger.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.790
And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.946
The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:16.262
ran two hours and eight minutes.

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:17.882
Had he been racing against the winner

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:20.348
of the 1904 Olympic marathon,

00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:23.681
he would have won by nearly an hour and a half.

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.453
Now we all have this feeling

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:27.043
that we're somehow just getting better

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:29.383
as a human race, inexorably progressing,

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:31.524
but it's not like we've evolved into a new species

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:32.990
in a century.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.598
So what's going on here?

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:36.959
I want to take a look at what's really behind

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:39.649
this march of athletic progress.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.946
In 1936, Jesse Owens

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:44.283
held the world record in the 100 meters.

00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:46.990
Had Jesse Owens been racing last year

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.436
in the world championships of the 100 meters,

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:51.910
when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.318
Owens would have still had 14 feet to go.

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:57.197
That's a lot in sprinter land.

00:00:57.197 --> 00:00:58.700
To give you a sense of how much it is,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.658
I want to share with you a demonstration

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:03.670
conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.835
Now picture the stadium last year

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:08.464
at the world championships of the 100 meters:

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:10.563
thousands of fans waiting with baited breath

00:01:10.563 --> 00:01:14.037
to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;

00:01:14.037 --> 00:01:16.912
flashbulbs popping as the
nine fastest men in the world

00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:19.475
coil themselves into their blocks.

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:20.606
And I want you to pretend

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:22.945
that Jesse Owens is in that race.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:26.190
Now close your eyes for a
second and picture the race.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.882
Bang! The gun goes off.

00:01:27.882 --> 00:01:29.950
An American sprinter jumps out to the front.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.900
Usain Bolt starts to catch him.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.521
Usain Bolt passes him, and as
the runners come to the finish,

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:36.198
you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.

00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:37.875
(Beeps)

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:40.980
That's the entire finish of the race.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.360
You can open your eyes now.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.970
That first beep was Usain Bolt.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.284
That last beep was Jesse Owens.

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:49.461
Listen to it again.

00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:51.179
(Beeps)

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.279
When you think of it like that,

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.550
it's not that big a difference, is it?

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.407
And then consider that Usain Bolt started

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:59.170
by propelling himself out of blocks

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.509
down a specially fabricated carpet

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.265
designed to allow him to travel

00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:05.381
as fast as humanly possible.

00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:07.052
Jesse Owens, on the other hand,

00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:10.643
ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,

00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:12.880
and that soft surface stole far more energy

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.657
from his legs as he ran.

00:02:14.657 --> 00:02:17.620
Rather than blocks, Jesse
Owens had a gardening trowel

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.447
that he had to use to dig holes
in the cinders to start from.

00:02:21.447 --> 00:02:23.551
Biomechanical analysis of the speed

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.095
of Owens' joints shows that had been running

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:27.609
on the same surface as Bolt,

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.120
he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.439
he would have been within one stride.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.181
Rather than the last beep,

00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:37.121
Owens would have been the second beep.

00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:39.172
Listen to it again.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:40.910
(Beeps)

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.293
That's the difference track
surface technology has made,

00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:45.572
and it's done it throughout the running world.

00:02:45.572 --> 00:02:47.303
Consider a longer event.

00:02:47.303 --> 00:02:50.266
In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.443
became the first man to run
under four minutes in the mile.

00:02:53.443 --> 00:02:56.493
Nowadays, college kids do that every year.

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:59.046
On rare occasions, a high school kid does it.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.788
As of the end of last year,

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:03.155
1,314 men

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.370
had run under four minutes in the mile,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.820
but like Jesse Owens,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.562
Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:11.386
that stole far more energy from his legs

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:13.749
than the synthetic tracks of today.

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.249
So I consulted biomechanics experts

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.813
to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders

00:03:17.813 --> 00:03:19.071
than synthetic tracks,

00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:22.471
and their consensus that it's
one and a half percent slower.

00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:25.758
So if you apply a one and a half
percent slowdown conversion

00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:27.944
to every man who ran his sub-four mile

00:03:27.944 --> 00:03:29.388
on a synthetic track,

00:03:29.388 --> 00:03:31.084
this is what happens.

00:03:31.084 --> 00:03:33.413
Only 530 are left.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.810
If you look at it from that perspective,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.130
fewer than ten new men per [year]

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.613
have joined the sub-four mile club

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:40.915
since Sir Roger Bannister.

00:03:40.915 --> 00:03:43.982
Now, 530 is a lot more than one,

00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:45.498
and that's partly because
there are many more people

00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:48.012
training today and they're training more intelligently.

00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:50.240
Even college kids are professional in their training

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.766
compared to Sir Roger Bannister,

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:53.225
who trained for 45 minutes at a time

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:56.315
while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.

00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:58.718
And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon

00:03:58.718 --> 00:04:00.429
in three in a half hours,

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.566
that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.598
while he ran along the course.

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:07.221
That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.

00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:09.284
(Laughter)

00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:10.972
Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy

00:04:10.972 --> 00:04:13.446
about performance-enhancing drugs as well,

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:15.717
and that's made a difference
in some sports at some times,

00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:18.004
but technology has made a difference in all sports,

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:20.553
from faster skis to lighter shoes.

00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:23.693
Take a look at the record for
the 100-meter freestyle swim.

00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:26.340
The record is always trending downward,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.090
but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.011
This first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction

00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:33.240
of the flip turn.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.269
Rather than stopping and turning around,

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:37.113
athletes could somersault under the water

00:04:37.113 --> 00:04:39.631
and get going right away in the opposite direction.

00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:42.423
This second cliff, the introduction of gutters

00:04:42.423 --> 00:04:43.955
on the side of the pool

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:45.512
that allows water to splash off,

00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:46.799
rather than becoming turbulence

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:49.046
that impedes the swimmers as they race.

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:50.685
This final cliff,

00:04:50.685 --> 00:04:51.871
the introduction of full-body

00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:53.768
and low-friction swimsuits.

00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:57.457
Throughout sports, technology has
changed the face of performance.

00:04:57.457 --> 00:05:00.233
In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.557
for the longest distance cycled in one hour

00:05:02.557 --> 00:05:06.605
at 30 miles, 3,774 feet.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:08.853
Now that record improved and improved

00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:11.872
as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic

00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:13.486
all the way until 1996,

00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:17.921
when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:20.150
nearly five miles farther

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.295
than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.

00:05:23.295 --> 00:05:26.718
But then in 2000, the International Cycling Union

00:05:26.718 --> 00:05:29.226
decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record

00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:32.298
had to do so with essentially the same equipment

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:34.963
that Eddy Merckx used in 1972.

00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:37.218
Where does the record stand today?

00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:40.840
30 miles, 4,657 feet,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.950
a grand total of 883 feet

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.726
farther than Eddy Merckx cycled

00:05:45.726 --> 00:05:47.427
more than four decades ago.

00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:49.808
Essentially the entire improvement in this record

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.860
was due to technology.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.030
Still, technology isn't the only
thing pushing athletes forward.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.481
While indeed we haven't evolved

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.198
into a new species in a century,

00:05:58.198 --> 00:06:00.158
the gene pool within competitive sports

00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:02.550
most certainly has changed.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.459
In the early half of the 20th century,

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.144
physical education instructors and coaches

00:06:06.144 --> 00:06:08.416
had the idea that the average body type

00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:10.787
was the best for all athletic endeavors:

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:14.110
medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.082
And this showed in athletes' bodies.

00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:18.335
In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper

00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:22.050
and average elite shot-putter
were the same exact size.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.960
But as that idea started to fade away,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.036
as sports scientists and coaches realized that

00:06:26.036 --> 00:06:27.628
rather than the average body type,

00:06:27.628 --> 00:06:29.540
you want highly specialized bodies

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.870
that fit into certain athletic niches,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.175
a form of artificial selection took place,

00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:36.798
a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,

00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:39.458
and athletes' bodies became
more different from one another.

00:06:39.458 --> 00:06:43.414
Today, rather than the same size
as the average elite high jumper,

00:06:43.414 --> 00:06:44.428
the average elite shot-putter

00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:46.079
is two and a half inches taller

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:49.168
and 130 pounds heavier.

00:06:49.168 --> 00:06:51.087
And this happened throughout the sports world.

00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:53.752
In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph

00:06:53.752 --> 00:06:56.280
one data point for each of two dozen sports

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.565
in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:01.050
There's some dispersal,

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.060
but it's kind of grouped
around that average body type.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.639
Then that idea started to go away,

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.340
and at the same time, digital technology --

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.547
first radio, then television and the Internet --

00:07:09.547 --> 00:07:11.924
gave millions, or in some cases billions, of people

00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:15.103
a ticket to consume elite sports performance.

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:18.976
The financial incentives and fame and glory
afforded elite athletes skyrocketed,

00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:23.169
and it tipped toward the tiny
upper echelon of performance.

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.596
It accelerated the artificial
selection for specialized bodies.

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:28.224
And if you plot a data point for these same

00:07:28.224 --> 00:07:32.106
two dozen sports today, it looks like this.

00:07:32.106 --> 00:07:33.533
The athletes' bodies have gotten

00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:35.727
much more different from one another.

00:07:35.727 --> 00:07:37.836
And because this chart looks like the charts

00:07:37.836 --> 00:07:39.567
that show the expanding universe,

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:42.027
with the galaxies flying away from one another,

00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:43.671
the scientists who discovered it call it

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.960
"The Big Bang of Body Types."

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.368
In sports where height is prized, like basketball,

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.158
the tall athletes got taller.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.264
In 1983, the National Basketball Association

00:07:54.264 --> 00:07:55.587
signed a groundbreaking agreement

00:07:55.587 --> 00:07:57.639
making players partners in the league,

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.189
entitled to shares of ticket revenues

00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:01.096
and television contracts.

00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:03.299
Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player

00:08:03.299 --> 00:08:04.495
wanted to be,

00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:06.341
and teams started scouring the globe

00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:08.621
for the bodies that could
help them win championships.

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.364
Almost overnight,

00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:11.742
the proportion of men in the NBA

00:08:11.742 --> 00:08:13.634
who are at least seven feet tall doubled

00:08:13.634 --> 00:08:15.399
to 10 percent.

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.422
Today, one in 10 men in the NBA

00:08:17.422 --> 00:08:19.604
is at least seven feet tall,

00:08:19.604 --> 00:08:21.753
but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare

00:08:21.753 --> 00:08:23.272
in the general population --

00:08:23.272 --> 00:08:25.922
so rare that if you know an American man

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.327
between the ages of 20 and 40

00:08:27.327 --> 00:08:29.463
who is at least seven feet tall,

00:08:29.463 --> 00:08:31.235
there's a 17 percent chance

00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:33.040
he's in the NBA right now.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.978
(Laughter)

00:08:35.978 --> 00:08:38.854
That is, find six honest seven footers,

00:08:38.854 --> 00:08:42.084
one is in the NBA right now.

00:08:42.084 --> 00:08:44.913
And that's not the only way that
NBA players' bodies are unique.

00:08:44.913 --> 00:08:47.528
This is Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man,"

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:48.951
the ideal proportions,

00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:50.950
with arm span equal to height.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.458
My arm span is exactly equal to my height.

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:55.594
Yours is probably very nearly so.

00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:57.756
But not the average NBA player.

00:08:57.756 --> 00:09:00.563
The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7",

00:09:00.563 --> 00:09:02.874
with arms that are seven feet long.

00:09:02.874 --> 00:09:05.672
Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall,

00:09:05.672 --> 00:09:07.950
they are ludicrously long.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.955
Had Leonardo wanted to draw

00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:10.930
the Vitruvian NBA Player,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.903
he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,

00:09:12.903 --> 00:09:15.685
not a circle and a square.

00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:17.850
So in sports where large size is prized,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.921
the large athletes have gotten larger.

00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:22.900
Conversely, in sports where
diminutive stature is an advantage,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.117
the small athletes got smaller.

00:09:25.117 --> 00:09:26.780
The average elite female gymnast

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.543
shrunk from 5'3" to 4'9" on average

00:09:29.543 --> 00:09:30.880
over the last 30 years,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.995
all the better for their power-to-weight ratio

00:09:32.995 --> 00:09:34.765
and for spinning in the air.

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:36.127
And while the large got larger

00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:37.491
and the small got smaller,

00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:39.919
the weird got weirder.

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:41.469
The average length of the forearm

00:09:41.469 --> 00:09:43.220
of a water polo player in relation

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.077
to their total arm got longer,

00:09:45.077 --> 00:09:47.206
all the better for a forceful throwing whip.

00:09:47.206 --> 00:09:48.933
And as the large got larger,

00:09:48.933 --> 00:09:51.303
small got smaller, and the weird weirder.

00:09:51.303 --> 00:09:53.496
In swimming, the ideal body type

00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:55.391
is a long torso and short legs.

00:09:55.391 --> 00:09:57.330
It's like the long hull of a canoe

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.036
for speed over the water.

00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:00.801
And the opposite is advantageous in running.

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:02.816
You want long legs and a short torso.

00:10:02.816 --> 00:10:05.012
And this shows in athletes' bodies today.

00:10:05.012 --> 00:10:06.607
Here you see Michael Phelps,

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.071
the greatest swimmer in history,

00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:10.940
standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.927
the world record holder in the mile.

00:10:12.927 --> 00:10:15.744
These men are seven inches different in height,

00:10:15.744 --> 00:10:16.946
but because of the body types

00:10:16.946 --> 00:10:18.809
advantaged in their sports,

00:10:18.809 --> 00:10:21.197
they wear the same length pants.

00:10:21.197 --> 00:10:22.691
Seven inches difference in height,

00:10:22.691 --> 00:10:25.211
these men have the same length legs.

00:10:25.211 --> 00:10:27.169
Now in some cases, the search for bodies

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:29.142
that could push athletic performance forward

00:10:29.142 --> 00:10:31.785
ended up introducing into the competitive world

00:10:31.785 --> 00:10:34.924
populations of people that weren't
previously competing at all,

00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:37.676
like Kenyan distance runners.

00:10:37.676 --> 00:10:41.006
We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:43.384
Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe

00:10:43.384 --> 00:10:45.484
as being great marathoners.

00:10:45.484 --> 00:10:47.579
The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:49.376
of the Kenyan population

00:10:49.376 --> 00:10:51.545
but the vast majority of elite runners.

00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:52.851
And they happen, on average,

00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:54.955
to have a certain unique physiology:

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:56.036
legs that are very long

00:10:56.036 --> 00:10:58.574
and very thin at their extremity,

00:10:58.574 --> 00:10:59.992
and this is because they have their ancestry

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.427
at very low latitude

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.842
in a very hot and dry climate,

00:11:03.842 --> 00:11:05.732
and an evolutionary adaptation to that

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:06.690
is limbs that are very long

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.209
and very thin at the extremity

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.983
for cooling purposes.

00:11:09.983 --> 00:11:13.012
It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,

00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:14.854
to increase surface area compared to volume

00:11:14.854 --> 00:11:16.796
to let heat out,

00:11:16.796 --> 00:11:18.309
and because the leg is like a pendulum,

00:11:18.309 --> 00:11:19.966
the longer and thinner it is at the extremity,

00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:22.745
the more energy-efficient it is to swing.

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:25.339
To put Kalenjin running success in perspective,

00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:28.066
consider that 17 American men in history

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:30.695
have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes

00:11:30.695 --> 00:11:31.984
in the marathon.

00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:35.031
That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.

00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:37.966
Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.

00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:40.060
(Laughter)

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.881
That's from a source population the size

00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:44.708
of metropolitan Atlanta.

00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:46.282
Still, even changing technology

00:11:46.282 --> 00:11:47.888
and the changing gene pool in sports

00:11:47.888 --> 00:11:50.361
don't account for all of the changes in performance.

00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:53.251
Athletes have a different mindset than they once did.

00:11:53.251 --> 00:11:54.620
Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.892
an electrical shock

00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:58.215
and they're thrown across a room?

00:11:58.215 --> 00:11:59.786
There's no explosion there.

00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:01.024
What's happening when that happens is that

00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:02.486
the electrical impulse is causing

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:04.616
all their muscle fibers to twitch at once,

00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:07.210
and they're throwing themselves across the room.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.107
They're essentially jumping.

00:12:09.107 --> 00:12:10.284
That's the power

00:12:10.284 --> 00:12:12.233
that's contained in the human body.

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:14.460
But normally we can't access nearly all of it.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.479
Our brain acts as a limiter,

00:12:16.479 --> 00:12:18.774
preventing us from accessing
all of our physical resources,

00:12:18.774 --> 00:12:20.015
because we might hurt ourselves,

00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:21.707
tearing tendons or ligaments.

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:24.730
But the more we learn about
how that limiter functions,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.610
the more we learn how we can push it back

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.050
just a bit,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.482
in some cases by convincing the brain

00:12:30.482 --> 00:12:32.256
that the body won't be in mortal danger

00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:34.066
by pushing harder.

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:35.685
Endurance and ultra-endurance sports

00:12:35.685 --> 00:12:37.257
serve as a great example.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.379
Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful

00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:40.794
to human health,

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:42.212
but now we realize

00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:43.308
that we have all these traits

00:12:43.308 --> 00:12:46.412
that are perfect for ultra-endurance:

00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:49.336
no body fur and a glut of sweat glands

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:50.952
that keep us cool while running;

00:12:50.952 --> 00:12:54.352
narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;

00:12:54.352 --> 00:12:57.270
large surface area of joints for shock absorption.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.004
We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,

00:13:00.004 --> 00:13:02.107
short toes that are better for pushing off

00:13:02.107 --> 00:13:03.781
than for grasping tree limbs,

00:13:03.781 --> 00:13:04.908
and when we run,

00:13:04.908 --> 00:13:06.433
we can turn our torso and our shoulders

00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:08.477
like this while keeping our heads straight.

00:13:08.477 --> 00:13:09.960
Our primate cousins can't do that.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.270
They have to run like this.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.336
And we have big old butt muscles

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.423
that keep us upright while running.

00:13:16.423 --> 00:13:18.141
Have you ever looked at an ape's butt?

00:13:18.141 --> 00:13:21.146
They have no buns because they don't run upright.

00:13:21.146 --> 00:13:22.533
And as athletes have realized

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:25.090
that we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.137
they've taken on feats

00:13:26.137 --> 00:13:28.546
that would have been unthinkable before,

00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:32.449
athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet.

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:34.449
Here's Kílian running up the Matterhorn.

00:13:34.449 --> 00:13:35.961
(Laughter)

00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:38.570
With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.292
It's so steep he can't even run here.

00:13:40.292 --> 00:13:41.945
He's pulling up on a rope.

00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:43.282
This is a vertical ascent

00:13:43.282 --> 00:13:45.391
of more than 8,000 feet,

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.058
and Kílian went up and down

00:13:47.058 --> 00:13:49.439
in under three hours.

00:13:49.439 --> 00:13:51.358
Amazing.

00:13:51.358 --> 00:13:52.547
And talented though he is,

00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:55.371
Kílian is not a physiological freak.

00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:57.050
Now that he has done this,

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.961
other athletes will follow,

00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:00.478
just as other athletes followed

00:14:00.478 --> 00:14:02.052
after Sir Roger Bannister

00:14:02.052 --> 00:14:04.190
ran under four minutes in the mile.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.817
Changing technology, changing genes,

00:14:05.817 --> 00:14:08.215
and a changing mindset.

00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:09.999
Innovation in sports,

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:11.656
whether that's new track surfaces

00:14:11.656 --> 00:14:13.120
or new swimming techniques,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.990
the democratization of sport,

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.331
the spread to new bodies

00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:18.916
and to new populations around the world,

00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:20.969
and imagination in sport,

00:14:20.969 --> 00:14:22.405
an understanding of what the human body

00:14:22.405 --> 00:14:24.186
is truly capable of,

00:14:24.186 --> 00:14:26.078
have conspired to make athletes stronger,

00:14:26.078 --> 00:14:28.601
faster, bolder,

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:30.578
and better than ever.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.934
Thank you very much.

00:14:32.934 --> 00:14:36.460
(Applause)
