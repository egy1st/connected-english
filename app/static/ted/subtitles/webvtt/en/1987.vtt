00:00:01.542 --> 00:00:04.386
There are 39 million people in the world

00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:05.876
who are blind.

00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:08.350
Eighty percent of them

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.169
are living in low-income countries such as Kenya,

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.118
and the absolute majority

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:14.625
do not need to be blind.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.480
They are blind from diseases

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.256
that are either completely curable or preventable.

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:22.768
Knowing this, with my young family,

00:00:22.768 --> 00:00:24.162
we moved to Kenya.

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:25.969
We secured equipment,

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:29.668
funds, vehicles, we trained a team,

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:31.692
we set up a hundred clinics throughout

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:33.190
the Great Rift Valley

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.651
to try and understand a single question:

00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:38.737
why are people going blind,

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:41.656
and what can we do?

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:44.570
The challenges were great.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.401
When we got to where we were going,

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.067
we set up our high-tech equipment.

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:51.246
Power was rarely available.

00:00:51.246 --> 00:00:52.099
We'd have to run our equipment

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:54.999
from petrol power generators.

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.946
And then something occurred to me:

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:59.441
There has to be an easier way,

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:01.441
because it's the patients who are the most in need

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:02.999
of access to eye care

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.340
who are the least likely to get it.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.446
More people in Kenya,

00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:08.358
and in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:10.149
have access to a mobile phone

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.302
than they do clean running water.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:14.021
So we said, could we harness

00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:15.640
the power of mobile technology

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.791
to deliver eye care in a new way?

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:19.576
And so we developed Peek,

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:22.114
a smartphone [system] that enables

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:23.626
community healthcare workers

00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:27.456
and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:30.126
We set about replacing
traditional hospital equipment,

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:32.649
which is bulky, expensive and fragile,

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.684
with smartphone apps and hardware

00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:36.821
that make it possible to test anyone

00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:40.010
in any language and of any age.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.814
Here we have a demonstration

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:43.537
of a three-month-old having their vision

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:47.910
accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.393
We've got many trials going on

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:55.593
in the community and in schools,

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:57.493
and through the lessons that
we've learned in the field,

00:01:57.493 --> 00:01:59.196
we've realized it's extremely important

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:02.056
to share the data in non-medical jargon

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:03.717
so that people understand

00:02:03.717 --> 00:02:06.340
what we're examining and what that means to them.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.614
So here, for example,

00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:09.470
we use our sight sim application,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.262
once your vision has been measured,

00:02:11.262 --> 00:02:13.972
to show carers and teachers

00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:16.486
what the visual world is like for that person,

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:19.952
so they can empathize with them and help them.

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:22.340
Once we've discovered somebody has low vision,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.911
the next big challenge is to work out why,

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:26.028
and to be able to do that,

00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:28.529
we need to have access to the inside of the eye.

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.115
Traditionally, this requires expensive equipment

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:33.196
to examine an area called the retina.

00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:36.005
The retina is the single part of the eye that has

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.101
huge amounts of information about the body

00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:39.889
and its health.

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.700
We've developed 3D-printed,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.141
low-cost hardware

00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.541
that comes in at less than five dollars to produce,

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:48.484
which can then be clipped onto a smartphone

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:49.926
and makes it possible to get views

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:51.147
of the back of the eye

00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:52.903
of a very high quality.

00:02:52.903 --> 00:02:56.100
And the beauty is, anybody can do it.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.979
In our trials on over two and half thousand people,

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.896
the smartphone with the add-on clip

00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:02.577
is comparable to a camera

00:03:02.577 --> 00:03:04.472
that is hugely more expensive

00:03:04.472 --> 00:03:08.061
and hugely more difficult to transport.

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:09.940
When we first moved to Kenya,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.593
we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:15.050
a team of 15 people,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.942
and that was what was
needed to deliver health care.

00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:20.307
Now, all that's needed

00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:22.099
is a single person

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.495
on a bike with a smartphone.

00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:29.349
And it costs just 500 dollars.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.219
The issue of power supply

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.780
is overcome by harnessing the power of solar.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.920
Our healthcare workers travel

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.465
with a solar-powered rucksack

00:03:36.465 --> 00:03:38.926
which keeps the phone charged and backed up.

00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:41.196
Now we go to the patient

00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:43.907
rather than waiting for the patient never to come.

00:03:43.907 --> 00:03:45.640
We go to them in their homes

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.437
and we give them the most comprehensive,

00:03:47.437 --> 00:03:49.377
high-tech, accurate examination,

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:53.481
which can be delivered by
anyone with minimal training.

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:56.318
We can link global experts

00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:58.060
with people in the most rural,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.250
difficult-to-reach places

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.839
that are beyond the end of the road,

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.353
effectively putting those experts in their homes,

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:05.331
allowing us to make diagnoses

00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:08.399
and make plans for treatment.

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.126
Project managers, hospital directors,

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.045
are able to search on our interface

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:15.047
by any parameter they may be interested in.

00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:17.070
Here in Nakuru, where I've been living,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.406
we can search for people

00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:19.850
by whatever condition.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.122
Here are people who are blind

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:23.652
from a curable condition cataract.

00:04:23.652 --> 00:04:25.681
Each red pin depicts somebody

00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:28.338
who is blind from a disease that is curable

00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:30.584
and treatable, and they're locatable.

00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:32.468
We can use bulk text messaging services

00:04:32.468 --> 00:04:35.622
to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment.

00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:38.237
What's more, we've learned that this is something

00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:40.275
that we haven't built just for the community

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:41.860
but with the community.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.112
Those blue pins that drop represent

00:04:44.112 --> 00:04:46.213
elders, or local leaders,

00:04:46.213 --> 00:04:47.452
that are connected to those people

00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:48.785
who can ensure that we can find them

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:50.886
and arrange treatment.

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:53.888
So for patients like Mama Wangari,

00:04:53.888 --> 00:04:55.484
who have been blind for over 10 years

00:04:55.484 --> 00:04:57.113
and never seen her grandchildren,

00:04:57.113 --> 00:05:00.931
for less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight.

00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:06.209
This is something that has to happen.

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:07.840
It's only in statistics

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.563
that people go blind by the millions.

00:05:10.563 --> 00:05:14.431
The reality is everyone goes blind on their own.

00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:16.408
But now, they might just be

00:05:16.408 --> 00:05:18.547
a text message away from help.

00:05:18.547 --> 00:05:24.483
(Applause)

00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:27.426
And now because live demos are always a bad idea,

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:29.224
we're going to try a live demo.

00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:30.480
(Laughter)

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.165
So here we have the Peek Vision app.

00:05:40.142 --> 00:05:42.786
Okay, and what we're looking at here,

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:44.281
this is Sam's optic nerve,

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:46.680
which is a direct extension of her brain,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.289
so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there.

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.820
We can see all parts of the retina.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.350
It makes it possible to pick up diseases

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.517
of the eye and of the body

00:05:57.517 --> 00:06:00.046
that would not be possible without access to the eye,

00:06:00.046 --> 00:06:01.981
and that clip-on device can be manufactured

00:06:01.981 --> 00:06:03.531
for just a few dollars,

00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:05.162
and people can be cured of blindness,

00:06:05.162 --> 00:06:08.385
and I think it says a lot about us as a human race

00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:10.910
if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.108
But now we can.

00:06:12.108 --> 00:06:14.324
Thank you.

00:06:14.324 --> 00:06:16.488
(Applause)
