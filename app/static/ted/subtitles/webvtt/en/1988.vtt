WEBVTT

00:00:00.864 --> 00:00:03.187
We live in a very complex environment:

00:00:03.187 --> 00:00:05.091
complexity and dynamism

00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:07.154
and patterns of evidence

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:10.039
from satellite photographs, from videos.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.050
You can even see it outside your window.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.910
It's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.870
but the patterns kind of repeat,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.360
but they never repeat exactly.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.487
It's a huge challenge to understand.

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:27.619
The patterns that you see

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.339
are there at all of the different scales,

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.245
but you can't chop it into one little bit and say,

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:36.908
"Oh, well let me just make a smaller climate."

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:41.120
I can't use the normal products of reductionism

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.842
to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.150
in a laboratory and say, "Oh,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.546
now that's something I now understand."

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:51.913
It's the whole or it's nothing.

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:54.465
The different scales that give you

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:56.587
these kinds of patterns

00:00:56.587 --> 00:01:00.044
range over an enormous range of magnitude,

00:01:00.044 --> 00:01:02.460
roughly 14 orders of magnitude,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.951
from the small microscopic particles

00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.327
that seed clouds

00:01:07.327 --> 00:01:09.887
to the size of the planet itself,

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:11.163
from 10 to the minus six

00:01:11.163 --> 00:01:12.240
to 10 to the eight,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.532
14 orders of spatial magnitude.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:17.943
In time, from milliseconds to millennia,

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.998
again around 14 orders of magnitude.

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:22.385
What does that mean?

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:24.324
Okay, well if you think about how

00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:26.984
you can calculate these things,

00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:28.944
you can take what you can see,

00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:29.970
okay, I'm going to chop it up

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.349
into lots of little boxes,

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.704
and that's the result of physics, right?

00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:35.429
And if I think about a weather model,

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.923
that spans about five orders of magnitude,

00:01:37.923 --> 00:01:41.050
from the planet to a few kilometers,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.588
and the time scale

00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:47.000
from a few minutes to 10 days, maybe a month.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.395
We're interested in more than that.

00:01:48.395 --> 00:01:49.700
We're interested in the climate.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.841
That's years, that's millennia,

00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:54.414
and we need to go to even smaller scales.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.015
The stuff that we can't resolve,

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:57.980
the sub-scale processes,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.960
we need to approximate in some way.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.722
That is a huge challenge.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.910
Climate models in the 1990s

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.880
took an even smaller chunk of that,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.898
only about three orders of magnitude.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:09.993
Climate models in the 2010s,

00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:11.767
kind of what we're working with now,

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.707
four orders of magnitude.

00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:17.010
We have 14 to go,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.210
and we're increasing our capability

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.080
of simulating those at about

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.626
one extra order of magnitude every decade.

00:02:24.626 --> 00:02:26.521
One extra order of magnitude in space

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.770
is 10,000 times more calculations.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.150
And we keep adding more things,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.524
more questions to these different models.

00:02:34.524 --> 00:02:37.257
So what does a climate model look like?

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.598
This is an old climate model, admittedly,

00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:43.678
a punch card, a single line of Fortran code.

00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:45.656
We no longer use punch cards.

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:47.897
We do still use Fortran.

00:02:47.897 --> 00:02:49.854
New-fangled ideas like C

00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:53.089
really haven't had a big impact

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.456
on the climate modeling community.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:56.856
But how do we go about doing it?

00:02:56.856 --> 00:03:01.480
How do we go from that complexity that you saw

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.010
to a line of code?

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.583
We do it one piece at a time.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.461
This is a picture of sea ice

00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:09.559
taken flying over the Arctic.

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.597
We can look at all of the different equations

00:03:11.597 --> 00:03:14.709
that go into making the ice grow

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.823
or melt or change shape.

00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:17.954
We can look at the fluxes.

00:03:17.954 --> 00:03:19.906
We can look at the rate at which

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:22.751
snow turns to ice, and we can code that.

00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.080
We can encapsulate that in code.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.306
These models are around

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.389
a million lines of code at this point,

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.859
and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.050
every year.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.703
So you can look at that piece,

00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:36.625
but you can look at the other pieces too.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:38.558
What happens when you have clouds?

00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:40.717
What happens when clouds form,

00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:42.599
when they dissipate, when they rain out?

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.341
That's another piece.

00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:46.187
What happens when we have radiation

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:48.721
coming from the sun, going through the atmosphere,

00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:50.647
being absorbed and reflected?

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.626
We can code each of those
very small pieces as well.

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:56.042
There are other pieces:

00:03:56.042 --> 00:03:59.502
the winds changing the ocean currents.

00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:03.272
We can talk about the role of vegetation

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:05.601
in transporting water from the soils

00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:07.570
back into the atmosphere.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.484
And each of these different elements

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:14.108
we can encapsulate and put into a system.

00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:19.256
Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole.

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:21.553
And you get something like this.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.401
You get a beautiful representation

00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.023
of what's going on in the climate system,

00:04:27.023 --> 00:04:30.412
where each and every one of those

00:04:30.412 --> 00:04:33.194
emergent patterns that you can see,

00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:35.197
the swirls in the Southern Ocean,

00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:37.953
the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:04:37.953 --> 00:04:39.594
and there's two more that are going to pop up

00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:41.948
in the Pacific at any point now,

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.661
those rivers of atmospheric water,

00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:47.518
all of those are emergent properties

00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:49.642
that come from the interactions

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:53.137
of all of those small-scale processes I mentioned.

00:04:53.137 --> 00:04:55.042
There's no code that says,

00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:56.899
"Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean."

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:59.567
There's no code that says, "Have two

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:02.465
tropical cyclones that spin around each other."

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:06.277
All of those things are emergent properties.

00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:08.423
This is all very good. This is all great.

00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:09.693
But what we really want to know

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:11.642
is what happens to these emergent properties

00:05:11.642 --> 00:05:13.347
when we kick the system?

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:16.880
When something changes, what
happens to those properties?

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.869
And there's lots of different ways to kick the system.

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:21.902
There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit

00:05:21.902 --> 00:05:23.781
over hundreds of thousands of years

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.807
that change the climate.

00:05:25.807 --> 00:05:27.943
There are changes in the solar cycles,

00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:31.048
every 11 years and longer, that change the climate.

00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:34.622
Big volcanoes go off and change the climate.

00:05:34.622 --> 00:05:37.860
Changes in biomass burning, in smoke,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.723
in aerosol particles, all of those things

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:41.545
change the climate.

00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:45.604
The ozone hole changed the climate.

00:05:45.604 --> 00:05:47.821
Deforestation changes the climate

00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:49.747
by changing the surface properties

00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:51.737
and how water is evaporated

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:54.203
and moved around in the system.

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:56.488
Contrails change the climate

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:59.355
by creating clouds where there were none before,

00:05:59.355 --> 00:06:03.953
and of course greenhouse gases change the system.

00:06:03.953 --> 00:06:06.974
Each of these different kicks

00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:09.125
provides us with a target

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:11.960
to evaluate whether we understand

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.121
something about this system.

00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:16.513
So we can go to look at

00:06:16.513 --> 00:06:19.217
what model skill is.

00:06:19.217 --> 00:06:21.250
Now I use the word "skill" advisedly:

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.661
Models are not right or wrong; they're always wrong.

00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.381
They're always approximations.

00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:27.275
The question you have to ask

00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:30.354
is whether a model tells you more information

00:06:30.354 --> 00:06:32.279
than you would have had otherwise.

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.660
If it does, it's skillful.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.114
This is the impact of the ozone hole

00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:40.974
on sea level pressure, so
low pressure, high pressures,

00:06:40.974 --> 00:06:43.569
around the southern oceans, around Antarctica.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.482
This is observed data.

00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:47.570
This is modeled data.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.164
There's a good match

00:06:49.164 --> 00:06:51.115
because we understand the physics

00:06:51.115 --> 00:06:54.253
that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere

00:06:54.253 --> 00:06:55.999
and what that does to the winds

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.180
around the southern oceans.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.699
We can look at other examples.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.555
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:05.354
put an enormous amount of aerosols, small particles,

00:07:05.354 --> 00:07:06.941
into the stratosphere.

00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:10.088
That changed the radiation
balance of the whole planet.

00:07:10.088 --> 00:07:12.870
There was less energy coming
in than there was before,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.528
so that cooled the planet,

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:16.547
and those red lines and those green lines,

00:07:16.547 --> 00:07:19.112
those are the differences between what we expected

00:07:19.112 --> 00:07:20.800
and what actually happened.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.583
The models are skillful,

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:24.276
not just in the global mean,

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:27.320
but also in the regional patterns.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.160
I could go through a dozen more examples:

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.010
the skill associated with solar cycles,

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.080
changing the ozone in the stratosphere;

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.427
the skill associated with orbital changes

00:07:37.427 --> 00:07:39.483
over 6,000 years.

00:07:39.483 --> 00:07:41.881
We can look at that too, and the models are skillful.

00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:44.975
The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets

00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:46.495
20,000 years ago.

00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:48.166
The models are skillful

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:51.070
when it comes to the 20th-century trends

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.585
over the decades.

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:54.867
Models are successful at modeling

00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:57.472
lake outbursts into the North Atlantic

00:07:57.472 --> 00:07:59.237
8,000 years ago.

00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:02.327
And we can get a good match to the data.

00:08:03.463 --> 00:08:05.850
Each of these different targets,

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.980
each of these different evaluations,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.371
leads us to add more scope

00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:11.522
to these models,

00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:14.266
and leads us to more and more

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:18.254
complex situations that we can ask

00:08:18.254 --> 00:08:20.823
more and more interesting questions,

00:08:20.823 --> 00:08:23.533
like, how does dust from the Sahara,

00:08:23.533 --> 00:08:25.267
that you can see in the orange,

00:08:25.267 --> 00:08:28.710
interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic?

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.187
How do organic aerosols from biomass burning,

00:08:32.187 --> 00:08:34.910
which you can see in the red dots,

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.844
intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns?

00:08:37.844 --> 00:08:39.631
How does pollution, which you can see

00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:43.530
in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe,

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.865
how does that affect the
temperatures at the surface

00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:50.353
and the sunlight that you get at the surface?

00:08:50.353 --> 00:08:53.841
We can look at this across the world.

00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:57.501
We can look at the pollution from China.

00:08:57.501 --> 00:09:01.099
We can look at the impacts of storms

00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:04.543
on sea salt particles in the atmosphere.

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:07.104
We can see the combination

00:09:07.104 --> 00:09:09.275
of all of these different things

00:09:09.275 --> 00:09:10.743
happening all at once,

00:09:10.743 --> 00:09:13.150
and we can ask much more interesting questions.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.774
How do air pollution and climate coexist?

00:09:17.774 --> 00:09:19.283
Can we change things

00:09:19.283 --> 00:09:21.872
that affect air pollution and
climate at the same time?

00:09:21.872 --> 00:09:24.216
The answer is yes.

00:09:24.216 --> 00:09:27.260
So this is a history of the 20th century.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.503
The first one is the model.

00:09:29.503 --> 00:09:30.910
The weather is a little bit different

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.199
to what actually happened.

00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:34.231
The second one are the observations.

00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:36.556
And we're going through the 1930s.

00:09:36.556 --> 00:09:39.380
There's variability, there are things going on,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.562
but it's all kind of in the noise.

00:09:41.562 --> 00:09:44.424
As you get towards the 1970s,

00:09:44.424 --> 00:09:46.433
things are going to start to change.

00:09:46.433 --> 00:09:48.495
They're going to start to look more similar,

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:51.053
and by the time you get to the 2000s,

00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:53.705
you're already seeing the
patterns of global warming,

00:09:53.705 --> 00:09:56.454
both in the observations and in the model.

00:09:56.454 --> 00:09:58.581
We know what happened over the 20th century.

00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:00.341
Right? We know that it's gotten warmer.

00:10:00.341 --> 00:10:01.952
We know where it's gotten warmer.

00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:04.692
And if you ask the models why did that happen,

00:10:04.692 --> 00:10:06.817
and you say, okay, well, yes,

00:10:06.817 --> 00:10:08.683
basically it's because of the carbon dioxide

00:10:08.683 --> 00:10:10.662
we put into the atmosphere.

00:10:10.662 --> 00:10:12.344
We have a very good match

00:10:12.344 --> 00:10:14.971
up until the present day.

00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:18.391
But there's one key reason why we look at models,

00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:20.612
and that's because of this phrase here.

00:10:20.612 --> 00:10:23.107
Because if we had observations of the future,

00:10:23.107 --> 00:10:26.436
we obviously would trust them more than models,

00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:28.380
But unfortunately,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.920
observations of the future
are not available at this time.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.625
So when we go out into the
future, there's a difference.

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:39.187
The future is unknown, the future is uncertain,

00:10:39.187 --> 00:10:41.591
and there are choices.

00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:43.424
Here are the choices that we have.

00:10:43.424 --> 00:10:45.563
We can do some work to mitigate

00:10:45.563 --> 00:10:48.358
the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:50.284
That's the top one.

00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:52.190
We can do more work

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.366
to really bring it down

00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:56.584
so that by the end of the century,

00:10:56.584 --> 00:10:59.048
it's not much more than there is now.

00:10:59.048 --> 00:11:02.815
Or we can just leave it to fate

00:11:02.815 --> 00:11:04.308
and continue on

00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:08.054
with a business-as-usual type of attitude.

00:11:08.054 --> 00:11:11.510
The differences between these choices

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.307
can't be answered by looking at models.

00:11:16.307 --> 00:11:17.946
There's a great phrase

00:11:17.946 --> 00:11:19.739
that Sherwood Rowland,

00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:23.603
who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry

00:11:23.603 --> 00:11:25.876
that led to ozone depletion,

00:11:25.876 --> 00:11:28.273
when he was accepting his Nobel Prize,

00:11:28.273 --> 00:11:29.652
he asked this question:

00:11:29.652 --> 00:11:31.963
"What is the use of having developed a science

00:11:31.963 --> 00:11:35.224
well enough to make predictions if, in the end,

00:11:35.224 --> 00:11:38.053
all we're willing to do is stand around

00:11:38.053 --> 00:11:40.760
and wait for them to come true?"

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.497
The models are skillful,

00:11:43.497 --> 00:11:46.815
but what we do with the
information from those models

00:11:46.815 --> 00:11:48.986
is totally up to you.

00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:50.924
Thank you.

00:11:50.924 --> 00:11:53.840
(Applause)
