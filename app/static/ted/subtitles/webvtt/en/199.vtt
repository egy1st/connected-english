WEBVTT

00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:02.071
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:05.253
My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.976
What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.976
to do something I call "mathemagics."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.191
But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.976
By any chance, did anyone happen

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.617
to bring with them
this morning a calculator?

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:24.276
Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.576
Raise your hand. Did your hand go up?

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:29.143
Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else?

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:30.976
I see, I see one way in the back.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.976
You sir, that's three.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.824
And anybody on this side here?

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.348
OK, over there on the aisle.

00:00:37.372 --> 00:00:40.006
Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.451
then join me up on stage.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.715
Let's give them a nice round of applause.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.552
(Applause)

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:47.661
That's right.

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:51.099
Now, since I haven't had the chance
to work with these calculators,

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:53.976
I need to make sure
that they are all working properly.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.330
Would somebody get us started by giving us
a two-digit number, please?

00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:00.863
How about a two-digit number?

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:01.976
Audience: 22.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.008
AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir?

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:05.039
Audience: 47.

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:08.976
AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
make sure you get 1,034,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.737
or the calculators are not working.

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:13.905
Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034?

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:14.976
Volunteer: No.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.976
AB: 594. Let's give three of them
a nice round of applause there.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.976
(Applause)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.229
Would you like to try a more
standard calculator, just in case?

00:01:24.253 --> 00:01:25.365
OK, great.

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:27.112
What I'm going to try and do then --

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:30.421
I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer.

00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:31.446
That's OK.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.976
I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.521
There is something called
the square of a number,

00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:41.205
which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.976
For instance, five squared would be?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.007
Audience: 25.

00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:46.509
AB: 25. The way we can
square on most calculators --

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.224
let me demonstrate with this one --

00:01:48.248 --> 00:01:50.682
is by taking the number, such as five,

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.416
hitting "times" and then "equals,"

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.194
and on most calculators
that will give you the square.

00:01:56.218 --> 00:01:58.265
On some of these ancient RPN calculators,

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.467
you've got an "x squared" button on it,

00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:02.976
will allow you to do
the calculation even faster.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.976
What I'm going to try and do
now is to square, in my head,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.976
four two-digit numbers

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.347
faster than they can do
on their calculators,

00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.215
even using the shortcut method.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.381
What I'll use is the second row this time,

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:15.913
and I'll get four of you

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:17.714
to each yell out a two-digit number,

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.976
and if you would square the first number,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.905
and if you would square the second,
the third and the fourth,

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:26.394
I will try and race you to the answer. OK?

00:02:26.418 --> 00:02:28.977
So quickly, a two-digit number please.

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:30.063
Audience: 37.

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:31.952
Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK.

00:02:31.976 --> 00:02:32.976
Audience: 23.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.508
AB: 23 squared, OK.

00:02:34.532 --> 00:02:35.603
Audience: 59.

00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:37.683
AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?

00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:38.732
Audience: 93.

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:39.804
AB: 93 squared.

00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:41.976
Would you call out your answers, please?

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:43.976
Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.976
Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.976
Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.023
Volunteer: 8649.

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:50.206
AB: Thank you very much.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.343
(Applause)

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:58.295
Let me try to take this one step further.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.340
I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time.

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:02.976
I won't even write these down --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.477
I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me.

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.976
Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.196
Anyone on our panel, verify the answer.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.243
Just give some indication if it's right.

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:14.870
A three-digit number, sir, yes?

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:15.976
Audience: 987.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.459
AB: 987 squared is 974,169.

00:03:19.483 --> 00:03:21.563
(Laughter)

00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:23.257
AB: Yes? Good.

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:24.977
Another three-digit --

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.931
(Applause)

00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:29.393
-- another three-digit number, sir?

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.423
Audience: 457.

00:03:30.447 --> 00:03:33.509
AB: 457 squared is 205,849.

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:34.976
205,849?

00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:36.788
AB: Yes?

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:39.169
OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir?

00:03:39.193 --> 00:03:40.217
Audience: 321.

00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:42.866
AB: 321 is 103,041.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.626
103,041.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:48.143
Yes? One more three-digit number please.

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:49.325
Audience: Oh, 722.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.253
AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.

00:03:52.277 --> 00:03:55.087
Is that 513,284?

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:56.166
Volunteer: Yes.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.079
AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please.

00:03:59.103 --> 00:04:00.134
Audience: 162.

00:04:00.158 --> 00:04:03.977
162 squared is 26,244.

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.087
Volunteer: Yes.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.120
Thank you very much.

00:04:06.144 --> 00:04:07.867
(Applause)

00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:12.976
(Applause ends)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.976
Let me try to take this one step further.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.388
(Laughter)

00:04:17.412 --> 00:04:20.976
I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.737
You can all take your time on this;

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:24.955
I will not beat you
to the answer on this one,

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.881
but I will try to get the answer right.

00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:30.444
To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time,

00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:32.122
let's say, one, two, three, four.

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:35.320
If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine,

00:04:35.344 --> 00:04:37.834
that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square.

00:04:38.222 --> 00:04:39.587
Nine.

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.682
Seven.

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:42.151
Five.

00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:43.214
Eight.

00:04:43.238 --> 00:04:46.332
9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me.

00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:48.563
95 million --

00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:50.824
(Sighs)

00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:55.720
218,564?

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:56.769
Volunteer: Yes!

00:04:56.793 --> 00:04:58.031
AB: Thank you very much.

00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:01.085
(Applause)

00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:05.976
(Applause ends)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.261
Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number --

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:10.794
and I can --

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:13.779
but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot.

00:05:13.803 --> 00:05:15.769
(Laughter)

00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:18.597
Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that?

00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:21.574
So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators --

00:05:21.598 --> 00:05:22.646
what's that?

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.916
Does yours go higher?

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.137
Volunteer: I don't know.

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:29.363
AB: Oh, yours does?

00:05:29.387 --> 00:05:32.295
Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.976
In the meanwhile, let me conclude

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.001
the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier.

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:40.511
Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649.

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:42.976
Would you each enter
that on your calculator?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.976
And instead of squaring it this time,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.191
I want you to take
that number and multiply it

00:05:47.215 --> 00:05:49.976
by any three-digit number that you want,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.239
but don't tell me
what you're multiplying by --

00:05:52.263 --> 00:05:55.542
just multiply it by any random
three-digit number.

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:57.617
So you should have as an answer either

00:05:57.641 --> 00:06:00.669
a six-digit or probably
a seven-digit number.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.743
How many digits do you have, six or seven?

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:04.021
Seven, and yours?

00:06:04.045 --> 00:06:05.765
Seven? Seven?

00:06:07.862 --> 00:06:08.976
And, uncertain.

00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:10.636
Seven.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.716
Is there any possible way
that I could know

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.416
what seven-digit numbers you have?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.441
Say "No."

00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:16.780
(Laughter)

00:06:16.804 --> 00:06:18.901
Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible --

00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:20.976
or at least the improbable.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.524
What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me

00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:26.560
any six of your seven digits,
any six of them,

00:06:26.584 --> 00:06:28.707
in any order you'd like.

00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:30.063
(Laughter)

00:06:30.087 --> 00:06:31.510
One digit at a time,

00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:34.952
I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out.

00:06:34.976 --> 00:06:36.848
Starting with your seven-digit number,

00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:38.546
call out any six of them please.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.921
Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.635
AB: Did you leave out the number 6?

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:46.976
Good, OK, that's one.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.976
You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.071
Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5.

00:06:53.373 --> 00:06:57.764
I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 --

00:06:57.788 --> 00:06:59.297
did you leave out the number 6?

00:06:59.321 --> 00:07:00.411
Same as she did, OK.

00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:02.063
You've got a seven-digit number --

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:04.097
call out any six of them loud and clear.

00:07:04.544 --> 00:07:08.236
Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.976
I think you left out the number 3?

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:11.941
AB: That's three.

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:15.127
The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:17.650
would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power.

00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:19.239
OK, any six of them.

00:07:19.263 --> 00:07:20.317
(Laughter)

00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:22.396
Really scramble them up this time, please.

00:07:22.634 --> 00:07:25.976
Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.794
Did you leave out the number 7?

00:07:27.818 --> 00:07:31.038
And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause.

00:07:31.062 --> 00:07:32.596
Thank you very much.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.294
(Applause)

00:07:38.162 --> 00:07:39.797
(Applause ends)

00:07:40.853 --> 00:07:41.976
For my next number --

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.948
(Laughter)

00:07:44.972 --> 00:07:47.836
while I mentally recharge my batteries,

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.508
I have one more question for the audience.

00:07:50.532 --> 00:07:54.976
By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.334
the day of the week
that they were born on?

00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:02.278
If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand.

00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:05.492
Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first.

00:08:05.516 --> 00:08:07.167
What year was it, first of all?

00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:08.976
That's why I pick a gentleman first.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.063
Audience: 1953.

00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:11.976
1953, and the month?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.230
November what?

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.910
23rd -- was that a Monday?

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:16.935
Audience: Yes.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.340
Good. Somebody else?

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:20.181
I haven't seen any women's hands up.

00:08:20.205 --> 00:08:21.976
OK, how about you, what year?

00:08:22.744 --> 00:08:23.976
1949, and the month?

00:08:24.586 --> 00:08:25.976
October what?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.706
Fifth -- was that a Wednesday?

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.254
Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you?

00:08:30.278 --> 00:08:31.471
Yell it out, what year?

00:08:31.495 --> 00:08:32.583
Audience: 1959.

00:08:32.607 --> 00:08:35.371
1959, OK -- and the month?

00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:36.490
Audience: February.

00:08:36.514 --> 00:08:37.921
February what?

00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:39.976
Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.229
Good, how about the person behind her?

00:08:42.253 --> 00:08:43.976
Call out, what year was it?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.666
Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month?

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.110
Audience: May.
AB: May what?

00:08:48.134 --> 00:08:50.205
Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday?

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:52.555
Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much.

00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:57.583
(Applause)

00:08:57.607 --> 00:09:00.781
Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born?

00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:01.949
We can do it that way.

00:09:01.973 --> 00:09:04.983
Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know,

00:09:05.007 --> 00:09:06.348
so I come prepared for that.

00:09:06.372 --> 00:09:08.975
I brought with me a book of calendars.

00:09:09.554 --> 00:09:13.799
It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know.

00:09:13.823 --> 00:09:15.350
(Laughter)

00:09:15.374 --> 00:09:18.491
I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there.

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:19.589
(Laughter)

00:09:19.613 --> 00:09:22.565
Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind.

00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:24.460
This is a book of calendars.

00:09:24.484 --> 00:09:26.276
Who wanted to know their birth day?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.976
What year was it, first of all?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.031
Audience: 1966.

00:09:29.055 --> 00:09:31.745
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:33.293
And what month?

00:09:33.317 --> 00:09:34.952
Audience: April.
AB: April what?

00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:35.997
Audience: 17th.

00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:38.325
I believe that was a Sunday.

00:09:38.349 --> 00:09:39.754
Can you confirm, Chris?

00:09:40.883 --> 00:09:41.933
Chris Anderson: Yes.

00:09:41.957 --> 00:09:43.475
AB: I'll tell you what, Chris:

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:45.688
as long as you have
that book in front of you,

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:48.976
do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.837
either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s --

00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:53.893
that'll be a much greater
challenge for me.

00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:55.976
AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.205
AB: 1824, OK.

00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:00.666
AB: And what month?

00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:01.904
CA: June.

00:10:01.928 --> 00:10:03.176
AB: June what?
CA: Sixth.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.360
AB: Was that a Sunday?

00:10:05.584 --> 00:10:07.458
CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:08.791
(Laughter)

00:10:08.815 --> 00:10:10.521
Good, thank you very much.

00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:12.419
(Applause)

00:10:15.138 --> 00:10:16.647
(Applause ends)

00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:18.295
But I'd like to wrap things up now

00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:22.976
by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.323
There was a gentleman up here
who had a 10-digit calculator.

00:10:26.347 --> 00:10:29.149
Where is he, would you stand up,

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:30.788
10-digit guy?

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.976
OK, stand up for me just for a second,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.604
so I can see where you are.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.130
You have a 10-digit calculator,
sir, as well?

00:10:40.154 --> 00:10:43.684
OK, what I'm going to try
and do, is to square in my head

00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:47.088
a five-digit number requiring
a 10-digit calculator.

00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:51.976
But to make my job more interesting
for you, as well as for me,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.872
I'm going to do this problem
thinking out loud.

00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:58.761
So you can actually, honestly hear

00:10:58.785 --> 00:11:03.503
what's going on in my mind
while I do a calculation of this size.

00:11:03.527 --> 00:11:06.807
Now, I have to apologize
to our magician friend Lennart Green.

00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:09.903
I know as a magician we're not supposed
to reveal our secrets,

00:11:09.927 --> 00:11:11.189
but I'm not too afraid

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:14.096
that people are going to start
doing my show next week, so --

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.683
I think we're OK.

00:11:15.707 --> 00:11:16.853
(Laughter)

00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:18.133
(Applause)

00:11:18.157 --> 00:11:20.808
So, let's see,

00:11:20.832 --> 00:11:23.775
let's take a different row of people,
starting with you.

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:25.976
I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.318
Oh, I did this row already.

00:11:27.342 --> 00:11:28.761
Let's do the row before you,

00:11:28.785 --> 00:11:31.054
starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five.

00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:32.389
Call out a single digit --

00:11:32.413 --> 00:11:36.394
that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead.

00:11:37.236 --> 00:11:38.244
Five.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:39.849
Seven.

00:11:39.873 --> 00:11:40.950
Six.

00:11:40.974 --> 00:11:41.976
Eight.

00:11:42.476 --> 00:11:43.514
Three.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.555
57,683 --

00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:49.668
squared.

00:11:49.692 --> 00:11:50.692
Yuck.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:55.424
Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.870
I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts.

00:11:58.894 --> 00:12:01.542
I'll do 57,000 squared,

00:12:01.566 --> 00:12:04.976
plus 683 squared,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.761
plus 57,000 times 683 times two.

00:12:10.483 --> 00:12:12.577
Add all those numbers together,

00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:15.382
and with any luck, arrive at the answer.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.449
Now, let me recap.

00:12:17.846 --> 00:12:19.316
(Laughter)

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.475
Thank you.

00:12:20.499 --> 00:12:22.372
(Laughter)

00:12:22.396 --> 00:12:24.269
While I explain something else --

00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:25.523
(Laughter)

00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:27.658
-- I know, that you can use, right?

00:12:27.682 --> 00:12:28.687
(Laughter)

00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:30.458
While I do these calculations,

00:12:30.482 --> 00:12:32.961
you might hear certain words,

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.976
as opposed to numbers,
creep into the calculation.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.398
Let me explain what that is.

00:12:37.422 --> 00:12:39.504
This is a phonetic code,

00:12:39.528 --> 00:12:41.604
a mnemonic device that I use,

00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:44.438
that allows me to convert
numbers into words.

00:12:44.462 --> 00:12:47.604
I store them as words, and later on
retrieve them as numbers.

00:12:47.628 --> 00:12:49.589
I know it sounds complicated; it's not.

00:12:49.613 --> 00:12:52.945
I don't want you to think you're seeing
something out of "Rain Man."

00:12:52.969 --> 00:12:54.016
(Laughter)

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.096
There's definitely
a method to my madness --

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.348
definitely, definitely.

00:12:57.372 --> 00:12:58.373
Sorry.

00:12:58.397 --> 00:13:01.976
(Laughter)

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.245
If you want to talk to me
about ADHD afterwards,

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:05.976
you can talk to me then.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.380
By the way, one last instruction,

00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:10.756
for my judges with the calculators --

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.922
you know who you are --

00:13:11.946 --> 00:13:16.976
there is at least a 50 percent chance
that I will make a mistake here.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.428
If I do, don't tell me
what the mistake is;

00:13:20.452 --> 00:13:22.784
just say, "you're close,"
or something like that,

00:13:22.808 --> 00:13:24.784
and I'll try and figure out the answer --

00:13:24.808 --> 00:13:26.976
which could be pretty
entertaining in itself.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.976
If, however, I am right,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.976
whatever you do,
don't keep it to yourself, OK?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.206
(Laughter)

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.444
Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right,

00:13:36.468 --> 00:13:38.154
because this is my big finish, OK.

00:13:38.178 --> 00:13:41.368
So, without any more stalling,

00:13:41.392 --> 00:13:44.343
here we go.

00:13:44.367 --> 00:13:47.057
I'll start the problem
in the middle, with 57 times 683.

00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:50.223
57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876,

00:13:50.247 --> 00:13:52.517
that's 38,760 plus 171,

00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:55.366
38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.976
38,931; double that to get 77,862.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.976
77,862 becomes cookie fission,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.976
cookie fission is 77,822.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.334
That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK.

00:14:07.358 --> 00:14:11.604
Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say,

00:14:11.628 --> 00:14:13.358
three billion.

00:14:13.382 --> 00:14:15.976
Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.976
oops, but I see a carry coming --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.976
249 --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.976
add that to cookie, 250 plus 77,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.976
is 327 million --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.983
fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared,

00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:31.342
that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared

00:14:31.366 --> 00:14:33.976
is 466,489, rev up if I need it,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.381
rev up, take the 466,

00:14:36.405 --> 00:14:39.532
add that to fission, to get,

00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:41.564
oh gee --

00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:45.976
328,489.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.976
Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.356
Thank you very much.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.976
(Applause)

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.489
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics.

00:14:52.513 --> 00:14:53.514
Thank you.

00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:56.391
(Applause)
