00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.769
So it's 2006.

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.899
My friend Harold Ford calls me.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.564
He's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee,

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:13.151
and he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?"

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:15.130
So I had an idea. I called a friend

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.282
who was in New York

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.671
at one of the most successful
media companies in the world,

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:21.757
and she said, "Why don't we host

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:24.003
an editorial board lunch for Harold?

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.598
You come with him."

00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:27.343
Harold and I arrive in New York.

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:29.358
We are in our best suits.

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:31.573
We look like shiny new pennies.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.094
And we get to the receptionist, and we say,

00:00:34.094 --> 00:00:35.474
"We're here for the lunch."

00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:37.678
She motions for us to follow her.

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:40.120
We walk through a series of corridors,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.374
and all of a sudden we find ourselves

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.040
in a stark room,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.130
at which point she looks at us and she says,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.415
"Where are your uniforms?"

00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:51.661
Just as this happens,

00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:53.990
my friend rushes in.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.438
The blood drains from her face.

00:00:56.438 --> 00:00:58.820
There are literally no words, right?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.839
And I look at her, and I say,

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.729
"Now, don't you think we need

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.800
more than one black person in the U.S. Senate?"

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.828
Now Harold and I --

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:10.346
(Applause) â€”

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:13.435
we still laugh about that story,

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:16.871
and in many ways, the moment caught me off guard,

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:19.891
but deep, deep down inside,

00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:22.015
I actually wasn't surprised.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.438
And I wasn't surprised because of something

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.574
my mother taught me about 30 years before.

00:01:26.574 --> 00:01:29.989
You see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.981
I remember one day coming
home from a birthday party

00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:33.820
where I was the only black kid invited,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.497
and instead of asking me the
normal motherly questions

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:39.481
like, "Did you have fun?" or "How was the cake?"

00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:41.658
my mother looked at me and she said,

00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:43.890
"How did they treat you?"

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.657
I was seven. I did not understand.

00:01:46.657 --> 00:01:49.940
I mean, why would anyone treat me differently?

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.065
But she knew.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:53.737
And she looked me right in the eye and she said,

00:01:53.737 --> 00:01:56.912
"They will not always treat you well."

00:01:56.912 --> 00:01:59.258
Now, race is one of those topics in America

00:01:59.258 --> 00:02:02.736
that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable.

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.390
You bring it up at a dinner party

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.035
or in a workplace environment,

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:09.215
it is literally the conversational equivalent

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:11.090
of touching the third rail.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.265
There is shock,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.230
followed by a long silence.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.884
And even coming here today,

00:02:16.884 --> 00:02:18.035
I told some friends and colleagues

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:19.601
that I planned to talk about race,

00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:22.260
and they warned me, they told me, don't do it,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.147
that there'd be huge risks

00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:25.677
in me talking about this topic,

00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:28.168
that people might think I'm a militant black woman

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:30.352
and I would ruin my career.

00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:31.643
And I have to tell you,

00:02:31.643 --> 00:02:34.100
I actually for a moment was a bit afraid.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.170
Then I realized,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.649
the first step to solving any problem

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:40.440
is to not hide from it,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.422
and the first step to any form of action

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.477
is awareness.

00:02:46.477 --> 00:02:49.917
And so I decided to actually talk about race.

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:52.790
And I decided that if I came
here and shared with you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.974
some of my experiences,

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:57.662
that maybe we could all be a little less anxious

00:02:57.662 --> 00:02:59.208
and a little more bold

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:02.110
in our conversations about race.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.100
Now I know there are people out there who will say

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.726
that the election of Barack Obama meant

00:03:05.726 --> 00:03:08.525
that it was the end of racial discrimination

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:10.547
for all eternity, right?

00:03:10.547 --> 00:03:12.190
But I work in the investment business,

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.650
and we have a saying:

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.705
The numbers do not lie.

00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:18.319
And here, there are significant,

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.040
quantifiable racial disparities

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.559
that cannot be ignored,

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.142
in household wealth, household income,

00:03:26.142 --> 00:03:29.141
job opportunities, healthcare.

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.628
One example from corporate America:

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.633
Even though white men

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:37.424
make up just 30 percent of the U.S. population,

00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:41.823
they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats.

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:44.101
Of the Fortune 250,

00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:47.944
there are only seven CEOs that are minorities,

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:52.210
and of the thousands of publicly
traded companies today, thousands,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.036
only two are chaired by black women,

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:56.841
and you're looking at one of them,

00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:58.993
the same one who, not too long ago,

00:03:58.993 --> 00:04:01.850
was nearly mistaken for kitchen help.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.024
So that is a fact.

00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:05.212
Now I have this thought experiment

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.739
that I play with myself, when I say,

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.998
imagine if I walked you into a room

00:04:09.998 --> 00:04:13.257
and it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil,

00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:16.867
and every single person around
the boardroom were black,

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:19.400
you would think that were weird.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.204
But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company,

00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:24.327
and everyone around the table is a white male,

00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:27.426
when will it be that we think that's weird too?

00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:29.140
And I know how we got here.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.303
(Applause)

00:04:33.303 --> 00:04:35.071
I know how we got here.

00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:37.757
You know, there was institutionalized,

00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:40.866
at one time legalized, discrimination in our country.

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:43.160
There's no question about it.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.985
But still, as I grapple with this issue,

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:48.510
my mother's question hangs in the air for me:

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.593
How did they treat you?

00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:53.069
Now, I do not raise this issue to complain

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.315
or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy.

00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:57.298
I have succeeded in my life

00:04:57.298 --> 00:05:00.140
beyond my wildest expectations,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.105
and I have been treated well by people of all races

00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:05.341
more often than I have not.

00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:08.154
I tell the uniform story because it happened.

00:05:08.154 --> 00:05:10.774
I cite those statistics around
corporate board diversity

00:05:10.774 --> 00:05:12.438
because they are real,

00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:14.102
and I stand here today

00:05:14.102 --> 00:05:16.692
talking about this issue of racial discrimination

00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:19.187
because I believe it threatens to rob

00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:22.473
another generation of all the opportunities

00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:25.058
that all of us want for all of our children,

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.821
no matter what their color

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:28.620
or where they come from.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.198
And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.999
You see, researchers have coined this term

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:36.834
"color blindness"

00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:39.509
to describe a learned behavior where we pretend

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.354
that we don't notice race.

00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:43.514
If you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people

00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:47.290
who look like you, that's purely accidental.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.390
Now, color blindness, in my view,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.248
doesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination,

00:05:52.248 --> 00:05:53.943
and there's fairness.

00:05:53.943 --> 00:05:56.090
It doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.488
In my view, color blindness is very dangerous

00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:01.245
because it means we're ignoring the problem.

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:03.775
There was a corporate study that said that,

00:06:03.775 --> 00:06:05.552
instead of avoiding race,

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:09.524
the really smart corporations
actually deal with it head on.

00:06:09.524 --> 00:06:12.308
They actually recognize that embracing diversity

00:06:12.308 --> 00:06:15.307
means recognizing all races,

00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:17.669
including the majority one.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.465
But I'll be the first one to tell you,

00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:22.306
this subject matter can be hard,

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:26.358
awkward, uncomfortable -- but that's kind of the point.

00:06:26.358 --> 00:06:29.380
In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes,

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.555
the one that black people don't like to swim,

00:06:31.555 --> 00:06:34.785
I'm going to tell you how much I love to swim.

00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:37.072
I love to swim so much

00:06:37.072 --> 00:06:39.204
that as an adult, I swim with a coach.

00:06:39.204 --> 00:06:42.041
And one day my coach had me do a drill

00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:44.652
where I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool

00:06:44.652 --> 00:06:46.540
without taking a breath.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.681
And every single time I failed,

00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:50.018
I had to start over.

00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:51.531
And I failed a lot.

00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:53.398
By the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool,

00:06:53.398 --> 00:06:56.021
I was exasperated and tired and annoyed,

00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:59.959
and I said, "Why are we doing
breath-holding exercises?"

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:02.125
And my coach looked me
at me, and he said, "Mellody,

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:05.116
that was not a breath-holding exercise.

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:07.465
That drill was to make you comfortable

00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:09.258
being uncomfortable,

00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:12.389
because that's how most of us spend our days."

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:14.655
If we can learn to deal with our discomfort,

00:07:14.655 --> 00:07:16.689
and just relax into it,

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.913
we'll have a better life.

00:07:18.913 --> 00:07:21.466
So I think it's time for us to be comfortable

00:07:21.466 --> 00:07:24.712
with the uncomfortable conversation about race:

00:07:24.712 --> 00:07:27.388
black, white, Asian, Hispanic,

00:07:27.388 --> 00:07:29.661
male, female, all of us,

00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:31.937
if we truly believe in equal rights

00:07:31.937 --> 00:07:33.948
and equal opportunity in America,

00:07:33.948 --> 00:07:36.951
I think we have to have real conversations

00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:38.203
about this issue.

00:07:38.203 --> 00:07:40.975
We cannot afford to be color blind.

00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:44.222
We have to be color brave.

00:07:44.222 --> 00:07:48.260
We have to be willing, as teachers and parents

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.090
and entrepreneurs and scientists,

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.373
we have to be willing to have

00:07:51.373 --> 00:07:54.210
proactive conversations about race

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.349
with honesty and understanding and courage,

00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:00.888
not because it's the right thing to do,

00:08:00.888 --> 00:08:03.161
but because it's the smart thing to do,

00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:05.544
because our businesses and our products

00:08:05.544 --> 00:08:07.598
and our science, our research,

00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:11.235
all of that will be better with greater diversity.

00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:14.190
Now, my favorite example of color bravery

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.648
is a guy named John Skipper.

00:08:15.648 --> 00:08:17.500
He runs ESPN.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.830
He's a North Carolina native,

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.877
quintessential Southern gentleman, white.

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.288
He joined ESPN, which already had a culture

00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:28.061
of inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch.

00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:30.649
He demanded that every open position

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.599
have a diverse slate of candidates.

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:35.398
Now he says the senior people

00:08:35.398 --> 00:08:37.210
in the beginning bristled,

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.260
and they would come to him and say,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.868
"Do you want me to hire the minority,

00:08:41.868 --> 00:08:45.486
or do you want me to hire
the best person for the job?"

00:08:45.486 --> 00:08:49.145
And Skipper says his answers were always the same:

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:50.820
"Yes."

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.630
And by saying yes to diversity,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.992
I honestly believe that ESPN

00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:57.482
is the most valuable cable franchise in the world.

00:08:57.482 --> 00:08:59.928
I think that's a part of the secret sauce.

00:08:59.928 --> 00:09:01.970
Now I can tell you, in my own industry,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.145
at Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversity

00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:06.305
as a competitive advantage,

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:09.626
and that advantage can extend
way beyond business.

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:11.810
There's a guy named Scott Page
at the University of Michigan.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.539
He is the first person to develop

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:16.579
a mathematical calculation for diversity.

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:18.870
He says, if you're trying to
solve a really hard problem,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.031
really hard,

00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:22.860
that you should have a diverse group of people,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.870
including those with diverse intellects.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.723
The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic.

00:09:28.723 --> 00:09:31.648
When it was ravaging Europe,

00:09:31.648 --> 00:09:33.028
they brought together all these scientists,

00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:34.490
and they were stumped.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.582
And the beginnings of the cure to the disease

00:09:37.582 --> 00:09:39.775
came from the most unlikely source,

00:09:39.775 --> 00:09:44.155
a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids

00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:46.064
were not getting smallpox.

00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:49.418
And the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based

00:09:49.418 --> 00:09:51.820
because of that dairy farmer.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.232
Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying,

00:09:54.232 --> 00:09:56.327
I don't run a cable company,

00:09:56.327 --> 00:09:58.449
I don't run an investment firm,

00:09:58.449 --> 00:09:59.900
I am not a dairy farmer.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.350
What can I do?

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.866
And I'm telling you, you can be color brave.

00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:06.750
If you're part of a hiring process

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.390
or an admissions process,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.057
you can be color brave.

00:10:10.057 --> 00:10:12.901
If you are trying to solve a really hard problem,

00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:15.680
you can speak up and be color brave.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.929
Now I know people will say,

00:10:18.929 --> 00:10:21.079
but that doesn't add up to a lot,

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:24.050
but I'm actually asking you
to do something really simple:

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.268
observe your environment,

00:10:26.268 --> 00:10:30.070
at work, at school, at home.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.429
I'm asking you to look at the people around you

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:35.050
purposefully and intentionally.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.493
Invite people into your life

00:10:36.493 --> 00:10:39.329
who don't look like you, don't think like you,

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:40.624
don't act like you,

00:10:40.624 --> 00:10:42.585
don't come from where you come from,

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:45.235
and you might find that they
will challenge your assumptions

00:10:45.235 --> 00:10:46.991
and make you grow as a person.

00:10:46.991 --> 00:10:49.331
You might get powerful new insights

00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:50.954
from these individuals,

00:10:50.954 --> 00:10:54.140
or, like my husband, who happens to be white,

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.210
you might learn that black people,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.767
men, women, children,

00:10:57.767 --> 00:11:00.656
we use body lotion every single day.

00:11:00.656 --> 00:11:05.278
Now, I also think that this is very important

00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:08.250
so that the next generation really understands

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.760
that this progress will help them,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.894
because they're expecting
us to be great role models.

00:11:12.894 --> 00:11:14.371
Now, I told you, my mother,

00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:15.942
she was ruthlessly realistic.

00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:19.182
She was an unbelievable role model.

00:11:19.182 --> 00:11:20.313
She was the kind of person

00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:21.635
who got to be the way she was

00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:23.611
because she was a single mom

00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:25.283
with six kids in Chicago.

00:11:25.283 --> 00:11:27.075
She was in the real estate business,

00:11:27.075 --> 00:11:29.825
where she worked extraordinarily hard

00:11:29.825 --> 00:11:33.093
but oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet.

00:11:33.093 --> 00:11:34.940
And that meant sometimes we got

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.320
our phone disconnected,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.188
or our lights turned off,

00:11:37.188 --> 00:11:39.129
or we got evicted.

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:40.670
When we got evicted, sometimes we lived

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.476
in these small apartments that she owned,

00:11:42.476 --> 00:11:44.075
sometimes in only one or two rooms,

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:45.832
because they weren't completed,

00:11:45.832 --> 00:11:50.543
and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.055
But she never gave up hope, ever,

00:11:53.055 --> 00:11:55.735
and she never allowed us to give up hope either.

00:11:55.735 --> 00:11:57.312
This brutal pragmatism that she had,

00:11:57.312 --> 00:11:59.106
I mean, I was four and she told me,

00:11:59.106 --> 00:12:01.429
"Mommy is Santa." (Laughter)

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.912
She was this brutal pragmatism.

00:12:03.912 --> 00:12:06.285
She taught me so many lessons,

00:12:06.285 --> 00:12:08.118
but the most important lesson

00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:11.344
was that every single day she told me,

00:12:11.344 --> 00:12:16.680
"Mellody, you can be anything."

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.538
And because of those words,

00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:20.643
I would wake up at the crack of dawn,

00:12:20.643 --> 00:12:22.459
and because of those words,

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:25.471
I would love school more than anything,

00:12:25.471 --> 00:12:27.404
and because of those words, when I was on a bus

00:12:27.404 --> 00:12:30.657
going to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams.

00:12:30.657 --> 00:12:33.760
And it's because of those words
that I stand here right now

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.716
full of passion,

00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:38.124
asking you to be brave for the kids

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.434
who are dreaming those dreams today.

00:12:40.434 --> 00:12:45.855
(Applause)

00:12:45.855 --> 00:12:50.044
You see, I want them to look at a CEO on television

00:12:50.044 --> 00:12:52.231
and say, "I can be like her,"

00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:54.738
or, "He looks like me."

00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:56.479
And I want them to know

00:12:56.479 --> 00:12:58.174
that anything is possible,

00:12:58.174 --> 00:12:59.690
that they can achieve the highest level

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.444
that they ever imagined,

00:13:01.444 --> 00:13:04.539
that they will be welcome
in any corporate boardroom,

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:07.430
or they can lead any company.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.368
You see this idea of being the land

00:13:09.368 --> 00:13:11.042
of the free and the home of the brave,

00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:14.490
it's woven into the fabric of America.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.498
America, when we have a challenge,

00:13:16.498 --> 00:13:19.374
we take it head on, we don't shrink away from it.

00:13:19.374 --> 00:13:22.233
We take a stand. We show courage.

00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:24.242
So right now, what I'm asking you to do,

00:13:24.242 --> 00:13:26.220
I'm asking you to show courage.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.488
I'm asking you to be bold.

00:13:28.488 --> 00:13:30.309
As business leaders, I'm asking you

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.512
not to leave anything on the table.

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:36.552
As citizens, I'm asking you
not to leave any child behind.

00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:39.007
I'm asking you not to be color blind,

00:13:39.007 --> 00:13:41.110
but to be color brave,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.267
so that every child knows that their future matters

00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:45.899
and their dreams are possible.

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:48.429
Thank you.

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:53.917
(Applause)

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:57.868
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. (Applause)
