WEBVTT

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.749
Let me introduce you to

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:04.652
something I've been working on.

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:06.463
It's what the Victorian illusionists

00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:10.909
would have described as a mechanical marvel,

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:12.392
an automaton,

00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:14.355
a thinking machine.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:16.605
Say hello to EDI.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.972
Now he's asleep. Let's wake him up.

00:00:18.972 --> 00:00:22.943
EDI, EDI.

00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:25.820
These mechanical performers were popular

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.280
throughout Europe.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.980
Audiences marveled at the way they moved.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.555
It was science fiction made true,

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:36.373
robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age,

00:00:36.373 --> 00:00:38.937
machines far in advance of anything

00:00:38.937 --> 00:00:41.508
that Victorian technology could create,

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.483
a machine we would later know

00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:46.171
as the robot.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.757
EDI: Robot. A word coined in 1921

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:51.605
in a science fiction tale

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:54.148
by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek.

00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:56.260
It comes from "robota."

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.613
It means "forced labor."

00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:02.342
Marco Tempest: But these robots were not real.

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:04.024
They were not intelligent.

00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:06.290
They were illusions,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.794
a clever combination of mechanical engineering

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:12.537
and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.

00:01:12.537 --> 00:01:14.512
EDI is different.

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:16.106
EDI is real.

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:18.156
EDI: I am 176 centimeters tall.

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:20.076
MT: He weighs 300 pounds.

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:22.718
EDI: I have two seven-axis arms —

00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:24.101
MT: Core of sensing —

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:27.159
EDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system,

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.581
and come complete with a warranty.

00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.120
MT: We love robots.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.634
EDI: Hi. I'm EDI. Will you be my friend?

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:36.880
MT: We are intrigued by the possibility

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.162
of creating a mechanical version of ourselves.

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.897
We build them so they look like us,

00:01:42.897 --> 00:01:46.138
behave like us, and think like us.

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:48.962
The perfect robot will be indistinguishable

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.897
from the human,

00:01:50.897 --> 00:01:52.956
and that scares us.

00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:54.661
In the first story about robots,

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.535
they turn against their creators.

00:01:57.535 --> 00:01:59.800
It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.855
EDI: Ha ha ha. Now you are the slaves

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.751
and we robots, the masters.

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:08.716
Your world is ours. You —

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:12.109
MT: As I was saying,

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.940
besides the faces and bodies we give our robots,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.268
we cannot read their intentions,

00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:19.316
and that makes us nervous.

00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:21.420
When someone hands an object to you,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.130
you can read intention in their eyes, their face,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.529
their body language.

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.809
That's not true of the robot.

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.856
Now, this goes both ways.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.485
EDI: Wow!

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.540
MT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.105
EDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable,

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:41.071
not to mention irrational.

00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.828
I literally have no idea

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:44.864
what you guys are going to do next, you know,

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.459
but it scares me.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.296
MT: Which is why humans and robots find it difficult

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:51.271
to work in close proximity.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.578
Accidents are inevitable.

00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:54.330
EDI: Ow! That hurt.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.717
MT: Sorry. Now, one way of persuading humans

00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:58.618
that robots are safe

00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:01.391
is to create the illusion of trust.

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.164
Much as the Victorians

00:03:03.164 --> 00:03:05.533
faked their mechanical marvels,

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:08.010
we can add a layer of deception

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.243
to help us feel more comfortable

00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:12.247
with our robotic friends.

00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:15.789
With that in mind, I set about teaching EDI

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:17.633
a magic trick.

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:21.066
Ready, EDI?
EDI: Uh, ready, Marco.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.142
Abracadabra.

00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:24.518
MT: Abracadabra?

00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:27.560
EDI: Yeah. It's all part of the illusion, Marco.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.228
Come on, keep up.

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:31.107
MT: Magic creates the illusion of

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:33.581
an impossible reality.

00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:35.518
Technology

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:39.771
can do the same.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.547
Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence,

00:03:44.547 --> 00:03:47.404
spoke about creating the illusion

00:03:47.404 --> 00:03:51.630
that a machine could think.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.454
EDI: A computer would deserve

00:03:53.454 --> 00:03:55.324
to be called intelligent

00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:58.230
if it deceived a human into believing

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.883
it was human.

00:03:59.883 --> 00:04:01.312
MT: In other words, if we do not yet have

00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:03.104
the technological solutions,

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:06.544
would illusions serve the same purpose?

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:08.556
To create the robotic illusion,

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:11.483
we've devised a set of ethical rules,

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:15.497
a code that all robots would live by.

00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:18.399
EDI: A robot may not harm humanity,

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.135
or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:24.388
Thank you, Isaac Asimov.

00:04:24.388 --> 00:04:26.364
MT: We anthropomorphize our machines.

00:04:26.364 --> 00:04:28.640
We give them a friendly face

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.716
and a reassuring voice.

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:31.926
EDI: I am EDI.

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:35.462
I became operational at TED in March 2014.

00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:37.289
MT: We let them entertain us.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.497
Most important, we make them indicate

00:04:39.497 --> 00:04:43.272
that they are aware of our presence.

00:04:43.272 --> 00:04:45.150
EDI: Marco, you're standing on my foot!

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.115
MT: Sorry. They'll be conscious of our fragile frame

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:51.055
and move aside if we got too close,

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:54.533
and they'll account for our unpredictability

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:57.122
and anticipate our actions.

00:04:57.122 --> 00:05:02.712
And now, under the spell of a technological illusion,

00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:04.848
we could ignore our fears

00:05:04.848 --> 00:05:07.588
and truly interact.

00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:13.631
(Music)

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:41.328
Thank you.

00:05:41.328 --> 00:05:43.610
EDI: Thank you!

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.520
(Applause)

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.241
(Music)

00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:53.570
MT: And that's it. Thank you very much,

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.841
and thank you, EDI.
EDI: Thank you, Marco.

00:05:56.841 --> 00:06:00.841
(Applause)
