00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:02.626
When I was a young officer, they told me

00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:04.894
to follow my instincts,

00:00:04.894 --> 00:00:07.150
to go with my gut,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.160
and what I've learned

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.544
is that often our instincts are wrong.

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:16.720
In the summer of 2010,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.059
there was a massive leak of classified documents

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.032
that came out of the Pentagon.

00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:24.848
It shocked the world,

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:26.423
it shook up the American government,

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:28.576
and it made people ask a lot of questions,

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:31.257
because the sheer amount of information

00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:34.832
that was let out, and the potential impacts,

00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:37.408
were significant.

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:41.430
And one of the first questions we asked ourselves

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.148
was why would a young soldier have access

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:47.080
to that much information?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.606
Why would we let sensitive things

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:53.764
be with a relatively young person?

00:00:53.764 --> 00:00:56.886
In the summer of 2003, I was assigned to command

00:00:56.886 --> 00:00:59.390
a special operations task force,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.530
and that task force was spread across the Mideast

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.118
to fight al Qaeda.

00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:06.115
Our main effort was inside Iraq,

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:08.082
and our specified mission

00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:09.936
was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:13.040
For almost five years I stayed there,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.850
and we focused on fighting a war

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.896
that was unconventional and it was difficult

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:21.736
and it was bloody

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:24.830
and it often claimed its highest price

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.904
among innocent people.

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:30.409
We did everything we could

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.318
to stop al Qaeda

00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:35.603
and the foreign fighters that
came in as suicide bombers

00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:40.718
and as accelerants to the violence.

00:01:40.718 --> 00:01:42.740
We honed our combat skills,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.576
we developed new equipment,

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:48.030
we parachuted, we helicoptered,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.488
we took small boats, we drove, and we walked

00:01:50.488 --> 00:01:53.498
to objectives night after night to stop

00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:58.850
the killing that this network was putting forward.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.390
We bled,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.879
we died,

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.730
and we killed to stop that organization

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.473
from the violence that they were putting

00:02:09.473 --> 00:02:13.702
largely against the Iraqi people.

00:02:13.702 --> 00:02:16.280
Now, we did what we knew,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.194
how we had grown up, and
one of the things that we knew,

00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:22.320
that was in our DNA, was secrecy.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.237
It was security. It was protecting information.

00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:27.050
It was the idea that information was the lifeblood

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.690
and it was what would protect and keep people safe.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.585
And we had a sense that,

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.596
as we operated within our organizations,

00:02:34.596 --> 00:02:36.514
it was important to keep information

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:38.825
in the silos within the organizations,

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.739
particularly only give information

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.931
to people had a demonstrated need to know.

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:50.570
But the question often came, who needed to know?

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.933
Who needed, who had to have the information

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:57.004
so that they could do the important 
parts of the job that you needed?

00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.056
And in a tightly coupled world,

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:01.854
that's very hard to predict.

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:04.798
It's very hard to know who needs to have information

00:03:04.798 --> 00:03:06.305
and who doesn't.

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.284
I used to deal with intelligence agencies,

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:10.451
and I'd complain that they weren't
sharing enough intelligence,

00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.841
and with a straight face, they'd
look at me and they'd say,

00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:14.988
"What aren't you getting?" (Laughter)

00:03:14.988 --> 00:03:20.470
I said, "If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem."

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.072
But what we found is we had to change.

00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:24.249
We had to change our culture about information.

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.366
We had to knock down walls. We had to share.

00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:29.434
We had to change from who needs to know

00:03:29.434 --> 00:03:31.557
to the fact that who doesn't know,

00:03:31.557 --> 00:03:34.791
and we need to tell, and tell
them as quickly as we can.

00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:37.917
It was a significant culture shift for an organization

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:43.241
that had secrecy in its DNA.

00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.517
We started by doing things, by building,

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:47.222
not working in offices,

00:03:47.222 --> 00:03:48.887
knocking down walls, working in things we called

00:03:48.887 --> 00:03:51.345
situation awareness rooms,

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:53.821
and in the summer of 2007,

00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:55.444
something happened which demonstrated this.

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.636
We captured the personnel records

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.836
for the people who were bringing foreign fighters

00:03:59.836 --> 00:04:01.991
into Iraq.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.839
And when we got the personnel records, typically,

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:05.153
we would have hidden these,

00:04:05.153 --> 00:04:07.491
shared them with a few intelligence agencies,

00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:09.287
and then try to operate with them.

00:04:09.287 --> 00:04:11.325
But as I was talking to my intelligence officer,

00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:12.175
I said, "What do we do?"

00:04:12.175 --> 00:04:15.201
And he said, "Well, you found them." Our command.

00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:17.565
"You can just declassify them."

00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:19.213
And I said, "Well, can we declassify them?

00:04:19.213 --> 00:04:20.223
What if the enemy finds out?"

00:04:20.223 --> 00:04:22.835
And he says, "They're their personnel records."

00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:24.235
(Laughter)

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:25.317
So we did,

00:04:25.317 --> 00:04:27.351
and a lot of people got upset about that,

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:29.835
but as we passed that information around,

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:32.725
suddenly you find that information is only of value

00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:34.581
if you give it to people who have the ability

00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:36.719
to do something with it.

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.845
The fact that I know something has zero value

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.333
if I'm not the person who can actually

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.207
make something better because of it.

00:04:42.207 --> 00:04:44.083
So as a consequence, what we did was

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:47.193
we changed the idea of information,

00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:49.477
instead of knowledge is power,

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:52.423
to one where sharing is power.

00:04:52.423 --> 00:04:54.395
It was the fundamental shift,

00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:56.733
not new tactics, not new weapons,

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:58.037
not new anything else.

00:04:58.037 --> 00:05:00.815
It was the idea that we were now part of a team

00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:03.163
in which information became the essential link

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:07.661
between us, not a block between us.

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:10.243
And I want everybody to take a deep breath

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:12.365
and let it out,

00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:14.299
because in your life, there's going to be information

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:16.631
that leaks out you're not going to like.

00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.877
Somebody's going to get my college grades out,

00:05:18.877 --> 00:05:22.904
a that's going to be a disaster. (Laughter)

00:05:22.904 --> 00:05:26.273
But it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that

00:05:26.273 --> 00:05:29.493
I am more scared of the bureaucrat

00:05:29.493 --> 00:05:31.945
that holds information in a desk drawer

00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:34.741
or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks,

00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:37.677
because ultimately, we'll be better off if we share.

00:05:37.677 --> 00:05:39.437
Thank you.

00:05:39.437 --> 00:05:43.839
(Applause)

00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:47.337
Helen Walters: So I don't know if
you were here this morning,

00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:49.637
if you were able to catch Rick Ledgett,

00:05:49.637 --> 00:05:51.469
the deputy director of the NSA

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.133
who was responding to Edward
Snowden's talk earlier this week.

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:57.445
I just wonder, do you think the American government

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.133
should give Edward Snowden amnesty?

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.581
Stanley McChrystal: I think that
Rick said something very important.

00:06:02.581 --> 00:06:05.201
We, most people, don't know all the facts.

00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:06.553
I think there are two parts of this.

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:10.293
Edward Snowden shined a
light on an important need

00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:11.783
that people had to understand.

00:06:11.783 --> 00:06:14.765
He also took a lot of documents that he didn't have

00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:17.357
the knowledge to know the importance of,

00:06:17.357 --> 00:06:19.790
so I think we need to learn the facts about this case

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.337
before we make snap judgments

00:06:21.337 --> 00:06:23.485
about Edward Snowden.

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:25.669
HW: Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.587
(Applause)
