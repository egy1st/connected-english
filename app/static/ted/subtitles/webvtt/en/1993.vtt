WEBVTT

00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:03.391
So, I have a feature on my website where every week

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:05.391
people submit hypothetical questions

00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:06.979
for me to answer,

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:09.360
and I try to answer them using math, science

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.820
and comics.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.228
So for example, one person asked,

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:14.922
what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:17.328
pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:20.280
So I did some calculations.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.547
Now, normally, when an object flies through the air,

00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:24.021
the air will flow around the object,

00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:25.950
but in this case, the ball would be going so fast

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.401
that the air molecules wouldn't have time

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:29.020
to move out of the way.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.007
The ball would smash right into and through them,

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:33.668
and the collisions with these air molecules

00:00:33.668 --> 00:00:35.333
would knock away the nitrogen,

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.291
carbon and hydrogen from the ball,

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.128
fragmenting it off into tiny particles,

00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:41.612
and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:43.140
in the air around it.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.305
This would result in a flood of x-rays

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.056
that would spread out in a bubble

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:48.482
along with exotic particles,

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.602
plasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:55.144
and that would move away from the pitcher's mound

00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:57.629
slightly faster than the ball.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.311
Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:02.214
the home plate is far enough away

00:01:02.214 --> 00:01:04.120
that light hasn't had time to reach it,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.571
which means the batter

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:08.335
still sees the pitcher about to throw

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.352
and has no idea that anything is wrong.

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:12.624
(Laughter)

00:01:12.624 --> 00:01:15.050
Now, after 70 nanoseconds,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.504
the ball will reach home plate,

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:19.241
or at least the cloud of expanding plasma

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:21.370
that used to be the ball,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.135
and it will engulf the bat and the batter

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:28.596
and the plate and the catcher and the umpire

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:31.401
and start disintegrating them all

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.567
as it also starts to carry them backward

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:38.031
through the backstop, which
also starts to disintegrate.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.801
So if you were watching this whole thing

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.108
from a hill,

00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:44.481
ideally, far away,

00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:45.936
what you'd see is a bright flash of light

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:47.442
that would fade over a few seconds,

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:49.570
followed by a blast wave spreading out,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.030
shredding trees and houses

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.149
as it moves away from the stadium,

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.081
and then eventually a mushroom cloud

00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.842
rising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:01.998
So the Major League Baseball rules

00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:04.102
are a little bit hazy,

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:08.987
but — (Laughter) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09,

00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:10.596
I think that in this situation,

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:13.049
the batter would be considered hit by pitch

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.683
and would be eligible to take first base,

00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:18.886
if it still existed.

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:20.682
So this is the kind of question I answer,

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.821
and I get people writing in with

00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:24.695
a lot of other strange questions.

00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:27.242
I've had someone write and say,

00:02:27.242 --> 00:02:29.161
scientifically speaking, what is the best

00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:31.231
and fastest way to hide a body?

00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:33.453
Can you do this one soon?

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.313
And I had someone write in,

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:37.328
I've had people write in about,

00:02:37.328 --> 00:02:39.532
can you prove whether or not you can find love again

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:41.204
after your heart's broken?

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:42.979
And I've had people send in

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.970
what are clearly homework questions

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.113
they're trying to get me to do for them.

00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:51.018
But one week, a couple months ago,

00:02:51.018 --> 00:02:54.679
I got a question that was actually about Google.

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.645
If all digital data in the world
were stored on punch cards,

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.324
how big would Google's data warehouse be?

00:03:00.324 --> 00:03:03.046
Now, Google's pretty secretive
about their operations,

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:06.422
so no one really knows how much data Google has,

00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:08.937
and in fact, no one really knows
how many data centers Google has,

00:03:08.937 --> 00:03:11.428
except people at Google itself.

00:03:11.428 --> 00:03:12.662
And I've tried, I've met them a few times,

00:03:12.662 --> 00:03:17.885
tried asking them, and they
aren't revealing anything.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.420
So I decided to try to figure this out myself.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.579
There are a few things that I looked at here.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.485
I started with money.

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:26.627
Google has to reveal how much they spend,

00:03:26.627 --> 00:03:28.617
in general, and that lets you put some caps

00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:32.403
on how many data centers could they be building,

00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:34.703
because a big data center costs
a certain amount of money.

00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:37.135
And you can also then put a cap on

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:39.466
how much of the world hard
drive market are they taking up,

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:41.418
which turns out, it's pretty sizable.

00:03:41.418 --> 00:03:43.355
I read a calculation at one point,

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:44.820
I think Google has a drive failure

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.074
about every minute or two,

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:49.424
and they just throw out the hard drive

00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:50.810
and swap in a new one.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.010
So they go through a huge number of them.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.121
And so by looking at money,

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:56.970
you can get an idea of how
many of these centers they have.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.830
You can also look at power.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.727
You can look at how much electricity they need,

00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:04.534
because you need a certain amount
of electricity to run the servers,

00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:06.573
and Google is more efficient than most,

00:04:06.573 --> 00:04:09.670
but they still have some basic requirements,

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.586
and that lets you put a limit

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:13.533
on the number of servers that they have.

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:17.724
You can also look at square footage and see

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.000
of the data centers that you know,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.353
how big are they?

00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:21.275
How much room is that?

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.635
How many server racks could you fit in there?

00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:25.338
And for some data centers,

00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:27.327
you might get two of these pieces of information.

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:29.023
You know how much they spent,

00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:31.380
and they also, say, because they had to contract

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.799
with the local government

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:34.479
to get the power provided,

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.136
you might know what they made a deal to buy,

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:38.890
so you know how much power it takes.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.184
Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers,

00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:42.713
and figure out for a data center

00:04:42.713 --> 00:04:44.349
where you don't have that information,

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.441
you can figure out,

00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:47.628
but maybe you only have one of those,

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:49.307
you know the square footage,
then you could figure out

00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:51.630
well, maybe the power is proportional.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.950
And you can do this same thing
with a lot of different quantities,

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.026
you know, with guesses about
the total amount of storage,

00:04:56.026 --> 00:04:58.619
the number of servers, the
number of drives per server,

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.666
and in each case using what you know

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:04.193
to come up with a model that narrows down

00:05:04.193 --> 00:05:06.323
your guesses for the things that you don't know.

00:05:06.323 --> 00:05:08.588
It's sort of circling around the
number you're trying to get.

00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:11.143
And this is a lot of fun.

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:13.325
The math is not all that advanced,

00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:16.460
and really it's like nothing more than

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.472
solving a sudoku puzzle.

00:05:18.472 --> 00:05:23.781
So what I did, I went through all of this information,

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.540
spent a day or two researching.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.579
And there are some things I didn't look at.

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:30.622
You could always look at the Google

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.439
recruitment messages that they post.

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.377
That gives you an idea of where they have people.

00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:35.988
Sometimes, when people visit a data center,

00:05:35.988 --> 00:05:37.833
they'll take a cell-cam photo and post it,

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:39.323
and they aren't supposed to,

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:42.136
but you can learn things about
their hardware that way.

00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:44.689
And in fact, you can just
look at pizza delivery drivers.

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.344
Turns out, they know where all
the Google data centers are,

00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:50.220
at least the ones that have people in them.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.405
But I came up with my estimate,

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:54.269
which I felt pretty good about,

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:57.518
that was about 10 exabytes of data

00:05:57.518 --> 00:05:59.940
across all of Google's operations,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.372
and then another maybe five exabytes or so

00:06:03.372 --> 00:06:05.417
of offline storage in tape drives,

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:06.992
which it turns out Google is

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:09.502
about the world's largest consumer of.

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:13.063
So I came up with this estimate, and this is

00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:14.306
a staggering amount of data.

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:17.180
It's quite a bit more than any other organization

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.927
in the world has, as far as we know.

00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:20.673
There's a couple of other contenders,

00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:23.017
especially everyone always thinks of the NSA.

00:06:23.017 --> 00:06:24.446
But using some of these same methods,

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:26.469
we can look at the NSA's data centers,

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.951
and figure out, you know, we
don't know what's going on there,

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.041
but it's pretty clear that their operation

00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.638
is not the size of Google's.

00:06:32.638 --> 00:06:34.377
Adding all of this up, I came up with

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:36.273
the other thing that we can answer, which is,

00:06:36.273 --> 00:06:38.258
how many punch cards would this take?

00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:41.216
And so a punch card can hold

00:06:41.216 --> 00:06:43.207
about 80 characters,

00:06:43.207 --> 00:06:46.980
and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.254
and you put them in, say,

00:06:48.254 --> 00:06:50.206
my home region of New England,

00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:52.546
it would cover the entire region

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:56.020
up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.463
which is about three times deeper

00:06:57.463 --> 00:06:59.862
than the glaciers during the last ice age

00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:02.030
about 20,000 years ago.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.453
So this is impractical, but I think

00:07:04.453 --> 00:07:07.404
that's about the best answer I could come up with.

00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.542
And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:13.232
And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.863
because of course they've been so secretive,

00:07:14.863 --> 00:07:16.267
they didn't answer of my questions,

00:07:16.267 --> 00:07:17.774
and so I just put it up and said,

00:07:17.774 --> 00:07:19.297
well, I guess we'll never know.

00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:21.321
But then a little while later

00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:23.770
I got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.212
saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:30.013
So I go and get it, open it up,

00:07:30.013 --> 00:07:32.540
and it's punch cards. (Laughter)

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.622
Google-branded punch cards.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.870
And on these punch cards,
there are a bunch of holes,

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.171
and I said, thank you, thank you,

00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:41.690
okay, so what's on here?

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.320
So I get some software and start reading it,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.320
and scan them, and it turns out

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.689
it's a puzzle.

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:48.327
There's a bunch of code,

00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:49.581
and I get some friends to help,

00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.133
and we crack the code, and then
inside that is another code,

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:53.428
and then there are some equations,

00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:54.599
and then we solve those equations,

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:58.070
and then finally out pops a message from Google

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.259
which is their official answer to my article,

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:03.711
and it said, "No comment."

00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:09.885
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:14.292 --> 00:08:17.509
And I love calculating these kinds of things,

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:19.224
and it's not that I love doing the math.

00:08:19.224 --> 00:08:20.789
I do a lot of math,

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:23.865
but I don't really like math for its own sake.

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:25.815
What I love is that it lets you take

00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:27.215
some things that you know,

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:31.993
and just by moving symbols
around on a piece of paper,

00:08:31.993 --> 00:08:33.690
find out something that you didn't know

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.870
that's very surprising.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.546
And I have a lot of stupid questions,

00:08:37.546 --> 00:08:39.349
and I love that math gives the power

00:08:39.349 --> 00:08:42.106
to answer them sometimes.

00:08:42.106 --> 00:08:43.633
And sometimes not.

00:08:43.633 --> 00:08:46.557
This is a question I got from a reader,

00:08:46.557 --> 00:08:47.730
an anonymous reader,

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.775
and the subject line just said, "Urgent,"

00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:51.704
and this was the entire email:

00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:54.466
"If people had wheels and could fly,

00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:57.162
how would we differentiate them from airplanes?"

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.837
Urgent. (Laughter)

00:08:59.837 --> 00:09:03.190
And I think there are some questions

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.860
that math just cannot answer.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.331
Thank you.

00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:12.681
(Applause)
