WEBVTT

00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:02.177
I'm assuming everyone here has watched

00:00:02.177 --> 00:00:06.541
a TED Talk online at one time or another, right?

00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.643
So what I'm going to do is play this.

00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:11.494
This is the song from the TED Talks online.

00:00:11.494 --> 00:00:15.775
(Music)

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:19.540
And I'm going to slow it down

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.321
because things sound cooler when they're slower.

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:31.683
(Music)

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:10.348
Ken Robinson: Good morning. How are you?

00:01:10.348 --> 00:01:13.688
Mark Applebaum: I'm going to --
Kate Stone: -- mix some music.

00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:15.794
MA: I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story.

00:01:15.794 --> 00:01:18.905
Tod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before.

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:20.399
KS: I have a crossfader.

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.048
Julian Treasure: I call this the mixer.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.348
KS: Two D.J. decks.

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:27.081
Chris Anderson: You turn up the 
dials, the wheel starts to turn.

00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:32.953
Dan Ellsey: I have always loved music.

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:35.468
Michael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody 
or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?

00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:38.124
Daniel Wolpert: Feeling everything 
that's going on inside my body.

00:01:38.124 --> 00:01:44.002
Adam Ockelford: In your brain is 
this amazing musical computer.

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:52.147
MTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create 
works. It's a language that's still evolving.

00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:58.074
And the 21st century.

00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:00.712
KR: Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque.

00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:06.180
You will know what this person 
is doing: moving to the music.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.982
Mark Ronson: This is my favorite part.

00:02:17.982 --> 00:02:22.197
MA: You gotta have doorstops. That's important.

00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:23.884
TM: We all love music a great deal.

00:02:23.884 --> 00:02:27.044
MTT: Anthems, dance crazes, ballads and marches.

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:30.767
Kirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It 
is new music created from old music.

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:33.028
Ryan Holladay: Blend seamlessly.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.483
Kathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes.

00:02:34.483 --> 00:02:41.918
MTT: What happens when the music stops?

00:02:41.918 --> 00:02:45.684
KS: Yay!

00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:51.594
(Applause)

00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:56.124
MR: Obviously, I've been watching a lot of TED Talks.

00:02:56.124 --> 00:02:59.503
When I was first asked to speak at TED,

00:02:59.503 --> 00:03:01.516
I wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first,

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:04.468
so yeah, I immediately started
watching tons of TED Talks,

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:06.484
which is pretty much absolutely

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:08.323
the worst thing that you can do

00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:11.151
because you start to go into panic mode, thinking,

00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:14.652
I haven't mounted a successful
expedition to the North Pole yet.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:18.552
Neither have I provided electricity

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:21.149
to my village through sheer ingenuity.

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.969
In fact, I've pretty much wasted most of my life

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.266
DJing in night clubs

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:27.245
and producing pop records.

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:29.920
But I still kept watching the videos,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.551
because I'm a masochist,

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:34.623
and eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomas

00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:37.439
and Tod Machover, and seeing

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.606
their visceral passion talking about music,

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:41.433
it definitely stirred something in me,

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:43.778
and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:45.169
about the power of music.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.829
And I started to write down on these little note cards

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.172
every time I heard something

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:51.387
that struck a chord in me, pardon the pun,

00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:53.143
or something that I thought I could use,

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:57.810
and pretty soon, my studio looked like this,

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.573
kind of like a John Nash, "Beautiful Mind" vibe.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:04.368
The other good thing about watching TED Talks,

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:06.255
when you see a really good one,

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:08.188
you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker

00:04:08.188 --> 00:04:11.032
was your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day.

00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:13.027
They seem like a nice person.

00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:16.009
You'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream.

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.760
You'd certainly learn a lot.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.214
And every now and then they'd chide you,

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:21.950
when they got frustrated that you couldn't really

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.879
keep up with half of the technical things
they're banging on about all the time.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.348
But then they'd remember that
you're but a mere human

00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:28.830
of ordinary, mortal intelligence

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.229
that didn't finish university,

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.795
and they'd kind of forgive you,

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:35.390
and pet you like the dog.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.515
(Laughter)

00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:40.253
Man, yeah, back to the real world,

00:04:40.253 --> 00:04:41.780
probably Sir Ken Robinson and I

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.484
are not going to end up being best of friends.

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:46.917
He lives all the way in L.A.
and I imagine is quite busy,

00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:49.654
but through the tools available to me -- technology

00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:51.922
and the innate way that I approach making music --

00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:54.660
I can sort of bully our existences

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.971
into a shared event,

00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:58.537
which is sort of what you saw.

00:04:58.537 --> 00:05:01.546
I can hear something that I love in a piece of media

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:02.930
and I can co-opt it

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.266
and insert myself in that narrative,

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:08.238
or alter it, even.

00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:09.968
In a nutshell, that's what I was trying to do

00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:12.174
with these things, but more importantly,

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.564
that's what the past 30 years of music has been.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.252
That's the major thread.

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:18.975
See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers,

00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:20.460
and they changed everything overnight.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.125
All of a sudden, artists could sample

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:24.930
from anything and everything that came before them,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.125
from a snare drum from the Funky Meters,

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:28.939
to a Ron Carter bassline,

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.010
the theme to "The Price Is Right."

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.143
Albums like De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising"

00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:35.297
and the Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique"

00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:37.555
looted from decades of recorded music

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:40.604
to create these sonic, layered masterpieces

00:05:40.604 --> 00:05:42.856
that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day.

00:05:42.856 --> 00:05:45.503
And they weren't sampling these records

00:05:45.503 --> 00:05:48.312
because they were too lazy to write their own music.

00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:50.277
They weren't sampling these records to cash in on

00:05:50.277 --> 00:05:51.946
the familiarity of the original stuff.

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:53.503
To be honest, it was all about sampling

00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:55.044
really obscure things,

00:05:55.044 --> 00:05:56.532
except for a few obvious exceptions

00:05:56.532 --> 00:05:59.361
like Vanilla Ice and "doo doo doo da da doo doo"

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.770
that we know about.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.205
But the thing is,

00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:03.680
they were sampling those records

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.478
because they heard something in that music

00:06:05.478 --> 00:06:07.643
that spoke to them

00:06:07.643 --> 00:06:09.641
that they instantly wanted to inject themselves

00:06:09.641 --> 00:06:11.137
into the narrative of that music.

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.907
They heard it, they wanted to be a part of it,

00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:14.501
and all of a sudden they found themselves

00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:17.160
in possession of the technology to do so,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.351
not much unlike the way the Delta blues

00:06:19.351 --> 00:06:22.020
struck a chord with the Stones
and the Beatles and Clapton,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.310
and they felt the need to co-opt that music

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.070
for the tools of their day.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.702
You know, in music we take something that we love

00:06:28.702 --> 00:06:30.120
and we build on it.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.740
I'd like to play a song for you.

00:06:40.068 --> 00:06:46.279
(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Doug E. Fresh &amp; Slick Rick)

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.728
That's "La Di Da Di" and it's the fifth-most sampled

00:07:01.728 --> 00:07:03.032
song of all time.

00:07:03.032 --> 00:07:06.202
It's been sampled 547 times.

00:07:06.202 --> 00:07:09.638
It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop,

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.817
Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh,

00:07:12.817 --> 00:07:16.227
and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.255
I do hope that comes back soon.

00:07:18.255 --> 00:07:22.348
Anyway, this predated the sampling era.

00:07:22.348 --> 00:07:23.850
There were no samples in this record,

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.206
although I did look up on the Internet last night,

00:07:26.206 --> 00:07:28.254
I mean several months ago,

00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:30.779
that "La Di Da Di" means, it's an old

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:33.819
Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England,

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.935
so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore

00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:37.861
from "Downton Abbey" coming soon,

00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:41.445
or that's for another day.

00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:43.171
Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.955
Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record,

00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:48.015
and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy,

00:07:48.015 --> 00:07:50.804
super-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bites

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.546
and samples for future pop records.

00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:54.876
That was 1984.

00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:57.779
This is me in 1984, in case you were wondering

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.310
how I was doing, thank you for asking.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.411
It's Throwback Thursday already.

00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:04.764
I was involved in a heavy love affair

00:08:04.764 --> 00:08:06.093
with the music of Duran Duran,

00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:08.164
as you can probably tell from my outfit.

00:08:08.164 --> 00:08:09.818
I was in the middle.

00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:11.949
And the simplest way that I knew

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.530
how to co-opt myself into that experience

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.463
of wanting to be in that song somehow

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:18.884
was to just get a band together
of fellow nine-year-olds

00:08:18.884 --> 00:08:21.391
and play "Wild Boys" at the school talent show.

00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:23.880
So that's what we did, and long story short,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.622
we were booed off the stage,

00:08:25.622 --> 00:08:28.435
and if you ever have a chance to live your life

00:08:28.435 --> 00:08:30.976
escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:32.529
full of second- and third-graders booing,

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:35.137
I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun.

00:08:35.137 --> 00:08:36.437
But it didn't really matter,

00:08:36.437 --> 00:08:38.205
because what I wanted somehow

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:40.932
was to just be in the history
of that song for a minute.

00:08:40.932 --> 00:08:42.123
I didn't care who liked it.

00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:45.442
I just loved it, and I thought
I could put myself in there.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.210
Over the next 10 years, "La Di Da Di"

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.155
continues to be sampled by countless records,

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:52.879
ending up on massive hits like
"Here Comes the Hotstepper"

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.360
and "I Wanna Sex You Up."

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.241
Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song

00:08:56.241 --> 00:09:00.304
on his debut album "Doggystyle"
and calls it "Lodi Dodi."

00:09:00.304 --> 00:09:02.712
Copyright lawyers are having
a field day at this point.

00:09:02.712 --> 00:09:05.480
And then you fast forward to 1997,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.334
and the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie,

00:09:08.334 --> 00:09:11.296
reinterprets "La Di Da Di"

00:09:11.296 --> 00:09:14.104
on his number one hit called "Hypnotize,"

00:09:14.104 --> 00:09:15.626
which I will play a little bit of

00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:17.208
and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:20.277
to show you where they got it from.

00:09:20.277 --> 00:09:27.218
(Music: "Hypnotize" by The Notorious B.I.G.)

00:09:47.385 --> 00:09:51.372
So Biggie was killed

00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:53.376
weeks before that song made it to number one,

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:55.578
in one of the great tragedies of the hip-hop era,

00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:57.294
but he would have been 13 years old

00:09:57.294 --> 00:09:59.603
and very much alive when
"La Di Da Di" first came out,

00:09:59.603 --> 00:10:00.865
and as a young boy

00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:02.516
growing up in Brooklyn,

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:04.658
it's hard not to think that that song probably held

00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:06.089
some fond memories for him.

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:07.875
But the way he interpreted it, as you hear,

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.290
is completely his own.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.365
He flips it, makes it,

00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:13.721
there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it.

00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:16.529
It's thoroughly modern Biggie.

00:10:16.529 --> 00:10:18.257
I had to make that joke in this room,

00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:21.083
because you would be the only people
that I'd ever have a chance of getting it.

00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:24.323
And so, it's a groaner. (Laughter)

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:27.876
Elsewhere in the pop and rap world,

00:10:27.876 --> 00:10:29.792
we're going a little bit sample-crazy.

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:32.290
We're getting away from the obscure
samples that we were doing,

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.626
and all of a sudden everyone's taking

00:10:33.626 --> 00:10:36.437
these massive '80s tunes like Bowie, "Let's Dance,"

00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:38.816
and all these disco records,
and just rapping on them.

00:10:38.816 --> 00:10:40.660
These records don't really age that well.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.715
You don't hear them now, because they borrowed

00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:44.309
from an era that was too steeped

00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:46.257
in its own connotation.

00:10:46.257 --> 00:10:50.969
You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale.

00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:53.093
It leaves the listener feeling sickly.

00:10:53.093 --> 00:10:55.356
You have to take an element of those things

00:10:55.356 --> 00:10:58.235
and then bring something fresh and new to it,

00:10:58.235 --> 00:10:59.425
which was something that I learned

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:01.143
when I was working with the late,

00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:02.455
amazing Amy Winehouse

00:11:02.455 --> 00:11:04.696
on her album "Back to Black."

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:07.752
A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album

00:11:07.752 --> 00:11:09.781
that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer,

00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:11.669
achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound,

00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:15.444
but without the very, very 21st-century personality

00:11:15.444 --> 00:11:17.397
and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse

00:11:17.397 --> 00:11:20.550
and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.476
and even a mention of Slick Rick,

00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:23.761
the whole thing would have run the risk

00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:27.222
of being very pastiche, to be honest.

00:11:27.222 --> 00:11:29.510
Imagine any other singer from that era over it

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.201
singing the same old lyrics.

00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:34.338
It runs a risk of being completely bland.

00:11:34.338 --> 00:11:36.851
I mean, there was no doubt that Amy

00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:38.809
and I and Salaam all had this love

00:11:38.809 --> 00:11:40.599
for this gospel, soul and blues and jazz

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:43.818
that was evident listening to
the musical arrangements.

00:11:43.818 --> 00:11:45.862
She brought the ingredients that made it urgent

00:11:45.862 --> 00:11:47.521
and of the time.

00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:50.558
So if we come all the way up to the present day now,

00:11:50.558 --> 00:11:54.070
the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus,

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.292
she reinterprets "La Di Da Di"

00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:58.454
completely for her generation,

00:11:58.454 --> 00:12:01.398
and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part

00:12:01.398 --> 00:12:05.129
and then see how she sort of flipped it.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:11.228
(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Slick Rick &amp; Doug E. Fresh)

00:12:19.953 --> 00:12:25.936
(Music: "We Can't Stop" by Miley Cyrus)

00:12:25.936 --> 00:12:27.777
So Miley Cyrus,

00:12:27.777 --> 00:12:31.315
who wasn't even born yet
when "La Di Da Di" was made,

00:12:31.315 --> 00:12:34.849
and neither were any of the co-writers on the song,

00:12:34.849 --> 00:12:36.959
has found this song that somehow

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:40.004
etched its way into the collective
consciousness of pop music,

00:12:40.004 --> 00:12:43.957
and now, with its timeless playfulness of the original,

00:12:43.957 --> 00:12:46.380
has kind of translated to a whole new generation

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.048
who will probably co-opt it as their own.

00:12:50.048 --> 00:12:53.250
Since the dawn of the sampling era,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.771
there's been endless debate

00:12:54.771 --> 00:12:57.369
about the validity of music that contains samples.

00:12:57.369 --> 00:12:58.995
You know, the Grammy committee says that

00:12:58.995 --> 00:13:01.653
if your song contains some kind of pre-written

00:13:01.653 --> 00:13:02.898
or pre-existing music,

00:13:02.898 --> 00:13:04.893
you're ineligible for song of the year.

00:13:04.893 --> 00:13:07.170
Rockists, who are racist

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.920
but only about rock music,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.151
constantly use the argument to —

00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:15.173
That's a real word. That is a real word.

00:13:15.173 --> 00:13:17.789
They constantly use the argument to devalue rap

00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:19.699
and modern pop,

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:23.861
and these arguments completely miss the point,

00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.820
because the dam has burst.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.853
We live in the post-sampling era.

00:13:27.853 --> 00:13:29.480
We take the things that we love

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.858
and we build on them.

00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:32.498
That's just how it goes.

00:13:32.498 --> 00:13:35.590
And when we really add
something significant and original

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.087
and we merge our musical journey with this,

00:13:38.087 --> 00:13:39.925
then we have a chance to be

00:13:39.925 --> 00:13:42.558
a part of the evolution of that music that we love

00:13:42.558 --> 00:13:45.799
and be linked with it once it
becomes something new again.

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:51.163
So I would like to do one more piece

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.881
that I put together for you tonight,

00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:55.236
and it takes place with two

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:58.272
pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen.

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:01.907
One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini,

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:03.989
who happens to be a blind,

00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:05.527
autistic genius at the piano,

00:14:05.527 --> 00:14:07.940
and Emmanuel Jal, who is an ex-child soldier

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.260
from the South Sudan,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.122
who is a spoken word poet and rapper.

00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:14.460
And once again I found a way to annoyingly

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.721
me-me-me myself into the musical history

00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:19.235
of these songs,

00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:20.343
but I can't help it,

00:14:20.343 --> 00:14:22.048
because they're these things that I love,

00:14:22.048 --> 00:14:23.975
and I want to mess around with them.

00:14:23.975 --> 00:14:27.712
So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go.

00:14:27.712 --> 00:14:29.793
Let's hear that TED sound again, right?

00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:37.465
(Music)

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:34.448
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:16:34.448 --> 00:16:37.111
(Applause)
