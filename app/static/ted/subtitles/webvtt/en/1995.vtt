00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:02.718
I study ants

00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:06.015
in the desert, in the tropical forest

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:07.543
and in my kitchen,

00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:11.563
and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.

00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:13.239
I've recently realized that ants

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.517
are using interactions differently

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:17.345
in different environments,

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:19.345
and that got me thinking
that we could learn from this

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:20.900
about other systems,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.488
like brains and data networks that we engineer,

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:29.334
and even cancer.

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.086
So what all these systems have in common

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.943
is that there's no central control.

00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:37.763
An ant colony consists of sterile female workers --

00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:40.149
those are the ants you see walking around â€”

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.305
and then one or more reproductive females

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:44.408
who just lay the eggs.

00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:46.417
They don't give any instructions.

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:48.401
Even though they're called queens,

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.566
they don't tell anybody what to do.

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.842
So in an ant colony, there's no one in charge,

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:56.620
and all systems like this without central control

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.539
are regulated using very simple interactions.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.276
Ants interact using smell.

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:05.463
They smell with their antennae,

00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:08.224
and they interact with their antennae,

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:11.233
so when one ant touches another with its antennae,

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.840
it can tell, for example, if the other ant

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.474
is a nestmate

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:18.710
and what task that other ant has been doing.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.910
So here you see a lot of ants moving around

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.843
and interacting in a lab arena

00:01:23.843 --> 00:01:27.281
that's connected by tubes to two other arenas.

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.785
So when one ant meets another,

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:31.874
it doesn't matter which ant it meets,

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:33.759
and they're actually not transmitting

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.224
any kind of complicated signal or message.

00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:39.335
All that matters to the ant is the rate

00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:42.156
at which it meets other ants.

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:44.913
And all of these interactions, taken together,

00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:47.418
produce a network.

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:49.628
So this is the network of the ants

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:52.272
that you just saw moving around in the arena,

00:01:52.272 --> 00:01:55.559
and it's this constantly shifting network

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:58.079
that produces the behavior of the colony,

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.960
like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.654
or how many are going out to forage.

00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:05.413
A brain actually works in the same way,

00:02:05.413 --> 00:02:06.913
but what's great about ants is

00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:11.780
that you can see the whole network as it happens.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.880
There are more than 12,000 species of ants,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.005
in every conceivable environment,

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.654
and they're using interactions differently

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:22.422
to meet different environmental challenges.

00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:24.727
So one important environmental challenge

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.597
that every system has to deal with

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:28.680
is operating costs, just what it takes

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.945
to run the system.

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:33.493
And another environmental challenge is resources,

00:02:33.493 --> 00:02:35.829
finding them and collecting them.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.612
In the desert, operating costs are high

00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:40.385
because water is scarce,

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.884
and the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert

00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:45.784
have to spend water to get water.

00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:47.923
So an ant outside foraging,

00:02:47.923 --> 00:02:49.960
searching for seeds in the hot sun,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.967
just loses water into the air.

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:53.631
But the colony gets its water

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.397
by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds

00:02:55.397 --> 00:02:57.331
that they eat.

00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.490
So in this environment, interactions are used

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.039
to activate foraging.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.303
An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless

00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:06.876
it gets enough interactions with returning foragers,

00:03:06.876 --> 00:03:08.866
and what you see are the returning foragers

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:10.690
going into the tunnel, into the nest,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.326
and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.949
This makes sense for the ant colony,

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.272
because the more food there is out there,

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:19.123
the more quickly the foragers find it,

00:03:19.123 --> 00:03:20.359
the faster they come back,

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.160
and the more foragers they send out.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.667
The system works to stay stopped,

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:27.682
unless something positive happens.

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:31.563
So interactions function to activate foragers.

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:34.470
And we've been studying
the evolution of this system.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.561
First of all, there's variation.

00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:38.040
It turns out that colonies are different.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.736
On dry days, some colonies forage less,

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:42.241
so colonies are different in how

00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:43.595
they manage this trade-off

00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:46.763
between spending water to search for seeds

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:50.083
and getting water back in the form of seeds.

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:51.802
And we're trying to understand why

00:03:51.802 --> 00:03:53.942
some colonies forage less than others

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.267
by thinking about ants as neurons,

00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:58.605
using models from neuroscience.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:01.279
So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.285
from other neurons to decide whether to fire,

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.170
an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.193
to decide whether to forage.

00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:09.830
And what we're looking for is whether there might be

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.822
small differences among colonies

00:04:11.822 --> 00:04:15.136
in how many interactions each ant needs

00:04:15.136 --> 00:04:17.062
before it's willing to go out and forage,

00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:20.829
because a colony like that would forage less.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.968
And this raises an analogous question about brains.

00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:25.380
We talk about the brain,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.270
but of course every brain is slightly different,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.649
and maybe there are some individuals

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:30.968
or some conditions

00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:34.190
in which the electrical properties of neurons are such

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.060
that they require more stimulus to fire,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.786
and that would lead to differences in brain function.

00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:44.120
So in order to ask evolutionary questions,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.799
we need to know about reproductive success.

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:49.124
This is a map of the study site

00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:51.677
where I have been tracking this population

00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:54.970
of harvester ant colonies for 28 years,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.232
which is about as long as a colony lives.

00:04:57.232 --> 00:04:59.331
Each symbol is a colony,

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.597
and the size of the symbol is
how many offspring it had,

00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:04.510
because we were able to use genetic variation

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.221
to match up parent and offspring colonies,

00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:10.518
that is, to figure out which colonies

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.443
were founded by a daughter queen

00:05:12.443 --> 00:05:14.511
produced by which parent colony.

00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:16.513
And this was amazing for me, after all these years,

00:05:16.513 --> 00:05:19.641
to find out, for example, that colony 154,

00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:21.817
whom I've known well for many years,

00:05:21.817 --> 00:05:23.636
is a great-grandmother.

00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:25.376
Here's her daughter colony,

00:05:25.376 --> 00:05:28.060
here's her granddaughter colony,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.452
and these are her great-granddaughter colonies.

00:05:30.452 --> 00:05:32.477
And by doing this, I was able to learn

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:35.760
that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.977
in their decisions about which days are so hot

00:05:37.977 --> 00:05:39.755
that they don't forage,

00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:41.219
and the offspring of parent colonies

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.125
live so far from each other that the ants never meet,

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.414
so the ants of the offspring colony

00:05:46.414 --> 00:05:48.658
can't be learning this from the parent colony.

00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:50.039
And so our next step is to look

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.315
for the genetic variation
underlying this resemblance.

00:05:55.315 --> 00:05:59.440
So then I was able to ask, okay, who's doing better?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.900
Over the time of the study,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.365
and especially in the past 10 years,

00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:05.673
there's been a very severe and deepening drought

00:06:05.673 --> 00:06:07.800
in the Southwestern U.S.,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.853
and it turns out that the
colonies that conserve water,

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:15.282
that stay in when it's really hot outside,

00:06:15.282 --> 00:06:17.914
and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible,

00:06:17.914 --> 00:06:20.859
are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies.

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:23.128
So all this time, I thought that colony 154

00:06:23.128 --> 00:06:25.798
was a loser, because on really dry days,

00:06:25.798 --> 00:06:27.666
there'd be just this trickle of foraging,

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:29.257
while the other colonies were out

00:06:29.257 --> 00:06:31.374
foraging, getting lots of food,

00:06:31.374 --> 00:06:34.394
but in fact, colony 154 is a huge success.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.726
She's a matriarch.

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:38.778
She's one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site.

00:06:38.778 --> 00:06:41.563
To my knowledge, this is the first time

00:06:41.563 --> 00:06:43.202
that we've been able to track

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:46.203
the ongoing evolution of collective behavior

00:06:46.203 --> 00:06:48.320
in a natural population of animals

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.977
and find out what's actually working best.

00:06:52.977 --> 00:06:55.398
Now, the Internet uses an algorithm

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:58.251
to regulate the flow of data

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.478
that's very similar to the one

00:07:00.478 --> 00:07:02.854
that the harvester ants are using to regulate

00:07:02.854 --> 00:07:04.395
the flow of foragers.

00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:07.761
And guess what we call this analogy?

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.279
The anternet is coming.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.000
(Applause)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.454
So data doesn't leave the source computer

00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:17.315
unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth

00:07:17.315 --> 00:07:20.044
for it to travel on.

00:07:20.044 --> 00:07:21.485
In the early days of the Internet,

00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:23.759
when operating costs were really high

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.986
and it was really important not to lose any data,

00:07:26.986 --> 00:07:29.143
then the system was set up for interactions

00:07:29.143 --> 00:07:32.205
to activate the flow of data.

00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:34.590
It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.486
that's so similar to the one that we recently invented,

00:07:38.486 --> 00:07:41.439
but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.858
that we know about,

00:07:42.858 --> 00:07:46.051
and ants have had 130 million years

00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:48.077
to evolve a lot of good ones,

00:07:48.077 --> 00:07:49.583
and I think it's very likely

00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:52.140
that some of the other 12,000 species

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.837
are going to have interesting algorithms

00:07:54.837 --> 00:07:55.861
for data networks

00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:58.558
that we haven't even thought of yet.

00:07:58.558 --> 00:08:01.643
So what happens when operating costs are low?

00:08:01.643 --> 00:08:03.430
Operating costs are low in the tropics,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.526
because it's very humid, and it's easy for the ants

00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:08.350
to be outside walking around.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.003
But the ants are so abundant

00:08:10.003 --> 00:08:11.821
and diverse in the tropics

00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:14.419
that there's a lot of competition.

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:16.371
Whatever resource one species is using,

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.543
another species is likely to be using that

00:08:19.543 --> 00:08:21.922
at the same time.

00:08:21.922 --> 00:08:24.530
So in this environment, interactions are used

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.475
in the opposite way.

00:08:26.475 --> 00:08:27.870
The system keeps going

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.424
unless something negative happens,

00:08:29.424 --> 00:08:31.591
and one species that I study makes circuits

00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:33.750
in the trees of foraging ants

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.731
going from the nest to a food source and back,

00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:38.060
just round and round,

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.502
unless something negative happens,

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:41.111
like an interaction

00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:43.850
with ants of another species.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.787
So here's an example of ant security.

00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.645
In the middle, there's an ant

00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:51.108
plugging the nest entrance with its head

00:08:51.108 --> 00:08:54.101
in response to interactions with another species.

00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:55.760
Those are the little ones running around

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.511
with their abdomens up in the air.

00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:00.557
But as soon as the threat is passed,

00:09:00.557 --> 00:09:03.312
the entrance is open again,

00:09:03.312 --> 00:09:05.102
and maybe there are situations

00:09:05.102 --> 00:09:06.191
in computer security

00:09:06.191 --> 00:09:08.397
where operating costs are low enough

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:11.772
that we could just block access temporarily

00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:13.965
in response to an immediate threat,

00:09:13.965 --> 00:09:15.991
and then open it again,

00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:17.260
instead of trying to build

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.240
a permanent firewall or fortress.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.180
So another environmental challenge

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.875
that all systems have to deal with

00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:30.327
is resources, finding and collecting them.

00:09:30.327 --> 00:09:32.000
And to do this, ants solve the problem

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.258
of collective search,

00:09:33.258 --> 00:09:34.834
and this is a problem that's of great interest

00:09:34.834 --> 00:09:36.318
right now in robotics,

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:38.050
because we've understood that,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.664
rather than sending a single,

00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:43.159
sophisticated, expensive robot out

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:44.576
to explore another planet

00:09:44.576 --> 00:09:47.143
or to search a burning building,

00:09:47.143 --> 00:09:49.743
that instead, it may be more effective

00:09:49.743 --> 00:09:54.120
to get a group of cheaper robots

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.665
exchanging only minimal information,

00:09:56.665 --> 00:09:59.464
and that's the way that ants do it.

00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:01.229
So the invasive Argentine ant

00:10:01.229 --> 00:10:03.559
makes expandable search networks.

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:05.832
They're good at dealing with the main problem

00:10:05.832 --> 00:10:07.163
of collective search,

00:10:07.163 --> 00:10:09.729
which is the trade-off between

00:10:09.729 --> 00:10:11.065
searching very thoroughly

00:10:11.065 --> 00:10:13.062
and covering a lot of ground.

00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:13.957
And what they do is,

00:10:13.957 --> 00:10:16.344
when there are many ants in a small space,

00:10:16.344 --> 00:10:18.557
then each one can search very thoroughly

00:10:18.557 --> 00:10:20.181
because there will be another ant nearby

00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:21.538
searching over there,

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.185
but when there are a few ants

00:10:23.185 --> 00:10:25.240
in a large space,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.654
then they need to stretch out their paths

00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:29.457
to cover more ground.

00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:32.411
I think they use interactions to assess density,

00:10:32.411 --> 00:10:33.640
so when they're really crowded,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.742
they meet more often,

00:10:34.742 --> 00:10:37.207
and they search more thoroughly.

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:40.607
Different ant species must use different algorithms,

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:43.129
because they've evolved to deal with

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:44.800
different resources,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.359
and it could be really useful to know about this,

00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:49.001
and so we recently asked ants

00:10:49.001 --> 00:10:51.451
to solve the collective search problem

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:52.819
in the extreme environment

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.377
of microgravity

00:10:54.377 --> 00:10:56.353
in the International Space Station.

00:10:56.353 --> 00:10:57.898
When I first saw this picture, I thought,

00:10:57.898 --> 00:11:00.755
Oh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically,

00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:03.373
but then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter.

00:11:03.373 --> 00:11:06.010
So the idea here is that the ants

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.980
are working so hard to hang on

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.037
to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:14.046
that they're less likely to interact,

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:15.290
and so the relationship between

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.410
how crowded they are and how often they meet

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.135
would be messed up.

00:11:19.135 --> 00:11:20.530
We're still analyzing the data.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.494
I don't have the results yet.

00:11:22.494 --> 00:11:24.188
But it would be interesting to know

00:11:24.188 --> 00:11:26.647
how other species solve this problem

00:11:26.647 --> 00:11:29.211
in different environments on Earth,

00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:30.477
and so we're setting up a program

00:11:30.477 --> 00:11:32.637
to encourage kids around the world

00:11:32.637 --> 00:11:35.173
to try this experiment with different species.

00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:36.940
It's very simple.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.030
It can be done with cheap materials.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.863
And that way, we could make a global map

00:11:41.863 --> 00:11:45.210
of ant collective search algorithms.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.693
And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species,

00:11:47.693 --> 00:11:49.842
the ones that come into our buildings,

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.584
are going to be really good at this,

00:11:51.584 --> 00:11:53.432
because they're in your kitchen

00:11:53.432 --> 00:11:57.339
because they're really good
at finding food and water.

00:11:57.339 --> 00:12:00.604
So the most familiar resource for ants

00:12:00.604 --> 00:12:01.919
is a picnic,

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:04.064
and this is a clustered resource.

00:12:04.064 --> 00:12:05.063
When there's one piece of fruit,

00:12:05.063 --> 00:12:07.578
there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby,

00:12:07.578 --> 00:12:11.010
and the ants that specialize on clustered resources

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.952
use interactions for recruitment.

00:12:12.952 --> 00:12:14.229
So when one ant meets another,

00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:15.854
or when it meets a chemical deposited

00:12:15.854 --> 00:12:17.590
on the ground by another,

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.423
then it changes direction to follow

00:12:19.423 --> 00:12:20.996
in the direction of the interaction,

00:12:20.996 --> 00:12:22.973
and that's how you get the trail of ants

00:12:22.973 --> 00:12:24.386
sharing your picnic.

00:12:24.386 --> 00:12:26.081
Now this is a place where I think we might be able

00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:29.822
to learn something from ants about cancer.

00:12:29.822 --> 00:12:31.803
I mean, first, it's obvious that we could do a lot

00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:33.413
to prevent cancer

00:12:33.413 --> 00:12:35.990
by not allowing people to spread around

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.934
or sell the toxins that promote

00:12:37.934 --> 00:12:40.714
the evolution of cancer in our bodies,

00:12:40.714 --> 00:12:43.060
but I don't think the ants can help us much with this

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.418
because ants never poison their own colonies.

00:12:46.418 --> 00:12:47.750
But we might be able to learn something from ants

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.513
about treating cancer.

00:12:49.513 --> 00:12:51.738
There are many different kinds of cancer.

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:54.716
Each one originates in a particular part of the body,

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:57.682
and then some kinds of cancer will spread

00:12:57.682 --> 00:13:00.512
or metastasize to particular other tissues

00:13:00.512 --> 00:13:03.392
where they must be getting
resources that they need.

00:13:03.392 --> 00:13:05.200
So if you think from the perspective

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.150
of early metastatic cancer cells

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.773
as they're out searching around

00:13:08.773 --> 00:13:11.090
for the resources that they need,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.073
if those resources are clustered,

00:13:13.073 --> 00:13:16.086
they're likely to use interactions for recruitment,

00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:19.179
and if we can figure out how
cancer cells are recruiting,

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:21.526
then maybe we could set traps

00:13:21.526 --> 00:13:25.575
to catch them before they become established.

00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:28.810
So ants are using interactions in different ways

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.412
in a huge variety of environments,

00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:33.233
and we could learn from this

00:13:33.233 --> 00:13:35.010
about other systems that operate

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.347
without central control.

00:13:37.347 --> 00:13:39.326
Using only simple interactions,

00:13:39.326 --> 00:13:41.121
ant colonies have been performing

00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:44.754
amazing feats for more than 130 million years.

00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:46.894
We have a lot to learn from them.

00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:49.632
Thank you.

00:13:49.632 --> 00:13:52.365
