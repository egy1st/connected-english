00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.534
So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,

00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:08.819
and it's clear that the general public needs guidance,

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:11.692
because the average bank robbery nets

00:00:11.692 --> 00:00:14.230
only 7,500 dollars.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.200
Rank amateurs who know nothing

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.539
about how to cook the books.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.599
The folks who know, of course,

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.390
run our largest banks,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.908
and in the last go-around,

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:29.144
they cost us over 11 trillion dollars.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.561
That's what 11 trillion looks like.

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.108
That's how many zeros?

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:36.544
And cost us over 10 million jobs as well.

00:00:36.544 --> 00:00:39.195
So our task is to educate ourselves

00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:40.403
so that we can understand

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:42.853
why we have these recurrent,

00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:44.930
intensifying financial crises,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.125
and how we can prevent them in the future.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.515
And the answer to that is

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:54.921
that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.870
Control fraud is what happens

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.690
when the people who control,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.415
typically a CEO,

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:02.988
a seemingly legitimate entity,

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:05.244
use it as a weapon to defraud.

00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:08.839
And these are the weapons of mass destruction

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.939
in the financial world.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.669
They also follow in finance a particular strategy,

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:18.041
because the weapon of choice in finance

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:19.511
is accounting,

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:23.405
and there is a recipe for accounting

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:25.735
control fraud, and how it occurs.

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.368
And we discovered this recipe

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:30.062
in quite an odd way that I'll
come back to in a moment.

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:34.039
First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.077
second, by making or buying really crappy loans,

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:42.560
but loans that are made at a very high interest rate

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.038
or yield;

00:01:44.038 --> 00:01:46.270
three, while employing extreme leverage --

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.985
that just means a lot of debt --

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:49.219
compared to your equity;

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.239
and four, while providing only trivial loss reserves

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:55.423
against the inevitable losses.

00:01:55.423 --> 00:01:59.089
If you follow those four simple steps,

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:01.390
and any bank can follow them,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.898
then you are mathematically guaranteed

00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:06.088
to have three things occur.

00:02:06.088 --> 00:02:07.648
The first thing is

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:11.012
you will report record bank profits --

00:02:11.012 --> 00:02:13.523
not just high, record.

00:02:13.523 --> 00:02:18.780
Two, the CEO will immediately
be made incredibly wealthy

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.676
by modern executive compensation.

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:24.546
And three, farther down the road,

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:27.607
the bank will suffer catastrophic losses

00:02:27.607 --> 00:02:30.803
and will fail unless it is bailed out.

00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:34.543
And that's a hint as to how

00:02:34.543 --> 00:02:36.279
we discovered this recipe,

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.355
because we discovered it
through an autopsy process.

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:45.267
During the savings and loan debacle in 1984,

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:47.722
we looked at every single failure,

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:50.139
and we looked for common characteristics,

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.398
and we discovered this recipe was common

00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:56.712
to each of these frauds.

00:02:56.712 --> 00:02:59.790
In other words, a coroner could find these things

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.650
because this is a fatal recipe

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.074
that will destroy the banks

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:06.165
as well as the economy.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:09.678
And it also turns out to be precisely

00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:11.940
what could have stopped this crisis,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.462
the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars

00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:16.398
just in the household sector,

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:18.502
that cost us 10 million jobs,

00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:21.956
was the easiest financial crisis by far

00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:24.427
to have avoided completely

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:26.499
if we had simply learned the lessons

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.604
of epidemics of control fraud,

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.095
particularly using this recipe.

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:33.002
So let's go to this crisis,

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:35.851
and the two huge epidemics

00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:39.515
of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis --

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:42.348
appraisal fraud and liar's loans --

00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:43.793
and what we're going to see

00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:46.140
in looking at both of these is

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.393
we got warnings that were incredibly early

00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:51.362
about these frauds.

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:55.500
We got warnings that we could
have taken advantage of easily,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.970
because back in the savings and loan debacle,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.590
we had figured out how to respond

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.668
and prevent these crises.

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:05.972
And three, the warnings were unambiguous.

00:04:05.972 --> 00:04:08.541
They were obvious that what was going on

00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:13.420
was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.193
Let's take appraisal fraud first.

00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:17.901
This is simply where you inflate the value

00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:20.630
of the home that is being pledged

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.227
as security for the loan.

00:04:23.227 --> 00:04:26.733
In 2000, the year 2000,

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:31.067
that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,

00:04:31.067 --> 00:04:35.303
the honest appraisers got together a formal petition

00:04:35.303 --> 00:04:38.405
begging the federal government to act,

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:40.260
and the industry to act,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.069
to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.373
And the appraisers explained how it was occurring,

00:04:47.373 --> 00:04:51.010
that banks were demanding that appraisers

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.920
inflate the appraisal,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.221
and that if the appraisers refused to do so,

00:04:56.221 --> 00:05:00.077
they, the banks, would blacklist

00:05:00.077 --> 00:05:02.299
honest appraisers

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:04.851
and refuse to use them.

00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:07.413
Now, we've seen this before

00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:08.941
in the savings and loan debacle,

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.765
and we know that this kind of fraud

00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:13.361
can only originate from the lenders,

00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:16.405
and that no honest lender would ever inflate

00:05:16.405 --> 00:05:17.714
the appraisal,

00:05:17.714 --> 00:05:20.810
because it's the great protection against loss.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.441
So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.

00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:26.622
It was something we'd seen before,

00:05:26.622 --> 00:05:28.861
and it was completely unambiguous.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:32.253
This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud

00:05:32.253 --> 00:05:33.850
led by the banks.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.523
What about liar's loans?

00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:39.372
Well, that warning actually comes earlier.

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.001
The savings and loan debacle is basically

00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:45.548
the early 1980s through 1993,

00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:48.303
and in the midst of fighting that wave

00:05:48.303 --> 00:05:50.970
of accounting control fraud,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.158
in 1990, we found that a second front

00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:57.203
of fraud was being started.

00:05:57.203 --> 00:05:59.358
And like all good financial frauds in America,

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:03.210
it began in Orange County, California.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.221
And we happened to be the regional regulators for it.

00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:08.010
And our examiners said,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.365
they are making loans without even checking

00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:13.868
what the borrower's income is.

00:06:13.868 --> 00:06:18.451
This is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,

00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:22.083
and it only makes sense for entities engaged

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:24.324
in these accounting control frauds.

00:06:24.324 --> 00:06:26.595
And we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:29.893
and we drove those liar's loans

00:06:29.893 --> 00:06:34.337
out of the industry in 1990 and 1991,

00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:36.389
but we could only deal with the industry

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:38.438
we had jurisdiction over,

00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:40.143
which was savings and loans,

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:43.523
and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,

00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:46.429
Long Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:49.298
its federal savings and loan charter,

00:06:49.298 --> 00:06:51.741
gave up federal deposit insurance,

00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.000
converted to become a mortgage bank

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.200
for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.773
and changed its name to Ameriquest,

00:06:59.773 --> 00:07:01.445
and became the most notorious

00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:05.070
of the liar's loans frauds early on,

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.606
and to add to that,

00:07:06.606 --> 00:07:11.826
they deliberately predated upon minorities.

00:07:11.826 --> 00:07:15.917
So we knew again about this crisis.

00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:19.151
We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.

00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:22.341
We had incredibly early warnings of it,

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.193
and it was absolutely unambiguous

00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:28.399
that no honest lender would
make loans in this fashion.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:31.241
So let's take a look at the reaction

00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:34.187
of the industry and the regulators

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.990
and the prosecutors to these clear

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.457
early warnings that could have prevented the crisis.

00:07:41.457 --> 00:07:43.306
Start with the industry.

00:07:43.306 --> 00:07:49.260
The industry responded between 2003 and 2006

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.101
by increasing liar's loans

00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:57.333
by over 500 percent.

00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:59.228
These were the loans

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:00.983
that hyperinflated the bubble

00:08:00.983 --> 00:08:04.631
and produced the economic crisis.

00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:09.482
By 2006, half of all the loans called subprime

00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:11.508
were also liar's loans.

00:08:11.508 --> 00:08:14.793
They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,

00:08:14.793 --> 00:08:17.233
they're the most toxic combination

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:19.093
you can possibly imagine.

00:08:19.093 --> 00:08:22.847
By 2006, 40 percent of all the loans

00:08:22.847 --> 00:08:25.464
made that year, all the home loans made that year,

00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:28.186
were liar's loans,

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:29.497
40 percent.

00:08:29.497 --> 00:08:32.201
And this is despite a warning

00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:35.624
from the industry's own antifraud experts

00:08:35.624 --> 00:08:38.779
that said that these loans were an open invitation

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:40.739
to fraudsters,

00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:42.481
and that they had a fraud incidence

00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:44.969
of 90 percent,

00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:47.661
nine zero.

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:50.728
In response to that, the industry

00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:55.776
first started calling these loans liar's loans,

00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:59.345
which lacks a certain subtlety,

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:02.395
and second, massively increased them,

00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:05.656
and no government regulator ever

00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:09.346
required or encouraged any lender

00:09:09.346 --> 00:09:10.642
to make a liar's loan

00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:13.329
or anyone to purchase a liar's loan,

00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:16.499
and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.

00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:18.621
This came from the lenders

00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:21.790
because of the fraud recipe.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.224
What happened to appraisal fraud?

00:09:24.224 --> 00:09:27.360
It expanded remarkably as well.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.757
By 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,

00:09:31.757 --> 00:09:34.458
90 percent of appraisers reported

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:36.898
that they had been subject to coercion

00:09:36.898 --> 00:09:39.390
from the lenders trying to get them

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.960
to inflate an appraisal.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.950
In other words, both forms of fraud

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.724
became absolutely endemic and normal,

00:09:47.724 --> 00:09:49.953
and this is what drove the bubble.

00:09:49.953 --> 00:09:52.145
What happened in the governmental sector?

00:09:52.145 --> 00:09:54.749
Well, the government, as I told you,

00:09:54.749 --> 00:09:57.465
when we were the savings and loan regulators,

00:09:57.465 --> 00:10:00.143
we could only deal with our industry,

00:10:00.143 --> 00:10:02.581
and if people gave up their
federal deposit insurance,

00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:04.844
we couldn't do anything to them.

00:10:04.844 --> 00:10:08.173
Congress, it may strike you as impossible,

00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:11.421
but actually did something intelligent in 1994,

00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:14.974
and passed the Home Ownership
and Equity Protection Act

00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:18.227
that gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,

00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:22.254
the explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loans

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:24.360
by every lender,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.358
whether or not they had federal deposit insurance.

00:10:27.358 --> 00:10:30.893
So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,

00:10:30.893 --> 00:10:32.860
as chairs of the Fed, do

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.766
when they got these warnings

00:10:34.766 --> 00:10:37.776
that these were massively fraudulent loans

00:10:37.776 --> 00:10:41.130
and that they were being sold
to the secondary market?

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.350
Remember, there's no fraud exorcist.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.398
Once it starts out a fraudulent loan,

00:10:45.398 --> 00:10:47.710
it can only be sold to the secondary market

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.906
through more frauds,

00:10:48.906 --> 00:10:51.454
lying about the reps and warrantees,

00:10:51.454 --> 00:10:53.062
and then those people are going to produce

00:10:53.062 --> 00:10:54.490
mortgage-backed securities

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.758
and exotic derivatives

00:10:55.758 --> 00:10:58.980
which are also going to be supposedly backed

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.703
by those fraudulent loans.

00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:02.244
So the fraud is going to progress

00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:03.708
through the entire system,

00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:06.961
hyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.

00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:10.262
And remember, we had experience with this.

00:11:10.262 --> 00:11:12.550
We had seen significant losses,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.996
and we had experience of competent regulators

00:11:15.996 --> 00:11:17.486
in stopping it.

00:11:17.486 --> 00:11:20.382
Greenspan and Bernanke refused

00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:22.793
to use the authority under the statute

00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:25.110
to stop liar's loans.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.674
And this was a matter first of dogma.

00:11:27.674 --> 00:11:30.525
They're just horrifically opposed

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:32.344
to anything regulatory.

00:11:32.344 --> 00:11:37.060
But it is also the international competition in laxity,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.344
the race to the bottom

00:11:38.344 --> 00:11:42.379
between the United States and the United Kingdom,

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:43.980
the city of London, in particular,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.950
and the city of London won that race to the bottom,

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.802
but it meant that all regulation in the West

00:11:50.802 --> 00:11:52.806
was completely degraded

00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:54.890
in this stupid competition to be

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.962
who could have the weakest regulation.

00:11:56.962 --> 00:11:59.012
So that was the regulatory response.

00:11:59.012 --> 00:12:02.669
What about the response of the prosecutors

00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:04.404
after the crisis,

00:12:04.404 --> 00:12:08.602
after 11 trillion dollars in losses,

00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:10.642
after 10 million jobs lost,

00:12:10.642 --> 00:12:13.926
a crisis in which the losses and the frauds

00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:17.381
were more than 70 times larger

00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:19.685
than the savings and loan debacle?

00:12:19.685 --> 00:12:21.576
Well, in the savings and loan debacle,

00:12:21.576 --> 00:12:25.546
our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,

00:12:25.546 --> 00:12:29.630
made over 30,000 criminal referrals,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.266
produced over 1,000 felony convictions

00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:34.940
just in cases designated as major,

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.078
and that understates the degree of prioritization,

00:12:38.078 --> 00:12:39.874
because we worked with the FBI

00:12:39.874 --> 00:12:44.138
to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:47.402
the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.

00:12:47.402 --> 00:12:50.186
Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.500
roughly 600 senior officials.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.840
Virtually all of them were prosecuted.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.671
We had a 90 percent conviction rate.

00:12:58.671 --> 00:13:00.501
It's the greatest success against

00:13:00.501 --> 00:13:03.103
elite white collar criminals ever,

00:13:03.103 --> 00:13:05.339
and it was because of this understanding

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:06.674
of control fraud

00:13:06.674 --> 00:13:09.185
and the accounting control fraud mechanism.

00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:12.357
Flash forward to the current crisis.

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:14.930
The same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.560
which was supposed to regulate

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.657
many of the largest makers of liar's loans

00:13:18.657 --> 00:13:19.764
in the country,

00:13:19.764 --> 00:13:24.458
has made, even today -- it no longer exists,

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:26.266
but as of a year ago,

00:13:26.266 --> 00:13:31.110
it had made zero criminal referrals.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.806
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,

00:13:32.806 --> 00:13:35.322
which is supposed to regulate
the largest national banks,

00:13:35.322 --> 00:13:37.873
has made zero criminal referrals.

00:13:37.873 --> 00:13:39.499
The Fed appears to have made

00:13:39.499 --> 00:13:41.494
zero criminal referrals.

00:13:41.494 --> 00:13:43.449
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

00:13:43.449 --> 00:13:47.983
is smart enough to refuse to answer the question.

00:13:47.983 --> 00:13:53.518
Without any guidance from the regulators,

00:13:53.518 --> 00:13:56.400
there's no expertise in the FBI

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.872
to investigate complex frauds.

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:00.804
It isn't simply that they've had

00:14:00.804 --> 00:14:02.626
to reinvent the wheel

00:14:02.626 --> 00:14:04.544
of how to do these prosecutions;

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:09.300
they've forgotten that the wheel exists,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.398
and therefore, we have zero prosecutions,

00:14:13.398 --> 00:14:16.000
and of course, zero convictions,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.790
of any of the elite bank frauds,

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.327
the Wall Street types,

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:23.459
that drove this crisis.

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:25.696
With no expertise coming from the regulators,

00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:28.787
the FBI formed what it calls a partnership

00:14:28.787 --> 00:14:33.110
with the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.943
The Mortgage Bankers Association

00:14:34.943 --> 00:14:38.694
is the trade association of the perps.

00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:41.110
And the Mortgage Bankers Association

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.900
set out, it had the audacity and the success

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.578
to con the FBI.

00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:49.655
It had created a supposed definition

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:52.530
of mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.392
its members are always the victim

00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:56.409
and never the perpetrators.

00:14:56.409 --> 00:15:00.923
And the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,

00:15:00.923 --> 00:15:05.004
rod, reel and the boat they rode out in.

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:08.060
And so the FBI,

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.158
under the leadership of an attorney general

00:15:11.158 --> 00:15:12.332
who is African-American

00:15:12.332 --> 00:15:14.794
and a president of the United
States who is African-American,

00:15:14.794 --> 00:15:18.294
have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,

00:15:18.294 --> 00:15:21.776
in which it is the first virgin crisis in history,

00:15:21.776 --> 00:15:25.454
conceived without sin in the executive ranks.

00:15:25.454 --> 00:15:28.850
And it's those oh-so-clever hairdressers

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.068
who were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,

00:15:32.068 --> 00:15:34.452
who lack any financial sophistication.

00:15:34.452 --> 00:15:37.810
It is the silliest story you can conceive of,

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.711
and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,

00:15:41.711 --> 00:15:45.890
and they leave the banksters alone entirely.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.800
And so, while lions are roaming the campsite,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.010
the FBI is chasing mice.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.440
What do we need to do?

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.944
What can we do in all of this?

00:15:55.944 --> 00:15:59.763
We need to change the perverse incentive structures

00:15:59.763 --> 00:16:02.759
that produce these recurrent epidemics

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:04.088
of accounting control fraud

00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:06.102
that are driving our crises.

00:16:06.102 --> 00:16:08.990
So we have to first get rid

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.478
of the systemically dangerous institutions.

00:16:11.478 --> 00:16:14.963
These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.

00:16:14.963 --> 00:16:17.105
We need to shrink them to the point,

00:16:17.105 --> 00:16:18.700
within the next five years,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.435
that they no longer pose a systemic risk.

00:16:21.435 --> 00:16:23.572
Right now, they are ticking time bombs

00:16:23.572 --> 00:16:26.915
that will cause a global crisis

00:16:26.915 --> 00:16:29.264
as soon as the next one fails --

00:16:29.264 --> 00:16:31.060
not if, when.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.971
Second thing we need to do is completely reform

00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:36.963
modern executive and professional compensation,

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:41.306
which is what they use to suborn the appraisers.

00:16:41.306 --> 00:16:43.194
Remember, they were pressuring the appraisers

00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:44.976
through the compensation system,

00:16:44.976 --> 00:16:47.638
trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,

00:16:47.638 --> 00:16:50.217
in which bad ethics drives good ethics

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:51.583
out of the marketplace.

00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:53.519
And they largely succeeded,

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:56.402
which is how the fraud became endemic.

00:16:56.402 --> 00:16:59.100
And the third thing that we need to do

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.738
is deal with what we call the three D's:

00:17:01.738 --> 00:17:04.319
deregulation, desupervision,

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.340
and the de facto decriminalization.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.437
Because we can make

00:17:10.437 --> 00:17:14.111
all three of these changes, and if we do so,

00:17:14.111 --> 00:17:16.920
we can dramatically reduce

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.112
how often we have a crisis

00:17:19.112 --> 00:17:22.739
and how severe those crises are.

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:25.720
That is not simply critical to our economy.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.146
You can see what these crises do to inequality

00:17:29.146 --> 00:17:31.466
and what they do to our democracy.

00:17:31.466 --> 00:17:34.210
They have produced crony capitalism,

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.592
American-style,

00:17:35.592 --> 00:17:38.870
in which the largest financial institutions

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.514
are the leading financial donors of both parties,

00:17:42.514 --> 00:17:44.434
and that's the reason why

00:17:44.434 --> 00:17:48.409
even after this crisis,

00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:53.694
70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,

00:17:53.694 --> 00:17:56.548
we have no meaningful reforms

00:17:56.548 --> 00:17:59.922
in any of the three areas that I've talked about,

00:17:59.922 --> 00:18:01.714
other than banning liar's loans,

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:02.790
which is good,

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.214
but that's just one form of ammunition

00:18:05.214 --> 00:18:06.610
for this fraud weapon.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.591
There are many forms of ammunition they can use.

00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:12.342
That's why we need to learn

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.454
what the bankers have learned:

00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:17.877
the recipe for the best way to rob a bank,

00:18:17.877 --> 00:18:20.742
so that we can stop that recipe,

00:18:20.742 --> 00:18:22.504
because our legislators,

00:18:22.504 --> 00:18:25.194
who are dependent on political contributions,

00:18:25.194 --> 00:18:27.388
will not do it on their own.

00:18:27.388 --> 00:18:29.458
Thank you very much.

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:31.585
(Applause)
