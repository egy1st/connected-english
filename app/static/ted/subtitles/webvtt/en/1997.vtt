00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:01.744
I recently retired

00:00:01.744 --> 00:00:03.788
from the California Highway Patrol

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:06.725
after 23 years of service.

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:08.691
The majority of those 23 years

00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:11.319
was spent patrolling the southern end

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:12.852
of Marin County,

00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:16.029
which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.316
The bridge is an iconic structure,

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:19.569
known worldwide

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:22.245
for its beautiful views of San Francisco,

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.636
the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.

00:00:26.636 --> 00:00:31.052
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,

00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:35.631
being one of the most utilized sites in the world.

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:38.761
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:43.084
Joseph Strauss, chief engineer
in charge of building the bridge,

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:44.688
was quoted as saying,

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:48.084
"The bridge is practically suicide-proof.

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:49.793
Suicide from the bridge

00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:53.559
is neither practical nor probable."

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.853
But since its opening,

00:00:55.853 --> 00:00:59.000
over 1,600 people have leapt to their death

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.162
from that bridge.

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.366
Some believe that traveling

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.431
between the two towers

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.554
will lead you to another dimension --

00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:11.010
this bridge has been romanticized as such â€”

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.589
that the fall from that

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:15.623
frees you from all your worries and grief,

00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:17.407
and the waters below

00:01:17.407 --> 00:01:19.531
will cleanse your soul.

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.855
But let me tell you what actually occurs

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:23.041
when the bridge is used

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.095
as a means of suicide.

00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:28.549
After a free fall of four to five seconds,

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.218
the body strikes the water

00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:34.900
at about 75 miles an hour.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.617
That impact shatters bones,

00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:40.969
some of which then puncture vital organs.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.318
Most die on impact.

00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:45.070
Those that don't

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.663
generally flail in the water helplessly,

00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:49.882
and then drown.

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:52.050
I don't think that those who contemplate

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.872
this method of suicide

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:59.048
realize how grisly a death that they will face.

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:01.176
This is the cord.

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:03.233
Except for around the two towers,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.521
there is 32 inches of steel

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.051
paralleling the bridge.

00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.336
This is where most folks stand

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:11.870
before taking their lives.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.904
I can tell you from experience

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.638
that once the person is on that cord,

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:18.396
and at their darkest time,

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:21.690
it is very difficult to bring them back.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.732
I took this photo last year

00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:25.668
as this young woman spoke to an officer

00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:27.666
contemplating her life.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.922
I want to tell you very happily

00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.030
that we were successful that day

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.954
in getting her back over the rail.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.346
When I first began working on the bridge,

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:39.830
we had no formal training.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.624
You struggled to funnel your
way through these calls.

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:46.078
This was not only a disservice

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:48.127
to those contemplating suicide,

00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:50.920
but to the officers as well.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.100
We've come a long, long way since then.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.669
Now, veteran officers and psychologists

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.340
train new officers.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.549
This is Jason Garber.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.760
I met Jason on July 22 of last year

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.875
when I get received a call

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:08.817
of a possible suicidal subject

00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:11.566
sitting on the cord near midspan.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.263
I responded, and when I arrived,

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:16.077
I observed Jason

00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:19.448
speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.

00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:21.972
Jason was just 32 years old

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:24.804
and had flown out here from New Jersey.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.348
As a matter of fact,

00:03:26.348 --> 00:03:28.166
he had flown out here on two other occasions

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.928
from New Jersey

00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:33.342
to attempt suicide on this bridge.

00:03:33.342 --> 00:03:36.900
After about an hour of speaking with Jason,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.635
he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.

00:03:40.635 --> 00:03:43.070
Recalling your Greek mythology,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.040
Zeus created Pandora,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.394
and sent her down to Earth with a box,

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:52.298
and told her, "Never, ever open that box."

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.940
Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.342
and she did open the box.

00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:00.194
Out flew plagues, sorrows,

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:03.406
and all sorts of evils against man.

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:07.985
The only good thing in the box was hope.

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:10.558
Jason then asked us,

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:13.542
"What happens when you open the box

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:16.724
and hope isn't there?"

00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:19.774
He paused a few moments,

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:22.213
leaned to his right,

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:24.414
and was gone.

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:28.284
This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:32.064
had just committed suicide.

00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:35.064
I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,

00:04:35.064 --> 00:04:37.626
and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:41.390
that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.610
because that very next day,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.130
their family rabbi called to check on me.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.924
Jason's parents had asked him to do so.

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:53.132
The collateral damage of suicide

00:04:53.132 --> 00:04:58.235
affects so many people.

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:01.216
I pose these questions to you:

00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:03.884
What would you do if your family member,

00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:06.992
friend or loved one was suicidal?

00:05:06.992 --> 00:05:09.426
What would you say?

00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:12.656
Would you know what to say?

00:05:12.656 --> 00:05:16.582
In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.830
but the listening.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.446
Listen to understand.

00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:25.974
Don't argue, blame,

00:05:25.974 --> 00:05:29.742
or tell the person you know how they feel,

00:05:29.742 --> 00:05:32.353
because you probably don't.

00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:35.264
By just being there,

00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:39.587
you may just be the turning point that they need.

00:05:39.587 --> 00:05:42.691
If you think someone is suicidal,

00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:46.405
don't be afraid to confront
them and ask the question.

00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:50.615
One way of asking them the question is like this:

00:05:50.615 --> 00:05:53.029
"Others in similar circumstances

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.197
have thought about ending their life;

00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:57.956
have you had these thoughts?"

00:05:57.956 --> 00:06:00.752
Confronting the person head-on

00:06:00.752 --> 00:06:04.702
may just save their life and
be the turning point for them.

00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:07.151
Some other signs to look for:

00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:11.299
hopelessness, believing that things are terrible

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:14.426
and never going to get better;

00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:17.871
helplessness, believing that there is nothing

00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:20.303
that you can do about it;

00:06:20.303 --> 00:06:22.900
recent social withdrawal;

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.717
and a loss of interest in life.

00:06:27.717 --> 00:06:31.639
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.840
and I received an email from a lady

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.325
that I'd like to read you her letter.

00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:47.437
She lost her son on January 19 of this year,

00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:49.250
and she wrote this me this email

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.620
just a couple of days ago,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.620
and it's with her permission and blessing

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.645
that I read this to you.

00:06:57.645 --> 00:07:01.647
"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.

00:07:01.647 --> 00:07:04.581
That must be quite the experience to be there.

00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:08.213
I'm thinking I should go walk
the bridge this weekend.

00:07:08.213 --> 00:07:10.746
Just wanted to drop you a note.

00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:12.967
Hope you get the word out to many people

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:15.079
and they go home talking about it

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:19.745
to their friends who tell their friends, etc.

00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:22.189
I'm still pretty numb,

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:25.261
but noticing more moments of really realizing

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:27.973
Mike isn't coming home.

00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:30.720
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.637
to watch the 49ers game with his father

00:07:32.637 --> 00:07:34.670
on January 19.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.614
He never made it there.

00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:39.661
I called Petaluma police

00:07:39.661 --> 00:07:42.157
and reported him missing that evening.

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:44.059
The next morning,

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:47.782
two officers came to my home

00:07:47.782 --> 00:07:52.286
and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.

00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:54.750
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.002
at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.

00:07:59.002 --> 00:08:01.622
Thanks so much

00:08:01.622 --> 00:08:02.806
for standing up for those

00:08:02.806 --> 00:08:05.358
who may be only temporarily too weak

00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:07.900
to stand for themselves.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.920
Who hasn't been low before

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.696
without suffering from a true mental illness?

00:08:13.696 --> 00:08:17.057
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.

00:08:17.057 --> 00:08:20.454
My prayers are with you for your fight.

00:08:20.454 --> 00:08:24.050
The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.776
is supposed to be a passage across

00:08:26.776 --> 00:08:28.859
our beautiful bay,

00:08:28.859 --> 00:08:31.546
not a graveyard.

00:08:31.546 --> 00:08:36.810
Good luck this week. Vicky."

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.853
I can't imagine the courage it takes for her

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.795
to go down to that bridge and walk the path

00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:45.233
that her son took that day,

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:50.307
and also the courage just to carry on.

00:08:50.307 --> 00:08:54.053
I'd like to introduce you to a man

00:08:54.053 --> 00:08:59.695
I refer to as hope and courage.

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:02.334
On March 11 of 2005,

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.997
I responded to a radio call of a possible

00:09:04.997 --> 00:09:07.211
suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:08.699
near the north tower.

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:11.387
I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk

00:09:11.387 --> 00:09:14.099
and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,

00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:16.635
standing on the sidewalk.

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:20.060
When he saw me, he immediately traversed

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.237
that pedestrian rail,

00:09:22.237 --> 00:09:23.109
and stood on that small pipe

00:09:23.109 --> 00:09:26.181
which goes around the tower.

00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:28.515
For the next hour and a half,

00:09:28.515 --> 00:09:31.443
I listened as Kevin spoke about

00:09:31.443 --> 00:09:34.331
his depression and hopelessness.

00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:37.005
Kevin decided on his own that day

00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:38.687
to come back over that rail

00:09:38.687 --> 00:09:41.419
and give life another chance.

00:09:41.419 --> 00:09:43.190
When Kevin came back over,

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.231
I congratulated him.

00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:47.981
"This is a new beginning, a new life."

00:09:47.981 --> 00:09:51.015
But I asked him, "What was it

00:09:51.015 --> 00:09:52.740
that made you come back

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.530
and give hope and life another chance?"

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.221
And you know what he told me?

00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:00.751
He said, "You listened.

00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:05.951
You let me speak, and you just listened."

00:10:05.951 --> 00:10:07.910
Shortly after this incident,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.169
I received a letter from Kevin's mother,

00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:14.081
and I have that letter with me,

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:16.931
and I'd like to read it to you.

00:10:16.931 --> 00:10:19.087
"Dear Mr. Briggs,

00:10:19.087 --> 00:10:21.952
Nothing will erase the events of March 11,

00:10:21.952 --> 00:10:25.080
but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.373
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.

00:10:29.373 --> 00:10:32.095
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness

00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:34.929
for which he has been properly medicated.

00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:38.297
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,

00:10:38.297 --> 00:10:42.245
completely unaware of any hereditary traits,

00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:46.429
but, thank God, now we know.

00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:49.255
Kevin is straight, as he says.

00:10:49.255 --> 00:10:51.940
We truly thank God for you.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.341
Sincerely indebted to you,

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:57.033
Narvella Berthia."

00:10:57.033 --> 00:10:59.081
And on the bottom she writes,

00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:04.517
"P.S. When I visited San Francisco
General Hospital that evening,

00:11:04.517 --> 00:11:06.445
you were listed as the patient.

00:11:06.445 --> 00:11:09.740
Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."

00:11:11.427 --> 00:11:15.557
Today, Kevin is a loving father

00:11:15.557 --> 00:11:18.242
and contributing member of society.

00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:19.711
He speaks openly

00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:22.645
about the events that day and his depression

00:11:22.645 --> 00:11:24.327
in the hopes that his story

00:11:24.327 --> 00:11:27.401
will inspire others.

00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:30.831
Suicide is not just something
I've encountered on the job.

00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:32.863
It's personal.

00:11:32.863 --> 00:11:36.737
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:40.611
That act, although ending his own pain,

00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:45.157
robbed me from ever getting to know him.

00:11:45.157 --> 00:11:47.823
This is what suicide does.

00:11:47.823 --> 00:11:50.171
For most suicidal folks,

00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:52.125
or those contemplating suicide,

00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:54.831
they wouldn't think of hurting another person.

00:11:54.831 --> 00:11:58.415
They just want their own pain to end.

00:11:58.415 --> 00:12:02.451
Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:

00:12:02.451 --> 00:12:08.109
sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.

00:12:08.109 --> 00:12:10.829
In my career, I've responded to

00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:13.182
and been involved in hundreds

00:12:13.182 --> 00:12:15.960
of mental illness and suicide calls

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.754
around the bridge.

00:12:17.754 --> 00:12:21.265
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,

00:12:21.265 --> 00:12:23.237
I've only lost two,

00:12:23.237 --> 00:12:25.423
but that's two too many.

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:27.435
One was Jason.

00:12:27.435 --> 00:12:29.691
The other was a man I spoke to

00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:31.374
for about an hour.

00:12:31.374 --> 00:12:33.790
During that time, he shook my hand

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.527
on three occasions.

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:38.603
On that final handshake,

00:12:38.603 --> 00:12:40.937
he looked at me, and he said,

00:12:40.937 --> 00:12:46.340
"Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.473
And he leapt.

00:12:48.473 --> 00:12:51.279
Horrible, absolutely horrible.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.255
I do want to tell you, though,

00:12:53.255 --> 00:12:55.607
the vast majority of folks

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:59.129
that we do get to contact on that bridge

00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:02.325
do not commit suicide.

00:13:02.325 --> 00:13:05.315
Additionally, that very few

00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:07.971
who have jumped off the bridge and lived

00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:09.317
and can talk about it,

00:13:09.317 --> 00:13:12.130
that one to two percent,

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.961
most of those folks have said

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.315
that the second that they let go of that rail,

00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:19.880
they knew that they had made a mistake

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.931
and they wanted to live.

00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:27.364
I tell people, the bridge not only connects

00:13:27.364 --> 00:13:29.645
Marin to San Francisco,

00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:32.837
but people together also.

00:13:32.837 --> 00:13:36.630
That connection, or bridge that we make,

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.059
is something that each and every one of us

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:41.053
should strive to do.

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:44.077
Suicide is preventable.

00:13:44.077 --> 00:13:47.411
There is help. There is hope.

00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:50.441
Thank you very much.

00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:54.441
(Applause)
