00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.240
There's a man by the name of Captain

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.570
William Swenson

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.772
who recently was awarded the
congressional Medal of Honor

00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:13.630
for his actions on September 8, 2009.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.995
On that day, a column of American

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:17.279
and Afghan troops

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.756
were making their way

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:21.640
through a part of Afghanistan

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.913
to help protect

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:26.008
a group of government officials,

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:27.854
a group of Afghan government officials,

00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:30.220
who would be meeting with some local

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.723
village elders.

00:00:31.723 --> 00:00:33.990
The column came under ambush,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.497
and was surrounded on three sides,

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:39.437
and amongst many other things,

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:40.843
Captain Swenson was recognized

00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:43.060
for running into live fire

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.241
to rescue the wounded

00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:48.464
and pull out the dead.

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:51.320
One of the people he rescued was a sergeant,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.758
and he and a comrade were making their way

00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:56.048
to a medevac helicopter.

00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:58.236
And what was remarkable about this day

00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.227
is, by sheer coincidence,

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.907
one of the medevac medics

00:01:01.907 --> 00:01:04.295
happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:09.057
and captured the whole scene on camera.

00:01:09.057 --> 00:01:12.263
It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:13.489
bringing this wounded soldier

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:18.039
who had received a gunshot to the neck.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.532
They put him in the helicopter,

00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:25.860
and then you see Captain Swenson bend over

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.043
and give him a kiss

00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:32.881
before he turns around to rescue more.

00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:36.088
I saw this, and I thought to myself,

00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:38.860
where do people like that come from?

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.903
What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:43.604
when you would want to do that.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.644
There's a love there,

00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:47.778
and I wanted to know why is it that

00:01:47.778 --> 00:01:50.462
I don't have people that I work with like that?

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:51.880
You know, in the military, they give medals

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.502
to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves

00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:56.340
so that others may gain.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.268
In business, we give bonuses to people

00:01:58.268 --> 00:01:59.976
who are willing to sacrifice others

00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:01.470
so that we may gain.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.134
We have it backwards. Right?

00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:07.013
So I asked myself, where do
people like this come from?

00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:10.236
And my initial conclusion was
that they're just better people.

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:11.756
That's why they're attracted to the military.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.217
These better people are attracted

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:15.963
to this concept of service.

00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:17.063
But that's completely wrong.

00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:19.900
What I learned was that it's the environment,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.070
and if you get the environment right,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.793
every single one of us has the capacity

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:25.311
to do these remarkable things,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.142
and more importantly, others have that capacity too.

00:02:28.142 --> 00:02:30.587
I've had the great honor of getting to meet

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:33.702
some of these, who we would call heroes,

00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:35.604
who have put themselves and put their lives

00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:37.203
at risk to save others,

00:02:37.203 --> 00:02:39.706
and I asked them, "Why would you do it?

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:41.759
Why did you do it?"

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.660
And they all say the same thing:

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.760
"Because they would have done it for me."

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.667
It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:52.266
So trust and cooperation are really important here.

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:55.425
The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.730
is that they are feelings, they are not instructions.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.765
I can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will.

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:04.000
I can't simply instruct two people 
to cooperate, and they will.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.434
It's not how it works. It's a feeling.

00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:08.848
So where does that feeling come from?

00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:10.930
If you go back 50,000 years

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.109
to the Paleolithic era,

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.265
to the early days of Homo sapiens,

00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:15.880
what we find is that the world

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.215
was filled with danger,

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:22.607
all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.

00:03:22.607 --> 00:03:24.106
Nothing personal.

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:26.548
Whether it was the weather,

00:03:26.548 --> 00:03:28.188
lack of resources,

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:29.670
maybe a saber-toothed tiger,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.005
all of these things working

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:33.141
to reduce our lifespan.

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:35.442
And so we evolved into social animals,

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:37.417
where we lived together and worked together

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:40.841
in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,

00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:42.864
where we felt like we belonged.

00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:45.595
And when we felt safe amongst our own,

00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:48.803
the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.

00:03:48.803 --> 00:03:49.905
There are inherent benefits to this.

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:51.793
It means I can fall asleep at night

00:03:51.793 --> 00:03:55.665
and trust that someone from within
my tribe will watch for danger.

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:57.997
If we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,

00:03:57.997 --> 00:03:59.381
that means you won't watch for danger.

00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:01.252
Bad system of survival.

00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:03.591
The modern day is exactly the same thing.

00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:05.212
The world is filled with danger,

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.967
things that are trying to frustrate our lives

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:08.136
or reduce our success,

00:04:08.136 --> 00:04:09.860
reduce our opportunity for success.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.229
It could be the ups and downs in the economy,

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.569
the uncertainty of the stock market.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.313
It could be a new technology that renders

00:04:16.313 --> 00:04:18.470
your business model obsolete overnight.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.119
Or it could be your competition

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:22.119
that is sometimes trying to kill you.

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:24.004
It's sometimes trying to put you out of business,

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:25.715
but at the very minimum

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:28.378
is working hard to frustrate your growth

00:04:28.378 --> 00:04:30.508
and steal your business from you.

00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:32.253
We have no control over these forces.

00:04:32.253 --> 00:04:33.770
These are a constant,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.748
and they're not going away.

00:04:35.748 --> 00:04:37.794
The only variable are the conditions

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:40.357
inside the organization,

00:04:40.357 --> 00:04:42.282
and that's where leadership matters,

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.961
because it's the leader that sets the tone.

00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:47.400
When a leader makes the choice

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.929
to put the safety and lives

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:51.190
of the people inside the organization first,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.068
to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice

00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:57.573
the tangible results, so that the people remain

00:04:57.573 --> 00:04:59.000
and feel safe and feel like they belong,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.894
remarkable things happen.

00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:05.013
I was flying on a trip,

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.128
and I was witness to an incident

00:05:07.128 --> 00:05:09.016
where a passenger attempted to board

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:12.627
before their number was called,

00:05:12.627 --> 00:05:15.196
and I watched the gate agent

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:17.620
treat this man like he had broken the law,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.029
like a criminal.

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.875
He was yelled at for attempting to board

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:23.246
one group too soon.

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:24.690
So I said something.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.360
I said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.451
Why can't you treat us like human beings?"

00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:32.572
And this is exactly what she said to me.

00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:35.258
She said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules,

00:05:35.258 --> 00:05:38.408
I could get in trouble or lose my job."

00:05:38.408 --> 00:05:39.990
All she was telling me

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.646
is that she doesn't feel safe.

00:05:41.646 --> 00:05:43.987
All she was telling me is that

00:05:43.987 --> 00:05:47.206
she doesn't trust her leaders.

00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:49.928
The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines

00:05:49.928 --> 00:05:52.395
is not because they necessarily hire better people.

00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:55.434
It's because they don't fear their leaders.

00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:57.356
You see, if the conditions are wrong,

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.615
we are forced to expend our own time and energy

00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:02.479
to protect ourselves from each other,

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.778
and that inherently weakens the organization.

00:06:05.778 --> 00:06:07.409
When we feel safe inside the organization,

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.603
we will naturally combine our talents

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:11.749
and our strengths and work tirelessly

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:13.431
to face the dangers outside

00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:16.566
and seize the opportunities.

00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:17.887
The closest analogy I can give

00:06:17.887 --> 00:06:21.099
to what a great leader is, is like being a parent.

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.758
If you think about what being a great parent is,

00:06:22.758 --> 00:06:24.588
what do you want? What makes a great parent?

00:06:24.588 --> 00:06:25.940
We want to give our child opportunities,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.658
education, discipline them when necessary,

00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:30.694
all so that they can grow up and achieve more

00:06:30.694 --> 00:06:33.259
than we could for ourselves.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.000
Great leaders want exactly the same thing.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.501
They want to provide their people opportunity,

00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:38.288
education, discipline when necessary,

00:06:38.288 --> 00:06:41.450
build their self-confidence, give
them the opportunity to try and fail,

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.161
all so that they could achieve more

00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:47.591
than we could ever imagine for ourselves.

00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:50.728
Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of
a company called Next Jump

00:06:50.728 --> 00:06:53.478
in New York City, a tech company,

00:06:53.478 --> 00:06:54.970
he makes the point that

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.099
if you had hard times in your family,

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.148
would you ever consider laying
off one of your children?

00:07:00.148 --> 00:07:01.650
We would never do it.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.677
Then why do we consider laying off people

00:07:03.677 --> 00:07:05.254
inside our organization?

00:07:05.254 --> 00:07:08.054
Charlie implemented a policy

00:07:08.054 --> 00:07:09.990
of lifetime employment.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.620
If you get a job at Next Jump,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.080
you cannot get fired for performance issues.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.063
In fact, if you have issues,

00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:20.110
they will coach you and they will give you support,

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.571
just like we would with one of our children

00:07:21.571 --> 00:07:24.410
who happens to come home with a C from school.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.363
It's the complete opposite.

00:07:25.363 --> 00:07:26.980
This is the reason so many people

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.244
have such a visceral hatred, anger,

00:07:31.244 --> 00:07:32.912
at some of these banking CEOs

00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:35.740
with their disproportionate
salaries and bonus structures.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.710
It's not the numbers.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.548
It's that they have violated the
very definition of leadership.

00:07:40.548 --> 00:07:43.442
They have violated this deep-seated social contract.

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:45.045
We know that they allowed their people

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:47.560
to be sacrificed so they could
protect their own interests,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.752
or worse, they sacrificed their people

00:07:50.752 --> 00:07:52.212
to protect their own interests.

00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:55.023
This is what so offends us, not the numbers.

00:07:55.023 --> 00:07:56.620
Would anybody be offended if we gave

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.193
a $150 million bonus to Gandhi?

00:07:59.193 --> 00:08:02.232
How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.966
Do we have an issue with that? None at all.

00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:06.298
None at all.

00:08:06.298 --> 00:08:08.509
Great leaders would never sacrifice

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:09.870
the people to save the numbers.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.549
They would sooner sacrifice the numbers

00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:14.528
to save the people.

00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:16.651
Bob Chapman, who runs

00:08:16.651 --> 00:08:18.964
a large manufacturing company in the Midwest

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:21.040
called Barry-Wehmiller,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.397
in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,

00:08:26.397 --> 00:08:30.398
and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.

00:08:30.398 --> 00:08:31.784
Now in a large manufacturing company,

00:08:31.784 --> 00:08:33.325
this is a big deal,

00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:36.172
and they could no longer afford their labor pool.

00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:37.875
They needed to save 10 million dollars,

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:39.898
so, like so many companies today,

00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:43.292
the board got together and discussed layoffs.

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:44.916
And Bob refused.

00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:49.168
You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts.

00:08:49.168 --> 00:08:52.609
Bob believes in heart counts,

00:08:52.609 --> 00:08:55.117
and it's much more difficult to simply reduce

00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:56.847
the heart count.

00:08:56.847 --> 00:08:59.854
And so they came up with a furlough program.

00:08:59.854 --> 00:09:01.945
Every employee, from secretary to CEO,

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:05.411
was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:07.322
They could take it any time they wanted,

00:09:07.322 --> 00:09:10.303
and they did not have to take it consecutively.

00:09:10.303 --> 00:09:11.635
But it was how Bob announced the program

00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:13.532
that mattered so much.

00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:16.180
He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.965
than any of us should have to suffer a lot,

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:22.083
and morale went up.

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:25.010
They saved 20 million dollars,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.447
and most importantly, as would be expected,

00:09:27.447 --> 00:09:30.676
when the people feel safe and protected
by the leadership in the organization,

00:09:30.676 --> 00:09:33.183
the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.

00:09:33.183 --> 00:09:35.940
And quite spontaneously, nobody expected,

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.856
people started trading with each other.

00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:39.352
Those who could afford it more

00:09:39.352 --> 00:09:41.429
would trade with those who could afford it less.

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:42.918
People would take five weeks

00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:47.080
so that somebody else only had to take three.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.014
Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank.

00:09:50.014 --> 00:09:51.722
I know many people at the seniormost

00:09:51.722 --> 00:09:52.880
levels of organizations

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.484
who are absolutely not leaders.

00:09:54.484 --> 00:09:57.037
They are authorities, and we do what they say

00:09:57.037 --> 00:10:00.080
because they have authority over us,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.940
but we would not follow them.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.974
And I know many people

00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:05.336
who are at the bottoms of organizations

00:10:05.336 --> 00:10:06.599
who have no authority

00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:08.662
and they are absolutely leaders,

00:10:08.662 --> 00:10:10.447
and this is because they have chosen to look after

00:10:10.447 --> 00:10:11.965
the person to the left of them,

00:10:11.965 --> 00:10:13.243
and they have chosen to look after

00:10:13.243 --> 00:10:15.037
the person to the right of them.

00:10:15.037 --> 00:10:19.770
This is what a leader is.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.800
I heard a story

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.390
of some Marines

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.711
who were out in theater,

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.757
and as is the Marine custom,

00:10:29.757 --> 00:10:32.082
the officer ate last,

00:10:32.082 --> 00:10:35.258
and he let his men eat first,

00:10:35.258 --> 00:10:37.110
and when they were done,

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.200
there was no food left for him.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.933
And when they went back out in the field,

00:10:43.933 --> 00:10:46.877
his men brought him some of their food

00:10:46.877 --> 00:10:48.734
so that he may eat,

00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:50.873
because that's what happens.

00:10:50.873 --> 00:10:53.562
We call them leaders because they go first.

00:10:53.562 --> 00:10:55.305
We call them leaders because they take the risk

00:10:55.305 --> 00:10:56.960
before anybody else does.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.990
We call them leaders because they will choose

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.999
to sacrifice so that their people

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:02.118
may be safe and protected

00:11:02.118 --> 00:11:04.254
and so their people may gain,

00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:07.308
and when we do, the natural response

00:11:07.308 --> 00:11:11.155
is that our people will sacrifice for us.

00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:13.653
They will give us their blood and sweat and tears

00:11:13.653 --> 00:11:17.092
to see that their leader's vision comes to life,

00:11:17.092 --> 00:11:19.864
and when we ask them, "Why would you do that?

00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:22.251
Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears

00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:26.735
for that person?" they all say the same thing:

00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:29.233
"Because they would have done it for me."

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:31.383
And isn't that the organization

00:11:31.383 --> 00:11:33.704
we would all like to work in?

00:11:33.704 --> 00:11:36.261
Thank you very much.

00:11:36.261 --> 00:11:39.862
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:39.862 --> 00:11:41.892
Thank you. (Applause)
