WEBVTT

00:00:00.693 --> 00:00:02.948
I'm going to ask and try to answer,

00:00:02.948 --> 00:00:07.846
in some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.

00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:10.200
Both civilians, obviously, and soldiers

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.286
suffer in war;

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:14.750
I don't think any civilian has ever missed

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.112
the war that they were subjected to.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:20.130
I've been covering wars for almost 20 years,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.458
and one of the remarkable things for me

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:27.342
is how many soldiers find themselves missing it.

00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:29.647
How is it someone can go through

00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:31.984
the worst experience imaginable,

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:33.960
and come home, back to their home,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.421
and their family, their country, and miss the war?

00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.992
How does that work? What does it mean?

00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:44.450
We have to answer that question,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.317
because if we don't, it'll be impossible

00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:48.585
to bring soldiers back

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:52.640
to a place in society where they belong,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.893
and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war,

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:57.911
if we don't understand how that mechanism works.

00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:01.173
The problem is that war

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:05.010
does not have a simple, neat truth,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.709
one simple, neat truth.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.970
Any sane person hates war,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.825
hates the idea of war,

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:14.402
wouldn't want to have anything to do with it,

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:17.518
doesn't want to be near it,
doesn't want to know about it.

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:20.202
That's a sane response to war.

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:22.969
But if I asked all of you in this room,

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.327
who here has paid money

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:28.313
to go to a cinema

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:31.703
and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie,

00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:35.261
most of you would probably raise your hands.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.857
That's what's so complicated about war.

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:41.397
And trust me, if a room full of peace-loving people

00:01:41.397 --> 00:01:44.636
finds something compelling about war,

00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:47.379
so do 20-year-old soldiers

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:50.641
who have been trained in it, I promise you.

00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:53.945
That's the thing that has to be understood.

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:56.767
I've covered war for about 20 years, as I said,

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:59.393
but my most intense experiences in combat

00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:03.625
were with American soldiers in Afghanistan.

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:04.940
I've been in Africa, the Middle East,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.690
Afghanistan in the '90s,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.537
but it was with American soldiers in 2007, 2008,

00:02:10.537 --> 00:02:13.170
that I was confronted with

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.690
very intense combat.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.730
I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.563
in eastern Afghanistan.

00:02:19.563 --> 00:02:21.349
It was six miles long.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.491
There were 150 men of
Battle Company in that valley,

00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:28.025
and for a while, while I was there,

00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:30.301
almost 20 percent of all the combat

00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:32.097
in all of Afghanistan was happening

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:33.930
in those six miles.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.481
A hundred and fifty men were absorbing

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:39.633
almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:42.159
in the country, for a couple months.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.296
It was very intense.

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.365
I spent most of my time at a small outpost

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.939
called Restrepo.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.499
It was named after the platoon medic

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.353
that had been killed about two
months into the deployment.

00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:56.293
It was a few plywood B-huts

00:02:56.293 --> 00:03:00.102
clinging to a side of a ridge,

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:04.879
and sandbags, bunkers, gun positions,

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.690
and there were 20 men up there

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.775
of Second Platoon, Battle Company.

00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:10.375
I spent most of my time up there.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:11.990
There was no running water.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.001
There was no way to bathe.

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.440
The guys were up there for a month at a time.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.964
They never even got out of their clothes.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.114
They fought. The worked.

00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:21.860
They slept in the same clothes.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.339
They never took them off,
and at the end of the month,

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.650
they went back down to the company headquarters,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.717
and by then, their clothes were unwearable.

00:03:27.717 --> 00:03:30.010
They burned them and got a new set.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.720
There was no Internet. There was no phone.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.629
There was no communication
with the outside world up there.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.459
There was no cooked food.

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.030
There was nothing up there

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.930
that young men typically like:

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.211
no cars, no girls, no television, nothing

00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:48.075
except combat.

00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:52.036
Combat they did learn to like.

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:54.487
I remember one day, it was a very hot day

00:03:54.487 --> 00:03:56.253
in the spring,

00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:58.634
and we hadn't been in a fight

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:01.080
in a couple of weeks, maybe.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.644
Usually, the outpost was attacked,

00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:06.507
and we hadn't seen any
combat in a couple of weeks,

00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:09.110
and everyone was just stunned

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.267
with boredom and heat.

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:15.801
And I remember the lieutenant walking past me

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:17.274
sort of stripped to the waist.

00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:19.676
It was incredibly hot.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.040
Stripped to the waist, walked past me muttering,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.792
"Oh God, please someone attack us today."

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:27.142
That's how bored they were.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:30.208
That's war too, is a lieutenant saying,

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:32.868
"Please make something happen

00:04:32.868 --> 00:04:34.911
because we're going crazy."

00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:37.259
To understand that,

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.169
you have to, for a moment,

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.570
think about combat not morally --

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.455
that's an important job to do —

00:04:43.455 --> 00:04:45.348
but for a moment, don't think about it morally,

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:48.219
think about it neurologically.

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.431
Let's think about what happens in your brain

00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:52.804
when you're in combat.

00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:55.156
First of all, the experience

00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:59.770
is very bizarre, it's a very bizarre one.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.760
It's not what I had expected.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.490
Usually, you're not scared.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.610
I've been very scared in combat,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.712
but most of the time when I was out there,

00:05:08.712 --> 00:05:09.839
I wasn't scared.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.366
I was very scared beforehand

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:13.281
and incredibly scared afterwards,

00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:15.883
and that fear that comes afterwards can last years.

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:17.835
I haven't been shot at in six years,

00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:20.188
and I was woken up very abruptly this morning

00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:23.433
by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft,

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:24.640
six years later.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.374
I've never even been strafed by aircraft,

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:29.750
and I was having nightmares about it.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.123
Time slows down.

00:05:31.123 --> 00:05:33.347
You get this weird tunnel vision.

00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:37.008
You notice some details very, very, very accurately

00:05:37.008 --> 00:05:39.195
and other things drop out.

00:05:39.195 --> 00:05:42.158
It's almost a slightly altered state of mind.

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:43.629
What's happening in your brain

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.346
is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.166
pumped through your system.

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:50.760
Young men will go to great lengths

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.096
to have that experience.

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:56.018
It's wired into us.

00:05:56.018 --> 00:05:59.860
It's hormonally supported.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.745
The mortality rate for young men in society

00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:06.165
is six times what it is for young women

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.970
from violence and from accidents,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.159
just the stupid stuff that young men do:

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.461
jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of,

00:06:12.461 --> 00:06:14.880
lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.118
I mean, you know what I'm talking about.

00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:19.159
They die at six times the rate

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:20.599
that young women do.

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.503
Statistically, you are safer as a teenage boy,

00:06:24.503 --> 00:06:27.146
you would be safer in the fire department

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:29.710
or the police department in most American cities

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.232
than just walking around the
streets of your hometown

00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:34.590
looking for something to do,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.640
statistically.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.888
You can imagine how that plays out in combat.

00:06:40.888 --> 00:06:43.950
At Restrepo, every guy up there was almost killed,

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.644
including me,

00:06:45.644 --> 00:06:47.704
including my good friend Tim Hetherington,

00:06:47.704 --> 00:06:50.126
who was later killed in Libya.

00:06:50.126 --> 00:06:51.802
There were guys walking around

00:06:51.802 --> 00:06:53.623
with bullet holes in their uniforms,

00:06:53.623 --> 00:06:55.510
rounds that had cut through the fabric

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.892
and didn't touch their bodies.

00:06:58.892 --> 00:07:01.974
I was leaning against some sandbags one morning,

00:07:01.974 --> 00:07:04.971
not much going on, sort of spacing out,

00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:08.478
and some sand was kicked into the side of,

00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:11.148
sort of hit the side of my face.

00:07:11.148 --> 00:07:13.361
Something hit the side of my face,
and I didn't know what it was.

00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:14.900
You have to understand about bullets

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.798
that they go a lot faster than sound,

00:07:16.798 --> 00:07:18.211
so if someone shoots at you

00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:20.268
from a few hundred meters,

00:07:20.268 --> 00:07:23.411
the bullet goes by you, or hits you obviously,

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:26.063
half a second or so before
the sound catches up to it.

00:07:26.063 --> 00:07:28.950
So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.950
Half a second later, I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.964
It was machine gun fire.

00:07:31.964 --> 00:07:34.310
It was the first round, the first burst

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.173
of an hour-long firefight.

00:07:37.173 --> 00:07:40.238
What had happened was the bullet hit,

00:07:40.238 --> 00:07:43.981
a bullet hit three or four inches
from the side of my head.

00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:48.630
Imagine, just think about it, because I certainly did,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.510
think about the angle of deviation that saved my life.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.972
At 400 meters, it missed me by three inches.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:57.268
Just think about the math on that.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.052
Every guy up there

00:07:59.052 --> 00:08:00.974
had some experience like that,

00:08:00.974 --> 00:08:04.502
at least once, if not many times.

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:06.982
The boys are up there for a year.

00:08:06.982 --> 00:08:08.751
They got back.

00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:10.110
Some of them got out of the Army

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.704
and had tremendous psychological
problems when they got home.

00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:14.239
Some of them stayed in the Army

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:17.862
and were more or less okay, psychologically.

00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:20.939
I was particularly close to a
guy named Brendan O'Byrne.

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:22.827
I'm still very good friends with him.

00:08:22.827 --> 00:08:25.883
He came back to the States. He got out of the Army.

00:08:25.883 --> 00:08:27.851
I had a dinner party one night.

00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:29.645
I invited him,

00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:33.080
and he started talking with a woman,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.317
one of my friends,

00:08:34.317 --> 00:08:37.369
and she knew how bad it had been out there,

00:08:37.369 --> 00:08:39.118
and she said, "Brendan,

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:42.446
is there anything at all that you miss about

00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:46.000
being out in Afghanistan, about the war?"

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.169
And he thought about it quite a long time,

00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:54.552
and finally he said, "Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."

00:08:54.552 --> 00:08:57.994
And he's one of the most traumatized people

00:08:57.994 --> 00:09:01.083
I've seen from that war.

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:03.094
"Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."

00:09:03.094 --> 00:09:06.179
What is he talking about?

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:09.621
He's not a psychopath.

00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:11.280
He doesn't miss killing people.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.560
He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.262
and seeing his friends get killed.

00:09:15.262 --> 00:09:19.090
What is it that he misses? We have to answer that.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:25.816
If we're going to stop war, we
have to answer that question.

00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:30.994
I think what he missed is brotherhood.

00:09:30.994 --> 00:09:32.750
He missed, in some ways,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.146
the opposite of killing.

00:09:34.146 --> 00:09:36.478
What he missed was connection

00:09:36.478 --> 00:09:38.826
to the other men he was with.

00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:41.342
Now, brotherhood is different from friendship.

00:09:41.342 --> 00:09:45.096
Friendship happens in society, obviously.

00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:46.634
The more you like someone,

00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:48.708
the more you'd be willing to do for them.

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:50.214
Brotherhood has nothing to do

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:53.706
with how you feel about the other person.

00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:56.688
It's a mutual agreement in a group

00:09:56.688 --> 00:09:58.930
that you will put the welfare of the group,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.950
you will put the safety of everyone in the group

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.810
above your own.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.187
In effect, you're saying,

00:10:06.187 --> 00:10:11.602
"I love these other people more than I love myself."

00:10:11.602 --> 00:10:13.000
Brendan was a team leader

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.863
in command of three men,

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:18.300
and the worst day in Afghanistan —

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.179
He was almost killed so many times.

00:10:21.179 --> 00:10:22.514
It didn't bother him.

00:10:22.514 --> 00:10:25.092
The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:27.908
was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet

00:10:27.908 --> 00:10:32.392
in the helmet, knocked him over.

00:10:32.392 --> 00:10:33.520
They thought he was dead.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.970
It was in the middle of a huge firefight.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.990
No one could deal with it, and a minute later,

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.030
Kyle Steiner sat back up

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.955
from the dead, as it were,

00:10:40.955 --> 00:10:42.980
because he'd come back to consciousness.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.252
The bullet had just knocked him out.

00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:46.179
It glanced off the helmet.

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:48.245
He remembers people saying,

00:10:48.245 --> 00:10:49.707
as he was sort of half-conscious,

00:10:49.707 --> 00:10:53.206
he remembers people saying,

00:10:53.206 --> 00:10:55.277
"Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead."

00:10:55.277 --> 00:10:56.899
And he was thinking, "I'm not dead."

00:10:56.899 --> 00:10:58.647
And he sat up.

00:10:58.647 --> 00:11:00.844
And Brendan realized after that

00:11:00.844 --> 00:11:02.485
that he could not protect his men,

00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:04.863
and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan,

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:07.828
was realizing that.

00:11:07.828 --> 00:11:10.340
That's brotherhood.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.772
This wasn't invented recently.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:15.269
Many of you have probably read "The Iliad."

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:17.240
Achilles surely would have risked his life

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.018
or given his life to save his friend Patroclus.

00:11:22.018 --> 00:11:24.956
In World War II, there were many stories

00:11:24.956 --> 00:11:28.032
of soldiers who were wounded,

00:11:28.032 --> 00:11:30.099
were brought to a rear base hospital,

00:11:30.099 --> 00:11:31.455
who went AWOL,

00:11:31.455 --> 00:11:33.675
crawled out of windows, slipped out doors,

00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:37.273
went AWOL, wounded,

00:11:37.273 --> 00:11:38.675
to make their way back to the front lines

00:11:38.675 --> 00:11:41.311
to rejoin their brothers out there.

00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:43.660
So you think about Brendan,

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.016
you think about all these soldiers

00:11:47.016 --> 00:11:49.901
having an experience like that, a bond like that,

00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:51.781
in a small group,

00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:53.679
where they loved 20 other people

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:56.598
in some ways more than they loved themselves,

00:11:56.598 --> 00:12:01.714
you think about how good that would feel, imagine it,

00:12:01.714 --> 00:12:06.344
and they are blessed with that experience for a year,

00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:07.833
and then they come home,

00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:10.820
and they are just back in society

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.659
like the rest of us are,

00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:16.085
not knowing who they can count on,

00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:21.262
not knowing who loves them, who they can love,

00:12:21.262 --> 00:12:23.853
not knowing exactly what anyone they know

00:12:23.853 --> 00:12:26.087
would do for them if it came down to it.

00:12:26.087 --> 00:12:29.673
That is terrifying.

00:12:29.673 --> 00:12:31.663
Compared to that,

00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:35.737
war, psychologically, in some ways, is easy,

00:12:35.737 --> 00:12:38.234
compared to that kind of alienation.

00:12:38.234 --> 00:12:39.624
That's why they miss it,

00:12:39.624 --> 00:12:42.102
and that's what we have to understand

00:12:42.102 --> 00:12:45.505
and in some ways fix in our society.

00:12:45.505 --> 00:12:48.435
Thank you very much.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.390
(Applause)
