00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.015
The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online

00:00:04.015 --> 00:00:06.388
started out the way most things do:

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:09.911
without me, and not online.

00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:12.819
On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.654
Alfred Nobel, died.

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:16.910
One hundred years later, exactly, actually,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.476
December 10, 1996,

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:20.475
this charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:22.636
won the Nobel Prize for literature.

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:24.277
She's a Polish poet.

00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:25.525
She's a big deal, obviously,

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.164
but back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,

00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:29.683
and when I checked out her work,

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:31.179
I found this sweet little poem,

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.780
"Four in the Morning."

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.045
"The hour from night to day.

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:35.431
The hour from side to side.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.229
The hour for those past thirty..."

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.316
And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:41.239
I fell for it hard,

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.180
so hard, I suspected we must have met

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.593
somewhere before.

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:47.892
Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?

00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:49.412
Did I flirt with this poem

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:50.557
in a coffee shop somewhere?

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:52.069
I could not place it, and it bugged me,

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:53.971
and then in the coming week or two,

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:55.420
I would just be watching an old movie,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.702
and this would happen.

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:57.965
(Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, you
should have come to the first party.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:00.317
We didn't get home till around four in the morning.

00:01:00.317 --> 00:01:02.589
Rives: My roommates would have the TV on,

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.271
and this would happen.

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:05.890
(Music: Seinfeld theme)

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.671
(Video) George Costanza: Oh boy, 
I was up til four in the morning

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:10.360
watching that Omen trilogy.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.597
Rives: I would be listening to music,

00:01:11.597 --> 00:01:13.124
and this would happen.

00:01:13.124 --> 00:01:15.938
(Video) Elton John: ♪ It's four o'clock
in the morning, damn it. ♪

00:01:15.938 --> 00:01:18.139
Rives: So you can see what was going on, right?

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:21.130
Obviously, the demigods of coincidence

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.818
were just messing with me.

00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:24.309
Some people get a number stuck in their head,

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:26.914
you may recognize a certain name or a tune,

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:28.699
some people get nothing, but four in the morning

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:31.600
was in me now, but mildly,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.114
like a groin injury.

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:35.586
I always assumed it would just go away

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:37.095
on its own eventually,

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:38.681
and I never talked about it with anybody,

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.233
but it did not, and I totally did.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.314
In 2007, I was invited to speak at TED

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:45.230
for the second time,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.732
and since I was still an authority on nothing,

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:51.123
I thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation

00:01:51.123 --> 00:01:52.711
on a topic so niche

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.558
it is actually inconsequential

00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:55.971
or actually cockamamie.

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.147
So my talk had some of my
four in the morning examples,

00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:00.525
but it also had examples

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.581
from my fellow TED speakers that year.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.035
I found four in the morning in a novel

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:05.311
by Isabel Allende.

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:06.842
I found a really great one

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:08.998
in the autobiography of Bill Clinton.

00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:10.643
I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,

00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:12.080
although Matt Groening told me later

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.898
that he could not make my talk

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.662
because it was a morning session

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:17.382
and I gather that he is not an early riser.

00:02:17.382 --> 00:02:20.970
However, had Matt been there,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.948
he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory

00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:26.563
that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:27.724
It was totally contrived

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:29.740
just for that room, just for that moment.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.897
That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.

00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:34.556
It was fun. That was pretty much it.

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:37.531
When I got home, though,
the emails started coming in

00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:38.970
from people who had seen the talk live,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.264
beginning with, and this is still my favorite,

00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:42.931
"Here's another one for your collection:

00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:45.571
'It's the friends you can call
up at 4 a.m. that matter.'"

00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:47.411
The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.

00:02:47.411 --> 00:02:50.392
The email itself was from another very

00:02:50.392 --> 00:02:52.453
sexy European type,

00:02:52.453 --> 00:02:54.941
TED Curator Chris Anderson.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:56.353
(Laughter)

00:02:56.353 --> 00:02:57.805
Chris found this quote

00:02:57.805 --> 00:02:59.207
on a coffee cup or something,

00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:01.670
and I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.809
of ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.024
I am contagious,

00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:08.031
which was confirmed less than a week later

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:10.070
when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.312
an actual greeting card

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:12.692
with that same quotation.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.929
As a bonus, she hooked me up
with a second one they make.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.549
It says, "Just knowing I can call you

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.964
at four in the morning if I need to

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:20.012
makes me not really need to,"

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:21.685
which I love, because together these are like,

00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:23.375
"Hallmark: When you care enough

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.438
to send the very best twice,

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.406
phrased slightly differently."

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:31.338
I was not surprised at the TEDster

00:03:31.338 --> 00:03:33.050
and New Yorker magazine overlap.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.075
A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:38.135
"It's 4 a.m.—maybe you'd sleep
better if you bought some crap."

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.877
I was surprised at the TEDster/"Rugrats" overlap.

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:43.637
More than one person sent me this.

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:45.516
(Video) Didi Pickles: It's
four o'clock in the morning.

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.748
Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding?

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:49.884
Stu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life.

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:52.010
(Laughter)

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.607
Rives: And then there was the lone TEDster

00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:55.487
who was disgruntled I had overlooked

00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:57.503
what he considers to be a classic.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.422
(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up! I'm not kidding.
Ronnie Neary: Is there an accident?

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:03.847
Roy: No, it's not an accident. You
wanted to get out of the house anyway, right?

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:05.983
Ronnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning.

00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:07.177
Rives: So that's "Close Encounters,"

00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:08.501
and the main character is all worked up

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:10.017
because aliens, momentously,

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.539
have chosen to show themselves to earthlings

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:12.565
at four in the morning,

00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:14.319
which does make that a very solid example.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.343
Those were all really solid examples.

00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:18.310
They did not get me any closer to understanding

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.911
why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.

00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:22.999
But they followed the pattern. They played along.

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.783
Right? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour

00:04:25.783 --> 00:04:27.553
when all these dramatic occurrences

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:29.919
allegedly occur.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.591
Maybe this was some kind of cliche

00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:33.439
that had never been taxonomized before.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.189
Maybe I was on the trail

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:36.255
of a new meme or something.

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.027
Just when things were getting pretty interesting,

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:40.636
things got really interesting.

00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:42.991
TED.com launched, later that year,

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.823
with a bunch of videos from past talks,

00:04:44.823 --> 00:04:45.723
including mine,

00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:48.597
and I started receiving "four in the morning" citations

00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:51.160
from what seemed like every
time zone on the planet.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.871
Much of it was content I never would have found

00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:55.295
on my own if I was looking for it,

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.833
and I was not.

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.480
I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.110
I probably would have missed the booklet,

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.647
"Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning."

00:05:01.647 --> 00:05:04.570
(Laughter)

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.475
I do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:11.967
although it looks delightful. (Laughter)

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:13.279
Take note of those clock ends.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.619
This is a college student's suggestion

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:16.285
for what a "four in the morning" gang sign

00:05:16.285 --> 00:05:18.639
should look like.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.727
People sent me magazine ads.

00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:22.810
They took photographs in grocery stores.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.277
I got a ton of graphic novels and comics.

00:05:26.277 --> 00:05:27.981
A lot of good quality work, too:

00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:29.650
"The Sandman," "Watchmen."

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.081
There's a very cute example
here from "Calvin and Hobbes."

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:35.186
In fact, the oldest citation anybody sent in

00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:37.621
was from a cartoon from the Stone Age.

00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:39.283
Take a look.

00:05:39.283 --> 00:05:41.170
(Video) Wilma Flintstone: Like how early?

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.287
Fred Flintstone: Like at 4 a.m., that's how early.

00:05:44.287 --> 00:05:46.007
Rives: And the flip side of the timeline,

00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:47.572
this is from the 31st century.

00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:48.769
A thousand years from now,

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:51.565
people are still doing this.

00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:54.105
(Video): Announcer: The time is 4 a.m.

00:05:54.105 --> 00:05:55.192
(Laughter)

00:05:55.192 --> 00:05:56.386
Rives: It shows the spectrum.

00:05:56.386 --> 00:06:00.220
I received so many songs, TV shows, movies,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.400
like from dismal to famous,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.362
I could give you a four-hour playlist.

00:06:04.362 --> 00:06:06.736
If I just stick to modern male movie stars,

00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:07.932
I keep it to the length

00:06:07.932 --> 00:06:09.268
of about a commercial.

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:10.998
Here's your sampler.

00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:13.924
(Movie montage of "It's 4 a.m.")

00:06:37.932 --> 00:06:40.384
(Laughter)

00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:42.526
Rives: So somewhere along the line,

00:06:42.526 --> 00:06:44.272
I realized I have a hobby

00:06:44.272 --> 00:06:46.290
I didn't know I wanted,

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.960
and it is crowdsourced.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.322
But I was also thinking what you might be thinking,

00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:52.944
which is really, couldn't you do this

00:06:52.944 --> 00:06:54.050
with any hour of the day?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.688
First of all, you are not getting clips like that

00:06:55.688 --> 00:06:57.272
about four in the afternoon.

00:06:57.272 --> 00:06:58.976
Secondly, I did a little research.

00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:00.448
You know, I was kind of interested.

00:07:00.448 --> 00:07:02.656
If this is confirmation bias,

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:05.267
there is so much confirmation, I am biased.

00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:06.513
Literature probably shows it best.

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:08.657
There are a couple three in
the mornings in Shakespeare.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.000
There's a five in the morning.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.388
There are seven four in the mornings,

00:07:11.388 --> 00:07:12.241
and they're all very dire.

00:07:12.241 --> 00:07:15.592
In "Measure for Measure," it's
the call time for the executioner.

00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:18.488
Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia

00:07:18.488 --> 00:07:20.320
at four in the morning right before battle

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.030
in "War and Peace."

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.746
Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" has got kind of

00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:24.875
a pivotal four in the morning,

00:07:24.875 --> 00:07:28.103
as does Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights."

00:07:28.103 --> 00:07:31.301
"Lolita" has as a creepy four in the morning.

00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:35.033
"Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:38.130
Someone sent in H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man."

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.241
Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man."

00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.641
"The Great Gatsby" spends the last

00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:45.251
four in the morning of his life

00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:47.449
waiting for a lover who never shows,

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:50.080
and the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.569
"The Metamorphosis."

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:53.721
First paragraph, the main character wakes up

00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:55.761
transformed into a giant cockroach,

00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:58.967
but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding,

00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:00.890
something is up with this guy.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.810
Why? His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.159
What kind of person would do that?

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:09.178
This kind of person would do that.

00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:13.490
(Music)

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.784
(4 a.m. alarm clock montage)

00:08:18.784 --> 00:08:21.395
(Video) Newcaster: Top of the hour.
Time for the morning news.

00:08:21.395 --> 00:08:22.649
But of course, there is no news yet.

00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:25.974
Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds.

00:08:25.974 --> 00:08:27.474
Rives: Exactly.

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:29.404
So that's Lucy from the Peanuts,

00:08:29.404 --> 00:08:31.800
"Mommie Dearest", Rocky, first day of training,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.516
Nelson Mandela, first day in office,

00:08:33.516 --> 00:08:36.235
and Bart Simpson, which combined with a cockroach

00:08:36.235 --> 00:08:38.804
would give you one hell of a dinner party

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:40.730
and gives me yet another category,

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.350
people waking up, in my big old database.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.780
Just imagine that your friends and your family

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.996
have heard that you collect, say, stuffed polar bears,

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.259
and they send them to you.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:53.108
Even if you don't really, at a certain point,

00:08:53.108 --> 00:08:56.148
you totally collect stuffed polar bears,

00:08:56.148 --> 00:08:58.710
and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.422
And when I got to that point, I embraced it.

00:09:00.422 --> 00:09:03.146
I got my curator on. I started fact checking,

00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:06.289
downloading, illegally screen-grabbing.

00:09:06.289 --> 00:09:07.660
I started archiving.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.847
My hobby had become a habit,

00:09:09.847 --> 00:09:12.573
and my habit gave me possibly the world's

00:09:12.573 --> 00:09:15.421
most eclectic Netflix queue.

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.311
At one point, it went, "Guys and Dolls: The Musical,"

00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:19.699
"Last Tango in Paris,"

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:20.949
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"

00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:22.623
"Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy."

00:09:22.623 --> 00:09:24.523
Why "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy"?

00:09:24.523 --> 00:09:27.183
Because someone told me I
would find this clip in there.

00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:28.647
(Video) Ron Jeremy: I was born

00:09:28.647 --> 00:09:30.415
in Flushing, Queens

00:09:30.415 --> 00:09:33.183
on March, 12, 1953,

00:09:33.183 --> 00:09:35.080
at four o'clock in the morning.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.800
Rives: Of course he was. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.693
Yeah. Not only does it seem to make sense,

00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:42.269
it also answers the question,

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:44.579
"What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir

00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:46.701
have in common?"

00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:49.157
Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography

00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:51.365
with the sentence, "I was born
at four o'clock in the morning,"

00:09:51.365 --> 00:09:53.541
which I had because someone
else had emailed it to me,

00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:56.170
and when they did, I had another bump up

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.390
in my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremy

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.057
and feminist Simone de Beauvoir

00:10:01.057 --> 00:10:02.309
are not just different people.

00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:05.189
They are different people that
have this thing connecting them,

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:08.586
and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge

00:10:08.586 --> 00:10:11.213
or inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder,

00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:13.070
is there maybe a cooler way to do this?

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.582
So last October, in gentleman scholar tradition,

00:10:17.582 --> 00:10:19.796
I put the entire collection online

00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:21.428
as "Museum of Four in the Morning."

00:10:21.428 --> 00:10:23.426
You can click on that red "refresh" button.

00:10:23.426 --> 00:10:25.710
It will take you at random to one of

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.008
hundreds of snippets that are in the collection.

00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:29.656
Here is a knockout poem

00:10:29.656 --> 00:10:32.149
by Billy Collins called "Forgetfulness."

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:33.514
(Video) Billy Collins: No wonder you rise

00:10:33.514 --> 00:10:35.194
in the middle of the night

00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:37.751
to look up the date of a famous battle

00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:39.380
in a book on war.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.130
No wonder the moon in the window

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.878
seems to have drifted out of a love poem

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:47.798
that you used to know by heart.

00:10:47.798 --> 00:10:51.190
Rives: So the first hour of this project

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.222
was satisfying.

00:10:52.222 --> 00:10:56.922
A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:59.166
Half a globe away, a teenager

00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:01.566
made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me,

00:11:01.566 --> 00:11:02.910
a stranger.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.088
Less than a week later, though,

00:11:04.088 --> 00:11:07.344
I received a little bit of grace.

00:11:07.344 --> 00:11:11.606
I received a poignant tweet.

00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:13.528
It was brief.

00:11:13.528 --> 00:11:17.670
It just said, "Reminds me of an ancient mix tape."

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.268
The name was a pseudonym,
actually, or a pseudo-pseudonym.

00:11:20.268 --> 00:11:23.200
As soon as I saw the initials, and the profile pic,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.366
I knew immediately, my whole body knew

00:11:25.366 --> 00:11:28.006
immediately who this was,

00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:30.200
and I knew immediately

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.262
what mix tape she was talking about.

00:11:33.262 --> 00:11:36.771
(Music)

00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:39.044
L.D. was my college romance.

00:11:39.044 --> 00:11:41.841
This is in the early '90s. I was an undegrad.

00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:45.159
She was a grad student in the
library sciences department.

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:47.232
Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off,

00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:49.408
lets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:51.170
She was already smoking hot,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.560
she was super dorky,

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.922
and we had a December-May romance,

00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:56.840
meaning we started dating in December,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.135
and by May, she had graduated

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.581
and became my one that got away.

00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:06.728
But her mix tape did not get away.

00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:09.584
I have kept this mix tape in a box

00:12:09.584 --> 00:12:12.311
with notes and postcards, not just from L.D.,

00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:15.000
from my life, but for decades.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.310
It's the kind of box where,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.428
if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her,

00:12:18.428 --> 00:12:20.138
and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her,

00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:23.504
but the story — (Laughter) — with this mix tape

00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:25.392
is there are seven songs per side,

00:12:25.392 --> 00:12:27.448
but no song titles.

00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:30.720
Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.439
classification system, including page numbers,

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:35.664
to leave me clues.

00:12:35.664 --> 00:12:37.296
When I got this mix tape,

00:12:37.296 --> 00:12:38.928
I put it in my cassette player,

00:12:38.928 --> 00:12:42.312
I took it to the campus library, her library,

00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:44.160
I found 14 books on the shelves.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.582
I remember bringing them all

00:12:45.582 --> 00:12:47.186
to my favorite corner table,

00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:51.199
and I read poems paired to songs

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:52.860
like food to wine,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.800
paired, I can tell you,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.583
like saddle shoes

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:59.589
to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress.

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:01.993
I did this again last October.

00:13:01.993 --> 00:13:04.115
I'm sitting there, I got new earbuds,

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:06.677
old Walkman, I realize this is just the kind

00:13:06.677 --> 00:13:08.771
of extravagance I used to take for granted

00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:10.787
even when I was extravagant.

00:13:10.787 --> 00:13:14.212
And then I thought, "Good for him."

00:13:14.212 --> 00:13:17.555
"PG" is Slavic literature.

00:13:17.555 --> 00:13:20.603
"7000" series Polish literature.

00:13:20.603 --> 00:13:23.253
Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems.

00:13:23.253 --> 00:13:26.402
Page 31 is Wislawa Szymborska's poem

00:13:26.402 --> 00:13:28.620
paired with Paul Simon's "Peace Like a River."

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.065
(Music: Paul Simon, "Peace Like a River")

00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:33.961
(Video) Paul Simon: ♪ Oh, four in the morning ♪

00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:39.323
♪ I woke up from out of my dream ♪

00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:43.723
Rives: Thank you. Appreciate it. (Applause)
