00:00:00.877 --> 00:00:04.120
As a scientist, and also as a human being,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.124
I've been trying to make myself

00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:09.499
susceptible to wonder.

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.368
I think Jason Webley last night called it

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:16.395
"conspiring to be part of the magic."

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:19.216
So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:21.860
lets me dive deeply into the lives

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.378
of some truly wondrous creatures

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:26.757
that share our planet:

00:00:26.757 --> 00:00:28.452
fireflies.

00:00:28.452 --> 00:00:30.735
Now, for many of you, I know that fireflies

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:33.478
might conjure up some really great memories:

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:36.532
childhood, summertime,

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:38.302
even other TED Talks.

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:42.442
Maybe something like this.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.815
My seduction into the world of fireflies

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:51.664
began when I was back in graduate school.

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:54.488
One evening, I was sitting out in my backyard

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.426
in North Carolina,

00:00:56.426 --> 00:01:01.725
and suddenly, these silent sparks

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:03.579
rose up all around me,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.961
and I began to wonder:

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:07.651
How do these creatures make light,

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.341
and what's with all this flashing?

00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:11.180
Are they talking to one another?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.371
And what happens after the lights go out?

00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.662
I've been lucky enough to answer

00:01:15.662 --> 00:01:17.030
some of these questions

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.121
as I've explored this nocturnal world.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.460
Now if you've ever seen

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.561
or even heard about fireflies,

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.207
then you'll know how magically they can transform

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:30.598
our everyday landscape into something

00:01:30.598 --> 00:01:32.501
ethereal and otherworldly,

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.442
and this happens around the globe,

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:36.532
like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains

00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:40.618
that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:44.978
by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies,

00:01:44.978 --> 00:01:47.998
or a roadside river that I visited in Japan

00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:52.104
as it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:54.735
of these Genji fireflies,

00:01:54.735 --> 00:01:57.297
or in Malaysia, the mangrove trees

00:01:57.297 --> 00:01:59.625
that I watched blossom nightly

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.055
not with flowers

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:03.923
but with the lights of a thousand â€” 
(Bleep! Bleep!) â€” fireflies,

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.253
all blinking together

00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:08.411
in stunning synchrony.

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.507
These luminous landscapes

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:12.899
still fill me with wonder,

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.419
and they keep me connected to the magic

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.827
of the natural world.

00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:19.443
And I find it amazing that they're created

00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:22.731
by these tiny insects.

00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:25.622
In person, fireflies are charming.

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:27.435
They're charismatic.

00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:29.119
They've been celebrated in art

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.594
and in poetry for centuries.

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:32.992
As I've traveled around the world,

00:02:32.992 --> 00:02:35.010
I've met many thoughtful people

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.839
who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:39.990
for humans to enjoy.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.386
Other creatures can enjoy them too.

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:46.715
I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:50.720
because they so beautifully illuminate

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.951
the creative improvisation of evolution.

00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:56.761
They've been shaped by two powerful

00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.292
evolutionary forces:

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:01.952
natural selection, the struggle for survival,

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:04.101
and sexual selection,

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:08.162
the struggle for reproductive opportunity.

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:10.513
As a firefly junkie, the past 20 years

00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:12.999
have been quite an exciting ride.

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.496
Together with my students at Tufts University

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:16.512
and other colleagues,

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:20.119
we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies:

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.128
their courtship and sex lives,

00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:25.022
their treachery and murder.

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:26.839
So today I'd like to share with you

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.310
just a couple of tales that we've brought back

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.788
from our collective adventures

00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:35.498
into this hidden world.

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.660
Fireflies belong to a very beautiful

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.898
and diverse group of insects, the beetles.

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:47.511
Worldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species,

00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:49.671
and these have evolved remarkably diverse

00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:51.026
courtship signals,

00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:54.660
that is, different ways to find and attract mates.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.916
Around 150 million years ago,

00:03:56.916 --> 00:04:00.045
the very first fireflies probably looked like this.

00:04:00.045 --> 00:04:01.402
They flew during the daytime

00:04:01.402 --> 00:04:03.665
and they didn't light up.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:06.838
Instead, males used their fantastic antennae

00:04:06.838 --> 00:04:10.949
to sniff out perfumes given off by their females.

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.555
In other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:18.897
They are attractively plump and wingless,

00:04:18.897 --> 00:04:20.821
so every night, they climb up onto perches

00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:22.789
and they glow brightly for hours

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.980
to attract their flying but unlit males.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.830
In still other fireflies, both sexes

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.217
use quick, bright flashes to find their mates.

00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:34.688
Here in North America,

00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:37.829
we have more than 100 different kinds of firefly

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:41.406
that have the remarkable ability to shine energy

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.644
out from their bodies

00:04:43.644 --> 00:04:45.970
in the form of light.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.420
How do they do that?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.453
It seems totally magical,

00:04:50.453 --> 00:04:51.736
but these bioluminescent signals

00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:55.040
arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.934
that happen inside the firefly lantern.

00:04:57.934 --> 00:05:01.241
The main star is an enzyme called luciferase,

00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:02.996
which in the course of evolution

00:05:02.996 --> 00:05:06.190
has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.780
around an even smaller molecule called luciferin,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.457
in the process getting it so excited

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:15.831
that it actually gives off light.

00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:17.506
Incredible.

00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:19.334
But how could these bright lights

00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:23.479
have benefited some proto-firefly?

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.589
To answer this question, we need to flip back

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:29.953
in the family album to some baby pictures.

00:05:29.953 --> 00:05:33.665
Fireflies completely reinvent
their bodies as they grow.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:35.966
They spend the vast majority of their lifetime,

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:37.709
up to two years,

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:40.570
in this larval form.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.823
Their main goal here, like my teenagers,

00:05:42.823 --> 00:05:45.978
is to eat and grow.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.430
And firefly light first originated

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.477
in these juveniles.

00:05:50.477 --> 00:05:52.907
Every single firefly larva can light up,

00:05:52.907 --> 00:05:55.786
even when their adults can't.

00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:56.878
But what's the point

00:05:56.878 --> 00:06:00.515
to being so conspicuous?

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:02.133
Well, we know that these juveniles

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:04.113
make nasty-tasting chemicals

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:07.731
that help them survive their extended childhood,

00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:11.561
so we think these lights first evolved as a warning,

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:16.120
a neon sign that says, "Toxic! Stay away!"

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.014
to any would-be predators.

00:06:19.014 --> 00:06:21.964
It took many millions of years

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.363
before these bright lights

00:06:23.363 --> 00:06:25.901
evolved into a smart communication tool

00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:28.916
that could be used not just to
ward off potential predators

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:31.886
but to bring in potential mates.

00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:34.687
Driven now by sexual selection,

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.577
some adult fireflies

00:06:36.577 --> 00:06:38.973
like this proud male

00:06:38.973 --> 00:06:42.765
evolved a shiny new glow-in-the-dark lantern

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:44.609
that would let them take courtship

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:48.389
to a whole new level.

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.841
These adults only live a few weeks,

00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:55.757
and now they're single-mindedly focused on sex,

00:06:55.757 --> 00:06:57.727
that is, on propelling their genes

00:06:57.727 --> 00:07:00.503
into the next firefly generation.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.767
So we can follow this male out into the field

00:07:03.767 --> 00:07:06.791
as he joins hundreds of other males

00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:11.169
who are all showing off their new courtship signals.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:14.161
It's amazing to think that the luminous displays

00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:15.845
we admire

00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:18.280
here and in fact everywhere around the world

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.476
are actually the silent love songs

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:25.453
of male fireflies.

00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:29.540
They're flying and flashing their hearts out.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.080
I still find it very romantic.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.497
But meanwhile, where are all the females?

00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.092
Well, they're lounging down below

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:39.830
surveying their options.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.758
They have plenty of males to choose from,

00:07:41.758 --> 00:07:45.850
and these females turn out to be very picky.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.215
When a female sees a flash

00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:50.862
from an especially attractive male,

00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:53.843
she'll aim her lantern in his direction,

00:07:53.843 --> 00:07:56.370
and give him a flash back.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.771
It's her "come hither" sign.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:03.366
So he flies closer and he flashes again.

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:04.492
If she still likes him,

00:08:04.492 --> 00:08:07.703
they'll strike up a conversation.

00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:10.395
These creatures speak their love

00:08:10.395 --> 00:08:13.298
in the language of light.

00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:18.195
So what exactly do these females consider sexy?

00:08:18.195 --> 00:08:20.940
We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.702
to find out.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.910
When we tested females using blinking LED lights,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.225
we discovered they prefer males

00:08:28.225 --> 00:08:32.280
who give longer-lasting flashes.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.891
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:37.070
I know you're wondering,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.273
what gives these males their sex appeal?

00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:41.648
Now we get to see what happens

00:08:41.648 --> 00:08:44.209
when the lights go out.

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:45.678
The first thing we discovered

00:08:45.678 --> 00:08:48.447
is that once a male and female hook up like this,

00:08:48.447 --> 00:08:51.192
they stay together all night long,

00:08:51.192 --> 00:08:52.419
and when we looked inside

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:53.853
to see what might be happening,

00:08:53.853 --> 00:08:56.141
we discovered a surprising new twist

00:08:56.141 --> 00:08:58.105
to firefly sex.

00:08:58.105 --> 00:08:59.275
While they're mating,

00:08:59.275 --> 00:09:01.079
the male is busy giving the female

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:03.050
not just his sperm

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.156
but also a nutrient-filled package

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:11.777
called a nuptial gift.

00:09:11.777 --> 00:09:13.711
We can zoom in to look more closely

00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:15.274
inside this mating pair.

00:09:15.274 --> 00:09:16.967
We can actually see the gift â€”

00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:18.379
it's shown here in red â€”

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:22.329
as it's being passed from the male to the female.

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:25.464
What makes this gift so valuable

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.320
is that it's packed with protein

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.781
that the female will use to provision her eggs.

00:09:31.781 --> 00:09:35.651
So females are keeping their eyes on this prize

00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:37.923
as they size up potential mates.

00:09:37.923 --> 00:09:40.792
We discovered that females use male flash signals

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:42.839
to try to predict which males

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:44.909
have the biggest gifts to offer,

00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:49.746
because this bling helps the female lay more eggs

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:52.997
and ultimately launch more of her own offspring

00:09:52.997 --> 00:09:55.747
into the next generation.

00:09:57.687 --> 00:09:59.695
So it's not all sweetness and light.

00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:02.466
Firefly romance is risky.

00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:04.943
For the most part, these adult fireflies

00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:07.627
don't get eaten because like their juveniles

00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:10.563
they can manufacture toxins that are repellent

00:10:10.563 --> 00:10:13.620
to birds and other insectivores,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.120
but somewhere along the line,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.440
one particular group of fireflies

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.567
somehow lost the metabolic machinery

00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:25.370
needed to make their own protective toxins.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.650
This evolutionary flaw,

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.356
which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner,

00:10:30.356 --> 00:10:32.299
has driven these fireflies

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:35.697
to take their bright lights out into the night

00:10:35.697 --> 00:10:39.380
with treacherous intent.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.010
Dubbed "femme fatales"

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.495
by Jim Lloyd, another colleague,

00:10:43.495 --> 00:10:46.413
these females have figured out how to target

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:50.224
the males of other firefly species.

00:10:50.224 --> 00:10:52.124
So the hunt begins with the predator â€”

00:10:52.124 --> 00:10:54.171
she's shown here in the lower left â€”

00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:56.218
where she's sitting quietly

00:10:56.218 --> 00:10:59.350
and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.790
of her intended prey,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.803
and here's how it might go.

00:11:02.803 --> 00:11:06.673
First the prey male flashes, "Do you love me?"

00:11:06.673 --> 00:11:10.779
His own female responds, "Maybe."

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:13.605
So then he flashes again.

00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:17.158
But this time, the predator sneaks in a reply

00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:22.834
that cleverly mimics exactly
what the other female just said.

00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:27.300
She's not looking for love: she's looking for toxins.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.181
If she's good, she can lure this male close enough

00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:34.172
to reach out and grab him,

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:36.613
and he's not just a light snack.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.448
Over the next hour, she slowly

00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.307
exsanguinates this male

00:11:42.307 --> 00:11:46.000
leaving behind just some gory remains.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.751
Unable to make their own toxins,

00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:51.088
these females resort to drinking the blood

00:11:51.088 --> 00:11:55.783
of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals.

00:11:55.783 --> 00:12:01.628
So a firefly vampire,

00:12:01.628 --> 00:12:05.980
brought to you by natural selection.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.161
We still have a lot to learn about fireflies,

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:12.544
but it looks like many stories will remain untold,

00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:14.973
because around the world, firefly populations

00:12:14.973 --> 00:12:17.628
are blinking out.

00:12:17.628 --> 00:12:20.216
The main culprit: habitat loss.

00:12:20.216 --> 00:12:22.702
Pretty much everywhere, the fields and forests,

00:12:22.702 --> 00:12:25.649
the mangroves and meadows
that fireflies need to survive,

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:29.281
are giving way to development and to sprawl.

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:33.470
Here's another problem: we've conquered darkness,

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.964
but in the process, we spill so
much extra light out into the night

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:40.090
that it disrupts the lives of other creatures,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.534
and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution

00:12:43.534 --> 00:12:46.155
because it obscures the signals

00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:50.614
that they use to find their mates.

00:12:50.614 --> 00:12:52.592
Do we really need fireflies?

00:12:52.592 --> 00:12:54.631
After all, they're just one tiny bit

00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:56.900
of Earth's biodiversity.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.208
Yet every time a species is lost,

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:02.897
it's like extinguishing a room full of candles

00:13:02.897 --> 00:13:05.825
one by one.

00:13:05.825 --> 00:13:06.771
You might not notice

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:10.061
when the first few flames flicker out,

00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:14.435
but in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:24.411
As we work together to craft a planetary future,

00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.875
I hope we can find a way

00:13:26.875 --> 00:13:30.328
to keep these bright lights shining.

00:13:30.328 --> 00:13:32.364
Thank you.

00:13:32.364 --> 00:13:34.672
(Applause)
