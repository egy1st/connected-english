00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:02.230
You may be wondering

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.064
why a marine biologist from Oceana

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:05.904
would come here today to talk to you

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:07.140
about world hunger.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.291
I'm here today because

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:12.526
saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire.

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:14.670
It's more than a thing we're doing

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.468
because we want to create jobs for fishermen

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:18.552
or preserve fishermen's jobs.

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:21.900
It's more than an economic pursuit.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.512
Saving the oceans can feed the world.

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:26.338
Let me show you how.

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:28.140
As you know, there are already

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.766
more than a billion hungry people on this planet.

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.116
We're expecting that problem to get worse

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.546
as world population grows to nine billion

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:37.410
or 10 billion by midcentury,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.388
and we can expect to have greater pressure

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:42.246
on our food resources.

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:43.290
And this is a big concern,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.956
especially considering where we are now.

00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:48.668
Now we know that our arable land per capita

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:50.096
is already on the decline

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:52.805
in both developed and developing countries.

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:55.460
We know that we're headed for climate change,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.876
which is going to change rainfall patterns,

00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:01.186
making some areas drier, as you can see in orange,

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.497
and others wetter, in blue,

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.240
causing droughts in our breadbaskets,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.090
in places like the Midwest and Central Europe,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.372
and floods in others.

00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:10.134
It's going to make it harder for the land

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:12.690
to help us solve the hunger problem.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.154
And that's why the oceans need
to be their most abundant,

00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:16.728
so that the oceans can provide us

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:19.321
as much food as possible.

00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:20.968
And that's something the oceans have been doing

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:23.610
for us for a long time.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.290
As far back as we can go, we've seen an increase

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.233
in the amount of food we've been able to harvest

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:29.897
from our oceans.

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:32.385
It just seemed like it was continuing to increase,

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:33.789
until about 1980,

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.585
when we started to see a decline.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:38.183
You've heard of peak oil.

00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:40.170
Maybe this is peak fish.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.970
I hope not. I'm going to come back to that.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.473
But you can see about an 18-percent decline

00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:47.425
in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:48.780
since 1980.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.040
And this is a big problem. It's continuing.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.397
This red line is continuing to go down.

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:55.493
But we know how to turn it around,

00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:57.183
and that's what I'm going to talk about today.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.583
We know how to turn that curve back upwards.

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:02.030
This doesn't have to be peak fish.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.219
If we do a few simple things in targeted places,

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.702
we can bring our fisheries back and use them

00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:09.966
to feed people.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.886
First we want to know where the fish are,

00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:13.457
so let's look where the fish are.

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:15.351
It turns out the fish, conveniently,

00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.567
are located for the most part

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.630
in our coastal areas of the countries,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.935
in coastal zones,

00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:23.339
and these are areas that national jurisdictions

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:24.721
have control over,

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.545
and they can manage their fisheries

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.204
in these coastal areas.

00:02:28.204 --> 00:02:30.462
Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:33.070
that go out about 200 nautical miles,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.441
in areas that are called exclusive economic zones,

00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:38.434
and this is a good thing that they can control

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:39.595
their fisheries in these areas,

00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:41.111
because the high seas,

00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:43.404
which are the darker areas on this map,

00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:45.603
the high seas, it's a lot harder to control things,

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:47.692
because it has to be done internationally.

00:02:47.692 --> 00:02:49.559
You get into international agreements,

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.807
and if any of you are tracking
the climate change agreement,

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:53.519
you know this can be a very slow,

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.501
frustrating, tedious process.

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:57.223
And so controlling things nationally

00:02:57.223 --> 00:02:59.997
is a great thing to be able to do.

00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:02.194
How many fish are actually in these coastal areas

00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:03.771
compared to the high seas?

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:05.281
Well, you can see here about

00:03:05.281 --> 00:03:08.364
seven times as many fish in the coastal areas

00:03:08.364 --> 00:03:09.951
than there are in the high seas,

00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:12.167
so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing,

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:14.311
because we can actually get a lot done.

00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:16.701
We can restore a lot of our fisheries

00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:18.895
if we focus in these coastal areas.

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:21.919
But how many of these countries
do we have to work in?

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.521
There's something like 80 coastal countries.

00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:25.507
Do we have to fix fisheries management

00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:26.910
in all of those countries?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.032
So we asked ourselves, how many countries

00:03:29.032 --> 00:03:30.439
do we need to focus on,

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.301
keeping in mind that the European Union

00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:33.870
conveniently manages its fisheries

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.237
through a common fisheries policy?

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:38.529
So if we got good fisheries management

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.794
in the European Union and,
say, nine other countries,

00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:43.883
how much of our fisheries would we be covering?

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:46.940
Turns out, European Union plus nine countries

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.054
covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch.

00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:53.333
If we took it up to 24 countries
plus the European Union,

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.055
we would up to 90 percent,

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:58.265
almost all of the world's fish catch.

00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:01.193
So we think we can work in
a limited number of places

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:02.885
to make the fisheries come back.

00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:05.497
But what do we have to do in these places?

00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:07.292
Well, based on our work in the United States

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:08.880
and elsewhere, we know that there are

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.721
three key things we have to do

00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:13.427
to bring fisheries back, and they are:

00:04:13.427 --> 00:04:15.373
We need to set quotas or limits

00:04:15.373 --> 00:04:17.480
on how much we take;

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.273
we need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental

00:04:20.273 --> 00:04:22.609
catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting,

00:04:22.609 --> 00:04:24.459
and it's very wasteful;

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:27.123
and three, we need to protect habitats,

00:04:27.123 --> 00:04:29.240
the nursery areas, the spawning areas

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.810
that these fish need to grow
and reproduce successfully

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.660
so that they can rebuild their populations.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.422
If we do those three things, we 
know the fisheries will come back.

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:38.770
How do we know?

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.785
We know because we've seen it happening

00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:42.213
in a lot of different places.

00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:43.654
This is a slide that shows

00:04:43.654 --> 00:04:45.852
the herring population in Norway

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.175
that was crashing since the 1950s.

00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:50.326
It was coming down, and when Norway set limits,

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:53.244
or quotas, on its fishery, what happens?

00:04:53.244 --> 00:04:55.110
The fishery comes back.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.010
This is another example, also
happens to be from Norway,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.468
of the Norwegian Arctic cod.

00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:02.524
Same deal. The fishery is crashing.

00:05:02.524 --> 00:05:04.484
They set limits on discards.

00:05:04.484 --> 00:05:06.598
Discards are these fish they weren't targeting

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.200
and they get thrown overboard wastefully.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.812
When they set the discard limit,

00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:12.868
the fishery came back.

00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:14.135
And it's not just in Norway.

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:16.094
We've seen this happening in countries

00:05:16.094 --> 00:05:19.153
all around the world, time and time again.

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:20.686
When these countries step in and they

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:23.820
put in sustainable fisheries management policies,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.636
the fisheries, which are always crashing, it seems,

00:05:26.636 --> 00:05:28.574
are starting to come back.

00:05:28.574 --> 00:05:30.432
So there's a lot of promise here.

00:05:30.432 --> 00:05:32.124
What does this mean for the world fish catch?

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.460
This means that if we take that fishery catch

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.490
that's on the decline

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.878
and we could turn it upwards, we could increase it

00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:41.416
up to 100 million metric tons per year.

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.389
So we didn't have peak fish yet.

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:44.916
We still have an opportunity

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:46.217
to not only bring the fish back

00:05:46.217 --> 00:05:47.920
but to actually get more fish

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.371
that can feed more people

00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:50.873
than we currently are now.

00:05:50.873 --> 00:05:52.979
How many more? Right about now,

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.860
we can feed about 450 million people

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.834
a fish meal a day

00:05:56.834 --> 00:05:59.084
based on the current world fish catch,

00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:01.548
which, of course, you know is going down,

00:06:01.548 --> 00:06:03.203
so that number will go down over time

00:06:03.203 --> 00:06:04.806
if we don't fix it,

00:06:04.806 --> 00:06:07.216
but if we put fishery management practices

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:09.780
like the ones I've described in place

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.885
in 10 to 25 countries,

00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:13.364
we could bring that number up

00:06:13.364 --> 00:06:16.918
and feed as many as 700 million people a year

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.466
a healthy fish meal.

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:20.008
We should obviously do this just because

00:06:20.008 --> 00:06:23.000
it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.177
but it's also cost-effective.

00:06:24.177 --> 00:06:28.524
It turns out fish is the most cost-effective protein

00:06:28.524 --> 00:06:29.900
on the planet.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.030
If you look at how much fish protein you get

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.030
per dollar invested

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.762
compared to all of the other animal proteins,

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:38.692
obviously, fish is a good business decision.

00:06:38.692 --> 00:06:40.292
It also doesn't need a lot of land,

00:06:40.292 --> 00:06:41.758
something that's in short supply,

00:06:41.758 --> 00:06:45.276
compared to other protein sources.

00:06:45.276 --> 00:06:47.907
And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.979
It uses a lot less fresh water than,

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.020
for example, cattle,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.174
where you have to irrigate a field

00:06:53.174 --> 00:06:56.317
so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.

00:06:56.317 --> 00:06:58.436
It also has a very low carbon footprint.

00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:00.316
It has a little bit of a carbon footprint

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:02.315
because we do have to get out and catch the fish.

00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:03.810
It takes a little bit of fuel,

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.032
but as you know, agriculture
can have a carbon footprint,

00:07:06.032 --> 00:07:07.586
and fish has a much smaller one,

00:07:07.586 --> 00:07:09.360
so it's less polluting.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.741
It's already a big part of our diet,

00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:13.830
but it can be a bigger part of our diet,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.561
which is a good thing, because we know

00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.186
that it's healthy for us.

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:19.511
It can reduce our risks of cancer,

00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:21.400
heart disease and obesity.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.371
In fact, our CEO Andy Sharpless,

00:07:23.371 --> 00:07:25.960
who is the originator of this concept, actually,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.880
he likes to say fish is the perfect protein.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.130
Andy also talks about the fact that

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.636
our ocean conservation movement really grew

00:07:34.636 --> 00:07:36.868
out of the land conservation movement,

00:07:36.868 --> 00:07:38.360
and in land conservation,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.424
we have this problem where biodiversity

00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:44.424
is at war with food production.

00:07:44.424 --> 00:07:47.215
You have to cut down the biodiverse forest

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:49.108
if you want to get the field

00:07:49.108 --> 00:07:51.338
to grow the corn to feed people with,

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:53.180
and so there's a constant push-pull there.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.728
There's a constant tough decision

00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:56.567
that has to be made between

00:07:56.567 --> 00:07:58.588
two very important things:

00:07:58.588 --> 00:08:01.681
maintaining biodiversity and feeding people.

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.981
But in the oceans, we don't have that war.

00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:06.538
In the oceans, biodiversity is not at war

00:08:06.538 --> 00:08:07.700
with abundance.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.805
In fact, they're aligned.

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:12.978
When we do things that produce biodiversity,

00:08:12.978 --> 00:08:15.030
we actually get more abundance,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.846
and that's important so that we can feed people.

00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:21.576
Now, there's a catch.

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:24.121
Didn't anyone get that? (Laughter)

00:08:24.121 --> 00:08:26.164
Illegal fishing.

00:08:26.164 --> 00:08:27.730
Illegal fishing undermines the type of

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.980
sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.460
It can be when you catch fish using gears

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.489
that have been prohibited,

00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:36.140
when you fish in places where
you're not supposed to fish,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.378
you catch fish that are the wrong
size or the wrong species.

00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:41.343
Illegal fishing cheats the consumer

00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:43.550
and it also cheats honest fishermen,

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.710
and it needs to stop.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.787
The way illegal fish get into our 
market is through seafood fraud.

00:08:47.787 --> 00:08:49.236
You might have heard about this.

00:08:49.236 --> 00:08:52.420
It's when fish are labeled as something they're not.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.955
Think about the last time you had fish.

00:08:53.955 --> 00:08:54.745
What were you eating?

00:08:54.745 --> 00:08:56.516
Are you sure that's what it was?

00:08:56.516 --> 00:08:59.240
Because we tested 1,300 different fish samples

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.482
and about a third of them

00:09:00.482 --> 00:09:02.220
were not what they were labeled to be.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.960
Snappers, nine out of 10
snappers were not snapper.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.180
Fifty-nine percent of the tuna we tested

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.150
was mislabeled.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.778
And red snapper, we tested 120 samples,

00:09:11.778 --> 00:09:13.694
and only seven of them were really red snapper,

00:09:13.694 --> 00:09:17.238
so good luck finding a red snapper.

00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:19.466
Seafood has a really complex supply chain,

00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:21.762
and at every step in this supply chain,

00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.952
there's an opportunity for seafood fraud,

00:09:23.952 --> 00:09:26.080
unless we have traceability.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.799
Traceability is a way where the seafood industry

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:31.096
can track the seafood from the boat to the plate

00:09:31.096 --> 00:09:33.627
to make sure that the consumer can then find out

00:09:33.627 --> 00:09:35.274
where their seafood came from.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.030
This is a really important thing.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.598
It's being done by some in
the industry, but not enough,

00:09:39.598 --> 00:09:40.945
so we're pushing a law in Congress

00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:42.351
called the SAFE Seafood Act,

00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:44.990
and I'm very excited today to announce the release

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.634
of a chef's petition, where 450 chefs

00:09:47.634 --> 00:09:50.306
have signed a petition calling on Congress

00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:52.508
to support the SAFE Seafood Act.

00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:54.336
It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know --

00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:57.540
Anthony Bourdain, Mario Batali,

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.216
Barton Seaver and others —

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:00.970
and they've signed it because they believe

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.298
that people have a right to know

00:10:02.298 --> 00:10:04.673
about what they're eating.

00:10:04.673 --> 00:10:09.856
(Applause)

00:10:10.464 --> 00:10:12.420
Fishermen like it too, so there's a good chance

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.020
we can get the kind of support we need

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.954
to get this bill through,

00:10:14.954 --> 00:10:16.478
and it comes at a critical time,

00:10:16.478 --> 00:10:18.584
because this is the way we stop seafood fraud,

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:20.650
this is the way we curb illegal fishing,

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.522
and this is the way we make sure

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.226
that quotas, habitat protection,

00:10:24.226 --> 00:10:26.106
and bycatch reductions can do the jobs

00:10:26.106 --> 00:10:27.283
they can do.

00:10:27.283 --> 00:10:30.459
We know that we can manage
our fisheries sustainably.

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:32.101
We know that we can produce

00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:35.870
healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.115
that don't use the land, that don't use much water,

00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:39.300
have a low carbon footprint,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.102
and are cost-effective.

00:10:41.102 --> 00:10:43.090
We know that saving the oceans

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.673
can feed the world,

00:10:44.673 --> 00:10:47.060
and we need to start now.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.817
(Applause)

00:10:49.817 --> 00:10:53.525
Thank you. (Applause)
