00:00:00.602 --> 00:00:02.940
Approximately 30 years ago,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.633
when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:07.022
in Philadelphia,

00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:10.176
a father and a son walked into my office

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.320
and they both had their right eye missing,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.131
and as I took the history, it became apparent

00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:18.900
that the father and the son had a rare form

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.442
of inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma,

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:25.556
and the father knew that he had passed that fate

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:27.431
on to his son.

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.843
That moment changed my life.

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:31.747
It propelled me to go on

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:35.279
and to co-lead a team that discovered

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:38.476
the first cancer susceptibility gene,

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.197
and in the intervening decades since then,

00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:44.617
there has been literally a seismic shift

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.643
in our understanding of what goes on,

00:00:46.643 --> 00:00:49.531
what genetic variations are sitting behind

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:51.090
various diseases.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.474
In fact, for thousands of human traits,

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:56.692
a molecular basis that's known for that,

00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:59.987
and for thousands of people, every day,

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:02.068
there's information that they gain

00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:04.510
about the risk of going on to get this disease

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.736
or that disease.

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:09.041
At the same time, if you ask,

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:11.748
"Has that impacted the efficiency,

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:13.840
how we've been able to develop drugs?"

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.622
the answer is not really.

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:17.952
If you look at the cost of developing drugs,

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:21.341
how that's done, it basically hasn't budged that.

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:25.814
And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:28.626
yet not the power to fully treat.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:31.092
And there are two commonly given reasons

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:32.560
for why that happens.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.032
One of them is it's early days.

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:39.622
We're just learning the words, the fragments,

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:41.398
the letters in the genetic code.

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:43.553
We don't know how to read the sentences.

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:46.123
We don't know how to follow the narrative.

00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:48.602
The other reason given is that

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:50.820
most of those changes are a loss of function,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.745
and it's actually really hard to develop drugs

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:55.660
that restore function.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.842
But today, I want us to step back

00:01:57.842 --> 00:01:59.870
and ask a more fundamental question,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.059
and ask, "What happens if we're thinking

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.792
about this maybe in the wrong context?"

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.951
We do a lot of studying of those who are sick

00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:10.551
and building up long lists

00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:13.669
of altered components.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.068
But maybe, if what we're trying to do

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:19.290
is to develop therapies for prevention,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.843
maybe what we should be doing

00:02:20.843 --> 00:02:23.225
is studying those who don't get sick.

00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:25.572
Maybe we should be studying those

00:02:25.572 --> 00:02:27.747
that are well.

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.544
A vast majority of those people

00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:31.880
are not necessarily carrying a particular

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.816
genetic load or risk factor.

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:35.800
They're not going to help us.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.399
There are going to be those individuals

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.068
who are carrying a potential future risk,

00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:41.912
they're going to go on to get some symptom.

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:43.700
That's not what we're looking for.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.548
What we're asking and looking for is,

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:48.318
are there a very few set of individuals

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:51.154
who are actually walking around

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:55.173
with the risk that normally would cause a disease,

00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:58.136
but something in them, something hidden in them

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.970
is actually protective

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.145
and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms?

00:03:03.145 --> 00:03:05.198
If you're going to do a study
like that, you can imagine

00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:08.030
you'd like to look at lots and lots of people.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.322
We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study,

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:13.057
and we realized that actually

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:14.586
one way to think of this is,

00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:18.863
let us look at adults who are over 40 years of age,

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:21.833
and let's make sure that we look at those

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:23.313
who were healthy as kids.

00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:25.715
They might have had individuals in their families

00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:27.527
who had had a childhood disease,

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:29.033
but not necessarily.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.800
And let's go and then screen those

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.793
to find those who are carrying genes

00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:35.471
for childhood diseases.

00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:37.035
Now, some of you, I can see you

00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:40.330
putting your hands up going, "Uh, a little odd.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.747
What's your evidence

00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:43.409
that this could be feasible?"

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.473
I want to give you two examples.

00:03:45.473 --> 00:03:48.421
The first comes from San Francisco.

00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:51.362
It comes from the 1980s and the 1990s,

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:53.756
and you may know the story where

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:56.153
there were individuals who had very high levels

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:57.421
of the virus HIV.

00:03:57.421 --> 00:03:59.900
They went on to get AIDS.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.217
But there was a very small set of individuals

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:05.185
who also had very high levels of HIV.

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:06.571
They didn't get AIDS.

00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:09.533
And astute clinicians tracked that down,

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:12.920
and what they found was
they were carrying mutations.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.005
Notice, they were carrying mutations from birth

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.020
that were protective, that were protecting them

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.661
from going on to get AIDS.

00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:22.826
You may also know that actually a line of therapy

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:25.946
has been coming along based on that fact.

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:29.170
Second example, more recent, is elegant work

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.573
done by Helen Hobbs,

00:04:30.573 --> 00:04:33.235
who said, "I'm going to look at individuals

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:35.951
who have very high lipid levels,

00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:37.890
and I'm going to try to find those people

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.692
with high lipid levels

00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:41.860
who don't go on to get heart disease."

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.298
And again, what she found was

00:04:44.298 --> 00:04:46.858
some of those individuals had mutations

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:49.577
that were protective from birth that kept them,

00:04:49.577 --> 00:04:51.022
even though they had high lipid levels,

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:54.393
and you can see this is an interesting way

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.354
of thinking about how you could develop

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:58.614
preventive therapies.

00:04:58.614 --> 00:05:00.558
The project that we're working on

00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:03.020
is called "The Resilience Project:

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.420
A Search for Unexpected Heroes,"

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.910
because what we are interested in doing is saying,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.558
can we find those rare individuals

00:05:09.558 --> 00:05:13.883
who might have these hidden protective factors?

00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:16.863
And in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring,

00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:18.789
a sort of resilience decoder ring

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.421
that we're going to try to build.

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:24.270
We've realized that we should 
do this in a systematic way,

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.897
so we've said, let's take every single

00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:28.140
childhood inherited disease.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.704
Let's take them all, and let's
pull them back a little bit

00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:33.890
by those that are known to have severe symptoms,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.810
where the parents, the child,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.860
those around them would know

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.190
that they'd gotten sick,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.890
and let's go ahead and then frame them again

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.471
by those parts of the genes where we know

00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.978
that there is a particular alteration

00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:49.776
that is known to be highly penetrant

00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:52.430
to cause that disease.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.658
Where are we going to look?

00:05:53.658 --> 00:05:56.146
Well, we could look locally. That makes sense.

00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:58.407
But we began to think, maybe we should look

00:05:58.407 --> 00:05:59.858
all over the world.

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:01.511
Maybe we should look not just here

00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:03.471
but in remote places where their might be

00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:06.501
a distinct genetic context,

00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.143
there might be environmental factors

00:06:08.143 --> 00:06:09.525
that protect people.

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:13.987
And let's look at a million individuals.

00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:16.957
Now the reason why we think it's a good time

00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:18.029
to do that now

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:19.789
is, in the last couple of years,

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.377
there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost

00:06:22.377 --> 00:06:24.612
to do this type of analysis,

00:06:24.612 --> 00:06:26.351
this type of data generation,

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:28.959
to where it actually costs less to do

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.153
the data generation and analysis

00:06:31.153 --> 00:06:34.337
than it does to do the sample
processing and the collection.

00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:38.641
The other reason is that in the last five years,

00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.605
there have been awesome tools,

00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:43.267
things about network biology, systems biology,

00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:45.228
that have come up that allow us to think

00:06:45.228 --> 00:06:47.168
that maybe we could decipher

00:06:47.168 --> 00:06:49.649
those positive outliers.

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.821
And as we went around talking to researchers

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.725
and institutions

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:55.294
and telling them about our story,

00:06:55.294 --> 00:06:56.961
something happened.

00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:59.190
They started saying, "This is interesting.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.537
I would be glad to join your effort.

00:07:02.537 --> 00:07:04.464
I would be willing to participate."

00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:07.043
And they didn't say, "Where's the MTA?"

00:07:07.043 --> 00:07:10.336
They didn't say, "Where is my authorship?"

00:07:10.336 --> 00:07:14.947
They didn't say, "Is this data going 
to be mine? Am I going to own it?"

00:07:14.947 --> 00:07:17.226
They basically said, "Let's work on this

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:20.107
in an open, crowd-sourced, team way

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:23.181
to do this decoding."

00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:25.696
Six months ago, we locked down

00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:29.011
the screening key for this decoder.

00:07:29.011 --> 00:07:33.589
My co-lead, a brilliant scientist, Eric Schadt

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:36.895
at the Icahn Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York,

00:07:36.895 --> 00:07:38.287
and his team,

00:07:38.287 --> 00:07:41.156
locked in that decoder key ring,

00:07:41.156 --> 00:07:43.551
and we began looking for samples,

00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.037
because what we realized is,

00:07:45.037 --> 00:07:46.831
maybe we could just go and look

00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:49.917
at some existing samples to
get some sense of feasibility.

00:07:49.917 --> 00:07:52.494
Maybe we could take two, three 
percent of the project on,

00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:53.911
and see if it was there.

00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:55.909
And so we started asking people

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.446
such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.691
We asked Leif up in Finland.

00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:05.364
We talked to Anne Wojcicki at 23andMe,

00:08:05.364 --> 00:08:07.131
and Wang Jun at BGI,

00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:09.319
and again, something remarkable happened.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:11.128
They said, "Huh,

00:08:11.128 --> 00:08:12.872
not only do we have samples,

00:08:12.872 --> 00:08:15.068
but often we've analyzed them,

00:08:15.068 --> 00:08:16.555
and we would be glad to go into

00:08:16.555 --> 00:08:17.958
our anonymized samples

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.020
and see if we could find those

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.183
that you're looking for."

00:08:21.183 --> 00:08:23.890
And instead of being 20,000 or 30,000,

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.042
last month we passed one half million samples

00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:28.947
that we've already analyzed.

00:08:28.947 --> 00:08:30.440
So you must be going,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.065
"Huh, did you find any unexpected heroes?"

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:38.648
And the answer is, we didn't find one or two.

00:08:38.648 --> 00:08:41.686
We found dozens of these strong candidate

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:43.415
unexpected heroes.

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:46.112
So we think that the time is now

00:08:46.112 --> 00:08:48.452
to launch the beta phase of this project

00:08:48.452 --> 00:08:51.569
and actually start getting prospective individuals.

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:54.740
Basically all we need is information.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.399
We need a swab of DNA

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:59.804
and a willingness to say, "What's inside me?

00:08:59.804 --> 00:09:03.067
I'm willing to be re-contacted."

00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:06.858
Most of us spend our lives,

00:09:06.858 --> 00:09:08.812
when it comes to health and disease,

00:09:08.812 --> 00:09:11.892
acting as if we're voyeurs.

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:14.229
We delegate the responsibility

00:09:14.229 --> 00:09:16.272
for the understanding of our disease,

00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:18.144
for the treatment of our disease,

00:09:18.144 --> 00:09:21.680
to anointed experts.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.020
In order for us to get this project to work,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.170
we need individuals to step up

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.062
in a different role and to be engaged,

00:09:31.062 --> 00:09:33.987
to realize this dream,

00:09:33.987 --> 00:09:37.122
this open crowd-sourced project,

00:09:37.122 --> 00:09:40.802
to find those unexpected heroes,

00:09:40.802 --> 00:09:43.462
to evolve from the current concepts

00:09:43.462 --> 00:09:45.796
of resources and constraints,

00:09:45.796 --> 00:09:49.047
to design those preventive therapies,

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.820
and to extend it beyond childhood diseases,

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.397
to go all the way up to ways

00:09:53.397 --> 00:09:57.268
that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,

00:09:57.268 --> 00:09:59.530
we're going to need us

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.636
to be looking inside ourselves and asking,

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:04.840
"What are our roles?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.513
What are our genes?"

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:09.298
and looking within ourselves for information

00:10:09.298 --> 00:10:11.940
we used to say we should go to the outside,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.148
to experts,

00:10:13.148 --> 00:10:17.200
and to be willing to share that with others.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.758
Thank you very much.

00:10:20.758 --> 00:10:22.573
