00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:03.507
As a student of adversity,

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:09.617
I've been struck over the years
by how some people with major challenges

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.979
seem to draw strength from them.

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.586
And I've heard the popular wisdom
that that has to do with finding meaning.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.401
And for a long time,

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:20.800
I thought the meaning was out there,

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:23.303
some great truth waiting to be found.

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:25.535
But over time,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.103
I've come to feel
that the truth is irrelevant.

00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.776
We call it "finding meaning,"

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.102
but we might better call
it "forging meaning."

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:37.928
My last book was about
how families manage to deal

00:00:37.952 --> 00:00:41.663
with various kinds of challenging
or unusual offspring.

00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:44.470
And one of the mothers I interviewed,

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:47.457
who had two children
with multiple severe disabilities,

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:52.178
said to me, "People always give us
these little sayings like,

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:55.118
'God doesn't give you
any more than you can handle.'

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.216
But children like ours
are not preordained as a gift.

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:02.296
They're a gift

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.045
because that's what we have chosen."

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.280
We make those choices all our lives.

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:13.395
When I was in second grade,

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:16.276
Bobby Finkel had a birthday party

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.573
and invited everyone in our class but me.

00:01:20.637 --> 00:01:23.131
My mother assumed
there had been some sort of error,

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:24.793
and she called Mrs. Finkel,

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:29.428
who said that Bobby didn't like me
and didn't want me at his party.

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:33.219
And that day, my mom took me to the zoo

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:35.150
and out for a hot fudge sundae.

00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:37.951
When I was in seventh grade,

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:42.293
one of the kids on my school bus
nicknamed me "Percy,"

00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:44.638
as a shorthand for my demeanor.

00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:50.059
And sometimes, he and his cohort
would chant that provocation

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:52.113
the entire school bus ride,

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:55.750
45 minutes up, 45 minutes back:

00:01:55.774 --> 00:01:59.739
"Percy! Percy! Percy! Percy!"

00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:04.753
When I was in eighth grade,
our science teacher told us

00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:08.801
that all male homosexuals
develop fecal incontinence

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:11.937
because of the trauma
to their anal sphincter.

00:02:13.294 --> 00:02:17.838
And I graduated high school
without ever going to the cafeteria,

00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:21.839
where I would have sat with the girls
and been laughed at for doing so,

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:23.520
or sat with the boys,

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:27.454
and been laughed at for being a boy
who should be sitting with the girls.

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:33.073
I survived that childhood
through a mix of avoidance and endurance.

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:35.555
What I didn't know then

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.055
and do know now,

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.556
is that avoidance and endurance
can be the entryway to forging meaning.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.509
After you've forged meaning,

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:50.193
you need to incorporate that meaning
into a new identity.

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.777
You need to take the traumas

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.076
and make them part
of who you've come to be,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.088
and you need to fold
the worst events of your life

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.213
into a narrative of triumph,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.755
evincing a better self
in response to things that hurt.

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:10.795
One of the other mothers I interviewed
when I was working on my book

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.144
had been raped as an adolescent,

00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:16.080
and had a child following that rape,

00:03:16.183 --> 00:03:19.063
which had thrown away her career plans

00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:22.327
and damaged all
of her emotional relationships.

00:03:23.073 --> 00:03:26.036
But when I met her, she was 50,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.438
and I said to her,

00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:30.208
"Do you often think
about the man who raped you?"

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:34.196
And she said, "I used to think
about him with anger,

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:36.593
but now only with pity."

00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:40.020
And I thought she meant pity
because he was so unevolved

00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:42.120
as to have done this terrible thing.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:43.866
And I said, "Pity?"

00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:45.927
And she said, "Yes,

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:51.068
because he has a beautiful daughter
and two beautiful grandchildren,

00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:52.566
and he doesn't know that,

00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:54.281
and I do.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.120
So as it turns out,

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.140
I'm the lucky one."

00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:03.166
Some of our struggles
are things we're born to:

00:04:03.888 --> 00:04:08.841
our gender, our sexuality,
our race, our disability.

00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:11.761
And some are things that happen to us:

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:15.359
being a political prisoner,
being a rape victim,

00:04:15.383 --> 00:04:17.062
being a Katrina survivor.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.789
Identity involves entering a community

00:04:20.813 --> 00:04:22.952
to draw strength from that community,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.303
and to give strength there, too.

00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:29.691
It involves substituting
"and" for "but" --

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:33.771
not "I am here but I have cancer,"

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:39.040
but rather, "I have cancer and I am here."

00:04:39.952 --> 00:04:42.956
When we're ashamed,
we can't tell our stories,

00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:46.078
and stories are the foundation

00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:47.325
of identity.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.187
Forge meaning,

00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:51.610
build identity.

00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:55.443
Forge meaning and build identity.

00:04:56.058 --> 00:04:57.681
That became my mantra.

00:04:58.213 --> 00:05:01.182
Forging meaning
is about changing yourself.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.960
Building identity
is about changing the world.

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:09.620
All of us with stigmatized identities
face this question daily:

00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:14.635
How much to accommodate society
by constraining ourselves,

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:17.075
and how much to break the limits

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.490
of what constitutes a valid life?

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.490
Forging meaning and building identity

00:05:23.514 --> 00:05:25.804
does not make what was wrong right.

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.396
It only makes what was wrong precious.

00:05:31.094 --> 00:05:33.197
In January of this year,

00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:37.283
I went to Myanmar
to interview political prisoners,

00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:41.474
and I was surprised to find them
less bitter than I'd anticipated.

00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:44.403
Most of them had knowingly
committed the offenses

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.244
that landed them in prison,

00:05:46.268 --> 00:05:49.723
and they had walked in
with their heads held high,

00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:53.788
and they walked out
with their heads still held high,

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.350
many years later.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:59.309
Dr. Ma Thida, a leading
human rights activist

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:00.737
who had nearly died in prison

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:03.791
and had spent many years
in solitary confinement,

00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:09.771
told me she was grateful to her jailers
for the time she had had to think,

00:06:09.795 --> 00:06:11.897
for the wisdom she had gained,

00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:15.080
for the chance to hone
her meditation skills.

00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.405
She had sought meaning

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:20.649
and made her travail
into a crucial identity.

00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:25.299
But if the people I met
were less bitter than I'd anticipated

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:26.860
about being in prison,

00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:29.725
they were also less thrilled
than I'd expected

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:32.813
about the reform process
going on in their country.

00:06:33.343 --> 00:06:34.932
Ma Thida said,

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:39.912
"We Burmese are noted
for our tremendous grace under pressure,

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:43.849
but we also have grievance under glamour."

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:48.304
She said, "And the fact that there
have been these shifts and changes

00:06:48.328 --> 00:06:52.165
doesn't erase the continuing
problems in our society

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.960
that we learned to see so well
while we were in prison."

00:06:56.385 --> 00:06:58.521
I understood her to be saying

00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:02.072
that concessions confer
only a little humanity

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.884
where full humanity is due;

00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:08.013
that crumbs are not the same
as a place at the table.

00:07:08.598 --> 00:07:09.918
Which is to say,

00:07:09.942 --> 00:07:13.072
you can forge meaning and build identity

00:07:13.096 --> 00:07:15.416
and still be mad as hell.

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:19.180
I've never been raped,

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:23.670
and I've never been in anything
remotely approaching a Burmese prison.

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:26.047
But as a gay American,

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.609
I've experienced prejudice
and even hatred,

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.864
and I've forged meaning

00:07:32.422 --> 00:07:34.624
and I've built identity,

00:07:34.648 --> 00:07:36.972
which is a move I learned from people

00:07:36.996 --> 00:07:40.934
who had experienced far worse privation
than I've ever known.

00:07:42.082 --> 00:07:43.907
In my own adolescence,

00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:46.581
I went to extreme lengths
to try to be straight.

00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:51.458
I enrolled myself in something called
"sexual surrogacy therapy,"

00:07:51.482 --> 00:07:55.144
in which people
I was encouraged to call doctors

00:07:55.168 --> 00:07:59.096
prescribed what I was encouraged
to call exercises

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.130
with women I was encouraged
to call surrogates,

00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:05.226
who were not exactly prostitutes

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.151
but who were also
not exactly anything else.

00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:11.470
(Laughter)

00:08:12.443 --> 00:08:16.656
My particular favorite
was a blonde woman from the Deep South

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.707
who eventually admitted to me
that she was really a necrophiliac,

00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:23.510
and had taken this job
after she got in trouble

00:08:23.534 --> 00:08:24.983
down at the morgue.

00:08:25.007 --> 00:08:28.854
(Laughter)

00:08:31.704 --> 00:08:34.683
These experiences eventually
allowed me to have

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:37.524
some happy physical
relationships with women,

00:08:37.548 --> 00:08:38.754
for which I'm grateful.

00:08:39.175 --> 00:08:41.063
But I was at war with myself,

00:08:41.665 --> 00:08:45.187
and I dug terrible wounds
into my own psyche.

00:08:46.544 --> 00:08:49.739
We don't seek the painful experiences

00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:51.504
that hew our identities,

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:54.146
but we seek our identities

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.102
in the wake of painful experiences.

00:08:57.643 --> 00:09:00.412
We cannot bear a pointless torment,

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:03.005
but we can endure great pain

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:05.076
if we believe that it's purposeful.

00:09:05.972 --> 00:09:08.436
Ease makes less of an impression on us

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.832
than struggle.

00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:12.578
We could have been ourselves
without our delights,

00:09:12.688 --> 00:09:16.843
but not without the misfortunes
that drive our search for meaning.

00:09:17.728 --> 00:09:21.167
"Therefore, I take
pleasure in infirmities,"

00:09:21.191 --> 00:09:23.832
St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians,

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:27.106
"for when I am weak, then I am strong."

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.355
In 1988, I went to Moscow
to interview artists

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:34.023
of the Soviet underground.

00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:37.683
I expected their work
to be dissident and political.

00:09:38.373 --> 00:09:40.474
But the radicalism in their work

00:09:40.498 --> 00:09:44.334
actually lay in reinserting
humanity into a society

00:09:44.358 --> 00:09:46.948
that was annihilating humanity itself,

00:09:46.972 --> 00:09:50.667
as, in some senses,
Russian society is now doing again.

00:09:51.234 --> 00:09:53.798
One of the artists I met said to me,

00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:57.398
"We were in training to be
not artists but angels."

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:02.740
In 1991, I went back to see
the artists I'd been writing about,

00:10:02.764 --> 00:10:06.652
and I was with them during the putsch
that ended the Soviet Union.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.353
And they were among the chief organizers
of the resistance to that putsch.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.376
And on the third day of the putsch,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.237
one of them suggested
we walk up to Smolenskaya.

00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:20.021
And we went there,

00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:23.241
and we arranged ourselves
in front of one of the barricades,

00:10:23.265 --> 00:10:24.712
and a little while later,

00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:26.411
a column of tanks rolled up.

00:10:26.895 --> 00:10:29.186
And the soldier on the front tank said,

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.024
"We have unconditional orders
to destroy this barricade.

00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:36.015
If you get out of the way,
we don't need to hurt you.

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:39.431
But if you won't move, we'll have
no choice but to run you down."

00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:42.877
The artist I was with said,
"Give us just a minute.

00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:46.750
Give us just a minute
to tell you why we're here."

00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:49.471
And the soldier folded his arms,

00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:54.070
and the artist launched into
a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy

00:10:54.094 --> 00:10:57.849
such as those of us who live
in a Jeffersonian democracy

00:10:57.873 --> 00:11:00.346
would be hard-pressed to present.

00:11:00.905 --> 00:11:02.820
And they went on and on,

00:11:02.844 --> 00:11:04.254
and the soldier watched.

00:11:04.808 --> 00:11:08.072
And then he sat there for a full minute
after they were finished

00:11:08.096 --> 00:11:10.694
and looked at us,
so bedraggled in the rain,

00:11:10.718 --> 00:11:14.820
and said, "What you have said is true,

00:11:14.844 --> 00:11:17.519
and we must bow to the will of the people.

00:11:18.238 --> 00:11:20.847
If you'll clear enough space
for us to turn around,

00:11:20.871 --> 00:11:22.725
we'll go back the way we came."

00:11:23.272 --> 00:11:24.630
And that's what they did.

00:11:25.102 --> 00:11:30.076
Sometimes, forging meaning
can give you the vocabulary you need

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.036
to fight for your ultimate freedom.

00:11:33.254 --> 00:11:36.090
Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion

00:11:36.114 --> 00:11:38.644
that oppression breeds
the power to oppose it.

00:11:38.995 --> 00:11:43.695
And I gradually understood that
as the cornerstone of identity.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:48.044
It took identity
to rescue me from sadness.

00:11:48.576 --> 00:11:50.851
The gay rights movement posits a world

00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:53.248
in which my aberrances are a victory.

00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:56.818
Identity politics
always works on two fronts:

00:11:57.354 --> 00:12:01.933
to give pride to people who have
a given condition or characteristic,

00:12:01.957 --> 00:12:04.792
and to cause the outside world
to treat such people

00:12:04.816 --> 00:12:06.598
more gently and more kindly.

00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:10.458
Those are two totally
separate enterprises,

00:12:10.482 --> 00:12:13.878
but progress in each sphere
reverberates in the other.

00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:17.640
Identity politics can be narcissistic.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.335
People extol a difference
only because it's theirs.

00:12:21.849 --> 00:12:25.144
People narrow the world
and function in discrete groups

00:12:25.168 --> 00:12:26.927
without empathy for one another.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:31.493
But properly understood
and wisely practiced,

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:35.725
identity politics should expand
our idea of what it is to be human.

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:42.001
Identity itself should be
not a smug label or a gold medal,

00:12:42.617 --> 00:12:43.970
but a revolution.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.809
I would have had an easier life
if I were straight,

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.697
but I would not be me.

00:12:50.182 --> 00:12:52.859
And I now like being myself better

00:12:52.883 --> 00:12:54.993
than the idea of being someone else,

00:12:55.017 --> 00:12:56.642
someone who, to be honest,

00:12:56.666 --> 00:13:00.560
I have neither the option of being
nor the ability fully to imagine.

00:13:01.257 --> 00:13:05.285
But if you banish the dragons,
you banish the heroes,

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:09.658
and we become attached
to the heroic strain in our own lives.

00:13:10.428 --> 00:13:11.805
I've sometimes wondered

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:14.588
whether I could have ceased
to hate that part of myself

00:13:14.612 --> 00:13:17.445
without gay pride's technicolor fiesta,

00:13:17.469 --> 00:13:20.115
of which this speech is one manifestation.

00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:21.732
(Laughter)

00:13:21.756 --> 00:13:24.689
I used to think I would know
myself to be mature

00:13:24.713 --> 00:13:27.143
when I could simply be gay
without emphasis.

00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:31.636
But the self-loathing
of that period left a void,

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.914
and celebration needs
to fill and overflow it,

00:13:34.938 --> 00:13:38.774
and even if I repay
my private debt of melancholy,

00:13:38.798 --> 00:13:41.689
there's still an outer world of homophobia

00:13:41.713 --> 00:13:43.813
that it will take decades to address.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.798
Someday, being gay will be a simple fact,

00:13:47.822 --> 00:13:50.123
free of party hats and blame.

00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:51.828
But not yet.

00:13:52.602 --> 00:13:56.775
A friend of mine who thought gay pride
was getting very carried away with itself,

00:13:56.799 --> 00:14:00.053
once suggested that we organize
Gay Humility Week.

00:14:00.077 --> 00:14:01.465
(Laughter)

00:14:01.489 --> 00:14:05.586
(Applause)

00:14:06.752 --> 00:14:07.943
It's a great idea.

00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:09.331
(Laughter)

00:14:09.355 --> 00:14:11.182
But its time has not yet come.

00:14:11.206 --> 00:14:13.167
(Laughter)

00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:18.569
And neutrality, which seems to lie
halfway between despair and celebration,

00:14:18.593 --> 00:14:20.285
is actually the endgame.

00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:23.831
In 29 states in the US,

00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:27.356
I could legally be fired or denied housing

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.705
for being gay.

00:14:29.352 --> 00:14:32.095
In Russia, the anti-propaganda law

00:14:32.119 --> 00:14:34.735
has led to people being beaten
in the streets.

00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:40.167
Twenty-seven African countries
have passed laws against sodomy.

00:14:40.191 --> 00:14:43.927
And in Nigeria, gay people
can legally be stoned to death,

00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:45.894
and lynchings have become common.

00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:48.652
In Saudi Arabia recently,

00:14:48.676 --> 00:14:51.549
two men who had been caught in carnal acts

00:14:51.573 --> 00:14:56.089
were sentenced to 7,000 lashes each,

00:14:56.113 --> 00:14:58.672
and are now permanently
disabled as a result.

00:14:59.337 --> 00:15:01.560
So who can forge meaning

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:03.094
and build identity?

00:15:04.118 --> 00:15:07.593
Gay rights are not primarily
marriage rights,

00:15:07.617 --> 00:15:10.688
and for the millions who live
in unaccepting places

00:15:10.712 --> 00:15:12.557
with no resources,

00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:14.399
dignity remains elusive.

00:15:15.106 --> 00:15:17.686
I am lucky to have forged meaning

00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:19.741
and built identity,

00:15:20.438 --> 00:15:22.321
but that's still a rare privilege.

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.524
And gay people deserve more, collectively,

00:15:25.548 --> 00:15:27.876
than the crumbs of justice.

00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:30.117
And yet,

00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.933
every step forward is so sweet.

00:15:33.815 --> 00:15:37.684
In 2007, six years after we met,

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:40.536
my partner and I decided to get married.

00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:45.315
Meeting John had been the discovery
of great happiness

00:15:45.339 --> 00:15:48.207
and also the elimination
of great unhappiness.

00:15:48.707 --> 00:15:53.772
And sometimes, I was so occupied
with the disappearance of all that pain,

00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:55.561
that I forgot about the joy,

00:15:56.148 --> 00:15:58.945
which was at first
the less remarkable part of it to me.

00:15:59.764 --> 00:16:02.371
Marrying was a way to declare our love

00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:05.322
as more a presence than an absence.

00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:08.410
Marriage soon led us to children,

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:10.381
and that meant new meanings

00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:13.706
and new identities -- ours and theirs.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:17.018
I want my children to be happy,

00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:20.713
and I love them most achingly
when they are sad.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:26.188
As a gay father, I can teach them
to own what is wrong in their lives,

00:16:26.827 --> 00:16:30.916
but I believe that if I succeed
in sheltering them from adversity,

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.896
I will have failed as a parent.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.789
A Buddhist scholar I know
once explained to me

00:16:36.813 --> 00:16:38.983
that Westerners mistakenly think

00:16:39.007 --> 00:16:43.389
that nirvana is what arrives
when all your woe is behind you,

00:16:43.909 --> 00:16:46.458
and you have only bliss
to look forward to.

00:16:47.021 --> 00:16:49.163
But he said that would not be nirvana,

00:16:49.187 --> 00:16:51.188
because your bliss in the present

00:16:51.212 --> 00:16:54.097
would always be shadowed
by the joy from the past.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.407
Nirvana, he said, is what you arrive at

00:16:57.431 --> 00:17:00.027
when you have only bliss
to look forward to

00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:04.722
and find in what looked like sorrows
the seedlings of your joy.

00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:07.178
And I sometimes wonder

00:17:07.202 --> 00:17:10.899
whether I could have found
such fulfillment in marriage and children

00:17:10.923 --> 00:17:12.488
if they'd come more readily,

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:17.046
if I'd been straight in my youth
or were young now,

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:19.538
in either of which cases
this might be easier.

00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:22.047
Perhaps I could.

00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:24.278
Perhaps all the complex
imagining I've done

00:17:24.302 --> 00:17:26.577
could have been applied to other topics.

00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:30.254
But if seeking meaning
matters more than finding meaning,

00:17:30.278 --> 00:17:34.851
the question is not whether
I'd be happier for having been bullied,

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:38.260
but whether assigning meaning
to those experiences

00:17:38.284 --> 00:17:39.981
has made me a better father.

00:17:40.878 --> 00:17:44.714
I tend to find the ecstasy
hidden in ordinary joys,

00:17:44.738 --> 00:17:48.300
because I did not expect those joys
to be ordinary to me.

00:17:49.265 --> 00:17:53.324
I know many heterosexuals who have
equally happy marriages and families,

00:17:53.348 --> 00:17:56.292
but gay marriage
is so breathtakingly fresh,

00:17:56.316 --> 00:17:59.633
and gay families so exhilaratingly new,

00:17:59.657 --> 00:18:02.754
and I found meaning in that surprise.

00:18:03.772 --> 00:18:07.262
In October, it was my 50th birthday,

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:09.828
and my family organized a party for me.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.205
And in the middle of it,
my son said to my husband

00:18:13.229 --> 00:18:14.976
that he wanted to make a speech.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.158
And John said,

00:18:16.182 --> 00:18:20.241
"George, you can't make
a speech. You're four."

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:21.946
(Laughter)

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.491
"Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I
are going to make speeches tonight."

00:18:26.515 --> 00:18:29.110
But George insisted and insisted,

00:18:29.134 --> 00:18:32.582
and finally, John took him
up to the microphone,

00:18:32.606 --> 00:18:35.455
and George said very loudly,

00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:37.899
"Ladies and gentlemen!

00:18:37.923 --> 00:18:40.395
May I have your attention, please?"

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:42.514
And everyone turned around, startled.

00:18:43.135 --> 00:18:44.446
And George said,

00:18:45.327 --> 00:18:47.207
"I'm glad it's daddy's birthday.

00:18:47.976 --> 00:18:49.713
I'm glad we all get cake.

00:18:51.284 --> 00:18:53.729
And Daddy, if you were little,

00:18:54.312 --> 00:18:55.692
I'd be your friend."

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.084
(Gasp)

00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.494
And I thought -- (Applause)

00:18:59.988 --> 00:19:01.139
Thank you.

00:19:01.163 --> 00:19:04.851
I thought that I was indebted
even to Bobby Finkel,

00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:07.517
because all those earlier experiences

00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:09.956
were what had propelled me to this moment,

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.489
and I was finally unconditionally grateful

00:19:12.513 --> 00:19:15.667
for a life I'd once have done
anything to change.

00:19:16.719 --> 00:19:20.956
The gay activist Harvey Milk
was once asked by a younger gay man

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.060
what he could do to help the movement,

00:19:23.084 --> 00:19:24.678
and Harvey Milk said,

00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:26.289
"Go out and tell someone."

00:19:27.138 --> 00:19:30.637
There's always somebody
who wants to confiscate our humanity.

00:19:31.011 --> 00:19:33.266
And there are always
stories that restore it.

00:19:33.816 --> 00:19:35.371
If we live out loud,

00:19:35.395 --> 00:19:37.392
we can trounce the hatred,

00:19:37.416 --> 00:19:39.622
and expand everyone's lives.

00:19:40.569 --> 00:19:41.785
Forge meaning.

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:43.580
Build identity.

00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:45.731
Forge meaning.

00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:48.379
Build identity.

00:19:49.228 --> 00:19:52.135
And then invite the world
to share your joy.

00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:53.874
Thank you.

00:19:53.898 --> 00:19:56.916
(Applause)

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.158
Thank you.

00:19:58.182 --> 00:20:00.200
(Applause)

00:20:00.224 --> 00:20:01.403
Thank you.

00:20:01.427 --> 00:20:04.125
(Applause)

00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:05.302
Thank you.

00:20:05.326 --> 00:20:10.357
(Applause)
