WEBVTT

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.519
So it was the fall of 1902,

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:05.437
and President Theodore Roosevelt

00:00:05.437 --> 00:00:07.217
needed a little break from the White House,

00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:09.595
so he took a train to Mississippi

00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:11.723
to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town

00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:13.910
called Smedes.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.970
The first day of the hunt,
they didn't see a single bear,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.490
so it was a big bummer for everyone,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.334
but the second day, the dogs cornered one

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.734
after a really long chase, but by that point,

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:24.178
the president had given up

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:25.920
and gone back to camp for lunch,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.531
so his hunting guide cracked the animal

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:31.199
on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.907
and then tied it up to a tree

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:35.519
and started tooting away on his bugle

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.558
to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:39.074
of shooting it.

00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:41.431
The bear was a female.

00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.007
It was dazed, injured,

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.654
severely underweight, a little mangy-looking,

00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:49.721
and when Roosevelt saw this animal

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:51.343
tied up to the tree,

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.142
he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it.

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:55.293
He felt like that would go against his code

00:00:55.293 --> 00:00:57.259
as a sportsman.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.960
A few days later, the scene was memorialized

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.995
in a political cartoon back in Washington.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.116
It was called "Drawing a Line in Mississippi,"

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:07.495
and it showed Roosevelt with
his gun down and his arm out,

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:09.132
sparing the bear's life,

00:01:09.132 --> 00:01:10.658
and the bear was sitting on its hind legs

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:12.696
with these two big, frightened, wide eyes

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:14.826
and little ears pricked up at the top of its head.

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:16.334
It looked really helpless, like you just wanted to

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:18.034
sweep it up into your arms

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:19.250
and reassure it.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.716
It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time,

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:22.784
but if you go looking for the cartoon now,

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:25.520
you recognize the animal right away:

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.474
It's a teddy bear.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.095
And this is how the teddy bear was born.

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:31.603
Essentially, toymakers took
the bear from the cartoon,

00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:33.203
turned it into a plush toy, and then named it

00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:36.397
after President Roosevelt -- Teddy's bear.

00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:38.541
And I do feel a little ridiculous

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.476
that I'm up here on this stage

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.894
and I'm choosing to use my time

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:45.162
to tell you about a 100-year-old story

00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:48.260
about the invention of a squishy kid's toy,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.220
but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.181
inside that story is a more important story,

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.409
a story about how dramatically our ideas

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.005
about nature can change,

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.345
and also about how, on the planet right now,

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:04.441
the stories that we tell

00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.709
are dramatically changing nature.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.241
Because think about the teddy bear.

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:10.746
For us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:12.249
because bears are so cute and cuddly,

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.721
and who wouldn't want to give
one to their kids to play with,

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.253
but the truth is that in 1902,

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:18.881
bears weren't cute and cuddly.

00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:20.182
I mean, they looked the same,

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.315
but no one thought of them that way.

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:24.161
In 1902, bears were monsters.

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.485
Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids.

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:29.145
For generations at that point,

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.418
the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.177
that people were encountering on the frontier,

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:35.545
and the federal government was actually

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.830
systematically exterminating bears

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.083
and lots of other predators too,

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:40.933
like coyotes and wolves.

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:42.781
These animals, they were being demonized.

00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:44.079
They were called murderers

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.235
because they killed people's livestock.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.773
One government biologist, he explained this

00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:50.953
war on animals like the bear by saying

00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:53.343
that they no longer had a place

00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:55.589
in our advancing civilization,

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:59.317
and so we were just clearing them out of the way.

00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:03.083
In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.290
had been slaughtered.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.147
The grizzly would soon be wiped out

00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:09.580
from 95 percent of its original territory,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.802
and whereas once there had been 30 million bison

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:14.420
moving across the plains, and you would have

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.128
these stories of trains having to stop

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:18.116
for four or five hours so that these thick,

00:03:18.116 --> 00:03:21.444
living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:26.803
now, by 1902, there were maybe 
less than 100 left in the wild.

00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:29.840
And so what I'm saying is, the teddy bear was born

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.364
into the middle of this great spasm of extermination,

00:03:33.364 --> 00:03:34.910
and you can see it as a sign that

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.550
maybe some people deep down

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.616
were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.644
America still hated the bear and feared it,

00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:45.200
but all of a sudden, America also wanted

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.086
to give the bear a great big hug.

00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:50.315
So this is something that I've been really
curious about in the last few years.

00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:51.989
How do we imagine animals,

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.587
how do we think and feel about them,

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:56.063
and how do their reputations get written

00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:58.319
and then rewritten in our minds?

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.163
We're here living in the eye of a great storm

00:04:01.163 --> 00:04:04.015
of extinction where half the species on the planet

00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:06.167
could be gone by the end of the century,

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:07.701
and so why is it that we come to care about

00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:10.571
some of those species and not others?

00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:12.701
Well, there's a new field, a relatively new field

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.147
of social science that started looking at

00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:16.315
these questions and trying to unpack the powerful

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:18.047
and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships

00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:20.168
that we have to animals,

00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:21.609
and I spent a lot of time looking through

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.633
their academic journals,

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:25.439
and all I can really say is that their findings

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.425
are astonishingly wide-ranging.

00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:29.251
So some of my favorites include that

00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:31.892
the more television a person
watches in Upstate New York,

00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:33.545
the more he or she is afraid

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:35.242
of being attacked by a black bear.

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:38.030
If you show a tiger to an American,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.140
they're much more likely to assume that it's female

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.400
and not male.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.168
In a study where a fake snake

00:04:43.168 --> 00:04:45.153
and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:47.405
drivers hit the snake much
more often than the turtle,

00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:49.469
and about three percent of
drivers who hit the fake animals

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.747
seemed to do it on purpose.

00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:54.337
Women are more likely than men to get a

00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:57.372
"magical feeling" when they see dolphins in the surf.

00:04:57.372 --> 00:04:59.184
Sixty-eight percent of mothers with

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:02.564
"high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem"

00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:04.209
identified with the dancing cats

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:06.674
in a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)

00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:08.359
Americans consider lobsters

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:09.655
more important than pigeons

00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:11.841
but also much, much stupider.

00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:14.837
Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly
more dangerous than sea otters,

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:20.010
and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.443
So some of this is physical, right?

00:05:21.443 --> 00:05:24.066
We tend to sympathize more
with animals that look like us,

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.696
and especially that resemble human babies,

00:05:25.696 --> 00:05:27.123
so with big, forward-facing eyes

00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:28.385
and circular faces,

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:30.119
kind of a roly-poly posture.

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:32.154
This is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,

00:05:32.154 --> 00:05:33.294
your great aunt in Minnesota,

00:05:33.294 --> 00:05:34.867
there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:37.579
and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:40.248
But it's not all physical, right?

00:05:40.248 --> 00:05:43.432
There's a cultural dimension to
how we think about animals,

00:05:43.432 --> 00:05:45.312
and we're telling stories about these animals,

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:46.670
and like all stories,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.743
they are shaped by the times and the places

00:05:48.743 --> 00:05:49.619
in which we're telling them.

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:51.093
So think about that moment

00:05:51.093 --> 00:05:54.011
back in 1902 again where a ferocious bear

00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:55.444
became a teddy bear.

00:05:55.444 --> 00:05:58.511
What was the context?
Well, America was urbanizing.

00:05:58.511 --> 00:06:01.270
For the first time, nearly a
majority of people lived in cities,

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.706
so there was a growing distance
between us and nature.

00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:05.498
There was a safe space where we could

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:08.172
reconsider the bear and romanticize it.

00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:10.906
Nature could only start to
seem this pure and adorable

00:06:10.906 --> 00:06:13.660
because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.185
And you can see that cycle playing out

00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:17.347
again and again with all kinds of animals.

00:06:17.347 --> 00:06:19.223
It seems like we're always stuck between

00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:21.630
demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.210
and then when we get very close to doing that,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.747
empathizing with it as an underdog

00:06:25.747 --> 00:06:28.272
and wanting to show it compassion.

00:06:28.272 --> 00:06:30.070
So we exert our power,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.514
but then we're unsettled

00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:34.289
by how powerful we are.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.413
So for example, this is one of

00:06:36.413 --> 00:06:39.050
probably thousands of letters and drawings

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.594
that kids sent to the Bush administration,

00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:42.305
begging it to protect the polar bear

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:43.572
under the Endangered Species Act,

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.080
and these were sent back in the mid-2000s,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.233
when awareness of climate
change was suddenly surging.

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:49.562
We kept seeing that image of a polar bear

00:06:49.562 --> 00:06:50.980
stranded on a little ice floe

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.327
looking really morose.

00:06:52.327 --> 00:06:54.091
I spent days looking through these files.

00:06:54.091 --> 00:06:56.250
I really love them. This one's my favorite.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.361
If you can see, it's a polar bear that's drowning

00:06:58.361 --> 00:07:00.776
and then it's also being eaten simultaneously

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:03.480
by a lobster and a shark.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.192
This one came from a kid named Fritz,

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:06.886
and he's actually got a solution to climate change.

00:07:06.886 --> 00:07:08.732
He's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.

00:07:08.732 --> 00:07:11.382
He says, "I feel bad about the polar bears.

00:07:11.382 --> 00:07:13.494
I like polar bears.

00:07:13.494 --> 00:07:19.280
Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz."

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.275
So 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.583
writing about polar bears leaping into their boats

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:25.826
and trying to devour them,

00:07:25.826 --> 00:07:27.493
even if they lit the bear on fire,

00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:29.673
but these kids don't see the polar bear that way,

00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:31.463
and actually they don't even see the polar bear

00:07:31.463 --> 00:07:33.223
the way that I did back in the '80s.

00:07:33.223 --> 00:07:34.343
I mean, we thought of these animals

00:07:34.343 --> 00:07:37.209
as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:39.529
But look now how quickly that climate change

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:42.415
has flipped the image of the animal in our minds.

00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:44.855
It's gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer

00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:47.929
to this delicate, drowning victim,

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:49.442
and when you think about it, that's kind of

00:07:49.442 --> 00:07:51.423
the conclusion to the story

00:07:51.423 --> 00:07:54.725
that the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:57.615
because back then, America had more or less

00:07:57.615 --> 00:07:58.930
conquered its share of the continent.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.233
We were just getting around to

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:02.251
polishing off these last wild predators.

00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:04.805
Now, society's reach has expanded

00:08:04.805 --> 00:08:06.865
all the way to the top of the world,

00:08:06.865 --> 00:08:09.159
and it's made even these, the most remote,

00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:11.191
the most powerful bears on the planet,

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:14.690
seem like adorable and blameless victims.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.581
But you know, there's also a
postscript to the teddy bear story

00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:19.218
that not a lot of people talk about.

00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:21.001
We're going to talk about it,

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.174
because even though it didn't really take long

00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:24.974
after Roosevelt's hunt in 1902

00:08:24.974 --> 00:08:26.951
for the toy to become a full-blown craze,

00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:29.452
most people figured it was a fad,

00:08:29.452 --> 00:08:31.684
it was a sort of silly political novelty item

00:08:31.684 --> 00:08:33.926
and it would go away once the president left office,

00:08:33.926 --> 00:08:37.723
and so by 1909, when Roosevelt's successor,

00:08:37.723 --> 00:08:39.148
William Howard Taft,

00:08:39.148 --> 00:08:40.556
was getting ready to be inaugurated,

00:08:40.556 --> 00:08:42.488
the toy industry was on the hunt

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:45.315
for the next big thing.

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:47.572
They didn't do too well.

00:08:47.572 --> 00:08:50.171
That January, Taft was the guest of honor

00:08:50.171 --> 00:08:51.610
at a banquet in Atlanta,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.479
and for days in advance,

00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:54.924
the big news was the menu.

00:08:54.924 --> 00:08:56.010
They were going to be serving him

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.074
a Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,

00:08:58.074 --> 00:09:00.980
called possum and taters.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.582
So you would have a whole opossum

00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:04.947
roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,

00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:06.394
and then sometimes they'd leave

00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:09.878
the big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.

00:09:09.878 --> 00:09:11.557
The one brought to Taft's table

00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:14.742
weighed 18 pounds.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:17.446
So after dinner, the orchestra started to play,

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:19.286
and the guests burst into song,

00:09:19.286 --> 00:09:20.910
and all of a sudden, Taft was surprised

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.632
with the presentation of a gift

00:09:22.632 --> 00:09:24.524
from a group of local supporters,

00:09:24.524 --> 00:09:26.960
and this was a stuffed opossum toy,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.170
all beady-eyed and bald-eared,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.870
and it was a new product they were putting forward

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.592
to be the William Taft presidency's answer

00:09:34.592 --> 00:09:38.140
to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.586
They were calling it the "billy possum."

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:46.436
Within 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company

00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:47.986
was up and running, brokering deals

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:49.586
for these things nationwide,

00:09:49.586 --> 00:09:51.184
and the Los Angeles Times announced,

00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:53.136
very confidently, "The teddy bear

00:09:53.136 --> 00:09:55.662
has been relegated to a seat in the rear,

00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:58.260
and for four years, possibly eight,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.214
the children of the United States

00:10:00.214 --> 00:10:03.446
will play with billy possum."

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:05.570
So from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.038
There were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,

00:10:08.038 --> 00:10:10.200
billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.930
There were smaller billy possums on a stick

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.872
that kids could wave around like flags.

00:10:14.872 --> 00:10:16.790
But even with all this marketing,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.820
the life of the billy possum

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.004
turned out to be just pathetically brief.

00:10:22.004 --> 00:10:24.047
The toy was an absolute flop,

00:10:24.047 --> 00:10:25.626
and it was almost completely forgotten

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:26.994
by the end of the year,

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:29.086
and what that means is that the billy possum

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.586
didn't even make it to Christmastime,

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:31.626
which when you think about it is

00:10:31.626 --> 00:10:35.475
a special sort of tragedy for a toy.

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:37.398
So we can explain that failure two ways.

00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:39.588
The first, well, it's pretty obvious.

00:10:39.588 --> 00:10:41.476
I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:

00:10:41.476 --> 00:10:44.337
Opossums are hideous. (Laughter)

00:10:44.337 --> 00:10:47.000
But maybe more importantly is that

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.690
the story of the billy possum was all wrong,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.221
especially compared

00:10:51.221 --> 00:10:53.302
to the backstory of the teddy bear.

00:10:53.302 --> 00:10:55.544
Think about it: for most of
human's evolutionary history,

00:10:55.544 --> 00:10:57.869
what's made bears impressive to us

00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:00.041
has been their complete independence from us.

00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:02.626
It's that they live these parallel lives

00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:05.131
as menaces and competitors.

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:07.486
By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,

00:11:07.486 --> 00:11:09.464
that stature was being crushed,

00:11:09.464 --> 00:11:11.702
and the animal that he had roped to a tree

00:11:11.702 --> 00:11:14.003
really was a symbol for all bears.

00:11:14.003 --> 00:11:16.430
Whether those animals lived or died now

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.440
was entirely up to the compassion

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.857
or the indifference of people.

00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:23.681
That said something really ominous

00:11:23.681 --> 00:11:26.363
about the future of bears,

00:11:26.363 --> 00:11:29.500
but it also said something very 
unsettling about who we'd become,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.942
if the survival of even an animal like that

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:34.231
was up to us now.

00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:36.311
So now, a century later, if you're at all

00:11:36.311 --> 00:11:38.511
paying attention to what's
happening in the environment,

00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:42.189
you feel that discomfort so much more intensely.

00:11:42.189 --> 00:11:45.011
We're living now in an age of what scientists

00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:47.221
have started to call "conservation reliance,"

00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:49.411
and what that term means is that we've disrupted

00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:52.575
so much that nature can't possibly
stand on its own anymore,

00:11:52.575 --> 00:11:54.277
and most endangered species

00:11:54.277 --> 00:11:56.049
are only going to survive

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.167
if we stay out there in the landscape

00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:00.663
riggging the world around them in their favor.

00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:02.519
So we've gone hands-on

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:04.957
and we can't ever take our hands off,

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:06.850
and that's a hell of a lot of work.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.929
Right now, we're training condors

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:11.881
not to perch on power lines.

00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:14.594
We teach whooping cranes
to migrate south for the winter

00:12:14.594 --> 00:12:16.893
behind little ultra-light airplanes.

00:12:16.893 --> 00:12:20.202
We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.

00:12:20.202 --> 00:12:24.552
We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.

00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:27.869
So we've gone from annihilating species

00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:31.373
to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species

00:12:31.373 --> 00:12:33.315
indefinitely, and which ones?

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:34.507
Well, the ones that we've told

00:12:34.507 --> 00:12:36.131
compelling stories about,

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:39.346
the ones we've decided ought to stick around.

00:12:39.346 --> 00:12:42.920
The line between conservation and domestication

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.945
is blurred.

00:12:44.945 --> 00:12:46.797
So what I've been saying is that the stories

00:12:46.797 --> 00:12:49.420
that we tell about wild animals are so subjective

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.582
they can be irrational

00:12:50.582 --> 00:12:52.766
or romanticized or sensationalized.

00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:55.515
Sometimes they just have
nothing to do with the facts.

00:12:55.515 --> 00:12:58.765
But in a world of conservation reliance,

00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:00.971
those stories have very real consequences,

00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:03.399
because now, how we feel about an animal

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:05.029
affects its survival

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:07.389
more than anything that you read about

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:09.438
in ecology textbooks.

00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:11.840
Storytelling matters now.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.373
Emotion matters.

00:13:13.373 --> 00:13:19.025
Our imagination has become an ecological force.

00:13:19.025 --> 00:13:20.962
And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part

00:13:20.962 --> 00:13:23.653
because the legend of Roosevelt

00:13:23.653 --> 00:13:25.708
and that bear in Mississippi

00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:27.168
was kind of like an allegory

00:13:27.168 --> 00:13:29.261
of this great responsibility that society

00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:31.955
was just beginning to face up to back then.

00:13:31.955 --> 00:13:34.375
It would be another 71 years

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:36.229
before the Endangered Species Act was passed,

00:13:36.229 --> 00:13:38.559
but really, here's its whole ethos

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:40.513
boiled down into something like a scene

00:13:40.513 --> 00:13:42.859
you'd see in a stained glass window.

00:13:42.859 --> 00:13:45.851
The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,

00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.402
and the president of the United States

00:13:48.402 --> 00:13:50.794
decided to show it some mercy.

00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:53.440
Thank you.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.154
(Applause)
