WEBVTT

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.198
What do augmented reality

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:04.604
and professional football

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:06.798
have to do with empathy?

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.983
And what is the air speed velocity

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:11.158
of an unladen swallow?

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:13.778
Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:14.895
one of those questions today,

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.186
so please, try and contain your disappointment.

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:19.658
When most people think about augmented reality,

00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:22.063
they think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.973
waving his hands in the air,

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:27.232
but augmented reality is not science fiction.

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:29.507
Augmented reality is something that will happen

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.711
in our lifetime, and it will happen

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:33.422
because we have the tools to make it happen,

00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:35.205
and people need to be aware of that,

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.686
because augmented reality will change our lives

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:41.469
just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.070
Now how do we get to augmented reality?

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.126
Step one is the step I'm wearing right now,

00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:47.530
Google Glass.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.150
I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.597
What you may not be familiar with

00:00:51.597 --> 00:00:54.037
is that Google Glass is a device

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:57.679
that will allow you to see what I see.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.695
It will allow you to experience what it is like

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:01.991
to be a professional athlete on the field.

00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:05.512
Right now, the only way you can be on the field

00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:07.288
is for me to try and describe it to you.

00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:08.799
I have to use words.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.147
I have to create a framework that you then fill in

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:13.098
with your imagination.

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:17.275
With Google Glass, we can put that

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:18.885
underneath a helmet,

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.031
and we can get a sense of what it's like

00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.130
to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.203
your blood pounding in your ears.

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:28.110
You can get a sense of what it's like

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.997
to have a 250-pound man

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:32.658
sprinting at you

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:34.634
trying to decapitate you

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:36.465
with every ounce of his being.

00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:37.851
And I've been on the receiving end of that,

00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:39.408
and it doesn't feel very good.

00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:41.987
Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:43.914
to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet

00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:45.148
to give you a taste of that.

00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:48.059
Unfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:50.474
because the NFL thinks emergent technology

00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:52.722
is what happens when a submarine surfaces,

00:01:52.722 --> 00:01:56.685
but — (Laughter) — we do what we can.

00:01:56.685 --> 00:02:00.160
So let's pull up some video.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.560
(Video) Chris Kluwe: Go.

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:09.429
Ugh, getting tackled sucks.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.387
Hold on, let's get a little closer.

00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:13.765
All right, ready?

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:16.814
Go!

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:19.459
Chris Kluwe: So as you can see,

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.726
small taste of what it's like to get tackled

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:22.848
on the football field

00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:24.727
from the perspective of the tacklee.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:25.980
Now, you may have noticed there are

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.075
some people missing there:

00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:28.901
the rest of the team.

00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:30.641
We have some video of that

00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:32.145
courtesy of the University of Washington.

00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:36.501
(Video) Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.984
Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:42.645
Oh!

00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:46.076
CK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:48.026
to what it's like to be on that field,

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:49.999
but this is nowhere what it's like

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.437
to be on the NFL.

00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:54.198
Fans want that experience.

00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:55.442
Fans want to be on that field.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.606
They want to be their favorite players,

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:00.338
and they've already talked to me on YouTube,

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:01.414
they've talked to me on Twitter, saying,

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.362
"Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?

00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:04.554
Can you get this on a running back?

00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:06.147
We want that experience."

00:03:06.147 --> 00:03:08.292
Well, once we have that experience with GoPro

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:09.615
and Google Glass,

00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.006
how do we make it more immersive?

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:12.201
How do we take that next step?

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:14.120
Well, we take that step

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.789
by going to something called the Oculus Rift,

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.896
which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.883
The Oculus Rift has been described as one of

00:03:20.883 --> 00:03:23.790
the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.273
and that is not empty hype.

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:27.433
I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:30.230
with this video.

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:36.240
(Video) Man: Oh! Oh!

00:03:36.524 --> 00:03:41.391
No! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!

00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:45.952
Oh my God! Aaaah!

00:03:45.952 --> 00:03:49.237
CK: So that is the experience of a man

00:03:49.237 --> 00:03:51.251
on a roller coaster

00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.030
in fear of his life.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.702
What do you think that fan's experience

00:03:56.702 --> 00:03:58.663
is going to be when we take the video footage

00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:01.775
of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.513
shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm

00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:05.607
before sprinting in for a touchdown?

00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:07.000
What do you think that fan's experience

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.156
is going to be when he's Messi

00:04:09.156 --> 00:04:10.376
sprinting down the pitch

00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:11.878
putting the ball in the back of the net,

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.160
or Federer serving in Wimbledon?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.492
What do you think his experience is going to be

00:04:16.492 --> 00:04:18.430
when he is going down the side of a mountain

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.207
at over 70 miles an hour

00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:23.226
as an Olympic downhill skier?

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:25.551
I think adult diaper sales may surge.

00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:26.460
(Laughter)

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.391
But this is not yet augmented reality.

00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:31.307
This is only virtual reality, V.R.

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:33.721
How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?

00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:35.830
We get to augmented reality

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.403
when coaches and managers and owners

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.557
look at this information streaming in

00:04:40.557 --> 00:04:41.943
that people want to see, and they say,

00:04:41.943 --> 00:04:44.915
"How do we use this to make our teams better?

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:46.940
How do we use this to win games?"

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.402
Because teams always use technology to win games.

00:04:49.402 --> 00:04:51.180
They like winning. It makes them money.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.156
So a brief history of technology in the NFL.

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:56.167
In 1965, the Baltimore Colts

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:57.820
put a wristband on their quarterback

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.114
to allow him to call plays quicker.

00:05:00.114 --> 00:05:01.518
They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.

00:05:01.518 --> 00:05:03.113
Other teams followed suit.

00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:05.276
More people watched the game
because it was more exciting.

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:06.730
It was faster.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.130
In 1994, the NFL put helmet radios

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.057
into the helmets of the quarterbacks,

00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:13.301
and later the defense.

00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:15.690
More people watched games because it was faster.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.356
It was more entertaining.

00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:20.469
In 2023, imagine you're a player

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:21.920
walking back to the huddle,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.260
and you have your next play displayed

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.226
right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.468
that you already wear right now.

00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:31.335
No more having to worry about forgetting plays.

00:05:31.335 --> 00:05:33.996
No more worrying about having
to memorize your playbook.

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:35.923
You just go out and react.

00:05:35.923 --> 00:05:37.371
And coaches really want this,

00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:39.924
because missed assignments lose you games,

00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:41.980
and coaches hate losing games.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.237
Losing games gets you fired as a coach.

00:05:44.237 --> 00:05:46.024
They don't want that.

00:05:46.024 --> 00:05:48.667
But augmented reality is not just

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.331
an enhanced playbook.

00:05:50.331 --> 00:05:53.635
Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data

00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:55.180
and use it in real time

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.773
to enhance how you play the game.

00:05:57.773 --> 00:05:59.830
What would that be like?

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.385
Well, a very simple setup would be a camera

00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:04.040
on each corner of the stadium looking down,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.304
giving you a bird's-eye view

00:06:05.304 --> 00:06:06.858
of all the people down there.

00:06:06.858 --> 00:06:09.432
You also have information from helmet sensors

00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:10.540
and accelerometers,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.473
technology that's being worked on right now.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.032
You take all that information,
and you stream it to your players.

00:06:16.032 --> 00:06:18.226
The good teams stream it in a
way that the players can use.

00:06:18.226 --> 00:06:20.208
The bad ones have information overload.

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:22.264
That determines good teams from bad.

00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:25.010
And now, your I.T. department

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.582
is just as important as your scouting department,

00:06:27.582 --> 00:06:30.167
and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:32.598
It's also for jocks. Who knew?

00:06:32.598 --> 00:06:34.474
What would that look like on the field?

00:06:34.474 --> 00:06:36.583
Well, imagine you're the quarterback.

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:38.077
You take the snap and you drop back.

00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:40.124
You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.

00:06:40.124 --> 00:06:42.291
All of a sudden, a bright flash

00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.975
on the left side of your visor lets you know,

00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:46.246
blind side linebacker is blitzing in.

00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:47.722
Normally, you wouldn't be able to see him,

00:06:47.722 --> 00:06:49.963
but the augmented reality system lets you know.

00:06:49.963 --> 00:06:51.132
You step up into the pocket.

00:06:51.132 --> 00:06:53.258
Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.

00:06:53.258 --> 00:06:55.556
You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.

00:06:55.556 --> 00:06:57.325
The ball comes off track.

00:06:57.325 --> 00:06:58.783
You don't know where it's going to land.

00:06:58.783 --> 00:07:00.361
However, on the receiver's visor,

00:07:00.361 --> 00:07:02.494
he sees a patch of grass light up,

00:07:02.494 --> 00:07:04.290
and he knows to readjust.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.519
He goes, catches the ball,

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:07.047
sprints in, touchdown.

00:07:07.047 --> 00:07:08.973
Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him

00:07:08.973 --> 00:07:10.314
every step of the way,

00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:12.498
watching from every perspective.

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:15.378
Now this is something that will create

00:07:15.378 --> 00:07:17.184
massive excitement in the game.

00:07:17.184 --> 00:07:19.452
It will make tons of people watch,

00:07:19.452 --> 00:07:21.843
because people want this experience.

00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:23.669
Fans want to be on the field.

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:25.932
They want to be their favorite player.

00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:28.050
Augmented reality will be a part of sports,

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.496
because it's too profitable not to.

00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:33.395
But the question I ask you is,

00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:36.746
is that's all that we're content
to use augmented reality for?

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:39.454
Are we going to use it solely for our panem,

00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:41.902
our circenses, our entertainment as normal?

00:07:41.902 --> 00:07:44.708
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality

00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:46.119
for something more.

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:48.286
I believe we can use augmented reality

00:07:48.286 --> 00:07:50.279
as a way to foster more empathy

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.583
within the human species itself,

00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:54.245
by literally showing someone

00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:55.684
what it looks like

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.970
to walk a mile in another person's shoes.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.712
We know what this technology is worth

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:01.930
to sports leagues.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.158
It's worth revenue, to the tune
of billions of dollars a year.

00:08:05.158 --> 00:08:07.208
But what is this technology worth

00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:09.080
to a teacher in a classroom

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.516
trying to show a bully

00:08:10.516 --> 00:08:12.232
just how harmful his actions are

00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:14.839
from the perspective of the victim?

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:16.485
What is this technology worth

00:08:16.485 --> 00:08:18.417
to a gay Ugandan or Russian

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.040
trying to show the world what it's like

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.790
living under persecution?

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.723
What is this technology worth

00:08:23.723 --> 00:08:27.297
to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson

00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:30.040
trying to inspire a generation of children

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.806
to think more about space and science

00:08:32.806 --> 00:08:36.511
instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?

00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:39.256
Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality

00:08:39.256 --> 00:08:41.426
is coming.

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:45.264
The questions we ask, the choices we make,

00:08:45.264 --> 00:08:46.897
and the challenges we face

00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:49.267
are, as always, up to us.

00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:51.020
Thank you.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.267
(Applause)
