00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:03.046
I'm excited to be here to speak about vets,

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:04.652
because I didn't join the Army

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:06.800
because I wanted to go to war.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.518
I didn't join the Army because I had a lust

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:13.175
or a need to go overseas and fight.

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:15.515
Frankly, I joined the Army because

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.242
college is really damn expensive,

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.951
and they were going to help with that,

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.291
and I joined the Army because

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:23.447
it was what I knew,

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:26.309
and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.707
I didn't come from a military family.

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:29.950
I'm not a military brat.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.729
No one in my family ever
had joined the military at all,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.015
and how I first got introduced to the military

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.110
was when I was 13 years old

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.789
and I got sent away to military school,

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.458
because my mother had been threatening me

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.564
with this idea of military school
ever since I was eight years old.

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:47.631
I had some issues when I was coming up,

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:49.659
and my mother would always tell me, she's like,

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.105
"You know, if you don't get this together,

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:52.371
I'm going to send you to military school."

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:53.931
And I'd look at her, and I'd say, "Mommy,

00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:55.863
I'll work harder."

00:00:55.863 --> 00:00:57.347
And then when I was nine years old,

00:00:57.347 --> 00:00:59.575
she started giving me brochures
to show me she wasn't playing around,

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:00.870
so I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.197
"Okay, Mommy, I can see you're
serious, and I'll work harder."

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:05.349
And then when I was 10 and 11,

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.503
my behavior just kept on getting worse.

00:01:08.503 --> 00:01:10.870
I was on academic and disciplinary probation

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.601
before I hit double digits,

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.543
and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.491
when I was 11 years old.

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.107
And so when I was 13 years old,

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:23.121
my mother came up to me, and she was like,

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:24.857
"I'm not going to do this anymore.

00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:26.403
I'm going to send you to military school."

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:28.241
And I looked at her, and I said, "Mommy,

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.381
I can see you're upset, and
I'm going to work harder."

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.476
And she was like, "No, you're going next week."

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.881
And that was how I first got introduced

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.471
to this whole idea of the military,

00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:41.367
because she thought this was a good idea.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.179
I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.479
when I first showed up there,

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.279
because literally in the first four days,

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.447
I had already run away five times from this school.

00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:50.333
They had these big black gates
that surrounded the school,

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.423
and every time they would turn their backs,

00:01:52.423 --> 00:01:54.879
I would just simply run out of the black gates

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.741
and take them up on their offer
that if we don't want to be there,

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.171
we can leave at any time.

00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:59.864
So I just said, "Well, if that's the case,

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:03.112
then I'd like to leave." (Laughter)

00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:05.223
And it never worked.

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:07.397
And I kept on getting lost.

00:02:07.397 --> 00:02:08.579
But then eventually,

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.109
after staying there for a little while,

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.511
and after the end of that first year

00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:14.359
at this military school,

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:19.015
I realized that I actually was growing up.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.539
I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.887
and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure

00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:27.634
was something that I'd never found before:

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:30.503
the fact that I finally felt like I
was part of something bigger,

00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:32.953
part of a team, and it actually mattered to people

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:34.665
that I was there,

00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:37.855
the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there,

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:41.131
but that it was a real, actually core part

00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:43.280
of the entire experience.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.404
And so when it was time for me to actually

00:02:45.404 --> 00:02:47.448
finish up high school,

00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:50.116
I started thinking about what I wanted to do,

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:51.920
and just like probably most students,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.314
had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do.

00:02:55.314 --> 00:02:57.009
And I thought about the people who I

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.298
respected and admired.

00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:00.984
I thought about a lot of the people,

00:03:00.984 --> 00:03:03.803
in particular a lot of the men, in my life

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:05.732
who I looked up to.

00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:07.607
They all happened to wear the uniform

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:09.546
of the United States of America,

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:11.791
so for me, the question and the answer

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.858
really became pretty easy.

00:03:13.858 --> 00:03:15.606
The question of what I wanted to do

00:03:15.606 --> 00:03:17.244
was filled in very quickly with saying,

00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:20.443
I guess I'll be an Army officer.

00:03:20.443 --> 00:03:22.267
So the Army then went through this process

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:23.468
and they trained me up,

00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:24.870
and when I say I didn't join the Army

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.500
because I wanted to go to war,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.583
the truth is, I joined in 1996.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.353
There really wasn't a whole lot going on.

00:03:31.353 --> 00:03:33.419
I didn't ever feel like I was in danger.

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.542
When I went to my mom,

00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:36.155
I first joined the Army when I was 17 years old,

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:37.864
so I literally needed parental permission

00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:38.947
to join the Army,

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:40.427
so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom,

00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:42.420
and she just assumed it was
kind of like military school.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.724
She was like, "Well, it was good for him before,

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:46.107
so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it,"

00:03:46.107 --> 00:03:48.908
having no idea that the
paperwork that she was signing

00:03:48.908 --> 00:03:50.940
was actually signing her son up

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.138
to become an Army officer.

00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:55.912
And I went through the process,

00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:57.706
and again the whole time still just thinking,

00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:01.529
this is great, maybe I'll serve on a weekend,

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:06.643
or two weeks during the year, do drill,

00:04:06.643 --> 00:04:09.359
and then a couple years after I signed up,

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.945
a couple years after my mother signed those papers,

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:15.671
the whole world changed.

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:18.875
And after 9/11, there was an entirely new context

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:22.865
about the occupation that I chose.

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:27.430
When I first joined, I never joined to fight,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.100
but now that I was in,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.887
this is exactly what was now going to happen.

00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:36.234
And I thought about so much about the soldiers

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.091
who I eventually had to end up leading.

00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:40.601
I remember when we first, right after 9/11,

00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:43.224
three weeks after 9/11, I was
on a plane heading overseas,

00:04:43.224 --> 00:04:45.210
but I wasn't heading overseas with the military,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.245
I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.566
to go overseas.

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:50.416
I received the scholarship to go overseas

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:52.716
and to go study and live overseas,

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:54.788
and I was living in England and that was interesting,

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:56.254
but at the same time, the same people who

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.998
I was training with,

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:01.411
the same soldiers that I went
through all my training with,

00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:03.600
and we prepared for war,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.086
they were now actually heading over to it.

00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:08.967
They were now about to find themselves

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:11.151
in the middle of places the fact is

00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:12.719
the vast majority of people,

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.985
the vast majority of us as we were training,

00:05:14.985 --> 00:05:18.924
couldn't even point out on a map.

00:05:18.924 --> 00:05:20.690
I spent a couple years finishing graduate school,

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.950
and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.536
in buildings at Oxford

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:26.910
that were literally built hundreds of years

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.758
before the United States was even founded,

00:05:28.758 --> 00:05:31.930
and I'm sitting there talking to dons

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.894
about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand,

00:05:35.894 --> 00:05:40.216
and how that influenced the start of World War I,

00:05:40.216 --> 00:05:42.460
where the entire time my heart and my head

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.344
were on my soldiers

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:47.314
who were now throwing on Kevlars

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.750
and grabbing their flak vests

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.298
and figuring out how exactly do I change around

00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:53.590
or how exactly do I clean a machine gun

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.638
in the darkness.

00:05:56.638 --> 00:05:59.571
That was the new reality.

00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:01.944
By the time I finished that up and I rejoined

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:04.634
my military unit and we were getting
ready to deploy to Afghanistan,

00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:06.222
there were soldiers in my unit who were now

00:06:06.222 --> 00:06:08.320
on their second and third deployments

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.740
before I even had my first.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.728
I remember walking out with
my unit for the first time,

00:06:11.728 --> 00:06:13.092
and when you join the Army

00:06:13.092 --> 00:06:14.748
and you go through a combat tour,

00:06:14.748 --> 00:06:16.082
everyone looks at your shoulder,

00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:19.860
because on your shoulder is your combat patch.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.136
And so immediately as you meet people,

00:06:21.136 --> 00:06:22.552
you shake their hand,

00:06:22.552 --> 00:06:24.411
and then your eyes go to their shoulder,

00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:26.024
because you want to see where did they serve,

00:06:26.024 --> 00:06:27.330
or what unit did they serve with?

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.024
And I was the only person walking around

00:06:29.024 --> 00:06:31.314
with a bare shoulder,

00:06:31.314 --> 00:06:35.404
and it burned every time someone stared at it.

00:06:35.404 --> 00:06:38.412
But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers,

00:06:38.412 --> 00:06:42.190
and you ask them why did they sign up.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.279
I signed up because college was expensive.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:50.700
A lot of my soldiers signed up
for completely different reasons.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.632
They signed up because of a sense of obligation.

00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:54.441
They signed up because they were angry

00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:56.258
and they wanted to do something about it.

00:06:56.258 --> 00:06:57.570
They signed up because

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.416
their family said this was important.

00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:01.628
They signed up because they
wanted some form of revenge.

00:07:01.628 --> 00:07:06.276
They signed for a whole
collection of different reasons.

00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:09.044
And now we all found ourselves overseas

00:07:09.044 --> 00:07:12.945
fighting in these conflicts.

00:07:12.945 --> 00:07:15.456
And what was amazing to me was that I

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:19.778
very naively started hearing this statement

00:07:19.778 --> 00:07:23.044
that I never fully understood,

00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:25.402
because right after 9/11, you start hearing this idea

00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:26.759
where people come up to you and they say,

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.396
"Well, thank you for your service."

00:07:29.396 --> 00:07:31.359
And I just kind of followed in and started saying

00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:32.994
the same things to all my soldiers.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.575
This is even before I deployed.

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:38.070
But I really had no idea what that even meant.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.074
I just said it because it sounded right.

00:07:40.074 --> 00:07:41.850
I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.494
to people who had served overseas.

00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:45.924
"Thank you for your service."

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.940
But I had no idea what the context was

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.270
or what that even,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.840
what it even meant to the people who heard it.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.626
When I first came back from Afghanistan,

00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:02.100
I thought that if you make it back from conflict,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.941
then the dangers were all over.

00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:08.138
I thought that if you made it
back from a conflict zone

00:08:08.138 --> 00:08:10.437
that somehow you could kind of

00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:11.671
wipe the sweat off your brow and say,

00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:15.415
"Whew, I'm glad I dodged that one,"

00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:17.223
without understanding that for so many people,

00:08:17.223 --> 00:08:19.366
as they come back home,

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:21.665
the war keeps going.

00:08:21.665 --> 00:08:23.919
It keeps playing out in all of our minds.

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:26.557
It plays out in all of our memories.

00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:31.220
It plays out in all of our emotions.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.557
Please forgive us

00:08:32.557 --> 00:08:37.767
if we don't like being in big crowds.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.030
Please forgive us

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.354
when we spend one week in a place

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:44.702
that has 100 percent light discipline,

00:08:44.702 --> 00:08:46.930
because you're not allowed to
walk around with white lights,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.417
because if anything has a white light,

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:49.894
it can be seen from miles away,

00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:51.607
versus if you use little green

00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:52.774
or little blue lights,

00:08:52.774 --> 00:08:54.706
they cannot be seen from far away.

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:56.839
So please forgive us if out of nowhere,

00:08:56.839 --> 00:09:00.046
we go from having 100 percent light discipline

00:09:00.046 --> 00:09:02.599
to then a week later being back
in the middle of Times Square,

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:07.730
and we have a difficult time adjusting to that.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.162
Please forgive us

00:09:09.162 --> 00:09:11.001
when you transition back to a family

00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:15.105
who has completely been maneuvering without you,

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:17.132
and now when you come back, it's not that easy

00:09:17.132 --> 00:09:20.776
to fall back into a sense of normality,

00:09:20.776 --> 00:09:25.258
because the whole normal has changed.

00:09:25.258 --> 00:09:28.820
I remember when I came back,
I wanted to talk to people.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.579
I wanted people to ask me about my experiences.

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:33.327
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,

00:09:33.327 --> 00:09:34.642
"What did you do?"

00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:36.129
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:37.747
"What was it like? What was the food like?

00:09:37.747 --> 00:09:42.272
What was the experience like? How are you doing?"

00:09:42.272 --> 00:09:44.333
And the only questions I got from people was,

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.064
"Did you shoot anybody?"

00:09:47.064 --> 00:09:48.890
And those were the ones who were even curious

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.548
enough to say anything.

00:09:52.548 --> 00:09:54.218
Because sometimes there's this fear

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:55.783
and there's this apprehension that if I say anything,

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:57.259
I'm afraid I'll offend,

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:58.633
or I'm afraid I'll trigger something,

00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:03.291
so the common default is just saying nothing.

00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:05.890
The problem with that

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.496
is then it feels like your service

00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:10.010
was not even acknowledged,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.017
like no one even cared.

00:10:13.017 --> 00:10:16.040
"Thank you for your service,"

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.133
and we move on.

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:21.809
What I wanted to better understand

00:10:21.809 --> 00:10:25.123
was what's behind that,

00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:30.875
and why "thank you for your service" isn't enough.

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:34.491
The fact is, we have literally

00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:37.048
2.6 million men and women

00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:39.972
who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.642
who are all amongst us.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.122
Sometimes we know who they are,

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:47.234
sometimes we don't,

00:10:47.234 --> 00:10:49.401
but there is that feeling, the shared experience,

00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:52.325
the shared bond

00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:54.197
where we know that that experience

00:10:54.197 --> 00:10:56.206
and that chapter of our life,

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:58.921
while it might be closed,

00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:02.967
it's still not over.

00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:04.596
We think about "thank you for your service,"

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:06.665
and people say, "So what does 'thank
you for your service' mean to you?"

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.345
Well, "Thank you for your service" means to me,

00:11:08.345 --> 00:11:12.423
it means acknowledging our stories,

00:11:12.423 --> 00:11:15.289
asking us who we are,

00:11:15.289 --> 00:11:17.702
understanding the strength

00:11:17.702 --> 00:11:21.932
that so many people, so many
people who we serve with, have,

00:11:21.932 --> 00:11:25.652
and why that service means so much.

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:27.786
"Thank you for your service"
means acknowledging the fact

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:29.604
that just because we've now come home

00:11:29.604 --> 00:11:30.895
and we've taken off the uniform

00:11:30.895 --> 00:11:33.175
does not mean our larger service to this country

00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:35.851
is somehow over.

00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:38.732
The fact is, there's still a tremendous amount

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:42.922
that can be offered and can be given.

00:11:42.922 --> 00:11:44.352
When I look at people

00:11:44.352 --> 00:11:49.010
like our friend Taylor Urruela,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.754
who in Iraq loses his leg,

00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:53.412
had two big dreams in his life.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:56.480
One was to be a soldier. The other
was to be a baseball player.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.280
He loses his leg in Iraq.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.904
He comes back

00:12:02.904 --> 00:12:04.598
and instead of deciding that,

00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:07.016
well, now since I've lost my
leg, that second dream is over,

00:12:07.016 --> 00:12:09.430
he decides that he still has that
dream of playing baseball,

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.402
and he starts this group called VETSports,

00:12:11.402 --> 00:12:13.313
which now works with veterans all over the country

00:12:13.313 --> 00:12:18.648
and uses sports as a way of healing.

00:12:18.648 --> 00:12:20.991
People like Tammy Duckworth,

00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:22.239
who was a helicopter pilot

00:12:22.239 --> 00:12:24.105
and with the helicopter that she was flying,

00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:25.644
you need to use both your hands

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:27.175
and also your legs to steer,

00:12:27.175 --> 00:12:28.644
and her helicopter gets hit,

00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:29.906
and she's trying to steer the chopper,

00:12:29.906 --> 00:12:31.823
but the chopper's not reacting

00:12:31.823 --> 00:12:33.504
to her instructions and to her commands.

00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:36.015
She's trying to land the chopper safely,

00:12:36.015 --> 00:12:37.656
but the chopper doesn't land safely,

00:12:37.656 --> 00:12:38.768
and the reason it's not landing safely

00:12:38.768 --> 00:12:41.441
is because it's not responding to the
commands that her legs are giving

00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:46.289
because her legs were blown off.

00:12:46.289 --> 00:12:49.194
She barely survives.

00:12:49.194 --> 00:12:53.100
Medics come and they save her life,

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.561
but then as she's doing her
recuperation back at home,

00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:59.871
she realizes that, "My job's still not done."

00:12:59.871 --> 00:13:01.355
And now she uses her voice

00:13:01.355 --> 00:13:03.547
as a Congresswoman from Illinois

00:13:03.547 --> 00:13:06.505
to fight and advocate for a collection of issues

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:10.370
to include veterans issues.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.096
We signed up because

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:17.566
we love this country we represent.

00:13:17.566 --> 00:13:19.910
We signed up because

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.468
we believe in the idea and we believe in the people

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.256
to our left and to our right.

00:13:25.256 --> 00:13:27.168
And the only thing we then ask is that

00:13:27.168 --> 00:13:29.430
"thank you for your service"

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.554
needs to be more than just a quote break,

00:13:32.554 --> 00:13:35.180
that "thank you for your service" means

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.406
honestly digging in

00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:40.356
to the people who have stepped up

00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:44.199
simply because they were asked to,

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:46.228
and what that means for us not just now,

00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:49.720
not just during combat operations,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.069
but long after the last vehicle has left

00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:57.943
and after the last shot has been taken.

00:13:57.943 --> 00:14:00.773
These are the people who I served with,

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:04.477
and these are the people who I honor.

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:06.648
So thank you for your service.

00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:10.500
(Applause)
