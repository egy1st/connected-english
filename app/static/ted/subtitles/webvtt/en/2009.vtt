00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:03.211
As a little girl, I always imagined

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.546
I would one day run away.

00:00:05.546 --> 00:00:07.010
From the age of six on,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.462
I kept a packed bag with some clothes

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:10.988
and cans of food tucked away

00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:12.982
in the back of a closet.

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:15.604
There was a deep restlessness in me,

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:18.150
a primal fear that I would fall prey

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.925
to a life of routine and boredom.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.534
And so, many of my early memories involved

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:27.100
intricate daydreams where
I would walk across borders,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.468
forage for berries,

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:30.532
and meet all kinds of strange people

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:33.576
living unconventional lives on the road.

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:36.160
Years have passed, but many of the adventures

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.927
I fantasized about as a child --

00:00:38.927 --> 00:00:40.524
traveling and weaving my way

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:42.524
between worlds other than my own â€”

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.124
have become realities through my work

00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:46.685
as a documentary photographer.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:49.820
But no other experience has felt as true

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.740
to my childhood dreams

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.458
as living amongst and documenting the lives

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:59.150
of fellow wanderers across the United States.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.910
This is the nomadic dream,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.820
a different kind of American dream

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.464
lived by young hobos, travelers,

00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:09.848
hitchhikers, vagrants and tramps.

00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:11.197
In most of our minds,

00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:14.288
the vagabond is a creature from the past.

00:01:14.288 --> 00:01:16.591
The word "hobo" conjures up an old

00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:18.028
black and white image

00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:20.534
of a weathered old man covered in coal,

00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:22.935
legs dangling out of a boxcar,

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:25.047
but these photographs are in color,

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:26.830
and they portray a community

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.552
swirling across the country,

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:31.377
fiercely alive and creatively free,

00:01:31.377 --> 00:01:33.876
seeing sides of America that no one else

00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:36.066
gets to see.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.756
Like their predecessors, today's nomads

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:41.423
travel the steel and asphalt arteries

00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:43.112
of the United States.

00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:46.300
By day, they hop freight trains,
stick out their thumbs,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.154
and ride the highways with anyone

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:51.170
from truckers to soccer moms.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.496
By night, they sleep beneath the stars,

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:56.178
huddled together with their packs of dogs,

00:01:56.178 --> 00:01:59.886
cats and pet rats between their bodies.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.514
Some travelers take to the road by choice,

00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:05.100
renouncing materialism, traditional jobs

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.034
and university degrees in exchange 
for a glimmer of adventure.

00:02:09.034 --> 00:02:12.284
Others come from the underbelly of society,

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:15.324
never given a chance to mobilize upwards:

00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:18.700
foster care dropouts, teenage runaways escaping

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.844
abuse and unforgiving homes.

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:24.754
Where others see stories of privation

00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:26.834
and economic failure,

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:28.694
travelers view their own existence

00:02:28.694 --> 00:02:32.267
through the prism of liberation and freedom.

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:34.482
They'd rather live off of the excess

00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:37.432
of what they view as a wasteful consumer society

00:02:37.432 --> 00:02:40.233
than slave away at an unrealistic chance

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:42.912
at the traditional American dream.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.001
They take advantage of the fact

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.549
that in the United States,

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.370
up to 40 percent of all food ends up in the garbage

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.003
by scavenging for perfectly good produce

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:55.677
in dumpsters and trash cans.

00:02:55.677 --> 00:02:58.046
They sacrifice material comforts in exchange

00:02:58.046 --> 00:03:00.769
for the space and the time to explore

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.491
a creative interior,

00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:07.373
to dream, to read, to work on music, art and writing.

00:03:07.373 --> 00:03:09.881
But there are many aspects to this life

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:12.244
that are far from idyllic.

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:14.367
No one loses their inner demons

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:16.076
by taking to the road.

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:19.238
Addiction is real, the elements are real,

00:03:19.238 --> 00:03:21.450
freight trains maim and kill,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.110
and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.000
to the exhaustive list of laws

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.106
that criminalize homeless existence.

00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:31.936
Who here knows that in many cities

00:03:31.936 --> 00:03:34.586
across the United States it is now illegal

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:36.619
to sit on the sidewalk,

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:40.006
to wrap oneself in a blanket,

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:42.741
to sleep in your own car,

00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:46.100
to offer food to a stranger?

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.872
I know about these laws because I've watched

00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:49.664
as friends and other travelers

00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:52.334
were hauled off to jail or received citations

00:03:52.334 --> 00:03:55.922
for committing these so-called crimes.

00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:58.083
Many of you might be wondering why anyone

00:03:58.083 --> 00:03:59.794
would choose a life like this,

00:03:59.794 --> 00:04:02.160
under the thumb of discriminatory laws,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.478
eating out of trash cans,

00:04:03.478 --> 00:04:05.267
sleeping under bridges,

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:08.518
picking up seasonal jobs here and there.

00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:11.032
The answer to such a question is as varied

00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:13.568
as the people that take to the road,

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:16.950
but travelers often respond with a single word:

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.281
freedom.

00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:22.794
Until we live in a society where every human

00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:24.863
is assured dignity in their labor

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.738
so that they can work to live well,

00:04:26.738 --> 00:04:28.845
not only work to survive,

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:30.762
there will always be an element of those

00:04:30.762 --> 00:04:33.894
who seek the open road as a means of escape,

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:38.952
of liberation and, of course, of rebellion.

00:04:38.952 --> 00:04:40.968
Thank you.

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:43.237
(Applause)
