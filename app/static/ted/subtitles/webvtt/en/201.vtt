00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I thought, "I will talk about death."

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Seemed to be the passion today.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Actually, it's not about death.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's what I want to talk about.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that appeared soon after he died, saying,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
his journey through cancer.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
through letters and a notebook.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and gentle suggestions for improvement,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Handwriting is a disappearing art.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm all for email and thinking while typing,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but why give up old habits for new?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There are times when I want to trade all those years

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and trade all those years for one hug.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But too late.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and the paper that touched his hand is in mine,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and I feel connected to him.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So maybe we all need to leave our children

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
with a value legacy, and not a financial one.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
A value for things with a personal touch --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
an autographed book, a soul-searching letter.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
where our children may go to penmanship classes.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So what do I plan to leave for my son?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I collect autographed books, and those of you authors

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
in the audience know I hound you for them --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and CDs too, Tracy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I plan to publish my own notebook.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I have no idea how I'm going to do it,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
into a book, and leave that published book for my son.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
at my father's cremation.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I took it out for the first time to come here.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
boundless energy confined in the bottle,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
forcing me to deal with reality,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
forcing me to deal with being grown up.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and suffocated by these raging emotional waters,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
just as you taught me.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to live again and to love again."

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Thank you.
