00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.385
So I was born and raised

00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:41.272
in the shadow of a shipyard

00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:45.288
in a little town on the northeast coast of England.

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:47.306
Some of my earliest memories

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:49.284
are of giant ships

00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:52.014
blocking the end of my street,

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:55.059
as well as the sun, for a lot of the year.

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:57.016
Every morning as a child,

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.121
I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.219
to work in the shipyard.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.951
I'd watch those same men

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.651
walking back home every night.

00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:08.543
It has to be said, the shipyard was not

00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:12.319
the most pleasant place to live next door to,

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.419
or indeed work in.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.895
The shipyard was noisy, dangerous,

00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:19.911
highly toxic,

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:23.407
with an appalling health and safety record.

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:26.575
Despite that, the men and women

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:28.225
who worked on those ships

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:31.117
were extraordinarily proud of the work they did,

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:33.117
and justifiably so.

00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:34.651
Some of the largest vessels

00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:36.579
ever constructed on planet Earth

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.379
were built right at the end of my street.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.440
My grandfather had been a shipwright,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.777
and as a child,

00:02:44.777 --> 00:02:46.649
as there were few other jobs in the town,

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.213
I would wonder with some anxiety

00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:52.371
whether that would be my destiny too.

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.443
I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be.

00:02:55.443 --> 00:02:57.087
I had other dreams,

00:02:57.087 --> 00:02:59.589
not necessarily practical ones,

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.575
but at the age of eight,

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.367
I was bequeathed a guitar.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:05.783
It was a battered old thing

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:09.391
with five rusty strings, and was out of tune,

00:03:09.391 --> 00:03:11.839
but quickly I learned to play it

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:17.037
and realized that I'd found a friend for life,

00:03:17.037 --> 00:03:19.703
an accomplice, a co-conspirator

00:03:19.703 --> 00:03:23.587
in my plan to escape from this surreal

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:26.275
industrial landscape.

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:28.357
Well, they say if you dream something hard enough,

00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:30.097
it will come to pass.

00:03:30.097 --> 00:03:32.133
Either that, or I was extremely lucky,

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:34.247
but this was my dream.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.929
I dreamt I would leave this town,

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:37.481
and just like those ships,

00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.669
once they were launched, I'd never come back.

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.265
I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs,

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.643
that I would sing those songs

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:48.561
to vast numbers of people all over the world,

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:52.710
that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.915
that I'd become famous,

00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:57.607
that I'd marry a beautiful woman,

00:03:57.607 --> 00:04:00.247
have children, raise a family,

00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:02.231
buy a big house in the country,

00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:04.951
keep dogs, grow wine,

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:06.961
have rooms full of Grammy Awards,

00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:10.257
platinum discs, and what have you.

00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:14.871
So far, so good, right? (Laughter)

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:19.061
And then one day, the songs stopped coming,

00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:21.978
and while you've suffered from periods

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:24.990
of writer's block before, albeit briefly,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.927
this is something chronic.

00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:29.061
Day after day, you face a blank page,

00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.697
and nothing's coming.

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:32.969
And those days turned to
weeks, and weeks to months,

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.562
and pretty soon those months

00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:35.793
have turned into years

00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:40.612
with very little to show for your efforts. No songs.

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:43.123
So you start asking yourself questions.

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:45.296
What have I done to offend the gods

00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:48.863
that they would abandon me so?

00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:51.599
Is the gift of songwriting taken away

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.856
as easily as it seems to have been bestowed?

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:56.889
Or perhaps there's a more --

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.989
a deeper psychological reason.

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:02.004
It was always a Faustian pact anyway.

00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:04.231
You're rewarded for revealing

00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:06.243
your innermost thoughts,

00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:08.070
your private emotions on the page

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.820
for the entertainment of others,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.141
for the analysis, the scrutiny of others,

00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:17.190
and perhaps you've given enough

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.183
of your privacy away.

00:05:19.183 --> 00:05:23.433
And yet, if you look at your work,

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:25.704
could it be argued that your best work

00:05:25.704 --> 00:05:27.092
wasn't about you at all,

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:29.893
it was about somebody else?

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:31.980
Did your best work occur

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.125
when you sidestepped your own ego

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:36.625
and you stopped telling your story,

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:38.447
but told someone else's story,

00:05:38.447 --> 00:05:41.023
someone perhaps without a voice,

00:05:41.023 --> 00:05:43.551
where empathetically, you stood in his shoes

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:47.100
for a while or saw the world through his eyes?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.077
Well they say, write what you know.

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:52.800
If you can't write about yourself anymore,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.413
then who do you write about?

00:05:55.413 --> 00:05:58.262
So it's ironic that the landscape

00:05:58.262 --> 00:06:00.627
I'd worked so hard to escape from,

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.917
and the community that I'd more or less abandoned

00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:05.086
and exiled myself from

00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:07.087
should be the very landscape,

00:06:07.087 --> 00:06:10.167
the very community I would have to return to

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:13.447
to find my missing muse.

00:06:13.447 --> 00:06:15.591
And as soon as I did that,

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.950
as soon as I decided to honor the community

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.336
I came from and tell their story,

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:24.770
that the songs started to come thick and fast.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.603
I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting,

00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:36.525
a torrent of ideas, of characters, of voices,

00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:39.847
of verses, couplets, entire songs

00:06:39.847 --> 00:06:42.359
almost formed whole,

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:44.019
materialized in front of me

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:45.943
as if they'd been bottled up inside me

00:06:45.943 --> 00:06:47.917
for many, many years.

00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:50.412
One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:52.341
of people I'd known,

00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.643
and they become characters

00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:55.980
in a kind of three-dimensional drama,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.340
where they explain who they are, what they do,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.399
their hopes and their fears for the future.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:04.709
This is Jackie White.

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:08.553
He's the foreman of the shipyard.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.209
My name is Jackie White,

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:11.981
and I'm foreman of the yard,

00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:14.579
and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:16.499
I'm as hard as iron plate,

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:18.519
woe betide you if you're late

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:21.513
when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide.

00:07:21.513 --> 00:07:23.449
Now you can die and hope for heaven,

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:25.611
but you need to work your shift,

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.211
and I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt,

00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:30.385
for if St. Peter at his gate

00:07:30.385 --> 00:07:32.200
were to ask you why you're late,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.370
why, you tell him that you had to get a ship built.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.969
We build battleships and cruisers

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:38.765
for Her Majesty the Queen,

00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:42.378
supertankers for Onassis,
and all the classes in between,

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.677
We built the greatest ship in tonnage

00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:48.253

00:08:15.425 --> 00:08:18.787
So having decided to write about other people

00:08:18.787 --> 00:08:21.712
instead of myself,

00:08:21.712 --> 00:08:23.639
a further irony is that sometimes you reveal

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.109
more about yourself than you'd ever intended.

00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:27.825
This song is called "Dead Man's Boots,"

00:08:27.825 --> 00:08:28.989
which is an expression

00:08:28.989 --> 00:08:31.771
which describes how difficult it is to get a job;

00:08:31.771 --> 00:08:34.070
in other words, you'd only get a job in the shipyard

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.193
if somebody else died.

00:08:36.193 --> 00:08:38.807
Or perhaps your father could finagle you

00:08:38.807 --> 00:08:42.199
an apprenticeship at the age of 15.

00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:44.681
But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued

00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:46.544
as controlling,

00:08:46.544 --> 00:08:49.636
and conversely, the scope of his son's ambition

00:08:49.636 --> 00:08:53.624
can seem like some pie-in-the-sky fantasy.

Thank you.

00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:07.238
So whenever they'd launch a big ship,

00:12:07.238 --> 00:12:09.980
they would invite some dignitary up from London

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.358
on the train to make a speech,

00:12:11.358 --> 00:12:14.063
break a bottle of champagne over the bows,

00:12:14.063 --> 00:12:15.722
launch it down the slipway

00:12:15.722 --> 00:12:17.845
into the river and out to sea.

00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:20.282
Occasionally on a really important ship,

00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:22.462
they'd get a member of the royal family to come,

00:12:22.462 --> 00:12:25.581
Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Anne or somebody.

00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:28.493
And you have to remember, it wasn't that long ago

00:12:28.493 --> 00:12:30.618
that the royal family in England

00:12:30.618 --> 00:12:34.801
were considered to have magical healing powers.

00:12:34.801 --> 00:12:36.617
Sick children were held up in crowds

00:12:36.617 --> 00:12:38.862
to try and touch the cloak

00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:40.306
of the king or the queen to cure them

00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:43.081
of some terrible disease.

00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:47.040
It wasn't like that in my day,
but we still got very excited.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.008
So it's a launch day, it's a Saturday,

00:12:49.008 --> 00:12:51.295
and my mother has dressed
me up in my Sunday best.

00:12:51.295 --> 00:12:53.970
I'm not very happy with her.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.544
All the kids are out in the street,

00:12:55.544 --> 00:12:58.316
and we have little Union Jacks to wave,

00:12:58.316 --> 00:13:00.372
and at the top of the hill,

00:13:00.372 --> 00:13:03.090
there's a motorcycle cortege appears.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.557
In the middle of the motorcycles,

00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:07.252
there's a big, black Rolls-Royce.

00:13:07.252 --> 00:13:09.847
Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother.

00:13:09.847 --> 00:13:11.912
This is a big deal.

00:13:11.912 --> 00:13:13.924
So the procession is moving

00:13:13.924 --> 00:13:15.954
at a stately pace down my street,

00:13:15.954 --> 00:13:18.244
and as it approaches my house,

00:13:18.244 --> 00:13:20.785
I start to wave my flag vigorously,

00:13:20.785 --> 00:13:22.512
and there is the Queen Mother.

00:13:22.512 --> 00:13:26.220
I see her, and she seems to see me.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.970
She acknowledges me. She waves, and she smiles.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.533
And I wave my flag even more vigorously.

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:32.944
We're having a moment,

00:13:32.944 --> 00:13:34.658
me and the Queen Mother.

00:13:34.658 --> 00:13:36.502
She's acknowledged me.

00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:39.541
And then she's gone.

00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:43.664
Well, I wasn't cured of anything.

00:13:43.664 --> 00:13:45.268
It was the opposite, actually.

00:13:45.268 --> 00:13:48.592
I was infected.

00:13:48.592 --> 00:13:51.199
I was infected with an idea.

00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:53.916
I don't belong in this street.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:56.544
I don't want to live in that house.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:59.619
I don't want to end up in that shipyard.

00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:03.026
I want to be in that car. (Laughter)

00:14:03.026 --> 00:14:04.990
I want a bigger life.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.534
I want a life beyond this town.

00:14:07.534 --> 00:14:11.518
I want a life that's out of the ordinary.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.832
It's my right.

00:14:12.832 --> 00:14:15.694
It's my right as much as hers.

00:14:15.694 --> 00:14:20.293
And so here I am at TED,

00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:22.828
I suppose to tell that story,

00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:27.402
and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious

00:14:27.402 --> 00:14:31.692
that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link

00:14:31.692 --> 00:14:34.922
between storytelling and community,

00:14:34.922 --> 00:14:37.118
between community and art,

00:14:37.118 --> 00:14:40.132
between community and science and technology,

00:14:40.132 --> 00:14:42.898
between community and economics.

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:46.286
It's my belief that

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:48.335
abstract economic theory

00:14:48.335 --> 00:14:51.109
that denies the needs of community

00:14:51.109 --> 00:14:54.280
or denies the contribution that community makes

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.219
to economy is shortsighted, cruel

00:14:58.219 --> 00:15:00.827
and untenable.

00:15:00.827 --> 00:15:04.583
(Applause)

00:15:04.583 --> 00:15:07.479
The fact is, whether you're a rock star

00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:11.099
or whether you're a welder in a shipyard,

00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:14.359

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:15.911
or the queen of England,

00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:20.047
at the end of the day,

00:15:20.047 --> 00:15:24.087
