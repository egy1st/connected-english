00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.736
People say things about religion all the time.

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:06.710
(Laughter)

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.960
The late, great Christopher Hitchens

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.381
wrote a book called "God Is Not Great"

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.913
whose subtitle was, "Religion Poisons Everything."

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.286
(Laughter)

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:19.380
But last month, in Time magazine,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.393
Rabbi David Wolpe, who I gather
is referred to as America's rabbi,

00:00:23.393 --> 00:00:28.031
said, to balance that against
that negative characterization,

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:30.655
that no important form of social change

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:34.995
can be brought about except through organized religion.

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.973
Now, remarks of this sort on the negative

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:40.010
and the positive side are very old.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.451
I have one in my pocket here

00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:48.366
from the first century BCE by Lucretius,

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.229
the author of "On the Nature of Things," who said,

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.512
"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum" --

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:58.134
I should have been able to learn that by heart â€”

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:00.822
which is, that's how much religion

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:03.332
is able to persuade people to do evil,

00:01:03.332 --> 00:01:05.119
and he was talking about the fact

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.164
of Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter

00:01:08.164 --> 00:01:10.075
Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:13.575
in order to preserve the prospects of his army.

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:16.471
So there have been these long debates

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:18.360
over the centuries, in that case, actually,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.946
we can say over the millennia, about religion.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.799
People have talked about it a lot,

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.597
and they've said good and bad

00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:27.106
and indifferent things about it.

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:28.841
What I want to persuade you of today

00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:30.444
is of a very simple claim,

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:32.681
which is that these debates are

00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:35.174
in a certain sense preposterous,

00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:39.345
because there is no such thing as religion

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:41.080
about which to make these claims.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.468
There isn't a thing called religion,

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:45.519
and so it can't be good or bad.

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:47.680
It can't even be indifferent.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.139
And if you think about claims

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:54.127
about the nonexistence of things,

00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:56.319
one obvious way to try and establish

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.771
the nonexistence of a purported thing

00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:01.229
would be to offer a definition of that thing

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.990
and then to see whether anything satisfied it.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.202
I'm going to start out on that little route

00:02:07.202 --> 00:02:08.411
to begin with.

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.988
So if you look in the dictionaries

00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:12.138
and if you think about it,

00:02:12.138 --> 00:02:14.507
one very natural definition of religion

00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:20.324
is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings.

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:21.830
As I say, this is in many dictionaries,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.581
but you'll also find it actually

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:26.208
in the work of Sir Edward Tylor,

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:28.435
who was the first professor
of anthropology at Oxford,

00:02:28.435 --> 00:02:30.431
one of the first modern anthropologists.

00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:32.665
In his book on primitive culture,

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:35.685
he says the heart of religion
is what he called animism,

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:37.403
that is, the belief in spiritual agency,

00:02:37.403 --> 00:02:39.780
belief in spirits.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.788
The first problem for that definition

00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:44.528
is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called "Tuff."

00:02:44.528 --> 00:02:45.934
There's a guy talking to a rabbi.

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:48.330
The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.760
The guy says, "You're a rabbi,
how can you not believe in God?"

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.151
And the reply is, "It's what's
so great about being Jewish.

00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.114
You don't have to believe in a God per se,

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:58.570
just in being Jewish." (Laughter)

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.598
So if this guy is a rabbi, and a Jewish rabbi,

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.790
and if you have to believe in
God in order to be religious,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.073
then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion

00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:10.265
that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:12.154
without believing in God,

00:03:12.154 --> 00:03:14.504
Judaism isn't a religion.

00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:17.970
That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.231
Here's another argument against this view.

00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:23.403
A friend of mine, an Indian friend of mine,

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.586
went to his grandfather when he was very young,

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:26.721
a child, and said to him,

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:28.840
"I want to talk to you about religion,"

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.085
and his grandfather said, "You're too young.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.616
Come back when you're a teenager."

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:33.459
So he came back when he was a teenager,

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.155
and he said to his grandfather,

00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:36.481
"It may be a bit late now

00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:40.221
because I've discovered that
I don't believe in the gods."

00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:42.248
And his grandfather, who was a wise man, said,

00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:44.432
"Oh, so you belong to the atheist branch

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.618
of the Hindu tradition." (Laughter)

00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:51.320
And finally, there's this guy,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.776
who famously doesn't believe in God.

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:55.594
His name is the Dalai Lama.

00:03:55.594 --> 00:03:58.242
He often jokes that he's one
of the world's leading atheists.

00:03:58.242 --> 00:04:01.186
But it's true, because the Dalai Lama's religion

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:03.966
does not involve belief in God.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:05.579
Now you might think this just shows

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.599
that I've given you the wrong definition

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.718
and that I should come up with some other definition

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:12.416
and test it against these cases

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:14.987
and try and find something that captures

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:17.913
atheistic Judaism, atheistic Hinduism,

00:04:17.913 --> 00:04:21.176
and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity,

00:04:21.176 --> 00:04:22.970
but I actually think that that's a bad idea,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.299
and the reason I think it's a bad idea

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:26.934
is that I don't think that's how

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.565
our concept of religion works.

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:30.165
I think the way our concept of religion works

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:33.203
is that we actually have, we have a list

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:35.129
of paradigm religions

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.368
and their sub-parts, right,

00:04:38.368 --> 00:04:40.922
and if something new comes along

00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:42.428
that purports to be a religion,

00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:44.892
what we ask is, "Well, is it like one of these?"

00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:47.144
Right?

00:04:47.144 --> 00:04:49.719
And I think that's not only
how we think about religion,

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.019
and that's, as it were,

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:52.810
so from our point of view,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.893
anything on that list had better be a religion,

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:56.661
which is why I don't think an account of religion

00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:58.516
that excludes Buddhism and Judaism

00:04:58.516 --> 00:05:01.216
has a chance of being a good starter,

00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:03.920
because they're on our list.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.900
But why do we have such a list?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.730
What's going on? How did it come about

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.917
that we have this list?

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:12.832
I think the answer is a pretty simple one

00:05:12.832 --> 00:05:15.960
and therefore crude and contentious.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.349
I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it,

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.943
but here's my story,

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:21.314
and true or not, it's a story that I think

00:05:21.314 --> 00:05:23.742
gives you a good sense of how

00:05:23.742 --> 00:05:25.431
the list might have come about,

00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:26.740
and therefore helps you to think about

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.184
what use the list might be.

00:05:28.184 --> 00:05:31.472
I think the answer is, European travelers,

00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:33.305
starting roughly about the time of Columbus,

00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:34.930
started going around the world.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.210
They came from a Christian culture,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.020
and when they arrived in a new place,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.905
they noticed that some people
didn't have Christianity,

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:43.950
and so they asked themselves
the following question:

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.140
what have they got instead of Christianity?

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.503
And that list was essentially constructed.

00:05:50.503 --> 00:05:52.779
It consists of the things that other people had

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.370
instead of Christianity.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.738
Now there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way,

00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:01.178
which is that Christianity is extremely,

00:06:01.178 --> 00:06:05.590
even on that list, it's an extremely specific tradition.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.151
It has all kinds of things in it

00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:09.277
that are very, very particular

00:06:09.277 --> 00:06:11.573
that are the results of the specifics

00:06:11.573 --> 00:06:14.260
of Christian history,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.857
and one thing that's at the heart of it,

00:06:15.857 --> 00:06:18.660
one thing that's at the heart of
most understandings of Christianity,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.990
which is the result of the
specific history of Christianity,

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.133
is that it's an extremely creedal religion.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:26.813
It's a religion in which people are really concerned

00:06:26.813 --> 00:06:29.552
about whether you believe the right things.

00:06:29.552 --> 00:06:31.808
The history of Christianity, the
internal history of Christianity,

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.684
is largely the history of people killing each other

00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:35.800
because they believed the wrong thing,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.879
and it's also involved in

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.631
struggles with other religions,

00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:43.230
obviously starting in the Middle Ages,

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.620
a struggle with Islam,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.740
in which, again, it was the infidelity,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.770
the fact that they didn't believe the right things,

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.150
that seemed so offensive to the Christian world.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.788
Now that's a very specific and particular history

00:06:55.788 --> 00:06:58.153
that Christianity has,

00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:01.371
and not everywhere is everything

00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.365
that has ever been put on this sort of list like it.

00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:06.772
Here's another problem, I think.

00:07:06.772 --> 00:07:08.110
A very specific thing happened.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.562
It was actually adverted to earlier,

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.103
but a very specific thing happened

00:07:11.103 --> 00:07:13.292
in the history of the kind of Christianity

00:07:13.292 --> 00:07:14.813
that we see around us

00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:16.997
mostly in the United States today,

00:07:16.997 --> 00:07:20.100
and it happened in the late 19th century,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.509
and that specific thing that happened

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:22.518
in the late 19th century

00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:25.473
was a kind of deal that was cut

00:07:25.473 --> 00:07:27.983
between science,

00:07:27.983 --> 00:07:33.676
this new way of organizing intellectual authority,

00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:34.873
and religion.

00:07:34.873 --> 00:07:36.764
If you think about the 18th century, say,

00:07:36.764 --> 00:07:38.234
if you think about intellectual life

00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:40.590
before the late 19th century,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.760
anything you did, anything you thought about,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.490
whether it was the physical world,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.021
the human world,

00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:50.251
the natural world apart from the human world,

00:07:50.251 --> 00:07:52.218
or morality, anything you did

00:07:52.218 --> 00:07:53.894
would have been framed against the background

00:07:53.894 --> 00:07:56.357
of a set of assumptions that were religious,

00:07:56.357 --> 00:07:57.560
Christian assumptions.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.226
You couldn't give an account

00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:00.822
of the natural world

00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:03.744
that didn't say something about its relationship,

00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:05.552
for example, to the creation story

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.092
in the Abrahamic tradition,

00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:10.296
the creation story in the first book of the Torah.

00:08:10.296 --> 00:08:13.613
So everything was framed in that way.

00:08:13.613 --> 00:08:16.045
But this changes in the late 19th century,

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:18.370
and for the first time, it's possible for people

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.749
to develop serious intellectual careers

00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:22.943
as natural historians like Darwin.

00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:24.928
Darwin worried about the relationship between

00:08:24.928 --> 00:08:27.481
what he said and the truths of religion,

00:08:27.481 --> 00:08:29.406
but he could proceed, he could write books

00:08:29.406 --> 00:08:31.190
about his subject

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.886
without having to say what the relationship was

00:08:33.886 --> 00:08:35.358
to the religious claims,

00:08:35.358 --> 00:08:37.740
and similarly, geologists
increasingly could talk about it.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.542
In the early 19th century, if you were a geologist

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:41.465
and made a claim about the age of the Earth,

00:08:41.465 --> 00:08:43.107
you had to explain whether that was consistent

00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:44.537
or how it was or wasn't consistent

00:08:44.537 --> 00:08:45.909
with the age of the Earth implied

00:08:45.909 --> 00:08:47.462
by the account in Genesis.

00:08:47.462 --> 00:08:48.647
By the end of the 19th century,

00:08:48.647 --> 00:08:50.160
you can just write a geology textbook

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.519
in which you make arguments
about how old the Earth is.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:54.610
So there's a big change, and that division,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.545
that intellectual division of
labor occurs as I say, I think,

00:08:57.545 --> 00:09:00.370
and it sort of solidifies so that by the end

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.528
of the 19th century in Europe,

00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:05.519
there's a real intellectual division of labor,

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.519
and you can do all sorts of serious things,

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:11.421
including, increasingly, even philosophy,

00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:14.279
without being constrained by the thought,

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:16.560
"Well, what I have to say has to be consistent

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.239
with the deep truths that are given to me

00:09:19.239 --> 00:09:21.749
by our religious tradition."

00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:23.913
So imagine someone who's coming out

00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:27.730
of that world, that late-19th-century world,

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.482
coming into the country that I grew up in, Ghana,

00:09:31.482 --> 00:09:33.742
the society that I grew up in, Asante,

00:09:33.742 --> 00:09:35.148
coming into that world

00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:37.164
at the turn of the 20th century

00:09:37.164 --> 00:09:39.187
with this question that made the list:

00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:42.950
what have they got instead of Christianity?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.807
Well, here's one thing he would have noticed,

00:09:45.807 --> 00:09:48.151
and by the way, there was a 
person who actually did this.

00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:49.450
His name was Captain Rattray,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.502
he was sent as the British
government anthropologist,

00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:53.495
and he wrote a book about Asante religion.

00:09:53.495 --> 00:09:56.035
This is a soul disc.

00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:58.308
There are many of them in the British Museum.

00:09:58.308 --> 00:09:59.578
I could give you an interesting, different history

00:09:59.578 --> 00:10:01.743
of how it comes about that many of the things

00:10:01.743 --> 00:10:05.134
from my society ended up in the British Museum,

00:10:05.134 --> 00:10:06.945
but we don't have time for that.

00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:08.437
So this object is a soul disc.

00:10:08.437 --> 00:10:09.575
What is a soul disc?

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:11.404
It was worn around the necks

00:10:11.404 --> 00:10:13.974
of the soul-washers of the Asante king.

00:10:13.974 --> 00:10:17.529
What was their job? To wash the king's soul.

00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:19.434
It would take a long while

00:10:19.434 --> 00:10:21.661
to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing

00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:22.961
that could be washed,

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:25.740
but Rattray knew that this was religion

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.243
because souls were in play.

00:10:29.243 --> 00:10:30.989
And similarly,

00:10:30.989 --> 00:10:33.196
there were many other things, many other practices.

00:10:33.196 --> 00:10:35.559
For example, every time anybody
had a drink, more or less,

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.581
they poured a little bit on the ground

00:10:37.581 --> 00:10:39.310
in what's called the libation,

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.999
and they gave some to the ancestors.

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:43.348
My father did this. Every time
he opened a bottle of whiskey,

00:10:43.348 --> 00:10:44.869
which I'm glad to say was very often,

00:10:44.869 --> 00:10:48.748
he would take the top off and
pour off just a little on the ground,

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.099
and he would talk to,

00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:53.639
he would say to Akroma-Ampim, the founder of our line,

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:55.235
or Yao Antony, my great uncle,

00:10:55.235 --> 00:10:57.130
he would talk to them,

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.353
offer them a little bit of this.

00:10:59.353 --> 00:11:02.238
And finally, there were these
huge public ceremonials.

00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:03.654
This is an early-19th-century drawing

00:11:03.654 --> 00:11:04.927
by another British military officer

00:11:04.927 --> 00:11:06.977
of such a ceremonial,

00:11:06.977 --> 00:11:09.105
where the king was involved,

00:11:09.105 --> 00:11:10.511
and the king's job,

00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:11.700
one of the large parts of his job,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.651
apart from organizing warfare and things like that,

00:11:14.651 --> 00:11:17.997
was to look after the tombs of his ancestors,

00:11:17.997 --> 00:11:19.994
and when a king died,

00:11:19.994 --> 00:11:21.508
the stool that he sat on was blackened

00:11:21.508 --> 00:11:24.392
and put in the royal ancestral temple,

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.521
and every 40 days,

00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:28.376
the King of Asante has to go and do cult

00:11:28.376 --> 00:11:29.738
for his ancestors.

00:11:29.738 --> 00:11:31.240
That's a large part of his job,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.113
and people think that if he doesn't do it,

00:11:33.113 --> 00:11:34.844
things will fall apart.

00:11:34.844 --> 00:11:37.210
So he's a religious figure,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.535
as Rattray would have said,

00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:41.160
as well as a political figure.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.844
So all this would count as religion for Rattray,

00:11:45.844 --> 00:11:47.783
but my point is that when you look

00:11:47.783 --> 00:11:49.165
into the lives of those people,

00:11:49.165 --> 00:11:51.910
you also find that every time they do anything,

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.944
they're conscious of the ancestors.

00:11:53.944 --> 00:11:55.977
Every morning at breakfast,

00:11:55.977 --> 00:11:57.803
you can go outside the front of the house

00:11:57.803 --> 00:12:00.899
and make an offering to the god tree, the nyame dua

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:02.083
outside your house,

00:12:02.083 --> 00:12:03.400
and again, you'll talk to the gods

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.426
and the high gods and the low gods

00:12:04.426 --> 00:12:06.084
and the ancestors and so on.

00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:07.620
This is not a world

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.527
in which the separation between religion and science

00:12:10.527 --> 00:12:12.101
has occurred.

00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:13.644
Religion has not being separated

00:12:13.644 --> 00:12:14.920
from any other areas of life,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.917
and in particular,

00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:18.612
what's crucial to understand about this world

00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:20.150
is that it's a world in which the job

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.288
that science does for us

00:12:21.288 --> 00:12:24.432
is done by what Rattray is going to call religion,

00:12:24.432 --> 00:12:26.372
because if they want an explanation of something,

00:12:26.372 --> 00:12:28.200
if they want to know why the crop just failed,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.486
if they want to know why it's raining

00:12:29.486 --> 00:12:31.904
or not raining, if they need rain,

00:12:31.904 --> 00:12:34.428
if they want to know why

00:12:34.428 --> 00:12:36.287
their grandfather has died,

00:12:36.287 --> 00:12:39.195
they are going to appeal to the very same entities,

00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:40.637
the very same language,

00:12:40.637 --> 00:12:43.253
talk to the very same gods about that.

00:12:43.253 --> 00:12:45.342
This great separation, in other words,

00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:47.273
between religion and science hasn't happened.

00:12:47.273 --> 00:12:51.598
Now, this would be a mere historical curiosity,

00:12:51.598 --> 00:12:55.050
except that in large parts of the world,

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.794
this is still the truth.

00:12:57.794 --> 00:12:59.802
I had the privilege of going to a wedding

00:12:59.802 --> 00:13:01.567
the other day in northern Namibia,

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:04.412
20 miles or so south of the Angolan border

00:13:04.412 --> 00:13:06.145
in a village of 200 people.

00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:07.313
These were modern people.

00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:09.204
We had with us Oona Chaplin,

00:13:09.204 --> 00:13:10.613
who some of you may have heard of,

00:13:10.613 --> 00:13:12.692
and one of the people from
this village came up to her,

00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:15.423
and said, "I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'"

00:13:15.423 --> 00:13:19.251
So these were not people who
were isolated from our world,

00:13:19.251 --> 00:13:20.780
but nevertheless, for them,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.333
the gods and the spirits are still very much there,

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:25.159
and when we were on the bus going back and forth

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:26.821
to the various parts of the [ceremony],

00:13:26.821 --> 00:13:29.398
they prayed not just in a generic way

00:13:29.398 --> 00:13:30.859
but for the safety of the journey,

00:13:30.859 --> 00:13:31.770
and they meant it,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.932
and when they said to me that my mother,

00:13:34.932 --> 00:13:36.623
the bridegroom's [grandmother],

00:13:36.623 --> 00:13:39.185
was with us, they didn't mean it figuratively.

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:41.940
They meant, even though she was a dead person,

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.518
they meant that she was still around.

00:13:44.518 --> 00:13:47.067
So in large parts of the world today,

00:13:47.067 --> 00:13:49.229
that separation between science and religion

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.910
hasn't occurred in large parts of the world today,

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.638
and as I say, these are not --

00:13:54.638 --> 00:13:59.440
This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.147
These are fellow citizens of the world with you,

00:14:02.147 --> 00:14:03.956
but they come from a place in which religion

00:14:03.956 --> 00:14:05.867
is occupying a very different role.

00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:07.993
So what I want you to think about
next time somebody wants

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:10.473
to make some vast generalization about religion

00:14:10.473 --> 00:14:13.214
is that maybe there isn't such a thing

00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:15.845
as a religion, such a thing as religion,

00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:17.501
and that therefore what they say

00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:20.314
cannot possibly be true.

00:14:20.314 --> 00:14:23.526
(Applause)
