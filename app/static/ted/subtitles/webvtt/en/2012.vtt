00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:02.618
At every stage of our lives

00:00:02.618 --> 00:00:06.186
we make decisions that will profoundly influence

00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:08.072
the lives of the people we're going to become,

00:00:08.072 --> 00:00:09.692
and then when we become those people,

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:12.110
we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.624
So young people pay good money

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:17.328
to get tattoos removed that teenagers

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:18.698
paid good money to get.

00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:21.206
Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:23.823
who young adults rushed to marry.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.460
Older adults work hard to lose

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160
what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.276
On and on and on.

00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:33.308
The question is, as a psychologist,
that fascinates me is,

00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:35.060
why do we make decisions

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.756
that our future selves so often regret?

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.608
Now, I think one of the reasons --

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.060
I'll try to convince you today â€”

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.620
is that we have a fundamental misconception

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.452
about the power of time.

00:00:47.452 --> 00:00:49.932
Every one of you knows that the rate of change

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:51.854
slows over the human lifespan,

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:54.712
that your children seem to change by the minute

00:00:54.712 --> 00:00:57.466
but your parents seem to change by the year.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.886
But what is the name of this magical point in life

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:02.922
where change suddenly goes

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:04.704
from a gallop to a crawl?

00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:07.440
Is it teenage years? Is it middle age?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.110
Is it old age? The answer, it turns out,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.640
for most people, is now,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.591
wherever now happens to be.

00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:17.593
What I want to convince you today

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:20.612
is that all of us are walking around with an illusion,

00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:23.830
an illusion that history, our personal history,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.444
has just come to an end,

00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:27.051
that we have just recently become

00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.206
the people that we were always meant to be

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:32.652
and will be for the rest of our lives.

00:01:32.652 --> 00:01:34.756
Let me give you some data to back up that claim.

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:37.910
So here's a study of change in people's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.942
personal values over time.

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:41.141
Here's three values.

00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:42.656
Everybody here holds all of them,

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:44.814
but you probably know that as you grow,

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:48.173
as you age, the balance of these values shifts.

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:50.082
So how does it do so?

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:52.090
Well, we asked thousands of people.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.877
We asked half of them to predict for us

00:01:53.877 --> 00:01:56.887
how much their values would
change in the next 10 years,

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:58.263
and the others to tell us

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:01.513
how much their values had
changed in the last 10 years.

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:04.980
And this enabled us to do a really
interesting kind of analysis,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.191
because it allowed us to compare the predictions

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:09.185
of people, say, 18 years old,

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:11.297
to the reports of people who were 28,

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.917
and to do that kind of analysis
throughout the lifespan.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.248
Here's what we found.

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:16.541
First of all, you are right,

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.389
change does slow down as we age,

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.281
but second, you're wrong,

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.679
because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.542
At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set,

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:32.252
people vastly underestimated how much change

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.171
they would experience over the next 10 years.

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:38.105
We call this the "end of history" illusion.

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:40.488
To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect,

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:41.710
you can connect these two lines,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.474
and what you see here is that 18-year-olds

00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:46.943
anticipate changing only as much

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:49.928
as 50-year-olds actually do.

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:53.482
Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things.

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.300
For example, personality.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.966
Many of you know that psychologists now claim

00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:01.260
that there are five fundamental
dimensions of personality:

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.527
neuroticism, openness to experience,

00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:07.375
agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.622
Again, we asked people how much they expected

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.198
to change over the next 10 years,

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:14.559
and also how much they had
changed over the last 10 years,

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:15.475
and what we found,

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:18.030
well, you're going to get used to
seeing this diagram over and over,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.069
because once again the rate of change

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.679
does slow as we age,

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.567
but at every age, people underestimate

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.900
how much their personalities will change

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.684
in the next decade.

00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:32.005
And it isn't just ephemeral things

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:33.859
like values and personality.

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.874
You can ask people about their likes and dislikes,

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.328
their basic preferences.

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:41.130
For example, name your best friend,

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.546
your favorite kind of vacation,

00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:44.312
what's your favorite hobby,

00:03:44.312 --> 00:03:46.123
what's your favorite kind of music.

00:03:46.123 --> 00:03:47.560
People can name these things.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.920
We ask half of them to tell us,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.313
"Do you think that that will
change over the next 10 years?"

00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:54.467
and half of them to tell us,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:57.158
"Did that change over the last 10 years?"

00:03:57.158 --> 00:03:59.741
And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now,

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.583
and here it is again:

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.663
people predict that the friend they have now

00:04:04.663 --> 00:04:06.211
is the friend they'll have in 10 years,

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.316
the vacation they most enjoy now is the one

00:04:08.316 --> 00:04:09.648
they'll enjoy in 10 years,

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:12.390
and yet, people who are 10 years older all say,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.319
"Eh, you know, that's really changed."

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.475
Does any of this matter?

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:19.635
Is this just a form of mis-prediction
that doesn't have consequences?

00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:22.557
No, it matters quite a bit, and
I'll give you an example of why.

00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:26.022
It bedevils our decision-making in important ways.

00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:27.727
Bring to mind right now for yourself

00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:30.000
your favorite musician today

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.368
and your favorite musician 10 years ago.

00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:34.927
I put mine up on the screen to help you along.

00:04:34.927 --> 00:04:36.530
Now we asked people

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.767
to predict for us, to tell us

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:41.654
how much money they would pay right now

00:04:41.654 --> 00:04:43.990
to see their current favorite musician

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.507
perform in concert 10 years from now,

00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:48.554
and on average, people said they would pay

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.271
129 dollars for that ticket.

00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:54.198
And yet, when we asked them
how much they would pay

00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:56.519
to see the person who was their favorite

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:58.558
10 years ago perform today,

00:04:58.558 --> 00:05:00.400
they say only 80 dollars.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.238
Now, in a perfectly rational world,

00:05:02.238 --> 00:05:04.352
these should be the same number,

00:05:04.352 --> 00:05:06.863
but we overpay for the opportunity

00:05:06.863 --> 00:05:08.966
to indulge our current preferences

00:05:08.966 --> 00:05:12.286
because we overestimate their stability.

00:05:12.286 --> 00:05:14.734
Why does this happen? We're not entirely sure,

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:16.280
but it probably has to do

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.459
with the ease of remembering

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:20.980
versus the difficulty of imagining.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.449
Most of us can remember
who we were 10 years ago,

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.188
but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be,

00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:29.193
and then we mistakenly think
that because it's hard to imagine,

00:05:29.193 --> 00:05:31.267
it's not likely to happen.

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:34.522
Sorry, when people say "I can't imagine that,"

00:05:34.522 --> 00:05:37.470
they're usually talking about
their own lack of imagination,

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.962
and not about the unlikelihood

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:41.952
of the event that they're describing.

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:45.519
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.162
It transforms our preferences.

00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:49.280
It reshapes our values.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.623
It alters our personalities.

00:05:50.623 --> 00:05:53.190
We seem to appreciate this fact,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.751
but only in retrospect.

00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:57.246
Only when we look backwards do we realize

00:05:57.246 --> 00:06:00.518
how much change happens in a decade.

00:06:00.518 --> 00:06:02.197
It's as if, for most of us,

00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:04.366
the present is a magic time.

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:06.383
It's a watershed on the timeline.

00:06:06.383 --> 00:06:08.727
It's the moment at which we finally

00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:11.230
become ourselves.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.923
Human beings are works in progress

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:16.846
that mistakenly think they're finished.

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:18.636
The person you are right now

00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:22.338
is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary

00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:24.997
as all the people you've ever been.

00:06:24.997 --> 00:06:28.545
The one constant in our life is change.

00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:30.641
Thank you.

00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:32.394
(Applause)
