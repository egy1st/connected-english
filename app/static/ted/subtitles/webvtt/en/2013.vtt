00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.462
I read poetry all the time

00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:05.022
and write about it frequently

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:06.630
and take poems apart

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.273
to see how they work

00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:09.980
because I'm a word person.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.757
I understand the world best, most fully,

00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:15.650
in words rather than, say, pictures or numbers,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.218
and when I have a new experience or a new feeling,

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.368
I'm a little frustrated

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:22.563
until I can try to put it into words.

00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:24.874
I think I've always been that way.

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:27.720
I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.000
And I found poems by Andrew Marvell

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.718
and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson

00:00:31.718 --> 00:00:33.122
and William Butler Yeats

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:35.402
because they were quoted in science fiction,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.563
and I loved their sounds

00:00:36.563 --> 00:00:39.970
and I went on to read about ottava rima

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.979
and medial caesuras and enjambment

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.810
and all that other technical stuff

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.930
that you care about if you already care about poems,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.176
because poems already made me happier

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:54.259
and sadder and more alive.

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:56.088
And I became a poetry critic

00:00:56.088 --> 00:01:00.828
because I wanted to know how and why.

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:05.620
Now, poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.724
any more than music or computer programming

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:10.586
serve one purpose.

00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:14.554
The greek word poem, it just means "a made thing,"

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:16.567
and poetry is a set of techniques,

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.518
ways of making patterns

00:01:18.518 --> 00:01:20.607
that put emotions into words.

00:01:20.607 --> 00:01:22.617
The more techniques you know,

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:25.069
the more things you can make,

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.289
and the more patterns you can recognize

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.454
in things you might already like or love.

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:35.491
That said, poetry does seem to be

00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:38.425
especially good at certain things.

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:44.930
For example, we are all going to die.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.653
Poetry can help us live with that.

00:01:47.653 --> 00:01:50.226
Poems are made of words, nothing but words.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.618
The particulars in poems are like

00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:54.114
the particularities, the personalities,

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:57.391
that distinguish people from one another.

00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.162
Poems are easy to share, easy to pass on,

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.982
and when you read a poem, you can imagine

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:05.990
someone's speaking to you or for you,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.905
maybe even someone far away

00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:12.337
or someone made up or someone deceased.

00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:16.782
That's why we can go to poems when we want to

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:19.220
remember something or someone,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.332
to celebrate or to look beyond death

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:24.192
or to say goodbye,

00:02:24.192 --> 00:02:28.012
and that's one reason poems can seem important,

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:30.035
even to people who aren't me,

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:34.740
who don't so much live in a world of words.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.836
The poet Frank O'Hara said,

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:40.090
"If you don't need poetry, bully for you,"

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.722
but he also said when he didn't
want to be alive anymore,

00:02:43.722 --> 00:02:46.232
the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.100
had stopped him.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.137
Poetry helps me want to be alive,

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:53.256
and I want to show you why by showing you how,

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.334
how a couple of poems react to the fact that

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:59.270
we're alive in one place at one time in one culture,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.646
and in another we won't be alive at all.

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:08.710
So here's one of the first poems I memorized.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.200
It could address a child or an adult.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.551
"From far, from eve and morning

00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:19.377
From yon twelve-winded sky,

00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:21.477
The stuff of life to knit me

00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:23.647
Blew hither; here am I.

00:03:23.647 --> 00:03:25.913
Now — for a breath I tarry

00:03:25.913 --> 00:03:28.033
Nor yet disperse apart —

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.109
Take my hand quick and tell me,

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.212
What have you in your heart.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.669
Speak now, and I will answer;

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.249
How shall I help you, say;

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.413
Ere to the wind's twelve quarters

00:03:39.413 --> 00:03:42.508
I take my endless way."

00:03:42.508 --> 00:03:44.677
[A. E. Housman]

00:03:44.677 --> 00:03:46.121
Now, this poem has appealed

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:47.524
to science fiction writers.

00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:50.693
It's furnished at least three science fiction titles,

00:03:50.693 --> 00:03:53.421
I think because it says poems can brings us news

00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:55.414
from the future or the past

00:03:55.414 --> 00:03:58.221
or across the world,

00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:00.926
because their patterns can seem to tell you

00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:02.677
what's in somebody's heart.

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:05.549
It says poems can bring people together temporarily,

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.629
which I think is true,

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.166
and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:12.604
but for how it rhymes,

00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:14.991
cleanly and simply on the two and four,

00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:16.228
"say" and "way,"

00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:19.035
with anticipatory hints on the one and three,

00:04:19.035 --> 00:04:20.660
"answer" and "quarters,"

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.535
as if the poem itself were coming together.

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.547
It plays up the fact that we die

00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:28.850
by exaggerating the speed of our lives.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.128
A few years on Earth become

00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:33.367
one speech, one breath.

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:35.526
It's a poem about loneliness --

00:04:35.526 --> 00:04:38.629
the "I" in the poem feels no connection will last —

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.541
and it might look like a plea for help

00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:43.051
'til you get to the word "help,"

00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:45.593
where this "I" facing you, taking your hand,

00:04:45.593 --> 00:04:47.574
is more like a teacher or a genie,

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:50.298
or at least that's what he wants to believe.

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:53.413
It would not be the first time a poet had

00:04:53.413 --> 00:04:58.275
written the poem that he wanted to hear.

00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:01.018
Now, this next poem really changed

00:05:01.018 --> 00:05:03.014
what I liked and what I read

00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:05.373
and what I felt I could read as an adult.

00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:07.012
It might not make any sense to you

00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:10.942
if you haven't seen it before.

00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:13.150
"The Garden"

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.541
"Oleander: coral

00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:18.101
from lipstick ads in the 50's.

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:21.069
Fruit of the tree of such knowledge

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.013
To smack
(thin air)

00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:25.111
meaning kiss or hit.

00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:26.230
It appears

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.249
in the guise of outworn usages

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:31.120
because we are bad?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.957
Big masculine threat,

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.507
insinuating and slangy."

00:05:35.507 --> 00:05:37.705
[Rae Armantrout]

00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:40.453
Now, I found this poem in an anthology

00:05:40.453 --> 00:05:43.275
of almost equally confusing poems in 1989.

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:45.293
I just heard that there were these scandalous writers

00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:47.920
called Language poets who didn't make any sense,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.188
and I wanted to go and see
for myself what they were like,

00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:51.878
and some of them didn't do much for me,

00:05:51.878 --> 00:05:53.430
but this writer, Rae Armantrout,

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.037
did an awful lot, and I kept reading her

00:05:56.037 --> 00:05:59.228
until I felt I knew what was going on,

00:05:59.228 --> 00:06:00.493
as I do with this poem.

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:03.614
It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall

00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:07.170
and the Biblical story of the Fall,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.322
in which sex as we know it

00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:10.600
and death and guilt

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.609
come into the world at the same time.

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:14.818
It's also about how appearances deceive,

00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:17.242
how our culture can sweep us along

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:19.610
into doing and saying things we didn't intend

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.080
or don't like, and Armantrout's style

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.518
is trying to help us stop or slow down.

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:29.952
"Smack" can mean "kiss" as in air kisses,

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:30.917
as in lip-smacking,

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:33.279
but that can lead to "smack" as in "hit"

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.394
as in domestic abuse,

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:39.202
because sexual attraction can seem threatening.

00:06:39.202 --> 00:06:41.468
The red that means fertility

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:43.170
can also mean poison.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.263
Oleander is poisonous.

00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:47.950
And outworn usages like "smack" for "kiss"

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.607
or "hit" can help us see

00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:52.925
how our unacknowledged assumptions

00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:54.920
can make us believe we are bad,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.962
either because sex is sinful

00:06:56.962 --> 00:06:59.802
or because we tolerate so much sexism.

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:02.898
We let guys tell women what to do.

00:07:02.898 --> 00:07:05.511
The poem reacts to old lipstick ads,

00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:07.572
and its edginess about statement,

00:07:07.572 --> 00:07:09.894
its reversals and halts, have everything to do

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:12.115
with resisting the language of ads

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:15.323
that want to tell us so easily what to want,

00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:16.723
what to do, what to think.

00:07:16.723 --> 00:07:19.267
That resistance is a lot of the point of the poem,

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:21.435
which shows me, Armantrout shows me

00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:23.401
what it's like to hear grave threats

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.949
and mortal dishonesty in the language

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.516
of everyday life, and once she's done that,

00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:32.976
I think she can show other people, women and men,

00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:34.451
what it's like to feel that way

00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:37.157
and say to other people, women and men

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:40.070
who feel so alienated or so threatened

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.011
that they're not alone.

00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:45.479
Now, how do I know that I'm right

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:47.457
about this somewhat confusing poem?

00:07:47.457 --> 00:07:50.198
Well in this case, I emailed
the poet a draft of my talk

00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:53.034
and she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it."

00:07:53.034 --> 00:07:56.949
Yeah. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:59.875
But usually, you can't know. You never know.

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:02.429
You can't be sure, and that's okay.

00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:04.030
All we can do we is listen to poems

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.689
and look at poems and guess

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:08.171
and see if they can bring us what we need,

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:11.140
and if you're wrong about some part of a poem,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.071
nothing bad will happen.

00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:17.854
Now, this next poem is older than Armantrout's,

00:08:17.854 --> 00:08:21.618
but a little younger than A. E. Housman's.

00:08:21.618 --> 00:08:23.486
"The Brave Man"

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:26.170
"The sun, that brave man,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.890
Comes through boughs that lie in wait,

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.315
That brave man.

00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:32.900
Green and gloomy eyes

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.728
In dark forms of the grass

00:08:34.728 --> 00:08:36.245
Run away.

00:08:36.245 --> 00:08:37.970
The good stars,

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.657
Pale helms and spiky spurs,

00:08:40.657 --> 00:08:42.047
Run away.

00:08:42.047 --> 00:08:43.402
Fears of my bed,

00:08:43.402 --> 00:08:45.880
Fears of life and fears of death,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.360
Run away.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.656
That brave man comes up

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:52.576
From below and walks without meditation,

00:08:52.576 --> 00:08:54.353
That brave man."

00:08:54.353 --> 00:08:57.343
[Wallace Stevens]

00:08:57.343 --> 00:08:59.696
Now, the sun in this poem,

00:08:59.696 --> 00:09:02.185
in Wallace Stevens' poem, seems so grave

00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:05.656
because the person in the poem is so afraid.

00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:08.143
The sun comes up in the morning through branches,

00:09:08.143 --> 00:09:11.082
dispels the dew, the eyes, on the grass,

00:09:11.082 --> 00:09:14.487
and defeats stars envisioned as armies.

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:16.456
"Brave" has its old sense of showy

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:18.700
as well as its modern sense, courage.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.040
This sun is not afraid to show his face.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.392
But the person in the poem is afraid.

00:09:25.392 --> 00:09:26.931
He might have been up all night.

00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:30.913
That is the reveal Stevens
saves for that fourth stanza,

00:09:30.913 --> 00:09:33.691
where run away has become a refrain.

00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:35.883
This person might want to run away too,

00:09:35.883 --> 00:09:38.173
but fortified by the sun's example,

00:09:38.173 --> 00:09:40.898
he might just rise.

00:09:40.898 --> 00:09:45.176
Stevens saves that sonically odd word "meditation"

00:09:45.176 --> 00:09:46.850
for the end.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.751
Unlike the sun, human beings think.

00:09:49.751 --> 00:09:53.848
We meditate on past and future, life and death,

00:09:53.848 --> 00:09:56.394
above and below.

00:09:56.394 --> 00:10:00.178
And it can make us afraid.

00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:02.248
Poems, the patterns in poems,

00:10:02.248 --> 00:10:04.190
show us not just what somebody thought

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.862
or what someone did or what happened

00:10:05.862 --> 00:10:10.658
but what it was like to be a person like that,

00:10:10.658 --> 00:10:14.348
to be so anxious, so lonely, so inquisitive,

00:10:14.348 --> 00:10:20.234
so goofy, so preposterous, so brave.

00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:23.880
That's why poems can seem at once so durable,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.921
so personal, and so ephemeral,

00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:29.048
like something inside and outside you at once.

00:10:29.048 --> 00:10:32.383
The Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry

00:10:32.383 --> 00:10:36.501
to a needle, a sliver of outside I cradle inside,

00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:38.909
and the American poet Terrance Hayes

00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:41.992
wrote six poems called "Wind in a Box."

00:10:41.992 --> 00:10:43.428
One of them asks, "Tell me,

00:10:43.428 --> 00:10:46.062
what am I going to do when I'm dead?"

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.792
And the answer is that he'll stay with us

00:10:48.792 --> 00:10:51.668
or won't stay with us inside us as wind,

00:10:51.668 --> 00:10:54.890
as air, as words.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.548
It is easier than ever to find poems

00:10:57.548 --> 00:11:01.140
that might stay inside you, that might stay with you,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.598
from long, long ago, or from right this minute,

00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:06.172
from far away or from right close to where you live,

00:11:06.172 --> 00:11:09.498
almost no matter where you live.

00:11:09.498 --> 00:11:12.967
Poems can help you say, help
you show how you're feeling,

00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:15.407
but they can also introduce you

00:11:15.407 --> 00:11:17.690
to feelings, ways of being in the world,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.067
people, very much unlike you,

00:11:20.067 --> 00:11:24.648
maybe even people from long, long ago.

00:11:24.648 --> 00:11:26.735
Some poems even tell you

00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:31.286
that that is what they can do.

00:11:31.286 --> 00:11:33.956
That's what John Keats is doing

00:11:33.956 --> 00:11:38.324
in his most mysterious, perhaps, poem.

00:11:38.324 --> 00:11:42.236
It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished,

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:44.565
he probably left it unfinished,

00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:46.162
and because it might be meant

00:11:46.162 --> 00:11:48.788
for a character in a play,

00:11:48.788 --> 00:11:50.465
but it might just be Keats' thinking

00:11:50.465 --> 00:11:52.100
about what his own writing,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.300
his handwriting, could do,

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.190
and in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality,

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.719
and I hear the power of older poetic techniques,

00:12:01.719 --> 00:12:04.250
and I have the feeling, you might have the feeling,

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.236
of meeting even for an instant, almost becoming,

00:12:07.236 --> 00:12:08.758
someone else from long ago,

00:12:08.758 --> 00:12:11.473
someone quite memorable.

00:12:11.473 --> 00:12:14.649
"This living hand, now warm and capable

00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:18.359
Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold

00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:20.750
And in the icy silence of the tomb,

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.326
So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:28.260
That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood


00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.911
So in my veins red life might stream again,

00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:36.810
And thou be conscience-calm’d -- see here it is --

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.798
I hold it towards you."

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.417
Thanks.

00:12:43.417 --> 00:12:50.206
(Applause)
