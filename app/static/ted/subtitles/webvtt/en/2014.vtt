00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.834
Even nature's most disgusting creatures

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.401
have important secrets,

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:07.890
but who would want a swarm of cockroaches

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.484
coming towards them?

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:12.496
Yet one of the greatest differences
between natural and human technologies

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.711
relates to robustness.

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:17.284
Robust systems are stable in complex

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.005
and new environments.

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.800
Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.479
running over rough terrain.

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:23.741
When we put a jet pack on them,

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:25.752
or give them a perturbation like an earthquake,

00:00:25.752 --> 00:00:28.643
we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:30.268
allow them to self-stabilize

00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:33.930
without using any of their brainpower.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.060
They can go over complex terrain like grass,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.012
no problem, and not get destabilized.

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:40.526
We discovered a new behavior where,

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:41.690
because of their shape,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.768
they actually roll automatically to their side

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:47.720
to go through this artificial test bit of grass.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.157
Robust systems can perform multiple tasks

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:52.295
with the same structure.

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:54.162
Here's a new behavior we've discovered.

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.008
The animals rapidly invert and disappear

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.509
in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them —

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:00.872
using the same structures that
they use to run, their legs.

00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:02.476
They can run upside down

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:05.608
very rapidly on rods, branches and wires,

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:07.087
and if you perturb one of those branches,

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:08.880
they can do this.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.410
They can perform gymnastic maneuvers

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.988
like no robot we have yet.

00:01:12.988 --> 00:01:14.719
And they have nearly unlimited

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.316
maneuverability with that same structure

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:21.136
and unprecedented access to a variety

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:25.406
of different areas.

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:28.029
They have wings for flying when they get warm,

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.643
but they use those same wings to flip over

00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:34.600
if they get destabilized.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.897
Very effective.

00:01:35.897 --> 00:01:39.102
Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:40.242
This is the foot of a cockroach.

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:43.531
It has spines, gluey pads and claws,

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.122
but if you take off those feet,

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:46.830
they can still go over rough terrain,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.727
like the bottom video that you see,

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:52.098
without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.

00:01:52.098 --> 00:01:55.271
They can run up mesh without their feet.

00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.554
Here's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod:

00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:59.097
three legs, three legs, three legs,

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:02.789
but in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.799
Here's one moving with two middle legs gone.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.715
It can even lose three legs, in a tripod,

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:13.642
and adopt a new gait, a hopping gait.

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:15.600
And I point out that all of these videos

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.304
are slowed down 20 times,

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:19.319
so they're actually really fast, when you see this.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.830
Robust systems are also damage resistant.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.643
Here's an animal climbing up a wall.

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:27.139
It looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb,

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.378
but when you slow it down,

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:30.872
you see something very different.

00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:32.520
Here's what they do.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.527
They intentionally have a
head-on collision with the wall

00:02:35.527 --> 00:02:37.641
so they don't slow down and can transition up it

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:40.039
in 75 milliseconds.

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.900
And they can do this in part because they have

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.957
extraordinary exoskeletons.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:47.766
And they're really just made up of compliant joints

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.499
that are tubes and plates

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.042
connected to one another.

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.989
Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.950
You see these plates, and you
see the compliant membrane.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.766
My engineering colleague at Berkeley

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:01.890
designed with his students

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.371
a novel manufacturing technique

00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.982
where you essentially origami the exoskeleton,

00:03:06.982 --> 00:03:08.342
you laser cut it, laminate it,

00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:10.737
and you fold it up into a robot.

00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:16.554
And you can do that now in less than 15 minutes.

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:18.493
These robots, called DASH,

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:21.103
for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod,

00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:24.185
are highly compliant robots,

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:27.887
and they're remarkably robust as a result

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:29.690
of these features.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.748
They're certainly incredibly damage resistant.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:39.101
(Laughter)

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.570
They even have some of the
behaviors of the cockroaches.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.843
So they can use their smart, compliant body

00:03:43.843 --> 00:03:46.360
to transition up a wall

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.252
in a very simple way.

00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:50.880
They even have some of the beginnings

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.199
of the rapid inversion behavior

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.043
where they disappear.

00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:56.520
Now we want to know why they can go anywhere.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.089
We discovered that they can go through

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:59.877
three-millimeter gaps,

00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:02.238
the height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,

00:04:02.238 --> 00:04:03.286
and when they do this,

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.861
they can actually run through those confined spaces

00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:07.618
at high speeds,

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:10.800
although you never see it.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.862
To understand it better,

00:04:11.862 --> 00:04:13.940
we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.414
and showed that they can compress their body

00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:18.060
by over 40 percent.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.617
We put them in a materials testing machine

00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:21.973
to look at the stress strain analysis

00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:24.091
and showed that they can withstand forces

00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:25.995
800 times their body weight,

00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:27.885
and after this they can fly and run

00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:29.875
absolutely normally.

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:31.598
So you never know where

00:04:31.598 --> 00:04:34.672
curiosity-based research will lead,

00:04:34.672 --> 00:04:36.211
and someday you may want a swarm

00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:38.405
of cockroach-inspired robots

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:40.819
to come at you.

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:47.940
(Laughter)

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.497
Thank you.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:50.783
(Applause)
